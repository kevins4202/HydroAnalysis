11515,the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs developed the mississippi river basin healthy watersheds initiative mrbi program to improve the health water quality and wildlife habitat within the mississippi river basin lake conway point remove lcpr watershed was identified as one of the watersheds for the mrbi program implementation the goal of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the mrbi program in lcpr watershed using a computer simulation model seven best management practices bmps pond wetland pond and wetland cover crops vegetative filter strips grassed waterways and forage and biomass planting were modelled under four placement strategies random placement in 30 of the watershed random placement in 30 hydrologic response units hrus of the high priority hydrological unit code hucs placement in the top 30 of the high priority hucs and top 30 of the hrus in the hucs near the outlet of the watershed the model was calibrated for flow for the period 1987 2006 and validated for the period 2007 2012 sediment and nutrients were validated from 2011 to 2012 out of the bmps evaluated grassed waterways proved to be the most effective bmp in reducing sediment and nutrient loads from row crop soy beans and pasture fields reductions at the watershed outlet ranged 0 1 for flow 0 28 14 for sediment 0 3 10 for tp and 0 3 9 for tn relatively higher reductions were observed at the subwatershed level flow reductions ranged 0 51 sediment reductions 1 to 79 tp 1 to 65 and tn 0 37 to 66 depending on bmp type placement scenario and watershed characteristics the results from this study provide the data to help prioritize monitoring needs for collecting watershed response data in lcpr and bmp implementation evaluations which could be used to inform decisions in similar studies keywords conservation practice bmps modeling water quality swat mrbi 1 introduction in the mississippi river basin healthy watershed initiative mrbi program farmers within selected watersheds in the mississippi river basin with the aid of the u s department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs voluntarily implement conservation practices to avoid control trap sediment and nutrient runoff improve wildlife habitat and maintain agricultural productivity the mrbi program offers a new innovative voluntary approach to addressing regional water quality issues related to agricultural nonpoint source pollution it is important to quantify the impact of conservation programs such as the mrbi program to demonstrate the effectiveness of voluntary conservation efforts this helps policy and decision makers in terms of justifying continued expenditures and resource allocation for future programs the lake conway point remove lcpr watershed which has an 8 digit hydrological unit code huc of 11110203 was designated as a 2011 2016 priority watershed by the arkansas natural resources commission anrc and identified by the usda nrcs as one of the watersheds for the mrbi program implementation anrc 2012 usda nrcs 2010 while field monitoring can provide the data necessary for evaluating these conservation programs this can be a time and labor intensive undertaking that and requires significant financial resources watershed modeling can be used as a tool to complement field monitoring by simulating multiple scenarios of land management practices saving time labor and other expenses associated with field studies in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 developed by the u s department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars was selected to evaluate flow nutrients and sediment transport from the lcpr watershed under various land management conditions swat is a physically based continuous time simulation model which uses gis databases of elevation soil and land use of the watershed tabular data of weather and point sources and provides the ability to include management practices of land along with inputs of nonpoint and point nutrient sources it can simulate watershed outputs for several years neitsch et al 2011 in arkansas swat has been successfully used for watershed response modeling for a number of watersheds including lake conway watershed saraswat et al 2010 cache river watershed eeshan 2015 illinois river watershed gitau et al 2007 pai et al 2011 and l anguille river watershed gitau et al 2007 singh and saraswat 2016 a major advantage of swat is that it provides a flexible framework for the simulation of variety of conservation practices through direct parameter changes gassman et al 2007 as a result swat has been applied in several studies to evaluate the impact of alternative land use and bmp scenarios bracmort et al 2006 chaubey et al 2010 gitau et al 2010 santhi et al 2006 and to support total maximum daily load tmdl development and implementation benham et al 2006 borah et al 2006 jha et al 2010 the overall goal of this paper is to explore and document possible outcomes of implementing the mrbi program on nutrient and sediment loss in runoff from pasture and row crop agriculture the specific objectives of the study were 1 develop calibrate and validate swat model for water quality response predictions at 12 digit hucs within the watershed 2 implement and run bmp scenarios on sediment and nutrient total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn loss reductions using swat 3 evaluate the effectiveness of bmp scenarios for continued program development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located in central arkansas lake conway point remove lcpr watershed is a 2950 km2 1140 miles2 watershed occupying the counties of conway 34 8 faulkner 20 0 perry 7 2 pope 23 5 pulaski 20 5 van buren 85 2 and yell 59 4 fig 2 the watershed is primarily forested 61 with pasture 22 urban 7 and cropland 6 as the other major land uses the arkansas river flows west to east through the central part of the watershed the arkansas department of environmental quality adeq placed three water bodies in this watershed on its 303 d list of impaired waterbodies white oak creek 10 miles stone dam creek 3 miles and whig creek 10 miles adeq 2010 most of the impairment in lcpr watershed is because of chronic ammonia toxicity levels elevated nitrate ammonia silt and turbidity levels 2 2 data collection organization available geospatial watershed management water quantity and point source data were collected and reorganized in a consistent format for use in the swat model the main data collected are as summarized in table 1 2 3 elevation soil and land use a 5 m digital elevation model for the watershed was obtained from arkansas spatial data infrastructure repository the 5 m dem was resampled to a 10 m resolution since the large files created by the 5 m dem caused simulation problems for such a large area topography within lcpr is variable ranging from 612 m in the north to 59 m in the south the soil survey geographic ssurgo soil data for pope yell perry conway faulkner and van buren counties in arkansas were combined to prepare the soil map used in the model the ssurgo database is a comprehensive database that provides information such as soil texture and soil hydraulic properties which are required by swat the soils of the lcpr watershed are comprised of 44 soil series of which the major soils are linkers mountainburg leadvale and enders series making up 18 16 11 and 10 of the watershed soils respectively land use land cover lulc for the years 1999 2004 and 2006 were obtained from the arkansas spatial data infrastructure repository land use change analysis between 1999 and 2006 indicates that the percent urban land in the watershed more than doubled 3 2 to 7 4 area of the watershed agriculture also doubled within the 7 year period with soybeans representing the most dominant agricultural production within the region whereas pasture land has gradually declined over the same period 32 in 1999 22 in 2006 recent developments of the swat model allow land use change over time to be modelled lulc layers were reclassified to eight categories to be used within the swat model fig 3 we used the land use change activation tool of pai and saraswat 2011 to determine the change in fractional area of each hydrologic response unit hru across each of the land use layers and activate the land use change module in swat 2 4 climate climatic data was obtained from two sources daily precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature data for 90 climate stations covering the counties of the basin were downloaded from the noaa s national oceanic and atmospheric administration national climatic data center ncdc this data covered different periods from 1980 to 2012 for at least one of the climatic parameters we followed the procedure implemented by the usda ars in developing swat formatted climate data for specific gauge stations in the u s http ars usda gov sp2userfiles place 30980000 us climatic data standard data details pdf an inverse distance weighted interpolation algorithm implemented in the r statistical program r core team 2015 was used to obtain daily climate data across the watershed as swat requires only one weather station per subwatershed average values for each subwatershed was computed and used as a pseudo weather station for each subwatershed daily nexrad stage iii data for the period 1993 2013 was obtained from noaa s arkansas basin river forecasting center abrfc a number of hydrologic studies have observed improved hydrological predictions when using radar estimated precipitation jayakrishnan et al 2005 kalin and hantush 2006 moon et al 2004 sexton et al 2010 a previously developed tool zhang and srinivasan 2010 was not available for use in this study since it was based on an older version of arcgis version 9 so we implemented the zhang and srinivasan 2010 algorithm in the r statistical program to calibrate and validate the nexrad data based on rain gauge measurements calibration was performed using the regression kriging algorithm described by hengl et al 2004 both the estimated nexrad and ncdc datasets were validated at seven rain gauge stations six of which were located within the watershed and one outside but close to the basin the predicted ncdc data was validated by using a leave one out cross validation procedure on a 3 day moving average measurement at the gauge locations and the predicted value prediction accuracy was assessed by computing several evaluation coefficients including 1 nexrad detection and non detection given that gauge observations exceeds a given threshold young and brunsell 2008 zhang and srinivasan 2010 1 d r a i n p p ˆ t h r e s h z t h r e s h l 1 ϕ p ˆ i t h

legates and mccabe 1999 overall drain ranged between 68 and 95 for the ncdc and 72 90 for the nexrad precipitation at gauge stations within and close to the watershed while r2 ranged 0 24 0 83 and 0 72 0 90 for ncdc and nexrad respectively temperature minimum and maximum accuracy of predictions were highest compared to precipitation with r2 ranging 0 94 0 98 the ncdc data processed for the period 1980 1993 was combined with the nexrad data to obtain the final swat compatible precipitation and temperature datasets other meteorological data required by swat solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were estimated stochastically using the swat weather generator 2 5 streamflow in any hydrological modeling study an assessment of model accuracy is required to have confidence in modeling results often this is done through a comparison of model predictions to measured data within and at the watershed outlet in a sense lcpr watershed can be considered as an ungauged watershed since it currently does not have a gauging station at its outlet however discharge data is available for a united states geological survey usgs monitoring station on the west fork point remove creek near hattieville usgs site 07260673 which is in devils creek west fork point remove creek subwatershed 3 this monitoring station has a total drainage area of 573 km2 20 3 of lcprs and drains the trimble creek west fork point remove brock creek upper clear creek rock creek west fork point remove creek and lower clear creek subwatersheds subwatersheds 1 2 8 9 and 11 available data include daily stage and discharge data from october 2001 to present while daily stage data is available from september 1987 through october 2001 we used the 2001 2012 dataset to develop a rating curve to estimate the discharge data for 1987 2001 using the equation 5 discharge 2 22 stage3 12 512 stage2 33 31 stage 21 51 out of sample r2 0 96 where discharge and stage are in m3 s and meters respectively total flow was separated into its component flows surface and baseflow using the baseflow filter software of arnold and allen 1999 2 6 point sources point source measurement of active facilities during the model setup in the lcpr watershed was obtained from the arkansas department of environmental quality adeq this included data for flow total suspended solids tss tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n ph temperature chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod and carbonaceous oxygen demand cbod for the 45 active facilities the data which varied at temporal scales bi annual quarterly through monthly and bi monthly was aggregated on a subwatershed basis in a swat compatible format where missing data occurred we used the average of the two nearest data points 2 7 management data management data were calculated mainly from the animal production information manure and fertilizer application and grazing data in the watershed 2 7 1 allocation of cattle to watershed and subwatershed boundaries to model cattle contributions to processes within the watershed pasture management including data on cattle grazing and manure deposition were allocated to the watershed cattle population calves and adult data was obtained for each of the counties within the lcpr from the national agricultural statistics service nass data of 1990 2012 survey of agriculture the county data was allocated to the watershed by computing the ratio of the watershed in the county to the area of county and multiplying it by the total number of cattle in the county cattle population per subwatershed was determined by using an area weighted approach 2 7 2 cattle grazing rate and manure deposition cattle populations per subwatershed were used to determine the grazing load and manure deposition on the pasture land cows in moderate condition weigh 532 560 kg and calves generally weigh 205 250 kg with an average daily intake of 2 and 2 5 of their body weight for adult and growing calves respectively dr shane gadberry and dr tom troxel personal communication 10 2013 based on this we assumed adult cows of weight 540 kg and calves 220 kg with daily intakes of 10 8 kg day and 5 5 kg day respectively daily consumption rate per subwatershed kg day was obtained by multiplying intake rate by the number of cows in each subwatershed the grazing rate kg day ha was obtained by dividing consumption rate by the subwatershed pasture area manure deposition was estimated as 4 54 kg day and 1 09 kg day for adult cattle and calves respectively lorimor et al 2008 and redistributed for each subwatershed by taking the respective pasture areas into consideration 2 7 3 poultry litter application spatial data of 951 chicken houses developed by the arkansas highway and transportation department was used for calculating the chicken litter application rates however as reported by saraswat et al 2010 not all the poultry facilities may be active we used a random sample of 60 of the facilities as the active facilities in our calculations it was assumed that cattle grazed only the pasture that received poultry litter and a grazing density of one cow per 0 8 ha of litter amended pasture brown and alford 2000 lin et al 2009 poultry litter was applied to pastures within 2 15 km of poultry production at a rate of 4483 kg ha using the procedure described by lin et al 2009 and saraswat et al 2010 the overall pasture management schedule was verified with a university of arkansas pasture management researcher dr dirk phillip personal communication on accuracy of timing and completeness 2 7 4 urban pasture management urban pasture management data was adopted from previous swat modeling in lcpr watershed saraswat et al 2010 a harvest efficiency of 33 was used patton and boyd 2007 with most of the clippings left as ground residue lawn mowing was scheduled twice a month between april and may once every week june to september and once in october nitrogen was set as 14 64 kg ha in may and september and 19 53 kg ha in june and july as fertilizer p application recommendations are based on soil tests we used the auto fertilization routine in swat to represent this we assumed that only half of the homeowners irrigate their lawns so 50 of urban hrus were set for auto irrigation table 2 2 7 5 row crop management soybeans is the major crop grown in this watershed accounting for over 45 of agriculture areas in lcpr watershed so row crop management focused only on soybeans production timing frequency of tillage agrochemical fertilizers irrigation planting dates and harvesting of soybeans was obtained from arkansas crop budgets and published research verification reports by the university of arkansas cooperative extension service uaces table 3 2 7 6 ponds and wetlands ponds and wetland data derived from the national hydrography waterbody layer showed that the lcpr has 6113 ponds covering a total area of 2436 ha and 254 wetlands covering an area of 1774 ha swat requires one set of pond and wetland parameters per subwatershed so areas and parameters were aggregated based on the gis data these areas included the maximum water levels emergency spillway water levels areas at principal spillway were assumed to be 25 less than the emergency spillway the fraction of subwatershed area contributing to pond was calculated according to usda nrcs 1997 by assuming an average pond depth of 1 m with a 0 001312 ha per cubic meter storage volume the wetland surface area was assumed at the maximum water level wet mxsa whiles the normal water surface area wet nsa was set to 30 of the maximum surface area liu et al 2008 the nominal maximum and normal water depth of the wetlands in the watershed were assumed to be 0 5 m and 0 1 m respectively as suggested by liu et al 2008 and wang et al 2008 the fractional area of the subwatershed that contributes to the wetland wet fr was computed as the ratio of the wetland normal surface area to subwatershed area wang et al 2008 2 8 swat model development calibration validation 2 8 1 model develeopment in swat the basin to be modelled is usually delineated into subwatersheds subwatershed delineation and size depends on the resolution of the input data and thresholds imposed an alternative to the threshold method is to specify user defined subwatersheds we used the user defined approach by specifying user defined subwatersheds to be consistent with the usgs watershed boundary dataset wbd 12 digit hydrologic unit code huc boundary the wbd defines hydrologic units drainage areas formed over the us and delineated through a national system of standardized criteria by the united states geological survey usgs a requirement of the user defined approach to subwatershed delineation is one user defined stream feature per subwatershed which routes flow through the subwatershed to an end point coincident with the subwatershed boundary winchell et al 2013 the swat swat2012 revision 635 model was developed using the arcswat version 2012 10 2 16 released 9 9 14 interface the 12 digit subwatersheds were subsequently divided into hrus the hrus which represent the smallest computational units of prediction in the watershed are represented by homogenous units that form a unique combination of land use land cover soil and slope this characterization is achieved by setting a threshold value for each parameter to define the hru distribution a threshold of 0 0 0 suggests that all the land use land cover soil and slope are included in the hru definition whereas setting a threshold of 5 for soil indicates that all soils that are less than 5 within a subwatershed are merged into the most dominant soil type we experimented with several hru configurations a configuration of 0 0 and 0 resulted in 25 336 hrus which would require extensive computational time while a 5 threshold each resulted in 1771 hrus the final selected configuration of 0 5 and 0 resulted in 3402 hrus delineated previous studies have reported varied watershed response sensitivity to hru delineation schemes cho et al 2010 tripathi et al 2006 2 8 2 model sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is often used to assess the effects of different parameter inputs representing different watershed properties on simulation outputs it is an iterative process measured as a response of an output to changes in parameter inputs greater output responses indicate greater sensitivity of that parameter and would have higher influence on output response the most sensitive parameters are therefore often used in calibrating the model thereby reducing the number of parameters required for calibration a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed on the model to identify parameters affecting flow sensitivity was computed using the latin hypercube one at a time lh oat method van griensven et al 2006 implemented in hydropso a model independent r package for assisting hydrologic modeling workflow zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 the lh oat uses i sampling intervals p times where p is the number of parameters the effect of each parameter for each lh sampling point is calculated and averaged to obtain the overall effect this method results in a total of i p 1 model runs we used 22 flow related parameters with 20 sampling intervals to obtain 460 model runs out of the 22 flow parameters examined 12 were found to be primarily sensitive to flow in the lcpr watershed table 4 2 8 3 calibration and validation since there was no observed data at the watershed outlet we employed a parameter regionalization approach to calibrate and validate the model at the usgs gauge station on the west fork point remove creek and extended parameters across the entire basin in parameter regionalization calibrated parameters are extended and or extrapolated from gaged watersheds to ungauged watersheds of similar characteristics gitau and chaubey 2010 several studies have observed improved model results by developing regionalized parameter values for ungauged watersheds gitau and chaubey 2010 merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2005 land use analysis of the watersheds that drained into the hattieville gauge suggests the area constitutes 75 6 forest 14 5 pasture and 1 4 urban which was assumed to be representative of the land use distribution of the entire lcpr watershed 54 forest 22 pasture and 7 urban model calibration was executed in several steps calibration was initially performed on an annual basis followed by a more detailed monthly calibration the calibration was conducted for a 20 year period 1987 2006 and validation period of 6 years 2007 2012 with a model warmup of three years to allow proper initialization of model parameters channel routing was simulated using the variable storage method and potential evapotranspiration using the default penman monteith monteith 1965 the goal of the annual calibration was to adjust the basin wide parameters to ensure simulated values were within a reasonable range of the observed data and key processes such as the water balance were well represented monthly calibration focused on simulating the seasonal trends in the data by calibrating the individual flow components total surface and baseflow analysis of the baseflow indicated a strong influence on the hydrologic regime 28 58 contribution to observed total water yield of the watershed baseflow was calibrated first followed by surface flow by adjusting parameters that governed each of these components in lcpr prior swat modeling activities have not included calibration and validation of water quality due to limited availability of monitoring data saraswat et al 2010 the anrc contracted out limited field monitoring from september 2011 through december 2014 equilibrium 2014 the results of the field monitoring were not available until after the development of our swat model also because of the limited data points extensive calibration for water quality was not possible as a result we performed limited calibration and conducted a post model validation for water quality first the swat check screening tool white et al 2014 was used during calibration to ensure simulated sediment and nutrient loads were reasonably within reported literature values for example a few agricultural hrus were identified as contributing excessive sediment yield further investigation revealed that these hrus were located in high slope areas 12 within the watershed as it is unlikely for row crop areas to be located on high sloping areas these slopes were adjusted to reduce the excessive sediment yields bi monthly water quality monitoring data september 2011 to december 2012 for sediment tp and no3 n at haitteville was extracted from the anrc reports the load estimator loadest tool runkel et al 2004 was used to generate continuous monthly values for sediment tp and no3 n at the haitteville station the loadest software developed by usgs has successfully been used by many researchers in estimating time series water quality data niraula et al 2013 yen et al 2015 for hydrological modeling however loadest has been known to also cause biases in water quality load estimation lee et al 2016 runkel 2013 therefore the adjusted maximum likelihood estimation method amle was used in loadest to compute the mean and 95 confidence interval of the monthly loads the amle method assumes that the samples are normally distributed and have a constant variance generating a nearly unbiased estimate of instantaneous load even for censored data runkel et al 2004 the r2 between the observed instantaneous flow and sediment tp and no3 n used for estimating loads was 0 84 0 91 and 0 72 respectively and regression coefficients were determined to be statistically significant for sediment tp no3 n p 0 05 additional water quality data april 2012 through december 2012 was acquired from the anrc reports for the monitoring site at morrilton relevant flow data acquired from usgs for morrilton was used together with the monitoring data to obtain monthly loads corresponding regression coefficients were also determined to be statistically significant at morrilton for sediment tp no3 n p 0 05 2 8 4 statistical analysis model performance in simulating flow was evaluated graphically and using multi criteria statistical measures including relative error re nash sutcliffe coefficient rns r2 root mean squared error rmse rmse standard deviation error rsr and percent bias pbias calculated as 6 r e o s o 100 7 r n s 1 n i 1 o i s i 2 n i 1 o i s a v g 2 8 rmse n i 1 o i s i 2 n 9 pbias n i 1 s i o i 100 n i 1 o i where o is the observed output s is the predicted output and i is the number of data points rns which ranges from to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect fit determines the relative magnitude of the variance compared to the measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 rmse is the average deviation of the predicted data from the observed an optimal value of rmse is 0 rsr is the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of the observed data with lower values indicating better model performance moriasi et al 2007 pbias is a measure of the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the corresponding observed data values range from negative values which would indicate underestimation optimal values of 0 0 through positive values that indicate mode overestimation for this study we followed the goodness of fit measures as recommended by moriasi et al 2007 to give an indication of the uncertainty in water quality predictions we also computed inclusion factor i factor an indicator analogous to the p factor abbaspour et al 2007 2004 and inclusion rate of yen et al 2016 the p factor is typically defined as the fraction of measured data bracketed by the 95 predictive uncertainty band of the simulated data in this sense the i factor can be interpreted as the percent of the simulated data that are within the 95 confidence interval of the measured data we did not simulate the uncertainty band of the simulated data however the observed monthly water quality loads were generated from bi monthly grab samples which are themselves uncertain harmel et al 2006 loadest outputs of the 95 confidence band of the monthly observed loads were combined with the swat simulated water quality data to compute the i factor the i factor varies from 0 to 100 where 100 indicates that all the simulated data are within the 95 confidence interval of the monitored data 2 9 bmp simulation a list of approved bmps for lcpr under the mrbi program for the period 2010 2013 was obtained from the nrcs dianne schlenker personal communication and six of the most common practices ponds wetlands cover crops vegetative filter strips grassed waterways forage and biomass planting were selected for implementation in the swat model generally the bmps could be classified as targeting two sources of pollutants 1 bmps that were installed to target upland sources of pollutants ponds wetlands and cover crops vegetative filter strips forage and biomass planting and 2 those that target instream sources of pollutants grassed water ways a detailed description of the practices can be found in usda national handbook of conservation practices usda nrcs 2012 2 9 1 bmp scenario development 2 9 1 1 baseline the baseline scenario consisted of running the model under current conditions without the use of any bmp to evaluate the impact of bmp implementation on water sediment and nutrient reductions respective scenarios were prepared by incorporating the changes in bmp parameters obtained from literature to the baseline scenario table 5 2 9 1 2 pond wetland pond and wetland nrcs codes 378 658 ponds nrcs code 378 are water impoundments constructed by embankment or excavating a pit the primary purpose of the ponds is to provide water for livestock fish and wild life fire control develop renewable energy systems and to maintain or improve water quality since the lcpr currently has 2436 ha of ponds present to evaluate the impact of ponds this bmp condition was simulated as the absence of pond in the watershed this was done by setting the pond and wetland parameters under respective scenarios to zero table 5 wetlands are artificial ecosystems with hydrophytic vegetation for water treatment they are typically used to improve runoff water quality lacking specific water quality criteria wetlands were simulated in a similar manner to ponds since 1774 ha area of wetlands was already present in the watershed a combined scenario pond and wetland was simulated for the watershed in which both ponds and wetlands were absent from the watershed 2 9 1 3 cover crop nrcs code 340 cover crops are grass small grain or legumes that are grown for the purpose of soil protection and improvement usda nrcs 2012 the cover crop bmp was simulated by scheduling winter wheat cover crop immediately after soybeans was harvested and was killed before the next soybeans planting season table 6 2 9 1 4 vegetative filter strips nrcs code 393 vegetative filter strips vfs are planted areas of vegetation for removing sediment and other pollutants form runoff usda nrcs 2012 and are considered one of the most effective methods of reducing sediments and associated contaminants from runoff inamdar et al 2001 lee et al 2003 vegetative filter strips were simulated by activating the vegetative filter strip module in swat we used a ratio of field area to filter strip area value of 40 vfsratio the fraction of the field drained by the most concentrated 10 of the vfs area was set to 0 5 vfscon the fraction of flow through the most concentrated 10 vfsch of the vfs was set as 0 for modeling waidler et al 2011 2 9 1 5 grassed waterway nrcs code 412 grassed waterways are vegetated channels that convey surface water at non erosive velocities from upland areas usda nrcs 2012 in the present study waterways were simulated by activating the grassed waterways in the scheduled management operations module in swat parameters used in simulating the effects of waterways included the channel roughness coefficient and channel configurations the channel manning s roughness coefficient gwatn was set to 0 24 following reported literature values arabi et al 2008 2006 luo and zhang 2009 the linear parameter for calculating sediment in grassed waterways gwatspcon was left at the default value of 0 005 depth of grassed waterway channel from top of bank to bottom gwatd was set to 0 5 m with an average width gwatw of 10 m length of grassed waterway gwatl was assumed to be equal to length of a single side of a square hru average slope of the waterway channel was calculated as hru slope 0 75 waidler et al 2011 2 9 1 6 forage biomass planting nrcs code 512 forage and biomass planting consists of establishing herbaceous species suitable for pasture hay or biomass production in addition well managed pasture lands provide good ground cover to reduce soil erosion thereby improving water quality we utilized the procedures described by ghebremichael et al 2008 and tuppad et al 2009 to represent forage and biomass planting in the watershed we simulated increased pasture production by increasing elemental n within the selected hrus this was achieved by initiating auto fertilization of n at a rate of 1 5 times initial removal after the first harvest within the affected hrus also curve number cn2 values were reduced by 5 for each selected bmp to simulate improved ground cover conditions 2 9 2 bmp placement options for each selected bmp we simulated a number of placement scenarios to determine which placement strategy could result in highest reductions in sediment and nutrient losses using the baseline simulation results subwatersheds were prioritized to identify subwatersheds with the highest sediment and nutrient losses subwatershed loadings for flow sediment and nutrients were extracted from reach outputs at each subwatershed outlet individual loadings were then obtained by subtracting upstream load contributions from subwatershed loads following the routing scheme used in developing the model this allowed for the identification of the individual subwatershed contribution to load without the influence of the upstream watersheds the average annual flow weighted concentrations were then used to rank all the 12 digit subwatersheds for bmp implementation fig 4 saraswat et al 2010 used a similar approach to prioritize lcpr subwatersheds using a prior swat model and our overall subwatershed rankings are in conceptual agreement with the saraswat et al 2010 study high sediment and nutrient source hucs ie hucs with 61 100 percentile rankings originate from devils creek west fork pr creek bams branch east fork pr creek galla creek whig creek arkansas river sunny side creek east fork pr creek gum log creek portland bottoms arkansas river little creek palarm creek beaverdam creek arkansas river little palarm creek palarm creek taylor creek arkansas river and tupelo bayou watersheds subwatershed 3 4 5 6 10 13 14 17 18 19 20 21 25 27 28 and 29 respectively out of these subwatersheds 3 5 6 14 17 19 20 21 and 27 were identified as being highest sources areas for both sediment and tp this was not surprising given the well documented transport mechanism of phosphorous via adsorption to sediment in agricultural lands sharpley et al 1999 pollutant source areas identified above were used in developing four bmp placement scenarios a b c and d a description of each scenario follows 2 9 2 1 scenario a scenario a consisted of a 100 implementation of the bmps randomly on all the hrus in 30 of the 12 digit hucs subwatersheds over the watershed this was achieved by randomly selecting 12 digit hucs such that the total agricultural area was equal to 30 of the agricultural area over the entire 8 digit huc 2 9 2 2 scenario b scenario b consisted of a 30 random implementation on hrus within the high contributing 12 digit hucs the high contributing subwatersheds fig 4 were selected then hrus within these subwatersheds were randomly selected until 30 of the agricultural areas was selected 2 9 2 3 scenario c scenario c consisted of implementation of the bmps on the top 30 hrus of the highest producing 12 digit hucs the identified high ranking hucs fig 4 were selected then hrus within these subwatersheds were ranked based on highest loading rates of sediment tn and tp bmps were applied in order of rank until the bmp applied hrus consisted of 30 of the agricultural areas 2 9 2 4 scenario d scenario d consisted of implementation of the bmps on the top 30 hrus of the 12 digit hucs near the outlet of the watershed subwatersheds 14 17 18 20 21 and 29 for the subwatersheds selected hrus were ranked as done in scenario c and bmps implemented in the ranked hrus that were in the top 30 agricultural area 2 9 3 bmp evaluation bmp effectiveness in improving water quality was evaluated by performing a number of long term 33 year scenario runs with a 3 year warm up period for the baseline and each of the bmps implemented the advantage of using long term simulations for scenarios analysis is that it accounts for the temporal variations in weather land use and management practices yuan et al 2006 results of the average annual losses were analyzed at the outlet of the subwatersheds and watershed swat outputs are available for different phases of the landscape including loading from overland sources as well as cumulative loadings from overland transport and instream channel processes the subwatershed analysis focused on pollutant reductions due to overland processes whereas the watershed analysis focused on cumulative load reductions including overland transport and routing through the stream channel network percent reductions in flow sediment tp and tn were calculated as 10 r e d u c t i o n baseline bmp baseline 100 where baseline is the pre bmp output yield and bmp is the output yield after implementation positive values would indicate reduced yields relative to the baseline whiles negative values indicate increased losses since scenarios a through d were applied at different areal extents we also computed the load reductions per treated area to compare load reductions across the various scenarios 11 load reductions per unit area baseline load bmp load area treated by bmp 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation results 3 1 1 annual calibration water balance analysis showed that et accounts for 36 of the water budget which is the largest of all the components groundwater and lateral flow contributed 48 of the water yield which was within the range of 28 58 suggested by the baseflow filter program at the hattieville gauge station annual flow calibration was considered complete once predicted total flow was reasonably within 15 of the observed annual average values overall total flow was over predicted but within the average relative error range of 15 however baseflow was under predicted during both the calibration and validation periods table 7 3 1 2 monthly calibration although the mean swat predicted baseflow was close to the observed value 11 5 re swat over predicted baseflow at least 10 of the time the time series plot showed periods of high overprediction and underprediction the baseflow related parameters which were used during the calibration include a baseflow recession parameter alpha bf groundwater delay parameter gw delay groundwater re evaporation coefficient gw revap deep aquifer percolation coefficient rchrg dp and a depth threshold for water in the shallow aquifer to become return flow gwqmn the alpha bf constant provides an indication of groundwater response to recharge arnold et al 2012 we set the alpha bf to a value of 0 0932 as suggested by the baseflow filter program while the groundwater delay time was calibrated to a value of 2 days overall baseflow calibration posed the greatest challenge with an unsatisfactory performance in terms of nse and rsr but satisfactory r2 and very good performance when considering pbias during calibration however baseflow validation statistics ranged in the good and very good categories and the overall pattern of baseflow was consistent with the observed patterns a comparison between measured and simulated monthly total and surface flows during the calibration period had performance rankings from good to very good table 8 during the calibration period this was confirmed by the time series plot which showed a consistent seasonal trend with the observed data fig 1 the primary flow parameters that were used to calibrate surface flow were soil available water capacity sol awc and curve number cn2 the default soil available water capacity was extracted from the ssurgo database which was developed by the usda nrcs from soil samples collected at scales from 1 12000 to 1 63 360 and therefore would have varying levels of uncertainty sol awc which affects both baseflow and surface flow was increased by 13 overall swat underestimated peak flows for some major rainfall events although a few events were over predicted fig 1 the validation results for sediment tp and no3 n at haitteville and morrilton stations are shown in tables 9 and 10 the r2 indicated above satisfactory correlation with values varying from 0 5 through 0 7 at haitteville and 0 7 through 0 87 at morrilton however the nse and pbias statistics varied between satisfactory and unsatisfactory the i factor indicates that over 40 of the simulated data were within the range of the observed the greatest uncertainties seemed to be related to the no3 n predictions it must be noted that the measured data was limited 9 data points for morrilton and 16 for hattieville and used only for validation since the data was not available until after the completion of our model nonetheless our results are comparable with results from other modeling studies of data scarce regions matamoros et al 2005 panagopoulos et al 2011a and the resulting statistics were considered acceptable 3 2 bmp results mean flow and nutrient yields for the bmp implemented watersheds are shown in table 11 overall water yield decrease was less than 1 across the various bmp types and between the different scenarios detailed discussions of the bmp implementations under the various scenarios follows 3 2 1 watershed level analysis 3 2 1 1 influence of bmp location 3 2 1 1 1 scenario a the location of the implemented bmp played a critical role in reductions for a random implementation of the bmps in 30 of the subwatersheds at a 100 adoption rate when the ponds were removed sediment yields at the watershed outlet increased by 12 48 and 13 19 vegetative filter strip and grassed waterways resulted in 6 3 and 9 18 reductions respectively tp reductions ranged less than 1 to 6 while tn ranged from less than 1 to 5 7 the grassed waterway was the most effective single bmp for all yields under this scenario the relatively lower percent reduction performance of the wetland could be attributed to the smaller area treated when compared to the ponds 3 2 1 1 2 scenario b scenario b tested reductions by applying bmps in random of 30 hrus of the high priority hucs this scenario indicated high reductions when compared to the scenario that randomly selected the subwatersheds scenario a sediment reductions was the highest when grassed waterways were implemented 11 3 reduction total p and tn reductions were similar with reductions of less than 10 when using grassed waterways 7 93 reduction for tp and 7 22 reduction for tn 3 2 1 1 3 scenario c scenario c was used to test the reduction in highest hrus in the high priority hucs since swat only allows one pond and one wetland per subwatershed these bmps were not simulated under this scenario since their reductions would be similar to that of scenario b sediment reductions ranged from 1 26 for forage and biomass planting to 14 for the use of grassed waterways tp ranged 3 15 9 96 while tn ranged 1 87 9 13 3 2 1 1 4 scenario d when bmps were placed in subwatersheds near the outlet of the watershed reductions were moderate sediment reductions ranged 0 28 7 31 tp reductions ranged 0 6 5 33 and tn reductions ranged 0 59 4 85 forage and biomass planting performed the worst with reductions at the watershed outlet ranging 0 1 0 6 when compared to the other scenarios 3 2 1 2 comparison of scenarios when the bmp implementations are compared on a unit area basis the implementation of cover crops in the top 30 of the highest priority hucs scenario c and near the outlet of the watershed scenario d resulted in the highest reductions of flow per treated area 33 mm and 32 mm fig 5 a vegetative filter strips and grassed waterways resulted in no reductions in runoff across all the bmps this was expected as these bmps were designed to control sediment and nutrients forage planting was the least performing bmp with respect to sediment reduction across all scenarios 0 05 0 09 mg ha grassed waterways could be considered the most effective bmp since it resulted in the highest sediment 1 88 2 35 mg ha and nutrient 0 9 4 84 kg ha unit reductions across the various scenarios vegetative filter strips were also effective with unit reductions ranging 0 93 1 54 mg ha for sediment and 0 9 4 84 kg ha for nutrients the location of bmp had a direct influence on sediment and nutrient reductions randomly placing bmps within the watershed scenario a resulted in the least unit area reductions since scenario a considered both priority and non priority subwatersheds in a random manner the unit area reduction was not expected to be great when randomly targeting hrus in the high priority hucs scenario b reductions per unit area were moderate the greatest reduction per area occurred when high producing hrus were targeted within the high priority hucs scenario c and when targeting subwatersheds that were located near the outlet of the watershed scenario d bosch et al 2013 reported a similar observation when testing options for bmp placement in six lake erie watersheds 3 2 2 subwatershed level analysis subwatershed level reductions were more significant when compared to the watershed level analysis at varying levels of reductions table 12 when the current ponds and wetlands were not simulated runoff varied from a decrease of 0 1 to an increase of 50 8 sediment ranged between no change to an increase of 48 while tp and tn ranged from no change to 12 2 and 9 2 increase respectively these results highlight the positive impacts of currently installed bmps indicating runoff sediment tp and tn could potentially be higher by as much as 51 48 12 and 9 respectively without these bmps these higher performance rates compared to the watershed level analysis were not surprising since these impoundment structures are located within the subwatershed and only received loadings from the land area within the subwatershed there was no flow reduction from the upland areas for the filter strip and grassed waterway bmps for any of the placement scenarios this may be attributed to the fact that these bmps are generally designed to treat sediment and nutrients the use of winter wheat as a cover crop reduced subwatershed level runoff up to 15 whereas sediment tp and tn ranged 1 to 25 0 28 and 0 27 respectively vegetative filter strips and grassed waterways proved very effective in reducing sediment and nutrients which supports their popularity forage production and cover crops performance was moderate with maximum reductions ranging 7 34 and minimum reductions in the range of 1 to 0 06 depending on placement scenario and pollutant type 3 2 3 comparison of bmp results with previous studies our results are within the range of values for similar bmps reported by others at the watershed and subwatershed scale bekele et al 2011 bosch et al 2013 luo and zhang 2009 panagopoulos et al 2011b santhi et al 2006 strauch et al 2013 zhang and srinivasan 2010 tables 13 and 14 respectively overall grassed waterways were the most effective bmp followed in order by vegetative filter strips ponds and wetlands combination cover crops forage and biomass planting ponds and wetlands grassed waterways and vegetative filter stripes have long been documented as being very effective in reducing sediment and nutrient loss from agricultural areas chaubey et al 1995 fiener and auerswald 2003 they entrap sediment using the vegetated cover there by allowing nutrients to be absorbed into trapped sediments and remain on the fields instead of being deposited downstream waidler et al 2011 bosch et al 2013 identified cover crops to be the most effective bmp in reducing sediment and nutrients when comparing rye grass cover crops with vegetative filter strips and no till bmps meanwhile lee et al 2010 observed vegetative filter strips as the most effective bmp in sediment removal for a 255 km2 watershed in south korea when compared to riparian buffers conversion of bare land to grasslands and fertilizer control measures a study by arabi et al 2008 reported sediment reduction performance was similar for filter strips and cover crops 3 reduction whereas the filter strip outperformed the cover crop in tp and tn reductions the variability in bmp performance in this study and previously reported studies tables 13 and 14 supports previous reports that bmp effectiveness is dependent on watershed characteristics placement strategy and bmp type bosch et al 2013 giri et al 2014 tuppad et al 2009 4 model limitations and potential improvements as found in many other modeling activities there are uncertainties in our modeling study primarily as a result of limited availability of water quality data which are discussed below one challenge in modeling lcpr is that the arkansas river flows into the watershed upstream of dardanelle and exits out of the beaverdam creek arkansas river watershed similar to saraswat et al 2010 we modelled the arkansas river as an inlet in subwatershed 6 however much of the discharge from the tributaries into the arkansas river could not be modelled also swat currently only models one pond and one wetland per subwatershed to incorporate the numerous ponds and wetlands in the watershed we aggregated pond and wetland properties on a subwatershed basis and modelled the aggregated ponds and wetlands in each subwatershed another challenge was that lcpr does not currently have a gauging station at its outlet the only long term flow gauging station present within the watershed was located in subwatershed 3 on the west fork point remove creek near hattieville usgs site 07260673 which drains approximately 20 3 of the entire watershed we employed a parameter regionalization approach to calibrate and validate the model at subwatershed 3 and extended parameters across the entire basin calibration at single gauge sites are more suitable for small watersheds and could be a source of uncertainty in larger watersheds which may exhibit higher degrees of variability in hydrologic conditions when compared to smaller watersheds cao et al 2006 niraula et al 2012 noor et al 2014 these include sources of error in data measurement model structure and parameter estimation the uncertainty in model output is usually minimized through calibration shirmohammadi et al 2006 limited water quality data was only available for some parts of the lcpr watershed after our model setup so we used the data to conduct post validation of our model with the limited availability of data an improvement to our model would be to setup the model to include the water quality data to be used for calibration and a detailed uncertainty analysis performed using for example swat cup despite the limited data available for this watershed and considering that swat was originally developed to predict land management impacts in large ungauged basins arnold et al 1998 and its successful applications in unguaged watersheds panagopoulos et al 2011a srinivasan et al 2010 we believe our modeling activities could provide useful information that could be used by decision makers and natural resource managers 5 conclusions the swat model was calibrated and validated to predict monthly flow sediment phosphorus and nitrogen loss in lake conway point remove watershed due to limited available water quality data the model was only calibrated for flow then validated for flow and water quality at the usgs gauge station at hattieville and validated for water quality at the usgs gauge station at morrilton model calibration and validation performance ranged from unsatisfactory to very good for flow and water quality depending on evaluation statistics the calibrated model was used to simulate baseline loading conditions for flow sediment tp and tn and analyzed the impact of five agricultural best management practices scenarios on flow and water quality under different placement strategies among the four individual agricultural bmps simulated grassed waterways were found as the most effective followed by vegetative filter strips cover crops forage and biomass planting model results suggest that significant reductions can be expected at the subwatershed level whiles moderate effectiveness would be observed at the watershed level the location of bmp and the watershed characteristics had a direct influence on sediment and nutrient reductions randomly placing bmps within the watershed resulted in the least unit area reductions the greatest reduction per area occurred when high producing hrus were targeted within the high priority hucs and when targeting subwatersheds that were located near the outlet of the watershed in addition the pond and wetland bmps which are already implemented within the watershed have reduced nutrient and sediment losses results from this modeling can be used to help prioritize monitoring needs evaluate the relative effectiveness of agricultural bmps in reducing pollutant loads and improving water quality in similar data limited watersheds acknowledgements this work was supported by the us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service

11515,the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs developed the mississippi river basin healthy watersheds initiative mrbi program to improve the health water quality and wildlife habitat within the mississippi river basin lake conway point remove lcpr watershed was identified as one of the watersheds for the mrbi program implementation the goal of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the mrbi program in lcpr watershed using a computer simulation model seven best management practices bmps pond wetland pond and wetland cover crops vegetative filter strips grassed waterways and forage and biomass planting were modelled under four placement strategies random placement in 30 of the watershed random placement in 30 hydrologic response units hrus of the high priority hydrological unit code hucs placement in the top 30 of the high priority hucs and top 30 of the hrus in the hucs near the outlet of the watershed the model was calibrated for flow for the period 1987 2006 and validated for the period 2007 2012 sediment and nutrients were validated from 2011 to 2012 out of the bmps evaluated grassed waterways proved to be the most effective bmp in reducing sediment and nutrient loads from row crop soy beans and pasture fields reductions at the watershed outlet ranged 0 1 for flow 0 28 14 for sediment 0 3 10 for tp and 0 3 9 for tn relatively higher reductions were observed at the subwatershed level flow reductions ranged 0 51 sediment reductions 1 to 79 tp 1 to 65 and tn 0 37 to 66 depending on bmp type placement scenario and watershed characteristics the results from this study provide the data to help prioritize monitoring needs for collecting watershed response data in lcpr and bmp implementation evaluations which could be used to inform decisions in similar studies keywords conservation practice bmps modeling water quality swat mrbi 1 introduction in the mississippi river basin healthy watershed initiative mrbi program farmers within selected watersheds in the mississippi river basin with the aid of the u s department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs voluntarily implement conservation practices to avoid control trap sediment and nutrient runoff improve wildlife habitat and maintain agricultural productivity the mrbi program offers a new innovative voluntary approach to addressing regional water quality issues related to agricultural nonpoint source pollution it is important to quantify the impact of conservation programs such as the mrbi program to demonstrate the effectiveness of voluntary conservation efforts this helps policy and decision makers in terms of justifying continued expenditures and resource allocation for future programs the lake conway point remove lcpr watershed which has an 8 digit hydrological unit code huc of 11110203 was designated as a 2011 2016 priority watershed by the arkansas natural resources commission anrc and identified by the usda nrcs as one of the watersheds for the mrbi program implementation anrc 2012 usda nrcs 2010 while field monitoring can provide the data necessary for evaluating these conservation programs this can be a time and labor intensive undertaking that and requires significant financial resources watershed modeling can be used as a tool to complement field monitoring by simulating multiple scenarios of land management practices saving time labor and other expenses associated with field studies in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 developed by the u s department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars was selected to evaluate flow nutrients and sediment transport from the lcpr watershed under various land management conditions swat is a physically based continuous time simulation model which uses gis databases of elevation soil and land use of the watershed tabular data of weather and point sources and provides the ability to include management practices of land along with inputs of nonpoint and point nutrient sources it can simulate watershed outputs for several years neitsch et al 2011 in arkansas swat has been successfully used for watershed response modeling for a number of watersheds including lake conway watershed saraswat et al 2010 cache river watershed eeshan 2015 illinois river watershed gitau et al 2007 pai et al 2011 and l anguille river watershed gitau et al 2007 singh and saraswat 2016 a major advantage of swat is that it provides a flexible framework for the simulation of variety of conservation practices through direct parameter changes gassman et al 2007 as a result swat has been applied in several studies to evaluate the impact of alternative land use and bmp scenarios bracmort et al 2006 chaubey et al 2010 gitau et al 2010 santhi et al 2006 and to support total maximum daily load tmdl development and implementation benham et al 2006 borah et al 2006 jha et al 2010 the overall goal of this paper is to explore and document possible outcomes of implementing the mrbi program on nutrient and sediment loss in runoff from pasture and row crop agriculture the specific objectives of the study were 1 develop calibrate and validate swat model for water quality response predictions at 12 digit hucs within the watershed 2 implement and run bmp scenarios on sediment and nutrient total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn loss reductions using swat 3 evaluate the effectiveness of bmp scenarios for continued program development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located in central arkansas lake conway point remove lcpr watershed is a 2950 km2 1140 miles2 watershed occupying the counties of conway 34 8 faulkner 20 0 perry 7 2 pope 23 5 pulaski 20 5 van buren 85 2 and yell 59 4 fig 2 the watershed is primarily forested 61 with pasture 22 urban 7 and cropland 6 as the other major land uses the arkansas river flows west to east through the central part of the watershed the arkansas department of environmental quality adeq placed three water bodies in this watershed on its 303 d list of impaired waterbodies white oak creek 10 miles stone dam creek 3 miles and whig creek 10 miles adeq 2010 most of the impairment in lcpr watershed is because of chronic ammonia toxicity levels elevated nitrate ammonia silt and turbidity levels 2 2 data collection organization available geospatial watershed management water quantity and point source data were collected and reorganized in a consistent format for use in the swat model the main data collected are as summarized in table 1 2 3 elevation soil and land use a 5 m digital elevation model for the watershed was obtained from arkansas spatial data infrastructure repository the 5 m dem was resampled to a 10 m resolution since the large files created by the 5 m dem caused simulation problems for such a large area topography within lcpr is variable ranging from 612 m in the north to 59 m in the south the soil survey geographic ssurgo soil data for pope yell perry conway faulkner and van buren counties in arkansas were combined to prepare the soil map used in the model the ssurgo database is a comprehensive database that provides information such as soil texture and soil hydraulic properties which are required by swat the soils of the lcpr watershed are comprised of 44 soil series of which the major soils are linkers mountainburg leadvale and enders series making up 18 16 11 and 10 of the watershed soils respectively land use land cover lulc for the years 1999 2004 and 2006 were obtained from the arkansas spatial data infrastructure repository land use change analysis between 1999 and 2006 indicates that the percent urban land in the watershed more than doubled 3 2 to 7 4 area of the watershed agriculture also doubled within the 7 year period with soybeans representing the most dominant agricultural production within the region whereas pasture land has gradually declined over the same period 32 in 1999 22 in 2006 recent developments of the swat model allow land use change over time to be modelled lulc layers were reclassified to eight categories to be used within the swat model fig 3 we used the land use change activation tool of pai and saraswat 2011 to determine the change in fractional area of each hydrologic response unit hru across each of the land use layers and activate the land use change module in swat 2 4 climate climatic data was obtained from two sources daily precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature data for 90 climate stations covering the counties of the basin were downloaded from the noaa s national oceanic and atmospheric administration national climatic data center ncdc this data covered different periods from 1980 to 2012 for at least one of the climatic parameters we followed the procedure implemented by the usda ars in developing swat formatted climate data for specific gauge stations in the u s http ars usda gov sp2userfiles place 30980000 us climatic data standard data details pdf an inverse distance weighted interpolation algorithm implemented in the r statistical program r core team 2015 was used to obtain daily climate data across the watershed as swat requires only one weather station per subwatershed average values for each subwatershed was computed and used as a pseudo weather station for each subwatershed daily nexrad stage iii data for the period 1993 2013 was obtained from noaa s arkansas basin river forecasting center abrfc a number of hydrologic studies have observed improved hydrological predictions when using radar estimated precipitation jayakrishnan et al 2005 kalin and hantush 2006 moon et al 2004 sexton et al 2010 a previously developed tool zhang and srinivasan 2010 was not available for use in this study since it was based on an older version of arcgis version 9 so we implemented the zhang and srinivasan 2010 algorithm in the r statistical program to calibrate and validate the nexrad data based on rain gauge measurements calibration was performed using the regression kriging algorithm described by hengl et al 2004 both the estimated nexrad and ncdc datasets were validated at seven rain gauge stations six of which were located within the watershed and one outside but close to the basin the predicted ncdc data was validated by using a leave one out cross validation procedure on a 3 day moving average measurement at the gauge locations and the predicted value prediction accuracy was assessed by computing several evaluation coefficients including 1

legates and mccabe 1999 overall drain ranged between 68 and 95 for the ncdc and 72 90 for the nexrad precipitation at gauge stations within and close to the watershed while r2 ranged 0 24 0 83 and 0 72 0 90 for ncdc and nexrad respectively temperature minimum and maximum accuracy of predictions were highest compared to precipitation with r2 ranging 0 94 0 98 the ncdc data processed for the period 1980 1993 was combined with the nexrad data to obtain the final swat compatible precipitation and temperature datasets other meteorological data required by swat solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were estimated stochastically using the swat weather generator 2 5 streamflow in any hydrological modeling study an assessment of model accuracy is required to have confidence in modeling results often this is done through a comparison of model predictions to measured data within and at the watershed outlet in a sense lcpr watershed can be considered as an ungauged watershed since it currently does not have a gauging station at its outlet however discharge data is available for a united states geological survey usgs monitoring station on the west fork point remove creek near hattieville usgs site 07260673 which is in devils creek west fork point remove creek subwatershed 3 this monitoring station has a total drainage area of 573 km2 20 3 of lcprs and drains the

stage and discharge data from october 2001 to present while daily stage data is available from september 1987 through october 2001 we used the 2001 2012 dataset to develop a rating curve to estimate the discharge data for 1987 2001 using the equation 5 discharge 2 22 stage3 12 512 stage2 33 31 stage 21 51 out of sample r2 0 96 where discharge and stage are in m3 s and meters respectively total flow was separated into its component flows surface and baseflow using the baseflow filter software of arnold and allen 1999 2 6 point sources point source measurement of active facilities during the model setup in the lcpr watershed was obtained from the arkansas department of environmental quality adeq this included data for flow total suspended solids tss tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n ph temperature chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod and carbonaceous oxygen demand cbod for the 45 active facilities the data which varied at temporal scales bi annual quarterly through monthly and bi monthly was aggregated on a subwatershed basis in a swat compatible format where missing data occurred we used the average of the two nearest data points 2 7 management data management data were calculated mainly from the animal production information manure and fertilizer application and grazing data in the watershed 2 7 1 allocation of cattle to watershed and subwatershed boundaries to model cattle contributions to processes within the watershed pasture management including data on cattle grazing and manure deposition were allocated to the watershed cattle population calves and adult data was obtained for each of the counties within the lcpr from the national agricultural statistics service nass data of 1990 2012 survey of agriculture the county data was allocated to the watershed by computing the ratio of the watershed in the county to the area of county and multiplying it by the total number of cattle in the county cattle population per subwatershed was determined by using an area weighted approach 2 7 2 cattle grazing rate and manure deposition cattle populations per subwatershed were used to determine the grazing load and manure deposition on the pasture land cows in moderate condition weigh 532 560 kg and calves generally weigh 205 250 kg with an average daily intake of 2 and 2 5 of their body weight for adult and growing calves respectively dr shane gadberry and dr tom troxel personal communication 10 2013 based on this we assumed adult cows of weight 540 kg and calves 220 kg with daily intakes of 10 8 kg day and 5 5 kg day respectively daily consumption rate per subwatershed kg day was obtained by multiplying intake rate by the number of cows in each subwatershed the grazing rate kg day ha was obtained by dividing consumption rate by the subwatershed pasture area manure deposition was estimated as 4 54 kg day and 1 09 kg day for adult cattle and calves respectively lorimor et al 2008 and redistributed for each subwatershed by taking the respective pasture areas into consideration 2 7 3 poultry litter application spatial data of 951 chicken houses developed by the arkansas highway and transportation department was used for calculating the chicken litter application rates however as reported by saraswat et al 2010 not all the poultry facilities may be active we used a random sample of 60 of the facilities as the active facilities in our calculations it was assumed that cattle grazed only the pasture that received poultry litter and a grazing density of one cow per 0 8 ha of litter amended pasture brown and alford 2000 lin et al 2009 poultry litter was applied to pastures within 2 15 km of poultry production at a rate of 4483 kg ha using the procedure described by lin et al 2009 and saraswat et al 2010 the overall pasture management schedule was verified with a university of arkansas pasture management researcher dr dirk phillip personal communication on accuracy of timing and completeness 2 7 4 urban pasture management urban pasture management data was adopted from previous swat modeling in lcpr watershed saraswat et al 2010 a harvest efficiency of 33 was used patton and boyd 2007 with most of the clippings left as ground residue lawn mowing was scheduled twice a month between april and may once every week june to september and once in october nitrogen was set as 14 64 kg ha in may and september and 19 53 kg ha in june and july as fertilizer p application recommendations are based on soil tests we used the auto fertilization routine in swat to represent this we assumed that only half of the homeowners irrigate their lawns so 50 of urban hrus were set for auto irrigation table 2 2 7 5 row crop management soybeans is the major crop grown in this watershed accounting for over 45 of agriculture areas in lcpr watershed so row crop management focused only on soybeans production timing frequency of tillage agrochemical fertilizers irrigation planting dates and harvesting of soybeans was obtained from arkansas crop budgets and published research verification reports by the university of arkansas cooperative extension service uaces table 3 2 7 6 ponds and wetlands ponds and wetland data derived from the national hydrography waterbody layer showed that the lcpr has 6113 ponds covering a total area of 2436 ha and 254 wetlands covering an area of 1774 ha swat requires one set of pond and wetland parameters per subwatershed so areas and parameters were aggregated based on the gis data these areas included the maximum water levels emergency spillway water levels areas at principal spillway were assumed to be 25 less than the emergency spillway the fraction of subwatershed area contributing to pond was calculated according to usda nrcs 1997 by assuming an average pond depth of 1 m with a 0 001312 ha per cubic meter storage volume the wetland surface area was assumed at the maximum water level wet mxsa whiles the normal water surface area wet nsa was set to 30 of the maximum surface area liu et al 2008 the nominal maximum and normal water depth of the wetlands in the watershed were assumed to be 0 5 m and 0 1 m respectively as suggested by liu et al 2008 and wang et al 2008 the fractional area of the subwatershed that contributes to the wetland wet fr was computed as the ratio of the wetland normal surface area to subwatershed area wang et al 2008 2 8 swat model development calibration validation 2 8 1 model develeopment in swat the basin to be modelled is usually delineated into subwatersheds subwatershed delineation and size depends on the resolution of the input data and thresholds imposed an alternative to the threshold method is to specify user defined subwatersheds we used the user defined approach by specifying user defined subwatersheds to be consistent with the usgs watershed boundary dataset wbd 12 digit hydrologic unit code huc boundary the wbd defines hydrologic units drainage areas formed over the us and delineated through a national system of standardized criteria by the united states geological survey usgs a requirement of the user defined approach to subwatershed delineation is one user defined stream feature per subwatershed which routes flow through the subwatershed to an end point coincident with the subwatershed boundary winchell et al 2013 the swat swat2012 revision 635 model was developed using the arcswat version 2012 10 2 16 released 9 9 14 interface the 12 digit subwatersheds were subsequently divided into hrus the hrus which represent the smallest computational units of prediction in the watershed are represented by homogenous units that form a unique combination of land use land cover soil and slope this characterization is achieved by setting a threshold value for each parameter to define the hru distribution a threshold of 0 0 0 suggests that all the land use land cover soil and slope are included in the hru definition whereas setting a threshold of 5 for soil indicates that all soils that are less than 5 within a subwatershed are merged into the most dominant soil type we experimented with several hru configurations a configuration of 0 0 and 0 resulted in 25 336 hrus which would require extensive computational time while a 5 threshold each resulted in 1771 hrus the final selected configuration of 0 5 and 0 resulted in 3402 hrus delineated previous studies have reported varied watershed response sensitivity to hru delineation schemes cho et al 2010 tripathi et al 2006 2 8 2 model sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is often used to assess the effects of different parameter inputs representing different watershed properties on simulation outputs it is an iterative process measured as a response of an output to changes in parameter inputs greater output responses indicate greater sensitivity of that parameter and would have higher influence on output response the most sensitive parameters are therefore often used in calibrating the model thereby reducing the number of parameters required for calibration a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed on the model to identify parameters affecting flow sensitivity was computed using the latin hypercube one at a time lh oat method van griensven et al 2006 implemented in hydropso a model independent r package for assisting hydrologic modeling workflow zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 the lh oat uses i sampling intervals p times where p is the number of parameters the effect of each parameter for each lh sampling point is calculated and averaged to obtain the overall effect this method results in a total of i p 1 model runs we used 22 flow related parameters with 20 sampling intervals to obtain 460 model runs out of the 22 flow parameters examined 12 were found to be primarily sensitive to flow in the lcpr watershed table 4 2 8 3 calibration and validation since there was no observed data at the watershed outlet we employed a parameter regionalization approach to calibrate and validate the model at the usgs gauge station on the west fork point remove creek and extended parameters across the entire basin in parameter regionalization calibrated parameters are extended and or extrapolated from gaged watersheds to ungauged watersheds of similar characteristics gitau and chaubey 2010 several studies have observed improved model results by developing regionalized parameter values for ungauged watersheds gitau and chaubey 2010 merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2005 land use analysis of the watersheds that drained into the hattieville gauge suggests the area constitutes 75 6 forest 14 5 pasture and 1 4 urban which was assumed to be representative of the land use distribution of the entire lcpr watershed 54 forest 22 pasture and 7 urban model calibration was executed in several steps calibration was initially performed on an annual basis followed by a more detailed monthly calibration the calibration was conducted for a 20 year period 1987 2006 and validation period of 6 years 2007 2012 with a model warmup of three years to allow proper initialization of model parameters channel routing was simulated using the variable storage method and potential evapotranspiration using the default penman monteith monteith 1965 the goal of the annual calibration was to adjust the basin wide parameters to ensure simulated values were within a reasonable range of the observed data and key processes such as the water balance were well represented monthly calibration focused on simulating the seasonal trends in the data by calibrating the individual flow components total surface and baseflow analysis of the baseflow indicated a strong influence on the hydrologic regime 28 58 contribution to observed total water yield of the watershed baseflow was calibrated first followed by surface flow by adjusting parameters that governed each of these components in lcpr prior swat modeling activities have not included calibration and validation of water quality due to limited availability of monitoring data saraswat et al 2010 the anrc contracted out limited field monitoring from september 2011 through december 2014 equilibrium 2014 the results of the field monitoring were not available until after the development of our swat model also because of the limited data points extensive calibration for water quality was not possible as a result we performed limited calibration and conducted a post model validation for water quality first the swat check screening tool white et al 2014 was used during calibration to ensure simulated sediment and nutrient loads were reasonably within reported literature values for example a few agricultural hrus were identified as contributing excessive sediment yield further investigation revealed that these hrus were located in high slope areas 12 within the watershed as it is unlikely for row crop areas to be located on high sloping areas these slopes were adjusted to reduce the excessive sediment yields bi monthly water quality monitoring data september 2011 to december 2012 for sediment tp and no3 n at haitteville was extracted from the anrc reports the load estimator loadest tool runkel et al 2004 was used to generate continuous monthly values for sediment tp and no3 n at the haitteville station the loadest software developed by usgs has successfully been used by many researchers in estimating time series water quality data niraula et al 2013 yen et al 2015 for hydrological modeling however loadest has been known to also cause biases in water quality load estimation lee et al 2016 runkel 2013 therefore the adjusted maximum likelihood estimation method amle was used in loadest to compute the mean and 95 confidence interval of the monthly loads the amle method assumes that the samples are normally distributed and have a constant variance generating a nearly unbiased estimate of instantaneous load even for censored data runkel et al 2004 the r2 between the observed instantaneous flow and sediment tp and no3 n used for estimating loads was 0 84 0 91 and 0 72 respectively and regression coefficients were determined to be statistically significant for sediment tp no3 n p 0 05 additional water quality data april 2012 through december 2012 was acquired from the anrc reports for the monitoring site at morrilton relevant flow data acquired from usgs for morrilton was used together with the monitoring data to obtain monthly loads corresponding regression coefficients were also determined to be statistically significant at morrilton for sediment tp no3 n p 0 05 2 8 4 statistical analysis model performance in simulating flow was evaluated graphically and using multi criteria statistical measures including relative error re nash sutcliffe coefficient rns r2 root mean squared error rmse rmse standard deviation error rsr and percent bias pbias calculated as 6 r e o s o 100 7 r n s 1 n i 1 o i s i 2 n i 1 o i s a v g 2 8 rmse n i 1 o i s i 2 n 9 pbias n i 1 s i o i 100 n i 1 o i where o is the observed output s is the predicted output and i is the number of data points rns which ranges from to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect fit determines the relative magnitude of the variance compared to the measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 rmse is the average deviation of the predicted data from the observed an optimal value of rmse is 0 rsr is the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of the observed data with lower values indicating better model performance moriasi et al 2007 pbias is a measure of the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the corresponding observed data values range from negative values which would indicate underestimation optimal values of 0 0 through positive values that indicate mode overestimation for this study we followed the goodness of fit measures as recommended by moriasi et al 2007 to give an indication of the uncertainty in water quality predictions we also computed inclusion factor i factor an indicator analogous to the p factor abbaspour et al 2007 2004 and inclusion rate of yen et al 2016 the p factor is typically defined as the fraction of measured data bracketed by the 95 predictive uncertainty band of the simulated data in this sense the i factor can be interpreted as the percent of the simulated data that are within the 95 confidence interval of the measured data we did not simulate the uncertainty band of the simulated data however the observed monthly water quality loads were generated from bi monthly grab samples which are themselves uncertain harmel et al 2006 loadest outputs of the 95 confidence band of the monthly observed loads were combined with the swat simulated water quality data to compute the i factor the i factor varies from 0 to 100 where 100 indicates that all the simulated data are within the 95 confidence interval of the monitored data 2 9 bmp simulation a list of approved bmps for lcpr under the mrbi program for the period 2010 2013 was obtained from the nrcs dianne schlenker personal communication and six of the most common practices ponds wetlands cover crops vegetative filter strips grassed waterways forage and biomass planting were selected for implementation in the swat model generally the bmps could be classified as targeting two sources of pollutants 1 bmps that were installed to target upland sources of pollutants ponds wetlands and cover crops vegetative filter strips forage and biomass planting and 2 those that target instream sources of pollutants grassed water ways a detailed description of the practices can be found in usda national handbook of conservation practices usda nrcs 2012 2 9 1 bmp scenario development 2 9 1 1 baseline the baseline scenario consisted of running the model under current conditions without the use of any bmp to evaluate the impact of bmp implementation on water sediment and nutrient reductions respective scenarios were prepared by incorporating the changes in bmp parameters obtained from literature to the baseline scenario table 5 2 9 1 2 pond wetland pond and wetland nrcs codes 378 658 ponds nrcs code 378 are water impoundments constructed by embankment or excavating a pit the primary purpose of the ponds is to provide water for livestock fish and wild life fire control develop renewable energy systems and to maintain or improve water quality since the lcpr currently has 2436 ha of ponds present to evaluate the impact of ponds this bmp condition was simulated as the absence of pond in the watershed this was done by setting the pond and wetland parameters under respective scenarios to zero table 5 wetlands are artificial ecosystems with hydrophytic vegetation for water treatment they are typically used to improve runoff water quality lacking specific water quality criteria wetlands were simulated in a similar manner to ponds since 1774 ha area of wetlands was already present in the watershed a combined scenario pond and wetland was simulated for the watershed in which both ponds and wetlands were absent from the watershed 2 9 1 3 cover crop nrcs code 340 cover crops are grass small grain or legumes that are grown for the purpose of soil protection and improvement usda nrcs 2012 the cover crop bmp was simulated by scheduling winter wheat cover crop immediately after soybeans was harvested and was killed before the next soybeans planting season table 6 2 9 1 4 vegetative filter strips nrcs code 393 vegetative filter strips vfs are planted areas of vegetation for removing sediment and other pollutants form runoff usda nrcs 2012 and are considered one of the most effective methods of reducing sediments and associated contaminants from runoff inamdar et al 2001 lee et al 2003 vegetative filter strips were simulated by activating the vegetative filter strip module in swat we used a ratio of field area to filter strip area value of 40 vfsratio the fraction of the field drained by the most concentrated 10 of the vfs area was set to 0 5 vfscon the fraction of flow through the most concentrated 10 vfsch of the vfs was set as 0 for modeling waidler et al 2011 2 9 1 5 grassed waterway nrcs code 412 grassed waterways are vegetated channels that convey surface water at non erosive velocities from upland areas usda nrcs 2012 in the present study waterways were simulated by activating the grassed waterways in the scheduled management operations module in swat parameters used in simulating the effects of waterways included the channel roughness coefficient and channel configurations the channel manning s roughness coefficient gwatn was set to 0 24 following reported literature values arabi et al 2008 2006 luo and zhang 2009 the linear parameter for calculating sediment in grassed waterways gwatspcon was left at the default value of 0 005 depth of grassed waterway channel from top of bank to bottom gwatd was set to 0 5 m with an average width gwatw of 10 m length of grassed waterway gwatl was assumed to be equal to length of a single side of a square hru average slope of the waterway channel was calculated as hru slope 0 75 waidler et al 2011 2 9 1 6 forage biomass planting nrcs code 512 forage and biomass planting consists of establishing herbaceous species suitable for pasture hay or biomass production in addition well managed pasture lands provide good ground cover to reduce soil erosion thereby improving water quality we utilized the procedures described by ghebremichael et al 2008 and tuppad et al 2009 to represent forage and biomass planting in the watershed we simulated increased pasture production by increasing elemental n within the selected hrus this was achieved by initiating auto fertilization of n at a rate of 1 5 times initial removal after the first harvest within the affected hrus also curve number cn2 values were reduced by 5 for each selected bmp to simulate improved ground cover conditions 2 9 2 bmp placement options for each selected bmp we simulated a number of placement scenarios to determine which placement strategy could result in highest reductions in sediment and nutrient losses using the baseline simulation results subwatersheds were prioritized to identify subwatersheds with the highest sediment and nutrient losses subwatershed loadings for flow sediment and nutrients were extracted from reach outputs at each subwatershed outlet individual loadings were then obtained by subtracting upstream load contributions from subwatershed loads following the routing scheme used in developing the model this allowed for the identification of the individual subwatershed contribution to load without the influence of the upstream watersheds the average annual flow weighted concentrations were then used to rank all the 12 digit subwatersheds for bmp implementation fig 4 saraswat et al 2010 used a similar approach to prioritize lcpr subwatersheds using a prior swat model and our overall subwatershed rankings are in conceptual agreement with the saraswat et al 2010 study high sediment and nutrient source hucs ie hucs with 61 100 percentile rankings originate from devils creek west fork pr creek bams branch east fork pr creek galla creek whig creek arkansas river sunny side creek east fork pr creek gum log creek portland bottoms arkansas river little creek palarm creek beaverdam creek arkansas river little palarm creek palarm creek taylor creek arkansas river and tupelo bayou watersheds subwatershed 3 4 5 6 10 13 14 17 18 19 20 21 25 27 28 and 29 respectively out of these subwatersheds 3 5 6 14 17 19 20 21 and 27 were identified as being highest sources areas for both sediment and tp this was not surprising given the well documented transport mechanism of phosphorous via adsorption to sediment in agricultural lands sharpley et al 1999 pollutant source areas identified above were used in developing four bmp placement scenarios a b c and d a description of each scenario follows 2 9 2 1 scenario a scenario a consisted of a 100 implementation of the bmps randomly on all the hrus in 30 of the 12 digit hucs subwatersheds over the watershed this was achieved by randomly selecting 12 digit hucs such that the total agricultural area was equal to 30 of the agricultural area over the entire 8 digit huc 2 9 2 2 scenario b scenario b consisted of a 30 random implementation on hrus within the high contributing 12 digit hucs the high contributing subwatersheds fig 4 were selected then hrus within these subwatersheds were randomly selected until 30 of the agricultural areas was selected 2 9 2 3 scenario c scenario c consisted of implementation of the bmps on the top 30 hrus of the highest producing 12 digit hucs the identified high ranking hucs fig 4 were selected then hrus within these subwatersheds were ranked based on highest loading rates of sediment tn and tp bmps were applied in order of rank until the bmp applied hrus consisted of 30 of the agricultural areas 2 9 2 4 scenario d scenario d consisted of implementation of the bmps on the top 30 hrus of the 12 digit hucs near the outlet of the watershed subwatersheds 14 17 18 20 21 and 29 for the subwatersheds selected hrus were ranked as done in scenario c and bmps implemented in the ranked hrus that were in the top 30 agricultural area 2 9 3 bmp evaluation bmp effectiveness in improving water quality was evaluated by performing a number of long term 33 year scenario runs with a 3 year warm up period for the baseline and each of the bmps implemented the advantage of using long term simulations for scenarios analysis is that it accounts for the temporal variations in weather land use and management practices yuan et al 2006 results of the average annual losses were analyzed at the outlet of the subwatersheds and watershed swat outputs are available for different phases of the landscape including loading from overland sources as well as cumulative loadings from overland transport and instream channel processes the subwatershed analysis focused on pollutant reductions due to overland processes whereas the watershed analysis focused on cumulative load reductions including overland transport and routing through the stream channel network percent reductions in flow sediment tp and tn were calculated as 10 r e d u c t i o n baseline bmp baseline 100 where baseline is the pre bmp output yield and bmp is the output yield after implementation positive values would indicate reduced yields relative to the baseline whiles negative values indicate increased losses since scenarios a through d were applied at different areal extents we also computed the load reductions per treated area to compare load reductions across the various scenarios 11 load reductions per unit area baseline load bmp load area treated by bmp 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation results 3 1 1 annual calibration water balance analysis showed that et accounts for 36 of the water budget which is the largest of all the components groundwater and lateral flow contributed 48 of the water yield which was within the range of 28 58 suggested by the baseflow filter program at the hattieville gauge station annual flow calibration was considered complete once predicted total flow was reasonably within 15 of the observed annual average values overall total flow was over predicted but within the average relative error range of 15 however baseflow was under predicted during both the calibration and validation periods table 7 3 1 2 monthly calibration although the mean swat predicted baseflow was close to the observed value 11 5 re swat over predicted baseflow at least 10 of the time the time series plot showed periods of high overprediction and underprediction the baseflow related parameters which were used during the calibration include a baseflow recession parameter alpha bf groundwater delay parameter gw delay groundwater re evaporation coefficient gw revap deep aquifer percolation coefficient rchrg dp and a depth threshold for water in the shallow aquifer to become return flow gwqmn the alpha bf constant provides an indication of groundwater response to recharge arnold et al 2012 we set the alpha bf to a value of 0 0932 as suggested by the baseflow filter program while the groundwater delay time was calibrated to a value of 2 days overall baseflow calibration posed the greatest challenge with an unsatisfactory performance in terms of nse and rsr but satisfactory r2 and very good performance when considering pbias during calibration however baseflow validation statistics ranged in the good and very good categories and the overall pattern of baseflow was consistent with the observed patterns a comparison between measured and simulated monthly total and surface flows during the calibration period had performance rankings from good to very good table 8 during the calibration period this was confirmed by the time series plot which showed a consistent seasonal trend with the observed data fig 1 the primary flow parameters that were used to calibrate surface flow were soil available water capacity sol awc and curve number cn2 the default soil available water capacity was extracted from the ssurgo database which was developed by the usda nrcs from soil samples collected at scales from 1 12000 to 1 63 360 and therefore would have varying levels of uncertainty sol awc which affects both baseflow and surface flow was increased by 13 overall swat underestimated peak flows for some major rainfall events although a few events were over predicted fig 1 the validation results for sediment tp and no3 n at haitteville and morrilton stations are shown in tables 9 and 10 the r2 indicated above satisfactory correlation with values varying from 0 5 through 0 7 at haitteville and 0 7 through 0 87 at morrilton however the nse and pbias statistics varied between satisfactory and unsatisfactory the i factor indicates that over 40 of the simulated data were within the range of the observed the greatest uncertainties seemed to be related to the no3 n predictions it must be noted that the measured data was limited 9 data points for morrilton and 16 for hattieville and used only for validation since the data was not available until after the completion of our model nonetheless our results are comparable with results from other modeling studies of data scarce regions matamoros et al 2005 panagopoulos et al 2011a and the resulting statistics were considered acceptable 3 2 bmp results mean flow and nutrient yields for the bmp implemented watersheds are shown in table 11 overall water yield decrease was less than 1 across the various bmp types and between the different scenarios detailed discussions of the bmp implementations under the various scenarios follows 3 2 1 watershed level analysis 3 2 1 1 influence of bmp location 3 2 1 1 1 scenario a the location of the implemented bmp played a critical role in reductions for a random implementation of the bmps in 30 of the subwatersheds at a 100 adoption rate when the ponds were removed sediment yields at the watershed outlet increased by 12 48 and 13 19 vegetative filter strip and grassed waterways resulted in 6 3 and 9 18 reductions respectively tp reductions ranged less than 1 to 6 while tn ranged from less than 1 to 5 7 the grassed waterway was the most effective single bmp for all yields under this scenario the relatively lower percent reduction performance of the wetland could be attributed to the smaller area treated when compared to the ponds 3 2 1 1 2 scenario b scenario b tested reductions by applying bmps in random of 30 hrus of the high priority hucs this scenario indicated high reductions when compared to the scenario that randomly selected the subwatersheds scenario a sediment reductions was the highest when grassed waterways were implemented 11 3 reduction total p and tn reductions were similar with reductions of less than 10 when using grassed waterways 7 93 reduction for tp and 7 22 reduction for tn 3 2 1 1 3 scenario c scenario c was used to test the reduction in highest hrus in the high priority hucs since swat only allows one pond and one wetland per subwatershed these bmps were not simulated under this scenario since their reductions would be similar to that of scenario b sediment reductions ranged from 1 26 for forage and biomass planting to 14 for the use of grassed waterways tp ranged 3 15 9 96 while tn ranged 1 87 9 13 3 2 1 1 4 scenario d when bmps were placed in subwatersheds near the outlet of the watershed reductions were moderate sediment reductions ranged 0 28 7 31 tp reductions ranged 0 6 5 33 and tn reductions ranged 0 59 4 85 forage and biomass planting performed the worst with reductions at the watershed outlet ranging 0 1 0 6 when compared to the other scenarios 3 2 1 2 comparison of scenarios when the bmp implementations are compared on a unit area basis the implementation of cover crops in the top 30 of the highest priority hucs scenario c and near the outlet of the watershed scenario d resulted in the highest reductions of flow per treated area 33 mm and 32 mm fig 5 a vegetative filter strips and grassed waterways resulted in no reductions in runoff across all the bmps this was expected as these bmps were designed to control sediment and nutrients forage planting was the least performing bmp with respect to sediment reduction across all scenarios 0 05 0 09 mg ha grassed waterways could be considered the most effective bmp since it resulted in the highest sediment 1 88 2 35 mg ha and nutrient 0 9 4 84 kg ha unit reductions across the various scenarios vegetative filter strips were also effective with unit reductions ranging 0 93 1 54 mg ha for sediment and 0 9 4 84 kg ha for nutrients the location of bmp had a direct influence on sediment and nutrient reductions randomly placing bmps within the watershed scenario a resulted in the least unit area reductions since scenario a considered both priority and non priority subwatersheds in a random manner the unit area reduction was not expected to be great when randomly targeting hrus in the high priority hucs scenario b reductions per unit area were moderate the greatest reduction per area occurred when high producing hrus were targeted within the high priority hucs scenario c and when targeting subwatersheds that were located near the outlet of the watershed scenario d bosch et al 2013 reported a similar observation when testing options for bmp placement in six lake erie watersheds 3 2 2 subwatershed level analysis subwatershed level reductions were more significant when compared to the watershed level analysis at varying levels of reductions table 12 when the current ponds and wetlands were not simulated runoff varied from a decrease of 0 1 to an increase of 50 8 sediment ranged between no change to an increase of 48 while tp and tn ranged from no change to 12 2 and 9 2 increase respectively these results highlight the positive impacts of currently installed bmps indicating runoff sediment tp and tn could potentially be higher by as much as 51 48 12 and 9 respectively without these bmps these higher performance rates compared to the watershed level analysis were not surprising since these impoundment structures are located within the subwatershed and only received loadings from the land area within the subwatershed there was no flow reduction from the upland areas for the filter strip and grassed waterway bmps for any of the placement scenarios this may be attributed to the fact that these bmps are generally designed to treat sediment and nutrients the use of winter wheat as a cover crop reduced subwatershed level runoff up to 15 whereas sediment tp and tn ranged 1 to 25 0 28 and 0 27 respectively vegetative filter strips and grassed waterways proved very effective in reducing sediment and nutrients which supports their popularity forage production and cover crops performance was moderate with maximum reductions ranging 7 34 and minimum reductions in the range of 1 to 0 06 depending on placement scenario and pollutant type 3 2 3 comparison of bmp results with previous studies our results are within the range of values for similar bmps reported by others at the watershed and subwatershed scale bekele et al 2011 bosch et al 2013 luo and zhang 2009 panagopoulos et al 2011b santhi et al 2006 strauch et al 2013 zhang and srinivasan 2010 tables 13 and 14 respectively overall grassed waterways were the most effective bmp followed in order by vegetative filter strips ponds and wetlands combination cover crops forage and biomass planting ponds and wetlands grassed waterways and vegetative filter stripes have long been documented as being very effective in reducing sediment and nutrient loss from agricultural areas chaubey et al 1995 fiener and auerswald 2003 they entrap sediment using the vegetated cover there by allowing nutrients to be absorbed into trapped sediments and remain on the fields instead of being deposited downstream waidler et al 2011 bosch et al 2013 identified cover crops to be the most effective bmp in reducing sediment and nutrients when comparing rye grass cover crops with vegetative filter strips and no till bmps meanwhile lee et al 2010 observed vegetative filter strips as the most effective bmp in sediment removal for a 255 km2 watershed in south korea when compared to riparian buffers conversion of bare land to grasslands and fertilizer control measures a study by arabi et al 2008 reported sediment reduction performance was similar for filter strips and cover crops 3 reduction whereas the filter strip outperformed the cover crop in tp and tn reductions the variability in bmp performance in this study and previously reported studies tables 13 and 14 supports previous reports that bmp effectiveness is dependent on watershed characteristics placement strategy and bmp type bosch et al 2013 giri et al 2014 tuppad et al 2009 4 model limitations and potential improvements as found in many other modeling activities there are uncertainties in our modeling study primarily as a result of limited availability of water quality data which are discussed below one challenge in modeling lcpr is that the arkansas river flows into the watershed upstream of dardanelle and exits out of the beaverdam creek arkansas river watershed similar to saraswat et al 2010 we modelled the arkansas river as an inlet in subwatershed 6 however much of the discharge from the tributaries into the arkansas river could not be modelled also swat currently only models one pond and one wetland per subwatershed to incorporate the numerous ponds and wetlands in the watershed we aggregated pond and wetland properties on a subwatershed basis and modelled the aggregated ponds and wetlands in each subwatershed another challenge was that lcpr does not currently have a gauging station at its outlet the only long term flow gauging station present within the watershed was located in subwatershed 3 on the west fork point remove creek near hattieville usgs site 07260673 which drains approximately 20 3 of the entire watershed we employed a parameter regionalization approach to calibrate and validate the model at subwatershed 3 and extended parameters across the entire basin calibration at single gauge sites are more suitable for small watersheds and could be a source of uncertainty in larger watersheds which may exhibit higher degrees of variability in hydrologic conditions when compared to smaller watersheds cao et al 2006 niraula et al 2012 noor et al 2014 these include sources of error in data measurement model structure and parameter estimation the uncertainty in model output is usually minimized through calibration shirmohammadi et al 2006 limited water quality data was only available for some parts of the lcpr watershed after our model setup so we used the data to conduct post validation of our model with the limited availability of data an improvement to our model would be to setup the model to include the water quality data to be used for calibration and a detailed uncertainty analysis performed using for example swat cup despite the limited data available for this watershed and considering that swat was originally developed to predict land management impacts in large ungauged basins arnold et al 1998 and its successful applications in unguaged watersheds panagopoulos et al 2011a srinivasan et al 2010 we believe our modeling activities could provide useful information that could be used by decision makers and natural resource managers 5 conclusions the swat model was calibrated and validated to predict monthly flow sediment phosphorus and nitrogen loss in lake conway point remove watershed due to limited available water quality data the model was only calibrated for flow then validated for flow and water quality at the usgs gauge station at hattieville and validated for water quality at the usgs gauge station at morrilton model calibration and validation performance ranged from unsatisfactory to very good for flow and water quality depending on evaluation statistics the calibrated model was used to simulate baseline loading conditions for flow sediment tp and tn and analyzed the impact of five agricultural best management practices scenarios on flow and water quality under different placement strategies among the four individual agricultural bmps simulated grassed waterways were found as the most effective followed by vegetative filter strips cover crops forage and biomass planting model results suggest that significant reductions can be expected at the subwatershed level whiles moderate effectiveness would be observed at the watershed level the location of bmp and the watershed characteristics had a direct influence on sediment and nutrient reductions randomly placing bmps within the watershed resulted in the least unit area reductions the greatest reduction per area occurred when high producing hrus were targeted within the high priority hucs and when targeting subwatersheds that were located near the outlet of the watershed in addition the pond and wetland bmps which are already implemented within the watershed have reduced nutrient and sediment losses results from this modeling can be used to help prioritize monitoring needs evaluate the relative effectiveness of agricultural bmps in reducing pollutant loads and improving water quality in similar data limited watersheds acknowledgements this work was supported by the us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service

11516,in recent decades agricultural production is being affected by a sharp increase in atmospheric co2 concentration due to the greenhouse effect gases crops are impacted by enhanced temperatures and concomitantly by increased scarce water availability all arid and semiarid areas including mediterranean viticulture must face these three climate change related factors atmospheric co2 concentration and temperature increases and scarce water for irrigation scarce water is a problem even in irrigated viticulture as irrigation is becoming more and more restricted within this context the aim of this work was to investigate grapevine vitis vinifera l cv red and white tempranillo vegetative and reproductive growth fruit bearing cuttings were grown under elevated co2 around 700 μmol mol 1 or ppm versus 400 high temperature ambient temperature 4 c versus ambient and water deficit cyclic drought versus full irrigated in temperature gradient greenhouses for three consecutive growing seasons years 2013 2014 and 2015 climate change impacted markedly vegetative growth within the abovementioned factors vegetative growth total vegetative mass was significantly reduced by drought consistent the three years and was associated to a low substrate water status and low leaf stomatal conductance elevated co2 stimulated total vegetative mass whereas leaf area was not affected when plants were grown under elevated co2 the largest increases were observed in leaf white and root red growth in these experiments elevated co2 did not compensate the negative effects of water stress an increase of the mean temperature 4 c had no consequences on vegetative growth yield and yield related traits were unaffected by the climate change scenario abbreviations dw dry weight fw fresh weight

greenhouses keywords red and white tempranillo vegetative and reproductive growth climate change related factors elevated co2 high temperature water deficit 1 introduction greenhouse effect gases such as co2 chlorine fluorine carbon cfc and its derivatives ch4 and n2o are causing the recent increases in temperature at a global scale atmospheric co2 concentration has increased since preindustrial period from 280 μmol mol 1 ppm to currently more than 400 and the predictions for the end of the century range from 421 to 936 meinshausen et al 2011 cumulative emissions of co2 contribute largely to the global mean surface warming foreseen values range from stabilization at 1 5 c higher than the current reference period 1986 2005 to a more than 4 c increase depending on the mitigation measures adopted ipcc 2014 during the last two decades for instance air temperature has increased 0 85 c ipcc 2014 this greenhouse effect is impacting crops causing more frequent mediterranean crop drought noaa 2011 that results from reduced water supply and increased transpiration due to the higher temperature grapevine is a typical mediterranean crop fully adapted to summer drought but its response to climate change related factors elevated co2 high temperature and drought can vary when stress factors act individually and or interacting kizildeniz et al 2015 an instantaneous response to an elevated atmospheric co2 is an increased photosynthesis and a decreased transpiration due to higher substrate availability for c fixation and stomata partial closure respectively lambers et al 1998 long 1991 consequently elevated co2 was reported to stimulate plant growth in different species ainsworth and long 2005 drake et al 1997 kimball and idso 1983 as in other c3 species where photosynthesis is limited by co2 availability grapevine responds to the elevated co2 with an increased vegetative growth and yield bindi et al 1996 bowes 1993 rogers et al 1994 however long term co2 exposure leads to a phenomenon known as photosynthetic acclimation or down regulation that decreases grapevine photosynthetic capacity salazar parra et al 2015 resulting in less clear effects on grapevine physiology and growth secondary changes in morphology allocation and chemical composition may also influence growth poorter et al 1997 studies of elevated temperature on grapevine have been focused on berry composition due to its association with grape ripening kuhn et al 2014 besides its effects on berries depending on the level of elevated temperature and duration it could also affect grapevine physiology in particular photosynthesis and vigor rates of photosynthesis can be reduced 30 50 when temperature rises over the 30 c light saturated optimum greer and weedon 2013 photosynthesis decreases with increasing temperatures were attributed only 15 30 to stomatal closure greer and weedon 2012 zsófi et al 2009 more extreme temperatures can also inactivate the co2 fixing rubisco ribulose 1 5 biphosphate carboxylase oxygenase enzyme which results in a drastic reduction of photosynthesis and limits the berry sugar supply causing slow ripening greer and weedon 2013 as a consequence of photosynthesis and sugar accumulation decreases under high temperatures growth and yield are expected to decrease medrano et al 2003 grapevine is traditionally a non irrigated crop that is cultivated on 6 out of 7 continents hofmann and schultz 2015 where it occupies quite extensive agricultural areas in arid and semiarid regions water is the most limiting resource in these environments such as the mediterranean region where rainfall is scarce and irregularly distributed along the year climate change models predict even more arid conditions for the future ashour and al najar 2012 collins et al 2013 grapevine has developed physiological and morphological mechanisms enabling it to produce under such circumstances koundouras et al 2008 irrigation is a major tool for grapevine growers to increase soil water availability which should lead to potential higher yields with salon et al 2005 valdes et al 2009 williams and matthews 1990 or without reynolds et al 2007 smart and coombe 1983 quality losses depending on the intensity of water stress and on the grapevine developmental stage soil water availability nevertheless has more influence on grapevine vegetative growth than on yield kizildeniz et al 2015 korkutal et al 2011 williams and matthews 1990 for viticulture purposes a managed deficit irrigation may be used to control grapevine vegetative growth and quality kennedy et al 2002 in the literature effects of climate change elevated co2 high temperature and water scarcity on grapevine physiology have been investigated as individual effects more than the interactions among them when individual effects are considered exposure time duration and sequence are essential for growth for instance increased number of warm days during flowering veraison period and low precipitation during maturation result in greater berry weights jones and davis 2000 combination of all abovementioned climate change related factors has more severe effects on berry weight mccarthy 1997 when high temperature and water deficit are combined leaf water potential stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis are reduced edwards et al 2011 in the long term if these factors persist the leaf area can be affected stimulation of grapevine production by elevated co2 is decreased or completely cancelled in presence of high temperature bindi et al 2001 grapevine works focused on multiple stress factors are rarely performed because such studies in the field or under controlled conditions are complex difficult and expensive to execute the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of the three main climate change related factors elevated co2 high temperature and water scarcity acting both individually and or interacting on plant vegetative and reproductive yield growth in fruit bearing cuttings of two grapevine cultivars red and white tempranillo plants were grown in temperature gradient greenhouses tggs during 3 consecutive growing seasons 2013 2014 and 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material dormant cuttings of vitis vinifera l cv red accession t43 clone rj 43 and white tempranillo accession ci 101 in la grajera germplasm bank riojás government spain were sampled from an experimental vineyard of the institute of sciences of vine and wine icvv in logroño la rioja spain experiments were conducted using each year new cuttings not imposing treatments on the same plants for 3 consecutive years tempranillo is a local red grape variety widely cultivated in northern and central spain currently expanded to many other viticulture areas in the world a new white berry somatic variant of tempranillo white tempranillo is the result of a spontaneous natural mutation which was discovered in an old red tempranillo vineyard in 1988 in murillo de río leza la rioja spain garcía escudero et al 2011 and vegetatively propagated from one single grapevine plant 2 2 growth conditions we used two types of greenhouses for growing the plants until fruit set plants were grown in a pre culture greenhouse with an effective cooling system where temperature and relative humidity rh were set at 26 15 c and 60 80 day night respectively and with a photoperiod of 15 h using natural daylight supplemented with high pressure metal halide lamps osram augsburg germany providing a photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of 500 μmol m 2 s 1 at inflorescence level variability around target temperature and rh values was typically 1 5 2 and 8 12 respectively morales et al 2014 after fruit set and coincident with the start of the treatments plants were moved to the second greenhouses i e the temperature gradient greenhouses tggs table 1 summarizes temperature and rh data within the tggs in 2013 2014 and 2015 fruit bearing cuttings were obtained according to mullins 1966 as described by kizildeniz et al 2015 briefly cuttings were treated with indole butyric acid 300 mg l 1 in a heated rockwool moist bed 25 27 c kept in a cool chamber 5 c one month later the rooted cuttings were planted in 0 8 l plastic pots containing a mixture of sand perlite and vermiculite 1 1 1 in volume and transferred to the pre culture greenhouse only a single flowering stem was allowed to develop on each plant in order to get only one berry bunch per plant until fruit set vegetation was controlled and only 4 leaves per plant was allowed to grow at fruit set the cuttings were transplanted to 13 l plastic pots including a peat and perlite 2 1 v v mixture field capacity permanent wilting point and available water content of the peat perlite mixture were determined using a soil moisture equipment with ceramic plates of 33 and 1500 kpa richards 1941 bulk density was calculated weighing the dry substrate contained in a given volume the characteristics of the peat perlite mixture used with respect to dynamics of water content are summarized in table 2 nutrient solution was applied as proposed by ollat et al 1998 nh4no3 64 5 mg l 1

treatments were applied in the second type of greenhouses the temperature gradient greenhouses tggs located in the campus of the university of navarra 42 48 n 1 40 w pamplona navarra spain from june to august 2013 2014 and 2015 fruit set to maturity tggs have a design based on temperature gradient tunnels rawson et al 1995 which allows investigating the effects on plants of environmental changes such as elevated temperature elevated co2 and drought acting separately or in combination tggs contain 3 temperature modules 3 04 m long each co2 can be injected inside increasing the air co2 concentration as desired and a gradient of temperature is created along them from module 1 of ambient temperature to module 3 of ambient 4 c morales et al 2014 also plants growing inside the tggs can be subjected to different levels of irrigation thus two tggs were set at current 400 ppm and the other two at elevated 700 ppm co2 concentrations the injection of co2 to the tgg was structurally fixed and therefore the same tggs were set at elevated co2 concentration the three years of experiments each tgg has a modular design temperature varied from ambient following the external temperature diurnal cycle module 1 to ambient 4 c adding 4 c always to the external temperature module 3 this was also structurally fixed finally half of the plants growing inside each module were full irrigated and half were exposed to cyclic drought the sub sections to irrigate fully or partially the plants were also structurally fixed and the red and white tempranillo plants positions within the modules of the tggs were not assigned randomly to blocks in the tggs co2 concentration and temperature were controlled and monitored and relative humidity and radiation were monitored by an informatics system therefore the treatments applied to the two grapevine varieties studied red and white tempranillo were a combination of two co2 levels ambient ca 400 ppm and elevated ca 700 ppm two temperature regimes ambient and ambient 4 c and two water availability conditions full irrigation and cyclic drought water treatments were applied and substrate water content recorded according to kizildeniz et al 2015 2 4 water treatments soil moisture sensors ec 5 soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa were placed into the pots 3 and 7 humidity sensors per treatment in full irrigated and cyclic drought treatments respectively during the last transplant at fruit set substrate water content was controlled until maturity plants under full irrigation were maintained at ca 80 of the substrate field capacity sensor value between 30 and 40 m3 h2o m 3 substrate 100 equivalent to 300 400 g h2o l 1 substrate cyclic drought consisted in withholding irrigation until plants showed visual signs of water deficit such as tendrils and leaves downwards sensor value between 10 and 0 m3 h2o m 3 substrate 100 equivalent to 0 100 g h2o l 1 substrate when cyclic drought plants had symptoms they were irrigated with the same amount of nutrients that received plants under full irrigation in that cycle 2 5 measurements and analyses gas exchange measurements were made on young fully expanded leaves at the same physiological stage from 8th to 10th node from the top inside each tgg at the respective growth conditions of co2 i e plants grown at current co2 were measured at 400 ppm co2 whereas those grown at elevated co2 were measured at 700 ppm temperature and rh stomatal conductance gs was performed using a portable photosynthesis system lci sd with the plus5 compact light unit adc bioscientific england and it was measured in early morning under 1200 μmol m 2 s 1 white led light stomatal conductance was used as a reference parameter of the plant water stress at which plants were exposed medrano et al 2002 plant leaf area was estimated using a model costanza et al 2004 adapted for cv tempranillo the model relates actual leaf area which was measured with a leaf area meter li 300 model li cor biosciences lincoln usa y and shoot length x y 15 5x 24 8 r2 0 93 regression model was built over 40 shoots sampled throughout the growing season from extra plants complete bunch of berries was collected at maturity defined at 21 23 brix for cv tempranillo berry and rachis fresh weight fw were measured and number of berries per bunch and seeds per berry were counted berry diameter was measured with a caliper relative skin mass was calculated as skin fw berry fw 100 leaves petioles shoots and roots were sampled at maturity and then oven dried at 80 c for 48 h in order to obtain dw or dry mass dm total vegetative mass was calculated as the sum of all these plant parts the design of the experiment was strip strip strip plot with four factors co2 temperature water availability and variety the experiment was carried out three years 2013 2014 and 2015 three biological replicates data were first tested using a four way anova four factors i co2 concentration ii temperature iii water availability and iv variety and two levels i 700 ppm co2 vs 400 ppm ii ambient temperature vs temperature 4 c iii full irrigation vs cyclic drought and iv white vs red tempranillo in order to determine the effects of the treatments and their possible interactions differences among groups were tested first with the fisher s least significant differences lsd post hoc test and then with the tukey test the latter being quite conservative these tests are useful when main effects or interactions are significant results were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 data are presented as means standard error se both absolute values and values relative to control red tempranillo full irrigated grown at current temperature and co2 set to 1 were used this normalization was year based i e control values of each year were set to 1 and all other treatment combinations were expressed relative to that year control this eliminated year to year variation the use of values relative to control was useful when variability among years was so high that blurred the effects of the applied treatments all these statistical analyses were carried out with xlstat 7 5 2 pro statistical software addinsoft paris france 3 results 3 1 foreseen climate change and substrate water status at maturity in v vinifera cv red and white tempranillo substrate water content is a useful parameter to monitor water use behavior of the two tempranillo cultivars red and white and their response to the different stress factors cyclic drought resulted in half of the substrate water content with respect to the full irrigated control mean values during the experiments were ca 277 348 and 157 203 g h2o l 1 substrate in control and droughted plants respectively table 3 just before re irrigation the lowest values of plants facing cyclic drought table 3 were below wilting point table 2 elevated co2 and temperature did not affect substrate water content averaged values were in the range 168 341 elevated temperature 157 348 current temperature 168 348 elevated co2 and 157 334 current co2 g h2o l 1 substrate table 3 all these values were between the value of permanent wilting point and that of field capacity table 2 for this substrate despite the abovementioned lowest values found in droughted plants these values pointed to good water availability for the growth of the grapevine plants 3 2 foreseen climate change and stomatal conductance of v vinifera cv red and white tempranillo stomatal conductance was used as a reference parameter of the extent of water stress that plants faced in the different treatments both red and white tempranillo plants exposed to simulated climate change conditions elevated co2 and temperature and water deficit had lower stomatal conductance gs than those grown under the current conditions ambient co2 and temperature and full irrigation fig 1 statistical differences were observed using both fisher s and tukey tests effects of elevated co2 elevated temperature and drought on gs were additive showing significant decreases in response to co2 p co2 0 009 temperature p temp 0 0001 and water availability p wa 0 0001 fig 1 the anova analysis also revealed two three and four level significant interactions in the response of gs to the simulated climate change fig 1 3 3 foreseen climate change and plant growth at maturity of v vinifera cv red and white tempranillo climate change conditions impacted growth in both red and white tempranillo within the factors investigated grapevine vegetative growth was highly influenced by water deficit water deficit decreased grapevine vegetative growth reflected in significant decreases in both total vegetative mass fig 2 and leaf area fig 3 p wa 0 0001 in both this was observed both when absolute values and when values relative to control were considered throughout this report control is referred to red tempranillo grown under full irrigation ambient temperature and current co2 figs 2 and 3 elevated co2 stimulated total vegetative mass p co2 0 002 fig 2 whereas had no influence in leaf area fig 3 contrary to this no effects were observed in response to high temperature figs 2 and 3 data also revealed a significant higher p variety 0 030 total vegetative mass in red than in white tempranillo fig 2 the interaction between variety and high temperature p variety temp 0 030 fig 2 evidenced that total vegetative mass of the two tempranillo varieties under investigation did not respond similarly to temperature see below in order to understand the behavior of individual and interacting factors in the whole vegetative growth the dw of the different grapevine vegetative organs was studied table 4 due to the variability among years changes observed were better reflected in values relative to control lower part of table 4 than in absolute values uppermost part of table 4 climate change conditions decreased leaf petiole and shoot dw when compared to the current conditions in red tempranillo whereas only decreased petiole and shoot dw in the white one table 4 both fisher s and tukey tests gave significant differences drastic growth decreases due to water scarcity occurred in all organs p wa 0 0001 table 4 but this effect was more severe in shoots petioles and leaves than in roots table 4 these data indicate that water deficit impacted more in the above than in the below growth on the contrary elevated co2 when compared to current co2 increased leaf p co2 0 007 petiole p co2 0 036 shoot p co2 0 011 and root p co2 0 011 dw whereas high temperature had no much influence table 4 thus there was a significant interaction in petiole and shoot dw p variety temp wa 0 022 and 0 015 respectively table 4 this corresponded to a positive effect of temperature only in well watered plants of the white tempranillo cultivar white tempranillo grew less than the red one table 4 with significant lower values in shoot p variety 0 005 and root p variety 0 025 dw analysis of the interaction between water deficit and varieties revealed a significantly higher reduction in shoot growth due to the water deficit in red than in white tempranillo p variety wa 0 037 table 4 given that var wa interaction is included in the var temp wa interaction which was significant for shoot dw shoot dw reduction produced by water stress was only observed at actual temperature not at temperature 4 c table 4 interestingly in well watered plants elevated temperature had a positive influence on the growth of white tempranillo plants whereas its influence was not so clear in the red one table 4 temperature increased the dw of petioles and shoots in white tempranillo while decreases were observed in the red variety table 4 p variety temp 0 005 and 0 007 respectively the different behavior of the two varieties and especially the increased growth of some particular organs of the white one could be a sign of the existence of a different physiological response to temperature 3 4 foreseen climate change and reproductive growth at maturity of v vinifera cv red and white tempranillo reproductive growth was unaffected by the simulated climate change scenario both in red and white tempranillo parameters analyzed were number of berries per bunch number of seeds per berry berry diameter berry and rachis fw and relative skin mass neither fisher s nor tukey tests gave differences in red tempranillo there was a tendency to produce a few less berries per bunch under drought but differences did not reach statistical significance fig 4 only small differences could be observed rachis fw was lower in droughted plants than in the full irrigated ones p wa 0 035 fig 5 whereas berry fw was higher in plants grown under elevated co2 than in those grown at current co2 concentration p co2 0 037 fig 6 also anova revealed a four level interaction in relative skin mass table 4 p variety co2 temp wa 0 011 and 0 022 when absolute or relative values were considered respectively 4 discussion data recently reported indicates that red tempranillo consumes more water than the white one kizildeniz et al 2015 causes for such higher water consumption in the red cultivar may include a higher root density and or a larger leaf area at plant level not all the above mentioned factors contribute to the observed varietal differences plant root and shoot dw was higher in red than in white tempranillo but plant leaf area was similar in both cultivars also our preliminary unpublished results indicate that the stomatal density is lower in white tempranillo when compared to the red one it is very likely that the natural mutation with genetic material loss carbonell bejerano et al 2017 that originated the white variety from red tempranillo had affected loci other than those related to berry color regarding water consumption and leaf area drought cycles length was reported to be shorter and symptoms of water deficit appeared with lower water content in the growth substrate at the end than at the beginning of the experiments in both red and white tempranillo kizildeniz et al 2015 which at least in part might be related to the leaf area growth and development of the tempranillo plants water scarcity was found to be the most detrimental factor related to climate change causing a drastic reduction in plant vegetative growth including shoots and roots in line with previous reports schultz and matthew 1988 from our results it is clear that the highest effect was induced by water reduction which given the experimental setup it was also the most extreme treatment temperature was increased in 4 c a situation the plant confronts usually co2 concentration was increased in 75 not a severe increase for the plant capacities but for watering one of the levels of the treatment was unreal although unavoidable in potted plants full capacity is never present in mediterranean conditions plants even with support irrigation are between drought and severe drought most of their life cycle moreover substrate characteristics which were far from the typical clay calcareous soils quite common in vineyards could also affect the water stress response these may be the reasons why water availability had the highest effect low vegetative growth was associated to low substrate water status in cyclic drought grown plants being this result consistent the three years of experiments also the water stress imposed was reflected in lower stomatal conductances in droughted plants when compared to the full irrigated ones root growth was less susceptible to water deficit than the abovegrown organs leaves petioles and shoots as was also indicated previously by williams and matthews 1990 and kizildeniz et al 2015 there was no interaction between water availability and either co2 or temperature with respect to vegetative growth it should be also remarked that growth of red tempranillo was more impacted by drought than that of the white one effects of future climate change on crop productions are likely to vary widely among crops and regions moriondo et al 2010 in southern europe because of water shortage and extreme weather events heat and drought agriculture is expected to face large yield losses bindi and olesen 2011 ferrise et al 2011 moriondo et al 2011 ruiz ramos et al 2011 negative effects of water stress on reproductive growth had been widely reported mccarthy 1997 petrie et al 2004 santesteban et al 2011 however it can be concluded from the literature that the impact of water stress on grapevines is more severe in vegetative than in reproductive growth korkutal et al 2011 williams and matthews 1990 our data indicate no changes in number of berries per bunch berry diameter and fw relative skin mass and number of seeds per berry in response to drought at the beginning of the berry developmental stage berry growth is very sensitive to water stress and the effects of drought cannot be reversed by supplemental irrigation during the following stages nevertheless applying climate change related factors after fruit set including drought has minor effects on berry size as has been previously reported by mekni 2014 and kizildeniz et al 2015 using grapevine fruit bearing cuttings changes in thermal conditions predominantly regulate grapevine phenological cycle including critical periods such as bud break flowering berry growth veraison maturation leaf fall and dormancy iland et al 2011 warming temperatures are related to a shorter period between bud burst and harvest inducing earlier flowering veraison ripening and harvest duchêne and schneider 2005 keller 2010 martínez lüscher et al 2016 over a 50 year period grape harvest now almost occurs one month earlier seguin and de cortazar 2005 during the vegetative cycle grapevine plants should choose between opening stomata with the aim of maintaining as low as possible leaf temperature and as high as possible photosynthesis or closing them preventing unwanted water losses and excessive dehydration campitelli and stinchcombe 2013 chaves et al 2016 jones 2014 nicotra et al 2008 peppe et al 2011 despite the closure of stomata observed in this work induced by the elevated temperature our data indicate no effects on vegetative or reproductive growth increasing the temperature 4 c when nutrients and water are available to plants elevated co2 accelerates grapevine growth mullins et al 1992 and yield with no negative impacts on grape and wine quality bindi et al 2001 but to a different extent among cultivars kizildeniz et al 2015 elevated co2 stimulated more vegetative total vegetative mass than reproductive berry fw growth elevated co2 increased leaf petiole shoot and root dw and there were no interactions with temperature or water availability the beneficial effects of elevated co2 on growth are likely related to the higher rates of photosynthesis reported in grapevines grown under such high co2 concentrations bindi et al 1996 2001 da silva et al 2017 salazar parra et al 2012 2015 schultz 2000 stomatal conductance and transpiration rates flexas et al 2014 leakey et al 2009 salazar parra et al 2012 2015 as well as stomatal density moutinho pereira et al 2009 rogiers et al 2011 are reduced by elevated co2 exposure the increases in photosynthesis and decreases in transpiration lead to an improved water use efficiency da silva et al 2017 wullschleger et al 2002 in contrast to previous reports chaves and pereira 1992 kizildeniz et al 2015 williams and matthews 1990 elevated co2 did not compensate for the negative effects of water stress on vegetative growth under our experimental conditions 5 conclusions climate change scenario impacted vegetative growth in red and white tempranillo plant vegetative growth decreased especially with water deficit treatments the inhibitory effect of water deficit was related to low substrate water status and low stomatal conductance elevated co2 stimulated vegetative growth in particular total vegetative mass leaf area was not affected in white and red tempranillo the largest increases when plants were grown under elevated co2 were observed in leaf and root growth respectively in contrast to previous reports of grapevine elevated co2 did not compensate the negative effects of water stress an increase of the mean temperature 4 c had no consequences on vegetative growth yield

11516,in recent decades agricultural production is being affected by a sharp increase in atmospheric co2 concentration due to the greenhouse effect gases crops are impacted by enhanced temperatures and concomitantly by increased scarce water availability all arid and semiarid areas including mediterranean viticulture must face these three climate change related factors atmospheric co2 concentration and temperature increases and scarce water for irrigation scarce water is a problem even in irrigated viticulture as irrigation is becoming more and more restricted within this context the aim of this work was to investigate grapevine vitis vinifera l cv red and white tempranillo vegetative and reproductive growth fruit bearing cuttings were grown under elevated co2 around 700 μmol

as co2 chlorine fluorine carbon cfc and its derivatives ch4 and n2o are causing the recent increases in temperature at a global scale atmospheric co2 concentration has increased since preindustrial period from 280 μmol mol 1 ppm to currently more than 400 and the predictions for the end of the century range from 421 to 936 meinshausen et al 2011 cumulative emissions of co2 contribute largely to the global mean surface warming foreseen values range from stabilization at 1 5 c higher than the current reference period 1986 2005 to a more than 4 c increase depending on the mitigation measures adopted ipcc 2014 during the last two decades for instance air temperature has increased 0 85 c ipcc 2014 this greenhouse effect is impacting crops causing more frequent mediterranean crop drought noaa 2011 that results from reduced water supply and increased transpiration due to the higher temperature grapevine is a typical mediterranean crop fully adapted to summer drought but its response to climate change related factors elevated co2 high temperature and drought can vary when stress factors act individually and or interacting kizildeniz et al 2015 an instantaneous response to an elevated atmospheric co2 is an increased photosynthesis and a decreased transpiration due to higher substrate availability for c fixation and stomata partial closure respectively lambers et al 1998 long 1991 consequently elevated co2 was reported to stimulate plant growth in different species ainsworth and long 2005 drake et al 1997 kimball and idso 1983 as in other c3 species where photosynthesis is limited by co2 availability grapevine responds to the elevated co2 with an increased vegetative growth and yield bindi et al 1996 bowes 1993 rogers et al 1994 however long term co2 exposure leads to a phenomenon known as photosynthetic acclimation or down regulation that decreases grapevine photosynthetic capacity salazar parra et al 2015 resulting in less clear effects on grapevine physiology and growth secondary changes in morphology allocation and chemical composition may also influence growth poorter et al 1997 studies of elevated temperature on grapevine have been focused on berry composition due to its association with grape ripening kuhn et al 2014 besides its effects on berries depending on the level of elevated temperature and duration it could also affect grapevine physiology in particular photosynthesis and vigor rates of photosynthesis can be reduced 30 50 when temperature rises over the 30 c light saturated optimum greer and weedon 2013 photosynthesis decreases with increasing temperatures were attributed only 15 30 to stomatal closure greer and weedon 2012 zsófi et al 2009 more extreme temperatures can also inactivate the co2 fixing rubisco ribulose 1 5 biphosphate carboxylase oxygenase enzyme which results in a drastic reduction of photosynthesis and limits the berry sugar supply causing slow ripening greer and weedon 2013 as a consequence of photosynthesis and sugar accumulation decreases under high temperatures growth and yield are expected to decrease medrano et al 2003 grapevine is traditionally a non irrigated crop that is cultivated on 6 out of 7 continents hofmann and schultz 2015 where it occupies quite extensive agricultural areas in arid and semiarid regions water is the most limiting resource in these environments such as the mediterranean region where rainfall is scarce and irregularly distributed along the year climate change models predict even more arid conditions for the future ashour and al najar 2012 collins et al 2013 grapevine has developed physiological and morphological mechanisms enabling it to produce under such circumstances koundouras et al 2008 irrigation is a major tool for grapevine growers to increase soil water availability which should lead to potential higher yields with salon et al 2005 valdes et al 2009 williams and matthews 1990 or without reynolds et al 2007 smart and coombe 1983 quality losses depending on the intensity of water stress and on the grapevine developmental stage soil water availability nevertheless has more influence on grapevine vegetative growth than on yield kizildeniz et al 2015 korkutal et al 2011 williams and matthews 1990 for viticulture purposes a managed deficit irrigation may be used to control grapevine vegetative growth and quality kennedy et al 2002 in the literature effects of climate change elevated co2 high temperature and water scarcity on grapevine physiology have been investigated as individual effects more than the interactions among them when individual effects are considered exposure time duration and sequence are essential for growth for instance increased number of warm days during flowering veraison period and low precipitation during maturation result in greater berry weights jones and davis 2000 combination of all abovementioned climate change related factors has more severe effects on berry weight mccarthy 1997 when high temperature and water deficit are combined leaf water potential stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis are reduced edwards et al 2011 in the long term if these factors persist the leaf area can be affected stimulation of grapevine production by elevated co2 is decreased or completely cancelled in presence of high temperature bindi et al 2001 grapevine works focused on multiple stress factors are rarely performed because such studies in the field or under controlled conditions are complex difficult and expensive to execute the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of the three main climate change related factors elevated co2 high temperature and water scarcity acting both individually and or interacting on plant vegetative and reproductive yield growth in fruit bearing cuttings of two grapevine cultivars red and white tempranillo plants were grown in temperature gradient greenhouses tggs during 3 consecutive growing seasons 2013 2014 and 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material dormant cuttings of vitis vinifera l cv red accession t43 clone rj 43 and white tempranillo accession ci 101 in la grajera germplasm bank riojás government spain were sampled from an experimental vineyard of the institute of sciences of vine and wine icvv in logroño la rioja spain experiments were conducted using each year new cuttings not imposing treatments on the same plants for 3 consecutive years tempranillo is a local red grape variety widely cultivated in northern and central spain currently expanded to many other viticulture areas in the world a new white berry somatic variant of tempranillo white tempranillo is the result of a spontaneous natural mutation which was discovered in an old red tempranillo vineyard in 1988 in murillo de río leza la rioja spain garcía escudero et al 2011 and vegetatively propagated from one single grapevine plant 2 2 growth conditions we used two types of greenhouses for growing the plants until fruit set plants were grown in a pre culture greenhouse with an effective cooling system where temperature and relative humidity rh were set at 26 15 c and 60 80 day night respectively and with a photoperiod of 15 h using natural daylight supplemented with high pressure metal halide lamps osram augsburg germany providing a photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of 500 μmol m 2 s 1 at inflorescence level variability around target temperature and rh values was typically 1 5 2 and 8 12 respectively morales et al 2014 after fruit set and coincident with the start of the treatments plants were moved to the second greenhouses i e the temperature gradient greenhouses tggs table 1 summarizes temperature and rh data within the tggs in 2013 2014 and 2015 fruit bearing cuttings were obtained according to mullins 1966 as described by kizildeniz et al 2015 briefly cuttings were treated with indole butyric acid 300 mg l 1 in a heated rockwool moist bed 25 27 c kept in a cool chamber 5 c one month later the rooted cuttings were planted in 0 8 l plastic pots containing a mixture of sand perlite and vermiculite 1 1 1 in volume and transferred to the pre culture greenhouse only a single flowering stem was allowed to develop on each plant in order to get only one berry bunch per plant until fruit set vegetation was controlled and only 4 leaves per plant was allowed to grow at fruit set the cuttings were transplanted to 13 l plastic pots including a peat and perlite 2 1 v v mixture field capacity permanent wilting point and available water content of the peat perlite mixture were determined using a soil moisture equipment with ceramic plates of 33 and 1500 kpa richards 1941 bulk density was calculated weighing the dry substrate contained in a given volume the characteristics of the peat perlite mixture used with respect to dynamics of water content are summarized in table 2 nutrient solution was applied as proposed by ollat et al 1998 nh4no3 64 5 mg l 1

treatments were applied in the second type of greenhouses the temperature gradient greenhouses tggs located in the campus of the university of navarra 42 48 n 1 40 w pamplona navarra spain from june to august 2013 2014 and 2015 fruit set to maturity tggs have a design based on temperature gradient tunnels rawson et al 1995 which allows investigating the effects on plants of environmental changes such as elevated temperature elevated co2 and drought acting separately or in combination tggs contain 3 temperature modules 3 04 m long each co2 can be injected inside increasing the air co2 concentration as desired and a gradient of temperature is created along them from module 1 of ambient temperature to module 3 of ambient 4 c morales et al 2014 also plants growing inside the tggs can be subjected to different levels of irrigation thus two tggs were set at current 400 ppm and the other two at elevated 700 ppm co2 concentrations the injection of co2 to the tgg was structurally fixed and therefore the same tggs were set at elevated co2 concentration the three years of experiments each tgg has a modular design temperature varied from ambient following the external temperature diurnal cycle module 1 to ambient 4 c adding 4 c always to the external temperature module 3 this was also structurally fixed finally half of the plants growing inside each module were full irrigated and half were exposed to cyclic drought the sub sections to irrigate fully or partially the plants were also structurally fixed and the red and white tempranillo plants positions within the modules of the tggs were not assigned randomly to blocks in the tggs co2 concentration and temperature were controlled and monitored and relative humidity and radiation were monitored by an informatics system therefore the treatments applied to the two grapevine varieties studied red and white tempranillo were a combination of two co2 levels ambient ca 400 ppm and elevated ca 700 ppm two temperature regimes ambient and ambient 4 c and two water availability conditions full irrigation and cyclic drought water treatments were applied and substrate water content recorded according to kizildeniz et al 2015 2 4 water treatments soil moisture sensors ec 5 soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa were placed into the pots 3 and 7 humidity sensors per treatment in full irrigated and cyclic drought treatments respectively during the last transplant at fruit set substrate water content was controlled until maturity plants under full irrigation were maintained at ca 80 of the substrate field capacity sensor value between 30 and 40 m3 h2o m 3 substrate 100 equivalent to 300 400 g h2o l 1 substrate cyclic drought consisted in withholding irrigation until plants showed visual signs of water deficit such as tendrils and leaves downwards sensor value between 10 and 0 m3 h2o m 3 substrate 100 equivalent to 0 100 g h2o l 1 substrate when cyclic drought plants had symptoms they were irrigated with the same amount of nutrients that received plants under full irrigation in that cycle 2 5 measurements and analyses gas exchange measurements were made on young fully expanded leaves at the same physiological stage from 8th to 10th node from the top inside each tgg at the respective growth conditions of co2 i e plants grown at current co2 were measured at 400 ppm co2 whereas those grown at elevated co2 were measured at 700 ppm temperature and rh stomatal conductance gs was performed using a portable photosynthesis system lci sd with the plus5 compact light unit adc bioscientific england and it was measured in early morning under 1200 μmol m 2 s 1 white led light stomatal conductance was used as a reference parameter of the plant water stress at which plants were exposed medrano et al 2002 plant leaf area was estimated using a model costanza et al 2004 adapted for cv tempranillo the model relates actual leaf area which was measured with a leaf area meter li 300 model li cor biosciences lincoln usa y and shoot length x y 15 5x 24 8 r2 0 93 regression model was built over 40 shoots sampled throughout the growing season from extra plants complete bunch of berries was collected at maturity defined at 21 23 brix for cv tempranillo berry and rachis fresh weight fw were measured and number of berries per bunch and seeds per berry were counted berry diameter was measured with a caliper relative skin mass was calculated as skin fw berry fw 100 leaves petioles shoots and roots were sampled at maturity and then oven dried at 80 c for 48 h in order to obtain dw or dry mass dm total vegetative mass was calculated as the sum of all these plant parts the design of the experiment was strip strip strip plot with four factors co2 temperature water availability and variety the experiment was carried out three years 2013 2014 and 2015 three biological replicates data were first tested using a four way anova four factors i co2 concentration ii temperature iii water availability and iv variety and two levels i 700 ppm co2 vs 400 ppm ii ambient temperature vs temperature 4 c iii full irrigation vs cyclic drought and iv white vs red tempranillo in order to determine the effects of the treatments and their possible interactions differences among groups were tested first with the fisher s least significant differences lsd post hoc test and then with the tukey test the latter being quite conservative these tests are useful when main effects or interactions are significant results were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 data are presented as means standard error se both absolute values and values relative to control red tempranillo full irrigated grown at current temperature and co2 set to 1 were used this normalization was year based i e control values of each year were set to 1 and all other treatment combinations were expressed relative to that year control this eliminated year to year variation the use of values relative to control was useful when variability among years was so high that blurred the effects of the applied treatments all these statistical analyses were carried out with xlstat 7 5 2 pro statistical software addinsoft paris france 3 results 3 1 foreseen climate change and substrate water status at maturity in v vinifera cv red and white tempranillo substrate water content is a useful parameter to monitor water use behavior of the two tempranillo cultivars red and white and their response to the different stress factors cyclic drought resulted in half of the substrate water content with respect to the full irrigated control mean values during the experiments were ca 277 348 and 157 203 g h2o l 1 substrate in control and droughted plants respectively table 3 just before re irrigation the lowest values of plants facing cyclic drought table 3 were below wilting point table 2 elevated co2 and temperature did not affect substrate water content averaged values were in the range 168 341 elevated temperature 157 348 current temperature 168 348 elevated co2 and 157 334 current co2 g h2o l 1 substrate table 3 all these values were between the value of permanent wilting point and that of field capacity table 2 for this substrate despite the abovementioned lowest values found in droughted plants these values pointed to good water availability for the growth of the grapevine plants 3 2 foreseen climate change and stomatal conductance of v vinifera cv red and white tempranillo stomatal conductance was used as a reference parameter of the extent of water stress that plants faced in the different treatments both red and white tempranillo plants exposed to simulated climate change conditions elevated co2 and temperature and water deficit had lower stomatal conductance gs than those grown under the current conditions ambient co2 and temperature and full irrigation fig 1 statistical differences were observed using both fisher s and tukey tests effects of elevated co2 elevated temperature and drought on gs were additive showing significant decreases in response to co2 p co2 0 009 temperature p temp 0 0001 and water availability p wa 0 0001 fig 1 the anova analysis also revealed two three and four level significant interactions in the response of gs to the simulated climate change fig 1 3 3 foreseen climate change and plant growth at maturity of v vinifera cv red and white tempranillo climate change conditions impacted growth in both red and white tempranillo within the factors investigated grapevine vegetative growth was highly influenced by water deficit water deficit decreased grapevine vegetative growth reflected in significant decreases in both total vegetative mass fig 2 and leaf area fig 3 p wa 0 0001 in both this was observed both when absolute values and when values relative to control were considered throughout this report control is referred to red tempranillo grown under full irrigation ambient temperature and current co2 figs 2 and 3 elevated co2 stimulated total vegetative mass p co2 0 002 fig 2 whereas had no influence in leaf area fig 3 contrary to this no effects were observed in response to high temperature figs 2 and 3 data also revealed a significant higher p variety 0 030 total vegetative mass in red than in white tempranillo fig 2 the interaction between variety and high temperature p variety temp 0 030 fig 2 evidenced that total vegetative mass of the two tempranillo varieties under investigation did not respond similarly to temperature see below in order to understand the behavior of individual and interacting factors in the whole vegetative growth the dw of the different grapevine vegetative organs was studied table 4 due to the variability among years changes observed were better reflected in values relative to control lower part of table 4 than in absolute values uppermost part of table 4 climate change conditions decreased leaf petiole and shoot dw when compared to the current conditions in red tempranillo whereas only decreased petiole and shoot dw in the white one table 4 both fisher s and tukey tests gave significant differences drastic growth decreases due to water scarcity occurred in all organs p wa 0 0001 table 4 but this effect was more severe in shoots petioles and leaves than in roots table 4 these data indicate that water deficit impacted more in the above than in the below growth on the contrary elevated co2 when compared to current co2 increased leaf p co2 0 007 petiole p co2 0 036 shoot p co2 0 011 and root p co2 0 011 dw whereas high temperature had no much influence table 4 thus there was a significant interaction in petiole and shoot dw p variety temp wa 0 022 and 0 015 respectively table 4 this corresponded to a positive effect of temperature only in well watered plants of the white tempranillo cultivar white tempranillo grew less than the red one table 4 with significant lower values in shoot p variety 0 005 and root p variety 0 025 dw analysis of the interaction between water deficit and varieties revealed a significantly higher reduction in shoot growth due to the water deficit in red than in white tempranillo p variety wa 0 037 table 4 given that var wa interaction is included in the var temp wa interaction which was significant for shoot dw shoot dw reduction produced by water stress was only observed at actual temperature not at temperature 4 c table 4 interestingly in well watered plants elevated temperature had a positive influence on the growth of white tempranillo plants whereas its influence was not so clear in the red one table 4 temperature increased the dw of petioles and shoots in white tempranillo while decreases were observed in the red variety table 4 p variety temp 0 005 and 0 007 respectively the different behavior of the two varieties and especially the increased growth of some particular organs of the white one could be a sign of the existence of a different physiological response to temperature 3 4 foreseen climate change and reproductive growth at maturity of v vinifera cv red and white tempranillo reproductive growth was unaffected by the simulated climate change scenario both in red and white tempranillo parameters analyzed were number of berries per bunch number of seeds per berry berry diameter berry and rachis fw and relative skin mass neither fisher s nor tukey tests gave differences in red tempranillo there was a tendency to produce a few less berries per bunch under drought but differences did not reach statistical significance fig 4 only small differences could be observed rachis fw was lower in droughted plants than in the full irrigated ones p wa 0 035 fig 5 whereas berry fw was higher in plants grown under elevated co2 than in those grown at current co2 concentration p co2 0 037 fig 6 also anova revealed a four level interaction in relative skin mass table 4 p variety co2 temp wa 0 011 and 0 022 when absolute or relative values were considered respectively 4 discussion data recently reported indicates that red tempranillo consumes more water than the white one kizildeniz et al 2015 causes for such higher water consumption in the red cultivar may include a higher root density and or a larger leaf area at plant level not all the above mentioned factors contribute to the observed varietal differences plant root and shoot dw was higher in red than in white tempranillo but plant leaf area was similar in both cultivars also our preliminary unpublished results indicate that the stomatal density is lower in white tempranillo when compared to the red one it is very likely that the natural mutation with genetic material loss carbonell bejerano et al 2017 that originated the white variety from red tempranillo had affected loci other than those related to berry color regarding water consumption and leaf area drought cycles length was reported to be shorter and symptoms of water deficit appeared with lower water content in the growth substrate at the end than at the beginning of the experiments in both red and white tempranillo kizildeniz et al 2015 which at least in part might be related to the leaf area growth and development of the tempranillo plants water scarcity was found to be the most detrimental factor related to climate change causing a drastic reduction in plant vegetative growth including shoots and roots in line with previous reports schultz and matthew 1988 from our results it is clear that the highest effect was induced by water reduction which given the experimental setup it was also the most extreme treatment temperature was increased in 4 c a situation the plant confronts usually co2 concentration was increased in 75 not a severe increase for the plant capacities but for watering one of the levels of the treatment was unreal although unavoidable in potted plants full capacity is never present in mediterranean conditions plants even with support irrigation are between drought and severe drought most of their life cycle moreover substrate characteristics which were far from the typical clay calcareous soils quite common in vineyards could also affect the water stress response these may be the reasons why water availability had the highest effect low vegetative growth was associated to low substrate water status in cyclic drought grown plants being this result consistent the three years of experiments also the water stress imposed was reflected in lower stomatal conductances in droughted plants when compared to the full irrigated ones root growth was less susceptible to water deficit than the abovegrown organs leaves petioles and shoots as was also indicated previously by williams and matthews 1990 and kizildeniz et al 2015 there was no interaction between water availability and either co2 or temperature with respect to vegetative growth it should be also remarked that growth of red tempranillo was more impacted by drought than that of the white one effects of future climate change on crop productions are likely to vary widely among crops and regions moriondo et al 2010 in southern europe because of water shortage and extreme weather events heat and drought agriculture is expected to face large yield losses bindi and olesen 2011 ferrise et al 2011 moriondo et al 2011 ruiz ramos et al 2011 negative effects of water stress on reproductive growth had been widely reported mccarthy 1997 petrie et al 2004 santesteban et al 2011 however it can be concluded from the literature that the impact of water stress on grapevines is more severe in vegetative than in reproductive growth korkutal et al 2011 williams and matthews 1990 our data indicate no changes in number of berries per bunch berry diameter and fw relative skin mass and number of seeds per berry in response to drought at the beginning of the berry developmental stage berry growth is very sensitive to water stress and the effects of drought cannot be reversed by supplemental irrigation during the following stages nevertheless applying climate change related factors after fruit set including drought has minor effects on berry size as has been previously reported by mekni 2014 and kizildeniz et al 2015 using grapevine fruit bearing cuttings changes in thermal conditions predominantly regulate grapevine phenological cycle including critical periods such as bud break flowering berry growth veraison maturation leaf fall and dormancy iland et al 2011 warming temperatures are related to a shorter period between bud burst and harvest inducing earlier flowering veraison ripening and harvest duchêne and schneider 2005 keller 2010 martínez lüscher et al 2016 over a 50 year period grape harvest now almost occurs one month earlier seguin and de cortazar 2005 during the vegetative cycle grapevine plants should choose between opening stomata with the aim of maintaining as low as possible leaf temperature and as high as possible photosynthesis or closing them preventing unwanted water losses and excessive dehydration campitelli and stinchcombe 2013 chaves et al 2016 jones 2014 nicotra et al 2008 peppe et al 2011 despite the closure of stomata observed in this work induced by the elevated temperature our data indicate no effects on vegetative or reproductive growth increasing the temperature 4 c when nutrients and water are available to plants elevated co2 accelerates grapevine growth mullins et al 1992 and yield with no negative impacts on grape and wine quality bindi et al 2001 but to a different extent among cultivars kizildeniz et al 2015 elevated co2 stimulated more vegetative total vegetative mass than reproductive berry fw growth elevated co2 increased leaf petiole shoot and root dw and there were no interactions with temperature or water availability the beneficial effects of elevated co2 on growth are likely related to the higher rates of photosynthesis reported in grapevines grown under such high co2 concentrations bindi et al 1996 2001 da silva et al 2017 salazar parra et al 2012 2015 schultz 2000 stomatal conductance and transpiration rates flexas et al 2014 leakey et al 2009 salazar parra et al 2012 2015 as well as stomatal density moutinho pereira et al 2009 rogiers et al 2011 are reduced by elevated co2 exposure the increases in photosynthesis and decreases in transpiration lead to an improved water use efficiency da silva et al 2017 wullschleger et al 2002 in contrast to previous reports chaves and pereira 1992 kizildeniz et al 2015 williams and matthews 1990 elevated co2 did not compensate for the negative effects of water stress on vegetative growth under our experimental conditions 5 conclusions climate change scenario impacted vegetative growth in red and white tempranillo plant vegetative growth decreased especially with water deficit treatments the inhibitory effect of water deficit was related to low substrate water status and low stomatal conductance elevated co2 stimulated vegetative growth in particular total vegetative mass leaf area was not affected in white and red tempranillo the largest increases when plants were grown under elevated co2 were observed in leaf and root growth respectively in contrast to previous reports of grapevine elevated co2 did not compensate the negative effects of water stress an increase of the mean temperature 4 c had no consequences on vegetative growth yield

11517,the aim of this experiment is to evaluate the effect of raw and treated wastewater irrigation on soil and plants in comparison to well water three plots planted with medicago sativa l were irrigated using water of three different qualities over a period of 9 months covering three crop seasons physicochemical and microbial parameters were analyzed in water and soil agro physiological biochemical and antioxidant enzyme traits in the crops were also assessed results of agro physiological parameters show a positive effect on alfalfa irrigated with domestic wastewater compared to well water while biochemical parameters stomatal conductance chlorophyll fluorescence and total chlorophyll content were adversely affected in alfalfa irrigated with raw wastewater as compared to treated and well water the plants irrigated with raw wastewater accumulate more proline and sugar than plants irrigated with treated wastewater and well water the prevalence of antioxidant enzymes pod cat and mda in the plants increased with raw wastewater irrigation however it remained within the tolerance levels in both plants irrigated by treated wastewater and well water all three levels of water treatment demonstrated low content of heavy metals in the soil indicating a lack of availability for the plants moreover the use of treated wastewater improves physicochemical properties and fertility of the soil compared to well water and enhances crop productivity keywords wastewater re use alfalfa irrigation biochemical parameters enzymatic activity 1 introduction nowadays there is a constant increase in the need for water global population growth has coincided with increases in agricultural and industrial activities aiming to focus on food needs along with frequent droughts and erratic rainfall in recent years the consumption of water resources is at all time high in arid and semi arid countries angin et al 2005 domestic wastewater can be cheaper than pumping freshwater and is considered an interesting alternative source for irrigation in developing countries al rashed and sherif 2000 mohammad and mazahreh 2003 treating wastewater before its re use in irrigation can decrease the health risks related to this practice thus under controlled conditions it has been suggested that treated wastewater is used for certain types of agricultural irrigation al lahham et al 2003 known for its high nutritional quality high protein content and its fertile effect on soil alfalfa medicago sativa l is a popular feed crop worldwide huyghe 2003 moreover the plant reduces the use of chemical fertilizers such as rhizobia symbiotic nitrogen fixing it also contributes to the incorporation of nitrogen in pastoral ecosystems zahia and elajudie 2001 in morocco the plant is grown on over 100 000 ha representing about 22 of the total acreage devoted to fodder crops bouizgaren et al 2011 and due its high productivity operational flexibility and high quality it produces 50 of fodder units bouizgaren 2007 finally many rural populations use it as a source of livestock nutrition as it is a resilient plant able to thrive in both oases and mountains abegunrin et al 2013 studied the effects of kitchen wastewater rainwater and groundwater irrigation on cucumber cucumis sativus growth parameters and soil properties in southwestern nigeria and concluded that the soil condition was not adversely impacted by the use of kitchen wastewater as compared to groundwater or rainwater whereas there were some negative effects on cucumber growth parameters castro et al 2013 reported the effects of treated domestic wastewater reuse for irrigating lettuce on soil properties and compared that to the effects of using drinking quality irrigation water on a lettuce crop lactuca sativa l they recorded that the main negative effect of using treated wastewater was the increase in salt and sodium contents in the soil and irrigation by wastewater was not sufficient to meet the nutritive demands of the lettuce due to a weak uptake of certain necessary elements produced by the accumulation of na pereira et al 2011 investigated the impacts of increasing wastewater irrigation rates on soil properties under tropical conditions and found decreases in soil acidity from land irrigated with urban wastewater the studies done by kouraa et al 2001 in morocco suggested that there is a clear improvement of culture production for potatoes and lettuce from soil irrigated by treated wastewater rusan et al 2006 evaluated the impact of long term wastewater irrigation on soil and crop quality parameters and observed that the soil and crop parameters for land irrigated by wastewater are significantly affected over the long term several researchers have studied the effect of wastewater reuse on certain agronomic aspects of plants such as agricultural yield however there are few reports that explore the deep physiological and biochemical effect of irrigation by raw and or treated domestic wastewaters on crops such a combination of studies would help to understand the real effects of treated wastewater use at a molecular level our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different quality irrigation waters on soil chemical properties and on growth traits of alfalfa and to identify the extent of the physiological and biochemical processes of medicago sativa l under the conditions presented by the moroccan context 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and test planning the plant material used to evaluate the effect of raw and treated wastewater in comparison with well water control is a breed of moroccan alfalfa medicago sativa l called tata it comes from the southwestern oasis as well as the high atlas mountains of morocco this crop has been cultivated

usa 2012 the means were compared using tukey s test at the significance level of α 0 05 4 results 4 1 characteristics of various irrigation waters tested the physicochemical characteristics of water of the three different qualities used in this experiment were shown in table 1 the levels of bod5 cod and tss tended to be nil in well water whereas their values were quite high in raw and treated wastewater in general the ph values of the three kinds of waters fall within the neutral range table 1 well water had the lowest values for ph with a value of 7 14 0 01 it was noticed that electrical conductivity ec carbonate bicarbonate total phosphorus and total nitrogen had significantly higher values in raw wastewater than in treated wastewater whereas low values had been noted in well water furthermore the nitrate content was significantly higher in well water compared to raw and or treated wastewater the sodium adsorption ratio sar shows the relative activity of sodium ions in exchange reactions with the soil the sar ratio evaluates the relative concentration of sodium na to ca and mg the sar value in domestic wastewater and well water was less than 3 indicating that there is no risk of a permeability problem for the soil and the hazards of sodification are nominal ayers and westcot 1985 wastewater contained a significant quantity of nutrients that are essential for plant growth and soil fertility on the other hand in well water the na k ca2 and mg2 concentrations were far lower than in raw and treated wastewater the chlorides content cl showed significant differences between the domestic wastewater raw treated wastewater and the well water its concentration was considerably higher in domestic wastewater than in well water the mean concentration of heavy metals in domestic wastewater raw treated and well water ranged from 0 001 to 0 015 ppm indicating their low contents in water samples table 1 whereas as cr be al were not detected in the water of the three different qualities tested for crop irrigation the average content of fecal bacteria in raw wastewater was consistently higher than moroccan standards which is to be expected table 2 the average content of fecal bacteria in treated wastewater were 382cfu 100 ml for tc 369cfu 100 ml for fc and 229 cfu 100 ml for fs a quantitative study of helminth eggs and salmonella sp in irrigation water is shown in table 2 raw wastewater contained a helminth eggs concentration of 17 0 01 eggs l and for salmonnella sp a content of 4 log unit these concentrations greatly exceeded the values recommended by moroccan standards to irrigate crops that can be eaten uncooked 0egg l for helminth eggs and 0 salmonnella 5l moroccan standards 2006 however well water and treated wastewater were free from helminth eggs and salmonella sp and so corresponded to the moroccan standards for water irrigation of crops that can be eaten uncooked 4 2 effect of water quality on irrigated soil table 3 showed the characteristics of the soil after the application of the water of three different qualities the soil texture consisted of 70 85 sand 9 25 clay and 19 89 silt classified as sandy according to the usda classification the lowest values of ph were noted in soil irrigated with raw wastewater 6 90 compared to the soil irrigated by treated wastewater 7 23 or well water 7 61 it is noted that irrigated soil with raw wastewater has a higher conductivity than well water and treated wastewater table 3 for raw wastewater it has a soil conductivity of 2 14 0 01 ds m which is equivalent to a very high salinity and thus a lower water quality on the other hand for treated wastewater the soil conductivity was 0 67 0 03 ds m which represents a low salinity which does not present a risk for crop yields and a fairly good water quality during the crop seasons as for well water 0 55 0 02 ds m also an increase of organic matter and n content was observed in soil irrigated with raw wastewater 1 97 and 0 089 respectively compared with the other irrigated soils soils organic matter and n content decreased sharply with treated wastewater irrigation 1 84 and 0 075 respectively compared to raw wastewater soils table 3 the lowest contents were noticed in soil irrigated with well water 0 71 and 0 050 respectively the exchangeable na k and ca were considerably increased in soils irrigated with raw wastewater compared to the soils irrigated with treated wastewater and or well water table 3 available p concentrations were more significant in soils irrigated with raw wastewater 26 17 0 68 mg kg than those of the other treatment soils 18 14 0 04 mg kg in treated wastewater and 16 56 0 04 mg kg in well water with regard to the concentration of micronutrients and heavy metals given in table 3 important differences were not seen between the plots used in the three treatments concentrations of fe zn mn and cu were less than 0 09 ppm for all soils irrigated with water of the three different qualities the poor concentration of micronutrients in soil is consistent with the general concept of sandy soils the concentration of co cr ni pb and al were constant throughout the study and relatively below or equal to 0 03 ppm in the soils of three water treatments 4 3 effect of irrigation water quality on alfalfa medicago sativa l crop 4 3 1 growth parameters the biomass production of alfalfa as an animal feed irrigated by the three water treatments fig 1 a d was determined as average leaf area plant length fresh weight and dry weight the best growth on average leaf area was noted with the raw wastewater irrigation followed by the treated wastewater irrigation during the three crop seasons whereas low growth has been noted with well water irrigation treatments as shown in fig 1a at the end of each crop season we noted a decrease of the average leaf area irrigated by well water while average leaf area of alfalfa irrigated by raw and treated wastewater was still growing and achieved 147 2 79 and 134 2 27 cm2 respectively moreover wastewater irrigation positively affected alfalfa length a significant increase was recorded in alfalfa from the raw and treated wastewater plots during all crops seasons fig 1b irrigation with raw and treated wastewater increased alfalfa lengths to about 109 2 67 cm and 99 88 2 45 cm respectively however alfalfa length didn t exceed 43 88 1 14 cm when irrigated with well water furthermore the production of dry weight of alfalfa showed no significant effect when using well water compared to irrigation with raw and treated wastewater during crop seasons as depicted in fig 1c whereas a significant difference in fresh weight fig 1d was noted between alfalfa irrigated by raw and treated wastewater compared to well water 4 3 2 biochemical parameters fig 2 a indicates the effect of irrigation water quality on stomatal conductance of alfalfa leaves the variation in stomatal conductance was dictated by the opening and closing of the stomata results showed that plants irrigated by raw wastewater had a lower stomatal conductance value 8 84 0 25 mmol m2 s than plants irrigated with treated wastewater and well water no great difference was shown between the stomatal conductance average values obtained for alfalfa irrigated by treated wastewater 15 65 0 39 mmol m2 s and alfalfa irrigated by well water 17 89 0 17 mmol m2 s during the irrigation period with different water quality alfalfa developed different behaviors in terms of the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii fv fm the fv fm bioindicator has a reference value of 0 8 in a healthy plant fig 2b the results obtained showed that the application of raw wastewater negatively affected the activity of the photosystem ii of plants by the reduction of fv fm ratio 0 5 0 03 whereas the fv fm ratio of plants control was normal moreover the plants irrigated by the treated wastewater 0 76 0 01 remained within the tolerance interval fig 2c indicates the effect of domestic wastewater and well water on total chlorophyll contents results show that raw wastewater led to a significant reduction in the total chlorophyll of plants with a value of 20 37 0 72 μg g the alfalfa irrigated by treated wastewater showed an almost similar content of total chlorophyll as did alfalfa irrigated by well water 33 05 0 66 and 31 86 0 28 μg g respectively in addition increased wastewater irrigation induced an increase in proline accumulation in plants fig 2d higher accumulation of proline content was recorded in plants irrigated with raw wastewater which reached 91 25 2 53 μg g while in the plants irrigated with treated wastewater and well water this value did not exceed 20 17 0 90 and 23 09 0 75 μg g respectively furthermore alfalfa irrigated with raw wastewater accumulated more sugar content 4 0 14 μg g than alfalfa irrigated with treated wastewater and well water fig 2e 2 24 0 10 and 2 05 0 05 μg g respectively domestic wastewater application significantly affected the content of n p k ca and na of alfalfa fig 3 plants irrigated with raw wastewater had the highest macronutrients contents followed by plants irrigated with treated wastewater much less amounts of the major macronutrients were determined in plants irrigated with well water the micronutrient contents fe zn mn and cu of alfalfa treated by water of the three different qualities are shown in fig 3 these micronutrients are necessary for plant nutrition only if they are required by the crops in much lower quantities compared to macronutrients the metrics indicate that the micronutrient content uptake by alfalfa receiving raw wastewater treatments yielded the highest content of fe 254 92 0 23 mn 59 94 0 18 zn 51 25 0 36 and cu 16 0 12 mg kg which could inhibit the correct development of alfalfa metabolism 4 3 3 enzymatic activity the activities of pod cat and mda mostly increased in plants grown with the application of the raw wastewater fig 4 a c the activities of pod and cat were stimulated by raw wastewater irrigation and reached 12 38 0 10 and 547 11 28 91 μmol mg respectively by contrast when the plants were irrigated with treated wastewater po and cat activities were 6 97 0 09 and 325 10 9 53 μmol mg respectively these results were close to that obtained by the control 6 83 0 07 and 344 36 9 70 μmol mg respectively fig 4a b treated wastewater enhanced enzymatic activities content tested in plants fig 4c oxidative damage of lipids peroxidation was evaluated by quantifying the mda content in alfalfa which is an indicator of peroxidation of cell membrane lipids turton et al 1997 malondialdehyde mda content in alfalfa increased when the plants were irrigated with raw wastewater 1 21 0 08 μmol mg and decreased significantly when the plants were irrigated with treated wastewater and well water 0 42 0 06 and 0 30 0 06 μmol mg respectively 5 discussion raw wastewater has higher values for chemical properties these metrics are in compliance with results obtained by castro et al 2013 the domestic wastewater raw and treated contains considerable amount of nutrients which are necessary for increasing crop growth and soil fertility el nahhal et al 2013 furthermore the nitrate content was significantly higher in well water compared to raw and or treated wastewater the well water was nitrogen phosphorus potassium npk fortified which meant that the nitrate quantity was reduced to ammonium hydroxide due to the aerobic condition when it became wastewater for that reason a relatively weak quantity of nitrate is available in domestic wastewater the analysis for heavy metals in water samples showed that fe zn mn cu co ni and pb were well within the standard limits moroccan standards 2006 for wastewater used for agricultural irrigation the results of fecal bacteria helminth eggs and salmonella sp in treated wastewater were in compliance with the who recommendation who 2006 and with moroccan standards on irrigation water quality for feed crops moroccan standards 2006 the slight decrease of soil ph could be explained by the high organic matter content of the raw wastewater and the secretion of organic acids in soils which is in accordance with the metrics of khai et al 2008 the inconsistency in wastewater irrigation effects on soil ph was also reported by other researchers soil salinity evaluated as ec of the 1 5 soil extract in ds m was highest with raw wastewater irrigation due to the accumulation of less soluble salts in the top soil layer which is in line with the results of el nahhal et al 2013 where they found a higher ec in the top soil layer and several levels lower in the deeper layer given the fact that this salinity could be built up in soil and crops through the continuous long term application of treated wastewater in irrigation their periodic surveillance should be an essential component of wastewater reuse management mohammad and mazahreh 2003 found that soil ec increased following long term wastewater irrigation 10years compared with soil irrigated with drinking water and they attributed this increase to the original high level of tds of the wastewater in addition rusan et al 2007 stated that long term wastewater irrigation for 10 5 and 2 years increased salts in the soil continuous accumulation of salts in the topsoil will negatively simulate the activity of soil microorganisms plant growth and soil productivity garcia and hernandez 1996 the organic matter content of the soils revealed similarities with n content although the increase in organic matter and nitrogen in soils after wastewater use was attributed directly to the contents of organic compounds and nutrients in the wastewater applied a similar result was reported by kiziloglu et al 2008 many studies including long and short term investigations declared that soil fertility arises as a consequence of the application of wastewater and sewage sludge chakrabarti 1995 manicas et al 1998 the exchangeable cations na k ca and available p were large in the soils irrigated with wastewater this is probably due to the high nutrients supplied by the domestic wastewater these findings were in agreement with the boruah and hazarika 2010 results as the available exchangeable levels were highest in wastewater irrigated soil other investigations reported that using wastewater irrigation increase n p and k in a quantity equal to 4 10 and 8 times that of the fertilizer rates advised for forage crops burns et al 1985 rusan et al 2007 found in their experiment that the concentration of n p and k on the soil irrigated with wastewater increased with the longer period of wastewater uses and this increase in the top soil was attributed to their high level in the wastewater application with regard to the fluctuation in the chemical composition of the domestic wastewater monitoring of domestic wastewater reuses must take into account the exchangeable cations content prior to establishment of the rate of domestic wastewater uses wastewater irrigation had no significant effect on soil micronutrients and or heavy metals during the crop seasons it was observed that there were low contents of heavy metals in soil which makes them less available to plants due to their complex compounds in organic matter sauve et al 2000 similar results were reported by rusan et al 2007 which reported that the levels of the soil pb and cd were not affected by the domestic wastewater irrigation regardless of period of wastewater irrigation nor on soil deeper layers on the other hand siebe 1998 found that the concentration of heavy metals in the top soil after 80 years of irrigation by wastewater were higher than the soil irrigated with well water other researchers found an increase in soil micronutrients with wastewater irrigation mainly in the top soil compared to the deeper layer brar et al 2002 rusan et al 2007 reported an accumulation of micronutrients with wastewater irrigation for a long period in the top soil on the other hand castro et al 2013 reported that there is no variation between soil micronutrients and heavy metal concentrations for fields irrigated with treated wastewater and for fields irrigated with fresh water it should be declared that improperly managed wastewater irrigation notably under long duration could lead to toxicity problems by high concentrations of nutrient and heavy metals accumulation and decay of soil properties and plant quality the treated wastewater from the tidili wwtp elfanssi et al 2018 used in this study was rich in nitrogen and phosphorus content which promoted the high growth parameters of alfalfa during the three crop seasons by observing the effect of irrigation water quality on the biomass production of alfalfa as an animal feed over the three crop seasons it is obvious that the use of domestic wastewater favorably influenced the biomass compared to crop production in the control well water similar trends were observed by rusan et al 2007 who reported that barley irrigated with wastewater generated taller biomass than did barley grown with well water they attributed this increase to the nutrients provided with wastewater these results are similar to the findings of abegunrin et al 2013 who reported an increase in growth traits of cucumber irrigated with kitchen wastewater compared with the groundwater mojiri et al 2013 also added that irrigation with wastewater causes a significant increase of root length and shoot length of lepidium sativum than those irrigated with fresh water the reduction in the dry matter production of alfalfa irrigated by raw wastewater was explained by decreased control of water status khajeh hossini and powell 2003 nutritional disorder ghoulam et al 2002 slowing of protein synthesis disruption of membrane structure stability inhibition of enzyme activity blaha et al 2000 changes in cell wall extensibility that is related to its protein composition hasegawa et al 1984 reduction of photosynthetic capacity erice et al 2011 and alteration of hormonal metabolism wilkinson and davies 2002 alfalfa showed better adaptation to the quality of treated wastewater this conclusion follows as the plants benefited from the nutrients present in the treated wastewater especially nitrogen and phosphorus these nutrients contribute to plant growth compared to the relatively poor growth associated with well water water and salinity deficiency are parameters that limit stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity radhouane 2009 stomatal conductance is an indicator of the foliar transpiration rate significant decrease was observed in plants stomatal conductance by raw wastewater treatment thus showing a reduction in transpiration of alfalfa irrigated by raw wastewater additionally the application of raw wastewater had a negative effect on the activity of photosystem ii by reducing the maximum quantum yield fv fm consequently and on the basis of these results raw wastewater has an effect on the effectiveness of psii photosystem ii which uses light for photochemical conversion and also has an effect on the photosynthetic activity in general decline in total chlorophyll contents observed with increasing raw wastewater application could be attributed to stomatal factors this confirmed that the chlorophyll content remained higher after irrigating with treated wastewater and that the latter did not have an inhibiting effect on the photosynthetic activity of the plants in the study the reduction in fv fm ratio in plants due to wastewater application was likely due to the deterioration of chlorophyll under saline conditions ganivea et al 1998 indeed the results showed that reduction in the maximum quantum yield was linked with decreasing total chlorophyll content the reduction in photosystem ii activity and total chlorophyll contents have detrimental impact on plant growth nasir khan et al 2007 increased raw wastewater irrigation caused a high accumulation of proline and soluble sugars contents in alfalfa plants considering the high production of proline as a leading indicator of physiological stress in plants it can be deduced that the treated wastewater did not cause a disorder in the physiological state of alfalfa as did raw wastewater additionally it gives a prediction of the molarity and the osmolyte content of the treated water it has been demonstrated that there was no significant effect of soluble sugar content between treated wastewater plants and well water plants this confirmed yet again the critical physiological state of the crop their accumulation is an indicator of ionic imbalance and excessive toxic ion molecular signaling is triggered to compensate for this and degrades the reserve sugar starch by generating soluble sugars able to retain water in the cells and keep a reasonable level of hydration this further underlines the importance of using treated wastewater in the irrigation of crops enhancement of plant macronutrient content with domestic wastewater irrigation indicates that wastewater irrigation supplied the soil with these nutrients which improved plant growth and soil fertility however macronutrient content should be managed regularly to avoid its accumulation to critical contents that might impact its quality for animal feeds the results of this experiment showed that the soils treated by well water and domestic wastewater did not feature a significantly different content of heavy metals which is to be expected as those parameters along with plant uptake take several years to change enzymatic activities pod cat of alfalfa irrigated by treated wastewater were close to that irrigated by well water this confirms the healthy physiological state of alfalfa similar results were reported by zafar et al 2016 who observed an increment of pod and cat activity in pumpkin tomato and okra irrigated with 50 of sewage water these two enzymes constitute the arsenal of cellular detoxification and their proportions are dependent on the plant s physiological state additionally they play a defensive role against oxidative stress and are indicators of metal uptake radotic et al 2000 our results showed that the application of raw wastewater for alfalfa irrigation was adversely affecting the membrane lipid system in the plant however irrigation with treated wastewater didn t increase mda content secretion which indicates that alfalfa grown in the soils irrigated by treated wastewater did not undergo oxidative stress this finding is compatible with results obtained by zafar et al 2016 who observed a high mda content in pumpkin 49 tomato 117 and okra 111 under 100 irrigation with sewage water in the present work the amount of enzymatic activity in alfalfa indicates that the antioxidant system was not damaged by the use of treated wastewater in irrigation in addition these results proved the high capacity of adaptation and growth of alfalfa under treated wastewater treatment conditions chen et al 2015 showed similar response patterns of the antioxidant enzymatic activities with high proportions of mine tailings 6 conclusion the results of this experiment show that soils irrigated with raw wastewater contain high levels of physicochemical parameters which are dangerous to plants if they exceed a certain limit the values of health risks and heavy metal parameters analyzed in treated wastewater by constructed wetlands systems were significantly lower than the limit values allowed by the standards that control the use of treated wastewater in agricultural soil and crops compared to plants irrigated with well water plants irrigated with treated wastewater showed no great difference in biochemical parameters the treated wastewater did not reveal any disorder in the physiological proprieties of alfalfa the accumulation of heavy metals was not detected in the crop and the soil irrigated with water of the three different qualities domestic wastewater treated by a hybrid constructed wetlands system can be a valuable recycling technique for water scarcity in satisfying farmers demands and provides proof of the beneficial effect of a treated wastewater application to enzymatic activity in alfalfa it is necessary to mention that suitable management of treated domestic wastewater reuse in agriculture and periodic monitoring of soil and crop quality parameters are required for reliable and long periods acknowledgments this

11517,the aim of this experiment is to evaluate the effect of raw and treated wastewater irrigation on soil and plants in comparison to well water three plots planted with medicago sativa l were irrigated using water of three different qualities over a period of 9 months covering three crop seasons physicochemical and microbial parameters were analyzed in water and soil agro physiological biochemical and antioxidant enzyme traits in the crops were also assessed results of agro physiological parameters show a positive effect on alfalfa irrigated with domestic wastewater compared to well water while biochemical parameters stomatal conductance chlorophyll fluorescence and total chlorophyll content were adversely affected in alfalfa irrigated with raw wastewater as compared to treated and well water the plants irrigated with raw wastewater accumulate more proline and sugar than plants irrigated with treated wastewater and well water the prevalence of antioxidant enzymes pod cat and mda in the plants increased with raw wastewater irrigation however it remained within the tolerance levels in both plants irrigated by treated wastewater and well water all three levels of water treatment demonstrated low content of heavy metals in the soil indicating a lack of availability for the plants moreover the use of treated wastewater improves physicochemical properties and fertility of the soil compared to well water and enhances crop productivity keywords wastewater re use alfalfa irrigation biochemical parameters enzymatic activity 1 introduction nowadays there is a constant increase in the need for water global population growth has coincided with increases in agricultural and industrial activities aiming to focus on food needs along with frequent droughts and erratic rainfall in recent years the consumption of water resources is at all time high in arid and semi arid countries angin et al 2005 domestic wastewater can be cheaper than pumping freshwater and is considered an interesting alternative source for irrigation in developing countries al rashed and sherif 2000 mohammad and mazahreh 2003 treating wastewater before its re use in irrigation can decrease the health risks related to this practice thus under controlled conditions it has been suggested that treated wastewater is used for certain types of agricultural irrigation al lahham et al 2003 known for its high nutritional quality high protein content and its fertile effect on soil alfalfa medicago sativa l is a popular feed crop worldwide huyghe 2003 moreover the plant reduces the use of chemical fertilizers such as rhizobia symbiotic nitrogen fixing it also contributes to the incorporation of nitrogen in pastoral ecosystems zahia and elajudie 2001 in morocco the plant is grown on over 100 000 ha representing about 22 of the total acreage devoted to fodder crops bouizgaren et al 2011 and due its high productivity operational flexibility and high quality it produces 50 of fodder units bouizgaren 2007 finally many rural populations use it as a source of livestock nutrition as it is a resilient plant able to thrive in both oases and mountains abegunrin et al 2013 studied the effects of kitchen wastewater rainwater and groundwater irrigation on cucumber cucumis sativus growth parameters and soil properties in southwestern nigeria and concluded that the soil condition was not adversely impacted by the use of kitchen wastewater as compared to groundwater or rainwater whereas there were some negative effects on cucumber growth parameters castro et al 2013 reported the effects of treated domestic wastewater reuse for irrigating lettuce on soil properties and compared that to the effects of using drinking quality irrigation water on a lettuce crop lactuca sativa l they recorded that the main negative effect of using treated wastewater was the increase in salt and sodium contents in the soil and irrigation by wastewater was not sufficient to meet the nutritive demands of the lettuce due to a weak uptake of certain necessary elements produced by the accumulation of na pereira et al 2011 investigated the impacts of increasing wastewater irrigation rates on soil properties under tropical conditions and found decreases in soil acidity from land irrigated with urban wastewater the studies done by kouraa et al 2001 in morocco suggested that there is a clear improvement of culture production for potatoes and lettuce from soil irrigated by treated wastewater rusan et al 2006 evaluated the impact of long term wastewater irrigation on soil and crop quality parameters and observed that the soil and crop parameters for land irrigated by wastewater are significantly affected over the long term several researchers have studied the effect of wastewater reuse on certain agronomic aspects of plants such as agricultural yield however there are few reports that explore the deep physiological and biochemical effect of irrigation by raw and or treated domestic wastewaters on crops such a combination of studies would help to understand the real effects of treated wastewater use at a molecular level our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different quality irrigation waters on soil chemical properties and on growth traits of alfalfa and to identify the extent of the physiological and biochemical processes of medicago sativa l under the conditions presented by the moroccan context 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and test planning the plant material used to evaluate the effect of raw and treated wastewater in comparison with well water control is a breed of moroccan alfalfa medicago sativa l called tata it comes from the southwestern oasis as well as the high atlas mountains of morocco this crop has been cultivated for centuries and remains widely used by farmers in traditional agro ecosystems farissi et al 2011 this fact means that it is well suited for adaptation to local growing patterns and habitats the

usa 2012 the means were compared using tukey s test at the significance level of α 0 05 4 results 4 1 characteristics of various irrigation waters tested the physicochemical characteristics of water of the three different qualities used in this experiment were shown in table 1 the levels of bod5 cod and tss tended to be nil in well water whereas their values were quite high in raw and treated wastewater in general the ph values of the three kinds of waters fall within the neutral range table 1 well water had the lowest values for ph with a value of 7 14 0 01 it was noticed that electrical conductivity ec carbonate bicarbonate total phosphorus and total nitrogen had significantly higher values in raw wastewater than in treated wastewater whereas low values had been noted in well water furthermore the nitrate content was significantly higher in well water compared to raw and or treated wastewater the sodium adsorption ratio sar shows the relative activity of sodium ions in exchange reactions with the soil the sar ratio evaluates the relative concentration of sodium na to ca and mg the sar value in domestic wastewater and well water was less than 3 indicating that there is no risk of a permeability problem for the soil and the hazards of sodification are nominal ayers and westcot 1985 wastewater contained a significant quantity of nutrients that are essential for plant growth and soil fertility on the other hand in well water the na k ca2 and mg2 concentrations were far lower than in raw and treated wastewater the chlorides content cl showed significant differences between the domestic wastewater raw treated wastewater and the well water its concentration was considerably higher in domestic wastewater than in well water the mean concentration of heavy metals in domestic wastewater raw treated and well water ranged from 0 001 to 0 015 ppm indicating their low contents in water samples table 1 whereas as cr be al were not detected in the water of the three different qualities tested for crop irrigation the average content of fecal bacteria in raw wastewater was consistently higher than moroccan standards which is to be expected table 2 the average content of fecal bacteria in treated wastewater were 382cfu 100 ml for tc 369cfu 100 ml for fc and 229 cfu 100 ml for fs a quantitative study of helminth eggs and salmonella sp in irrigation water is shown in table 2 raw wastewater contained a helminth eggs concentration of 17 0 01 eggs l and for salmonnella sp a content of 4 log unit these concentrations greatly exceeded the values recommended by moroccan standards to irrigate crops that can be eaten uncooked 0egg l for helminth eggs and 0 salmonnella 5l moroccan standards 2006 however well water and treated wastewater were free from helminth eggs and salmonella sp and so corresponded to the moroccan standards for water irrigation of crops that can be eaten uncooked 4 2 effect of water quality on irrigated soil table 3 showed the characteristics of the soil after the application of the water of three different qualities the soil texture consisted of 70 85 sand 9 25 clay and 19 89 silt classified as sandy according to the usda classification the lowest values of ph were noted in soil irrigated with raw wastewater 6 90 compared to the soil irrigated by treated wastewater 7 23 or well water 7 61 it is noted that irrigated soil with raw wastewater has a higher conductivity than well water and treated wastewater table 3 for raw wastewater it has a soil conductivity of 2 14 0 01 ds m which is equivalent to a very high salinity and thus a lower water quality on the other hand for treated wastewater the soil conductivity was 0 67 0 03 ds m which represents a low salinity which does not present a risk for crop yields and a fairly good water quality during the crop seasons as for well water 0 55 0 02 ds m also an increase of organic matter and n content was observed in soil irrigated with raw wastewater 1 97 and 0 089 respectively compared with the other irrigated soils soils organic matter and n content decreased sharply with treated wastewater irrigation 1 84 and 0 075 respectively compared to raw wastewater soils table 3 the lowest contents were noticed in soil irrigated with well water 0 71 and 0 050 respectively the exchangeable na k and ca were considerably increased in soils irrigated with raw wastewater compared to the soils irrigated with treated wastewater and or well water table 3 available p concentrations were more significant in soils irrigated with raw wastewater 26 17 0 68 mg kg than those of the other treatment soils 18 14 0 04 mg kg in treated wastewater and 16 56 0 04 mg kg in well water with regard to the concentration of micronutrients and heavy metals given in table 3 important differences were not seen between the plots used in the three treatments concentrations of fe zn mn and cu were less than 0 09 ppm for all soils irrigated with water of the three different qualities the poor concentration of micronutrients in soil is consistent with the general concept of sandy soils the concentration of co cr ni pb and al were constant throughout the study and relatively below or equal to 0 03 ppm in the soils of three water treatments 4 3 effect of irrigation water quality on alfalfa medicago sativa l crop 4 3 1 growth parameters the biomass production of alfalfa as an animal feed irrigated by the three water treatments fig 1 a d was determined as average leaf area plant length fresh weight and dry weight the best growth on average leaf area was noted with the raw wastewater irrigation followed by the treated wastewater irrigation during the three crop seasons whereas low growth has been noted with well water irrigation treatments as shown in fig 1a at the end of each crop season we noted a decrease of the average leaf area irrigated by well water while average leaf area of alfalfa irrigated by raw and treated wastewater was still growing and achieved 147 2 79 and 134 2 27 cm2 respectively moreover wastewater irrigation positively affected alfalfa length a significant increase was recorded in alfalfa from the raw and treated wastewater plots during all crops seasons fig 1b irrigation with raw and treated wastewater increased alfalfa lengths to about 109 2 67 cm and 99 88 2 45 cm respectively however alfalfa length didn t exceed 43 88 1 14 cm when irrigated with well water furthermore the production of dry weight of alfalfa showed no significant effect when using well water compared to irrigation with raw and treated wastewater during crop seasons as depicted in fig 1c whereas a significant difference in fresh weight fig 1d was noted between alfalfa irrigated by raw and treated wastewater compared to well water 4 3 2 biochemical parameters fig 2 a indicates the effect of irrigation water quality on stomatal conductance of alfalfa leaves the variation in stomatal conductance was dictated by the opening and closing of the stomata results showed that plants irrigated by raw wastewater had a lower stomatal conductance value 8 84 0 25 mmol m2 s than plants irrigated with treated wastewater and well water no great difference was shown between the stomatal conductance average values obtained for alfalfa irrigated by treated wastewater 15 65 0 39 mmol m2 s and alfalfa irrigated by well water 17 89 0 17 mmol m2 s during the irrigation period with different water quality alfalfa developed different behaviors in terms of the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii fv fm the fv fm bioindicator has a reference value of 0 8 in a healthy plant fig 2b the results obtained showed that the application of raw wastewater negatively affected the activity of the photosystem ii of plants by the reduction of fv fm ratio 0 5 0 03 whereas the fv fm ratio of plants control was normal moreover the plants irrigated by the treated wastewater 0 76 0 01 remained within the tolerance interval fig 2c indicates the effect of domestic wastewater and well water on total chlorophyll contents results show that raw wastewater led to a significant reduction in the total chlorophyll of plants with a value of 20 37 0 72 μg g the alfalfa irrigated by treated wastewater showed an almost similar content of total chlorophyll as did alfalfa irrigated by well water 33 05 0 66 and 31 86 0 28 μg g respectively in addition increased wastewater irrigation induced an increase in proline accumulation in plants fig 2d higher accumulation of proline content was recorded in plants irrigated with raw wastewater which reached 91 25 2 53 μg g while in the plants irrigated with treated wastewater and well water this value did not exceed 20 17 0 90 and 23 09 0 75 μg g respectively furthermore alfalfa irrigated with raw wastewater accumulated more sugar content 4 0 14 μg g than alfalfa irrigated with treated wastewater and well water fig 2e 2 24 0 10 and 2 05 0 05 μg g respectively domestic wastewater application significantly affected the content of n p k ca and na of alfalfa fig 3 plants irrigated with raw wastewater had the highest macronutrients contents followed by plants irrigated with treated wastewater much less amounts of the major macronutrients were determined in plants irrigated with well water the micronutrient contents fe zn mn and cu of alfalfa treated by water of the three different qualities are shown in fig 3 these micronutrients are necessary for plant nutrition only if they are required by the crops in much lower quantities compared to macronutrients the metrics indicate that the micronutrient content uptake by alfalfa receiving raw wastewater treatments yielded the highest content of fe 254 92 0 23 mn 59 94 0 18 zn 51 25 0 36 and cu 16 0 12 mg kg which could inhibit the correct development of alfalfa metabolism 4 3 3 enzymatic activity the activities of pod cat and mda mostly increased in plants grown with the application of the raw wastewater fig 4 a c the activities of pod and cat were stimulated by raw wastewater irrigation and reached 12 38 0 10 and 547 11 28 91 μmol mg respectively by contrast when the plants were irrigated with treated wastewater po and cat activities were 6 97 0 09 and 325 10 9 53 μmol mg respectively these results were close to that obtained by the control 6 83 0 07 and 344 36 9 70 μmol mg respectively fig 4a b treated wastewater enhanced enzymatic activities content tested in plants fig 4c oxidative damage of lipids peroxidation was evaluated by quantifying the mda content in alfalfa which is an indicator of peroxidation of cell membrane lipids turton et al 1997 malondialdehyde mda content in alfalfa increased when the plants were irrigated with raw wastewater 1 21 0 08 μmol mg and decreased significantly when the plants were irrigated with treated wastewater and well water 0 42 0 06 and 0 30 0 06 μmol mg respectively 5 discussion raw wastewater has higher values for chemical properties these metrics are in compliance with results obtained by castro et al 2013 the domestic wastewater raw and treated contains considerable amount of nutrients which are necessary for increasing crop growth and soil fertility el nahhal et al 2013 furthermore the nitrate content was significantly higher in well water compared to raw and or treated wastewater the well water was nitrogen phosphorus potassium npk fortified which meant that the nitrate quantity was reduced to ammonium hydroxide due to the aerobic condition when it became wastewater for that reason a relatively weak quantity of nitrate is available in domestic wastewater the analysis for heavy metals in water samples showed that fe zn mn cu co ni and pb were well within the standard limits moroccan standards 2006 for wastewater used for agricultural irrigation the results of fecal bacteria helminth eggs and salmonella sp in treated wastewater were in compliance with the who recommendation who 2006 and with moroccan standards on irrigation water quality for feed crops moroccan standards 2006 the slight decrease of soil ph could be explained by the high organic matter content of the raw wastewater and the secretion of organic acids in soils which is in accordance with the metrics of khai et al 2008 the inconsistency in wastewater irrigation effects on soil ph was also reported by other researchers soil salinity evaluated as ec of the 1 5 soil extract in ds m was highest with raw wastewater irrigation due to the accumulation of less soluble salts in the top soil layer which is in line with the results of el nahhal et al 2013 where they found a higher ec in the top soil layer and several levels lower in the deeper layer given the fact that this salinity could be built up in soil and crops through the continuous long term application of treated wastewater in irrigation their periodic surveillance should be an essential component of wastewater reuse management mohammad and mazahreh 2003 found that soil ec increased following long term wastewater irrigation 10years compared with soil irrigated with drinking water and they attributed this increase to the original high level of tds of the wastewater in addition rusan et al 2007 stated that long term wastewater irrigation for 10 5 and 2 years increased salts in the soil continuous accumulation of salts in the topsoil will negatively simulate the activity of soil microorganisms plant growth and soil productivity garcia and hernandez 1996 the organic matter content of the soils revealed similarities with n content although the increase in organic matter and nitrogen in soils after wastewater use was attributed directly to the contents of organic compounds and nutrients in the wastewater applied a similar result was reported by kiziloglu et al 2008 many studies including long and short term investigations declared that soil fertility arises as a consequence of the application of wastewater and sewage sludge chakrabarti 1995 manicas et al 1998 the exchangeable cations na k ca and available p were large in the soils irrigated with wastewater this is probably due to the high nutrients supplied by the domestic wastewater these findings were in agreement with the boruah and hazarika 2010 results as the available exchangeable levels were highest in wastewater irrigated soil other investigations reported that using wastewater irrigation increase n p and k in a quantity equal to 4 10 and 8 times that of the fertilizer rates advised for forage crops burns et al 1985 rusan et al 2007 found in their experiment that the concentration of n p and k on the soil irrigated with wastewater increased with the longer period of wastewater uses and this increase in the top soil was attributed to their high level in the wastewater application with regard to the fluctuation in the chemical composition of the domestic wastewater monitoring of domestic wastewater reuses must take into account the exchangeable cations content prior to establishment of the rate of domestic wastewater uses wastewater irrigation had no significant effect on soil micronutrients and or heavy metals during the crop seasons it was observed that there were low contents of heavy metals in soil which makes them less available to plants due to their complex compounds in organic matter sauve et al 2000 similar results were reported by rusan et al 2007 which reported that the levels of the soil pb and cd were not affected by the domestic wastewater irrigation regardless of period of wastewater irrigation nor on soil deeper layers on the other hand siebe 1998 found that the concentration of heavy metals in the top soil after 80 years of irrigation by wastewater were higher than the soil irrigated with well water other researchers found an increase in soil micronutrients with wastewater irrigation mainly in the top soil compared to the deeper layer brar et al 2002 rusan et al 2007 reported an accumulation of micronutrients with wastewater irrigation for a long period in the top soil on the other hand castro et al 2013 reported that there is no variation between soil micronutrients and heavy metal concentrations for fields irrigated with treated wastewater and for fields irrigated with fresh water it should be declared that improperly managed wastewater irrigation notably under long duration could lead to toxicity problems by high concentrations of nutrient and heavy metals accumulation and decay of soil properties and plant quality the treated wastewater from the tidili wwtp elfanssi et al 2018 used in this study was rich in nitrogen and phosphorus content which promoted the high growth parameters of alfalfa during the three crop seasons by observing the effect of irrigation water quality on the biomass production of alfalfa as an animal feed over the three crop seasons it is obvious that the use of domestic wastewater favorably influenced the biomass compared to crop production in the control well water similar trends were observed by rusan et al 2007 who reported that barley irrigated with wastewater generated taller biomass than did barley grown with well water they attributed this increase to the nutrients provided with wastewater these results are similar to the findings of abegunrin et al 2013 who reported an increase in growth traits of cucumber irrigated with kitchen wastewater compared with the groundwater mojiri et al 2013 also added that irrigation with wastewater causes a significant increase of root length and shoot length of lepidium sativum than those irrigated with fresh water the reduction in the dry matter production of alfalfa irrigated by raw wastewater was explained by decreased control of water status khajeh hossini and powell 2003 nutritional disorder ghoulam et al 2002 slowing of protein synthesis disruption of membrane structure stability inhibition of enzyme activity blaha et al 2000 changes in cell wall extensibility that is related to its protein composition hasegawa et al 1984 reduction of photosynthetic capacity erice et al 2011 and alteration of hormonal metabolism wilkinson and davies 2002 alfalfa showed better adaptation to the quality of treated wastewater this conclusion follows as the plants benefited from the nutrients present in the treated wastewater especially nitrogen and phosphorus these nutrients contribute to plant growth compared to the relatively poor growth associated with well water water and salinity deficiency are parameters that limit stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity radhouane 2009 stomatal conductance is an indicator of the foliar transpiration rate significant decrease was observed in plants stomatal conductance by raw wastewater treatment thus showing a reduction in transpiration of alfalfa irrigated by raw wastewater additionally the application of raw wastewater had a negative effect on the activity of photosystem ii by reducing the maximum quantum yield fv fm consequently and on the basis of these results raw wastewater has an effect on the effectiveness of psii photosystem ii which uses light for photochemical conversion and also has an effect on the photosynthetic activity in general decline in total chlorophyll contents observed with increasing raw wastewater application could be attributed to stomatal factors this confirmed that the chlorophyll content remained higher after irrigating with treated wastewater and that the latter did not have an inhibiting effect on the photosynthetic activity of the plants in the study the reduction in fv fm ratio in plants due to wastewater application was likely due to the deterioration of chlorophyll under saline conditions ganivea et al 1998 indeed the results showed that reduction in the maximum quantum yield was linked with decreasing total chlorophyll content the reduction in photosystem ii activity and total chlorophyll contents have detrimental impact on plant growth nasir khan et al 2007 increased raw wastewater irrigation caused a high accumulation of proline and soluble sugars contents in alfalfa plants considering the high production of proline as a leading indicator of physiological stress in plants it can be deduced that the treated wastewater did not cause a disorder in the physiological state of alfalfa as did raw wastewater additionally it gives a prediction of the molarity and the osmolyte content of the treated water it has been demonstrated that there was no significant effect of soluble sugar content between treated wastewater plants and well water plants this confirmed yet again the critical physiological state of the crop their accumulation is an indicator of ionic imbalance and excessive toxic ion molecular signaling is triggered to compensate for this and degrades the reserve sugar starch by generating soluble sugars able to retain water in the cells and keep a reasonable level of hydration this further underlines the importance of using treated wastewater in the irrigation of crops enhancement of plant macronutrient content with domestic wastewater irrigation indicates that wastewater irrigation supplied the soil with these nutrients which improved plant growth and soil fertility however macronutrient content should be managed regularly to avoid its accumulation to critical contents that might impact its quality for animal feeds the results of this experiment showed that the soils treated by well water and domestic wastewater did not feature a significantly different content of heavy metals which is to be expected as those parameters along with plant uptake take several years to change enzymatic activities pod cat of alfalfa irrigated by treated wastewater were close to that irrigated by well water this confirms the healthy physiological state of alfalfa similar results were reported by zafar et al 2016 who observed an increment of pod and cat activity in pumpkin tomato and okra irrigated with 50 of sewage water these two enzymes constitute the arsenal of cellular detoxification and their proportions are dependent on the plant s physiological state additionally they play a defensive role against oxidative stress and are indicators of metal uptake radotic et al 2000 our results showed that the application of raw wastewater for alfalfa irrigation was adversely affecting the membrane lipid system in the plant however irrigation with treated wastewater didn t increase mda content secretion which indicates that alfalfa grown in the soils irrigated by treated wastewater did not undergo oxidative stress this finding is compatible with results obtained by zafar et al 2016 who observed a high mda content in pumpkin 49 tomato 117 and okra 111 under 100 irrigation with sewage water in the present work the amount of enzymatic activity in alfalfa indicates that the antioxidant system was not damaged by the use of treated wastewater in irrigation in addition these results proved the high capacity of adaptation and growth of alfalfa under treated wastewater treatment conditions chen et al 2015 showed similar response patterns of the antioxidant enzymatic activities with high proportions of mine tailings 6 conclusion the results of this experiment show that soils irrigated with raw wastewater contain high levels of physicochemical parameters which are dangerous to plants if they exceed a certain limit the values of health risks and heavy metal parameters analyzed in treated wastewater by constructed wetlands systems were significantly lower than the limit values allowed by the standards that control the use of treated wastewater in agricultural soil and crops compared to plants irrigated with well water plants irrigated with treated wastewater showed no great difference in biochemical parameters the treated wastewater did not reveal any disorder in the physiological proprieties of alfalfa the accumulation of heavy metals was not detected in the crop and the soil irrigated with water of the three different qualities domestic wastewater treated by a hybrid constructed wetlands system can be a valuable recycling technique for water scarcity in satisfying farmers demands and provides proof of the beneficial effect of a treated wastewater application to enzymatic activity in alfalfa it is necessary to mention that suitable management of treated domestic wastewater reuse in agriculture and periodic monitoring of soil and crop quality parameters are required for reliable and long periods acknowledgments this

11518,we evaluated the suitability of scheduling a regulated deficit irrigation strategy in a hedgerow olive orchard with high plant density from leaf turgor related measurements measurements were made for two consecutive years at an olive orchard with 1667 arbequina trees per hectare where we had two deficit irrigation treatments 45rdicc and 45rditp plus a full irrigation as a control the two 45rdi treatments consisted on applying the same regulated deficit irrigation strategy aimed to supply a total of 45 of the irrigation needs the 45rdicc treatment however was scheduled with the crop coefficient approach while the 45rditp treatment was scheduled with an irrigation scheduling approach based on leaf turgor related measurements first suggested by padilla díaz et al 2016 agric water manage 164 28 37 they worked at the orchard in 2014 and made a preliminary evaluation of the irrigation scheduling approach by comparing 45rditp versus 45rdicc in terms of irrigation dose and frequency predawn and midday stem water potential ψ stem and the fruit yields of each treatment in this work we considered the same variables as well as maximum daily values of stomatal conductance and co2 net assimilation the seasonal courses of the number of internodes in current year shoots leaf area and oil accumulation in the fruits and total fruit and oil yields all those variables were monitored both in 2014 and 2015 and we found no differences between the 45rditp and the 45rdicc treatments for any of them the irrigation amounts applied to each treatment differed occasionally but the total water supplies were similar to both 45rdi treatments our results therefore confirm the suitability of the irrigation scheduling approach proposed by padilla díaz et al 2016 to apply regulated deficit irrigation in commercial hedgerow olive orchards we found additional evidence for the 15 changes on the irrigation amount recommended by the irrigation scheduling approach as being suitable for the orchard conditions caution must be taken when applying this approach to other olive orchards since the relations between the tree water status and the shape of the daily curves recorded with the zim probes may depend on the cultivar and orchard conditions keywords irrigation management stem water potential irrigation water productivity leaf patch clamp pressure probe crop

for mediterranean areas ipcc 2014 we are facing the challenge therefore of producing more food fibber and biofuel with less water and greater atmospheric demand among the responses of the scientific community to that challenge are the development of new irrigation strategies and effective tools for monitoring plant water stress and scheduling irrigation concerning the irrigation strategy that can vary from full irrigation irrigating with enough water to replace 100 of the crop water needs to supplementary or complementary irrigation just one or very few irrigation events supplying a small fraction of the crop water needs between both the user can choose among a variety of deficit irrigation strategies fereres and soriano 2007 iniesta et al 2009 ruiz sanchez et al 2010 martín vertedor et al 2011 gómez del campo 2013 fernández 2014a for assessing water stress and scheduling irrigation the user can choose among different methods based on soil atmosphere or plant measurements the latter are widely used in fruit trees including olive in fact a variety of methods are available from the conventional non automated methods for assessing leaf or stem water status and stomatal conductance or photosynthesis to methods with systems that run continuously and automatically based on measurements related to sap flow trunk diameter and leaf turgor pressure among other plant variables jones 2004 2007 ben gal et al 2010 fernández 2014b many of those methods apart from running automatically and being easily implemented with data transmission systems for a remote access to the recorded data through the internet can be combined with remote imagery for a precise irrigation of large orchards gonzalez dugo et al 2015 gago et al 2015 bellvert et al 2016 fernández 2017 the most suitable irrigation strategies for fruit trees orchards in arid and semi arid areas are deficit irrigation strategies specifically designed to match both the crop characteristics and main environment conditions rallo et al 2016 deficit irrigation is especially suitable to hedgerow orchards with high tree densities also called super high density shd orchards where excessive growth must be avoided by controlling water and fertilizer supplies for shd olive orchards regulated deficit irrigation rdi has been reported as one of the best deficit irrigation strategies fernández et al 2013 fernández 2014b several experiments at the sanabria orchard a commercial shd arbequina orchard near seville southwest spain representative of those in many other mediterranean olive growing areas proved the suitability of the 45rdi strategy for shd olive orchards ndez et al 2013 2017 hernandez santana et al 2017 the 45rdi strategy consists in irrigating daily to replace 100 of irrigation needs in three periods of the annual growing cycle these periods named as periods 1 2 and 3 are those in which olive is most sensitive to water stress fernández et al 2013 fernández 2014a in between those periods one or two irrigation events per week are recommended as reported by fernández et al 2013 and padilla díaz et al 2016 the total water supplies in between the three mentioned periods amounted to 15 30 of the irrigation needs depending of the time of the year the total water supply for the whole irrigation season in this 45rdi strategy aims at 45 of the irrigation needs the successful application of any rdi strategy requires effective irrigation scheduling for olive different water stress indicators and related systems to schedule irrigation based on sap flow trunk diameter variations and leaf turgor related measurements have been assessed fernández 2014a among them the zim system which uses the leaf patch clamp pressure lpcp or also called zim probe zimmermann et al 2008 has been proved to be useful to assess water stress in commercial orchards fernández et al 2011 fernández 2014a the zim probe records the output pressure p p a variable inversely correlated with the leaf turgor pressure zimmermann et al 2008 a variable closely related to water stress fernández 2014b egea et al 2017 analysed the financial feasibility of scheduling irrigation at the sanabria orchard from the three mentioned plant based type of measurements and concluded that the zim system is the best approach to evaluate the potential of the zim system to assess water stress and to schedule irrigation fernández et al 2011 and ehrenberger et al 2012 analysed the relationship between midday stem water potential ψ stem a variable widely accepted as a reliable indicator of plant water status and the p p values recorded with the zim probe in olive trees they found that the shape of the daily p p curve changes dramatically with the level of water stress and defined three different states or shapes of the curve typical of certain ψ stem levels state 1 for ψ stem 1 2 mpa state 2 for 1 2 ψ stem 1 7 mpa and state 3 for ψ stem 1 7 mpa similar studies has been made for other olive cultivars and environments marino et al 2016 and for other species martínez gimeno et al 2017 the potential for scheduling irrigation from a visual analysis of the curve from which the orchardist easily identifies the state of the p p daily curve and therefore the level of water stress of the trees was already suggested by fernández et al 2011 and ehrenberger et al 2012 this was used by padilla díaz et al 2016 to derive an irrigation scheduling approach for the sanabria olive orchard and to run preliminary evaluation measurements during the irrigation season of 2014 they had two regulated deficit irrigation treatments 45rdicc and 45rditp in both of them they applied the regulated deficit irrigation strategy proposed for shd olive orchards by fernández et al 2013 and fernández 2014a for 45rdicc they scheduled irrigation with the crop coefficient approach while for the 45rditp they designed and applied an irrigation scheduling approach based on the visualization of the daily p p curves recorded with zim sensors see section 2 1 for details they evaluated the performance of their irrigation scheduling approach by comparing 45rdicc versus 45rditp in terms of the irrigation amounts relative extractable water in the soil stem water potential at both predawn and midday and fruit yield padilla díaz et al 2016 confirmed the relationships between the level of plant water stress and the shape states of the daily p p curves first reported by fernández et al 2011 and ehrenberger et al 2012 and concluded that the irrigation scheduling approach applied to the 45rditp treatment showed a performance as good as that of the crop coefficient approach allowing for precise irrigation scheduling in orchards for which the crop coefficient values were unknown they however were concerned on the empirical assumptions of their irrigation scheduling approach e g changing the irrigation amount by 15 as well on their evaluation relying on a reduced number of variables monitored for a single irrigation season the aim of this work was to apply the irrigations scheduling approach proposed by padilla díaz et al 2016 for two consecutive years at the sanabria orchard and to study a wider range of variables with the aim of further assessing the advantages and limitations of the irrigations scheduling approach based on leaf turgor related measurements as compared to the crop coefficient approach we applied the same 45rditp and 45rdicc treatments they used and stem water potential stomatal conductance and co2 net assimilation as well as the number of internodes in shoots of the current year leaf area fruit yield and seasonal oil accumulation in the fruit and total oil yield were monitored on representative trees of each treatment both in 2014 and 2015 we also had a fully irrigated treatment as a control fi treatment in which the trees were daily irrigated for the whole irrigation season to replace 100 of the irrigation needs 2 material and methods 2 1 orchard characteristics and irrigation management the orchard located at 25 km to the east of seville 37 15 n 5 48 w was planted in 2007 with one year old arbequina trees the trees were at the top of 0 4 m high ridges and at 4 m 1 5 m 1667 trees ha 1 measurements described below were made during the irrigation seasons of 2014 and 2015 when the trees were 8 and 9 years old respectively the hedgerows were kept ca 2 10 m wide and ca 2 5 m high by pruning in january we applied the same irrigation treatments described by padilla díaz et al 2016 i e fi 45rdicc and 45rditp and with the same layout four 12 m 6 m plots per treatment in a randomized block design basically daily irrigation was applied to the full irrigation fi trees during the whole irrigation season aimed to replace 100 of the irrigation needs every monday of the irrigation seasons the irrigation needs in were calculated as in etc p e being etc the crop evapotranspiration estimated from the crop coefficient approach and p e the effective precipitation estimated as 75 of precipitation recorded by the weather station in the orchard see padilla díaz et al 2016 for details on the k c and potential evapotranspiration values for the 45rdi trees we applied a regulated deficit irrigation strategy consisting on daily irrigation to replace 100 of the irrigation needs on the periods when the crop is most sensitive to water stress periods 1 2 and 3 shown in fig 1 of padilla díaz et al 2016 while reducing to one or two irrigation events per week in between those periods for both 45rdi treatments the irrigation supply for the whole irrigation season aimed to 45 of the irrigation needs the difference between 45rdicc and 45rditp was that in the 45rdicc treatment irrigation was scheduled from the crop coefficient approach while in the 45rditp treatment irrigation was scheduled from the state of the daily p p curves recorded with zim sensors in representative 45rditp trees according to the irrigation scheduling approach proposed by padilla díaz et al 2016 basically we clamped a zim probe in three 45rditp trees one per plot in three plots out of the four 45rditp plots in 2014 we did not irrigate on period 1 because rainfall was enough at that time of the year to replace the crop water needs in 2015 however we had to irrigate on that period still the irrigations amounts in period 1 in 2015 were calculated with the crop coefficient approach for both the 45rdicc and 45rditp treatments because at that time we were still installing and checking the zim probes and related system at the beginning of both period 2 and period 3 all the 45rditp trees showed moderate to severe levels of water stress because of the lack of rain and the reduced irrigation applied on the weeks before each period consequently most zim probes were in state 3 we then supplied daily irrigation amounts of 120 of the irrigation needs on the first three days of both period 2 and 3 this was enough for the daily p p curves recorded in those trees to change from state 2 or 3 to state 1 for the rest of the period we adjusted irrigation to the 45rditp trees according to the state of the p p curves and the 3 day weather forecast given through internet thus when one out of the three p p curves changed from state 1 to state 2 and the weather forecast announced increasing atmospheric demand irrigation was increased by 15 if atmospheric demand was expected to decrease or the most sensitive instrumented 45rditp tree did not show a change from state 2 to state 3 the irrigation dose was not modified in case of a change from state 2 to state 3 or a second tree changing from state 1 to state 2 irrigation was increased by 15 when the state shown by the p p curves indicated a recovery of the tree water status irrigation was decreased also by 15 outside of periods 2 and 3 when irrigation was applied just once or twice per week irrigation amounts were applied according to fig 1 in padilla díaz et al 2016 on those days i e on the weeks before in between and after periods 2 and 3 we used the irrigation needs calculated for the fi treatments with the crop coefficient approach to derive the required irrigation amounts for the 45rditp trees in 2014 the irrigation season started on april 26th day of year doy 116 and ended on november 20th doy 324 in 2015 the irrigation season lasted from april 8th doy 98 to october 25th doy 298 the calculated irrigation doses were input in an irrigation controller agronic 2000 sistemes electrònics pro grés s a lleida spain and water was applied through a single pipe per tree row with three 2 l h 1 drippers per tree 0 5 m apart fertilizers were injected once per week into the irrigation system to match the tree requirements fernández et al 2013 all treatments received the same amounts of fertilizers climate in the area is typically mediterranean with mild wet winters and little precipitation during the irrigation season may october average values of precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration eto in the area are 522 7 mm and 1531 5 mm respectively period 2002 2015 the soil had a 0 4 m deep sandy layer over a clayey layer with low conductance most roots were in the top sandy layer details in fernández et al 2013 2 2 soil plant and weather measurements all measurements described in this section and in section 2 3 were made on both 2014 and 2015 from the 24 trees of each plot measurements were made in the central 8 trees to avoid any border effect soil water status was assessed as described by fernández et al 2013 basically we used a profile probe delta t devices ltd cambridge uk to record volumetric soil water content θ v values in the root zones of one tree per plot in three plots per treatment the recorded values were used to calculate the seasonal course of the relative extractable water rew for all treatments one central tree per plot in three out of the four plots of the all treatments was instrumented with zim probes also called leaf patch clamp pressure probe and now commercially named yara water sensors yara zim plant technology hennigsdorf germany in each instrumented tree a zim probe was clamped on a leaf of the east side of the canopy at ca 1 5 m above ground once every 5 min the output of the probe was sent via radio to a datalogger with a gprs modem for data transfer to a server owned by yara zim plant technology gmbh to which we accessed via internet details on both the zim probes and their performance when used in olive are given elsewhere see review by fernández 2017 basically the probes were able to measure continuously and automatically for the whole irrigation season since they are not affected by weather conditions dust spraying etc fernández et al 2011 precaution should be taken however with traffic in the orchard since they are magnetic and can be easily removed by tractors and machinery when that happened or when the sampled leave was detached from the tree by any reason reclampling was made that did not affect the application irrigation scheduling approach since the state of the daily p p curve collected before and after reclamplig was the same reclamping was made on a new leaf of the same tree measurements of ψ stem were made every two weeks for the entire irrigation seasons in one leaf per tree sampled from two representative trees per plot and three plots per treatment the selected leaves were close to a main branch and wrapped in aluminum foil ca 2 h before measurements these leaves were sampled from 11 30 gmt to 12 30 gmt and ψ stem measured with a scholander type pressure chamber see padilla díaz et al 2016 for details leaf gas exchange measurements were made on the same days and trees than ψ stem measurements were made at ambient light and co2 conditions we sampled young but fully developed leaves from the east part of the canopy at ca 1 5 m above ground measurements were made with a licor li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor lincoln ne usa with a 2 cm 3 cm standard chamber at 08 00 09 00 gmt the time for maximum daily stomatal conductance g s max and co2 net assimilation a max in olive fernández et al 1997 weather measurements were made as described by fernández et al 2013 basically main weather variables in the orchard were monitored by a campbell weather station campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk located at the center of the area covered by the experimental plots for the calculation of potential evapotranspiration values eto required to schedule irrigation with the crop coefficient approach data were collected from a nearby standard weather station belonging to the agroclimatic information network of the local government https www juntadeandalucia es 2 3 growth and production measurements shoot growth was assessed by measuring the number of internodes of four current year shoots per tree in two trees per plot each randomly selected from a cardinal point of the canopy and at ca 1 5 m above ground measurements were made once per month from june to november both in 2014 and 2015 leaf area la measurements in each plot were made after pruning in january with a lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor lincoln ne usa see cuevas et al 2013 for details and also during the whole irrigation seasons one every other week fruit and virgin olive oil voo yields were obtained after manual harvesting of three out of the eight trees in the central area of each plot from the four plots per treatment harvesting was made on november 21st 2014 doy 325 and on november 6th 2015 doy 310 total fruits per tree were weighed separately from each plot we took 2 kg of fruit for the oil physical extraction with the abencor method comercial abengoa s a seville spain as detailed by martinez et al 1975 fruit water productivity wp and oil wp were calculated as kilograms of fruit or oil per cubic meter of applied water although the standard definition for wp molden et al 2010 perry 2011 considers the amount of water actually consumed by the crop and not the water applied our soil water measurements suggested that all the water applied was consumed by the crop oil accumulated in the fruits was determined from june to november both in 2014 and 2015 we collected manually around 100 fruits from ca 1 5 m high of five out of the eight central trees of each plot the other three trees were used to determine yield as described above after grinding the fruits we obtained ca 20 g of fresh paste which was dehydrated at 105 c the oil of the dehydrated paste was chemically extracted by using hexane as a solvent soxhlet s method garcía et al 2013 results were expressed as percentage of oil per dry weight 2 4 statistical analysis we used linear mixed models lmm with tukey s post hoc comparisons to analyze the effects of the irrigation treatment fixed factor on rew ψ stem g s max a max number of internodes leaf area and fruit and voo yield as dependent variables at p 0 05 we used leaf identity within plot as the random factor structure in the ψ stem g s max and a max analyses to describe appropriately our experimental design and deal with the non independent nature of the spatial experimental design in the rest of comparisons the random factor was not necessary as we only have one value per plot when no normal and heteroscedastic residuals were obtained appropriate transformation of the variable was used data are shown as mean standard error we used the r software r core team 2012 to perform the statistical analysis with help of nlme packages pinheiro et al 2011 for lmm and for pair comparisons multcomp hothorn et al 2008 3 results 3 1 water supplies atmospheric demand and soil water content results on the irrigation amounts ia supplied to each treatment are shown in table 1 the good agreement between the aimed and the actual doses shows a reasonably good irrigation management still in 2015 total water supplies for the 45rdi treatments were closer to 50 than to 45 of the irrigation needs that was a year of high atmospheric demand 1581 37 mm and low precipitation 237 60 mm so the calculated irrigation needs 5855 m3 ha 1 were unusually high table 1 as compared to previous years in which this amount was usually below 5000 m3 ha 1 fernández et al 2017 the total ia applied in 2015 to both 45rdi treatments was quite similar although with marked differences on periods 2 and 3 table 1 the seasonal courses of ia for the three treatments are displayed in fig 1 a together with the collected precipitation values of relative extractable water rew calculated from the soil water measurements made in 2015 are shown in fig 1b for the fi treatment they were usually around 0 8 suggesting non limiting soil water conditions for olive the low rew value registered in the fi treatment on doy 225 fig 1b was probably due to the peak on atmospheric demand registered on the previous days fig 2 for the two 45rdi treatments rew values showed similar trends with no differences between treatments before periods 2 and 3 the soil in the two 45rdi treatments was very dry but recovered quickly after the increase on irrigation of both periods and hence no differences in rew were observed among the fi and the 45rdi treatments fig 1b in between period 2 and period 3 rew values showed severe soil water depletion in the 45rdi treatments as expected in the autumn the rainfall and ia supplied by irrigation avoided the soil becoming so dry main features of the rew seasonal courses in 2015 were similar to those in 2014 see padilla díaz et al 2016 with no differences among treatments on periods 2 and 3 for any of the two years one of the concerns of padilla díaz et al 2016 was the suitability of the 15 value for changing ia although percentages ranging from 10 to 20 are common in this type of studies goldhamer and fereres 2004 conejero et al 2007 velez et al 2007 fernández et al 2008a they had no evidence on 15 being a proper value to assess whether that value was appropriate we determined the coefficient of variation cv of the daily values of the irrigation needs in calculated at sanabria with the crop coefficient approach on periods 2 and 3 of the two experimental years table 2 the coefficient of variation was calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of the daily in values to the average in for each period expressed in percentage with those values we calculated the mean of the cv and the standard error for daily changes in in as shown in table 2 the average cv for in was 15 14 a value similar to the 15 change in the irrigation amount adopted in our irrigation scheduling approach in addition to the accumulated eto values for the two irrigation seasons table 1 shows the eto values for the whole 2014 and 2015 and for the periods 2 and 3 of each year and fig 2 shows the seasonal eto courses for both irrigation seasons also shown in that figure are the seasonal courses of the crop evapotranspiration etc values calculated with the crop coefficient approach section 2 1 3 2 plant water status versus leaf turgor related measurements fig 3 shows the results from applying the irrigation scheduling approach developed by padilla díaz et al 2016 to schedule irrigation in the 45rditp treatment on periods 2 fig 3a and b and 3 fig 3c and d of 2015 as compared to the crop irrigation approach applied fig 3a and c displays the collected p p curves from the sampled tree that first showed the onset of water stress through the shift from state 1 to state 2 arrows indicate the days in which the irrigation amount was increased arrow up or decreased arrow down by 15 as a response to changes in the state of the daily p p curve the resulting irrigation amounts are displayed in fig 3b period 2 and 3d period 3 on period 2 the total amounts of water supplied to the 45rdicc and 45rditp treatment amounted to 79 and 90 of the irrigation needs calculated for the fi treatment respectively fig 3b on period 3 these values were of 107 and 89 respectively fig 3d see padilla díaz et al 2016 for a similar figure with data of 2014 for 2015 the tree to tree variability in the state of the p p curves from all trees instrumented with zim probes and the seasonal courses of ψ stem for each treatment are shown in fig 4 a similar figure was published by padilla díaz et al 2016 with data from 2014 for all treatments the appearance of state 1 2 or 3 was in accordance to the plant water status as represented by ψ stem thus in periods 2 and 3 most trees showed state 1 or 2 while in between the two periods when the irrigation amounts of the 45rdi trees markedly decreased fig 1 state 3 was common in nearly all 45rdi trees the same was observed in between period 3 and harvesting although on this period the number of days in which the 45rdi trees showed state 3 was lower likely because of the lower atmospheric demand fig 2 and greater water supplies both from irrigation and rainfall fig 1 on these autumn days the 45rditp trees showed state 3 on a greater number of days than the 45rdicc trees despite of both treatments receiving similar amounts of water probably the lower irrigation amounts applied to 45rditp on period 3 as compared to 45rdicc fig 3d led to differences on the soil water status between both treatments which could have caused the observed differences on state the rew data showed no significant differences among treatments for that time of the year but the variability was very high as shown by the standard errors shown in fig 1b such that actual differences in soil water content could have been enough to explain the differences on the state shown in fig 4 3 3 gas exchange growth and production as expected the 45rdi treatments had a significant influence not only on the plant water status as described above and in padilla díaz et al 2016 but also on gas exchange thus significant differences on g s max and a max between the fi and the 45rdi treatments were observed not only in between period 2 and 3 and from period 3 to harvest but also during periods 2 and 3 especially at the beginning of both periods i e on the first days after water recovery fig 5 in 2014 the low g s max and a max values recorded on doy 226 and 268 fig 5a and b were likely due to those days being cloudy with low radiation levels similarly to ψ stem there were no differences for g s max and a max among 45rdi treatments except in the autumn of 2015 fig 5c and d when lower values were sometimes recorded for both variables in 45rditp trees than in 45rdicc trees for the two experimental years the number of internodes in shoots of the year was greater in fi trees than in 45rdi trees fig 6 no differences were detected between the two 45rdi treatments similarly the fi trees showed greater values of leaf area than the 45rdi trees but differences among the two 45rdi treatments were not significant either fig 7 in fig 8 we show the percentage of oil accumulated in the fruits of every treatment along the two irrigation seasons in both years the synthesis of oil began at the end of june ca doy 180 and the greatest rate of oil synthesis occurred from the second week of october ca doy 280 as compared to the fi treatment in july and august the two 45rdi trees lagged behind in oil synthesis during the autumn however no differences among treatments were observed such that at harvesting fruits of all treatments showed similar oil content expressed as percentage of dry weight results from 2014 and 2015 showed that on average with 45rdi treatments we supplied 47 3 of in and obtained 76 2 of fruit yield and 75 1 of oil yield as compared to the fi treatment however differences among treatments for both fruit yield or oil yield were never significant at α 0 05 table 3 in 2015 however the p values were close to the standard significant level 0 068 for fruit production and 0 086 for oil production suggesting an effect of the fi treatment as compared to the 45rdi treatments on both production variables the high standard errors suggested that the number of replications n 4 was too low to account for the high tree to tree variability on production results in table 3 suggested lower differences for both fruit and oil yield between the two 45rdi treatments than in between them and the fi treatment this agrees with results on water productivity wp thus the values of wp showed no statistical differences between fi and 45rdi in 2014 while in 2015 significant differences were detected for wp both for fruit and oil between the fi and the 45rdi treatments differences for the two 45rdi treatments on wp were negligible 4 discussion 4 1 impact of the scheduling irrigation approach on crop physiology and crop performance similarly to 2014 see padilla díaz et al 2016 for details in 2015 no significant differences either on the total irrigation amount applied or on the seasonal course of rew were found between 45rdicc and 45rditp fig 1 for both period 2 and 3 the irrigation amounts supplied to the 45rditp trees was ca 90 of in table 1 fig 3 which means that our irrigation scheduling approach based on the use of leaf turgor related measurements was suitable for ensuring non limiting soil water conditions on these periods of high crop sensitivity to water stress the water status of the 45rditp trees showed in fact no differences on periods 2 and 3 with the fi trees values of ψ stem values were nearly always above 1 2 mpa a threshold value for safe hydraulic functioning in olive torres ruiz et al 2013 hernandez santana et al 2016 this agrees with trees of the 45rdi treatments being in state 1 or 2 most of the days on periods 2 and 3 in fact the number of days in state 2 shown by the 45rdi trees on both periods was similar to that of the fi trees this suggests that the occurrence of state 2 on those periods was due more to the high atmospheric demand recorded on those days fig 2 than to a lack of water in the root zone values of both g s max and a max were also similar for all treatments on periods 2 and 3 fig 5 this is with the exception of the first days of both periods on which gas exchange was lower in the 45rdi trees than in the fi trees this was expected since it is known than in olive ψ stem recovers soon after water stress than gas exchange this the full recovery of g s max and a max may take a few days depending on the severity of the water stress suffered before the recovery irrigation fereres et al 1996 fernández et al 1997 the mechanisms behind that behaviour has not been clearly stablished yet nevertheless torres ruiz et al 2013 suggested that this stomatal behaviour during stress and recovery might be due to the aba synthetized during the water stress period which controlled stomata opening at the beginning of the recovery period the 45rdi strategy applied in the orchard implies a period of water stress before periods 2 and 3 in which the soil can become markedly depleted fig 1b as described above in our irrigation scheduling approach we irrigated with 120 of the irrigation needs on the first days of both periods for a quick recovery of the soil water status aiming to minimise the described delay in the recovery of both g s max and a max plant growth was reduced by the 45rdi treatments as expected but no differences were observed between 45rdicc and 45rditp either for the number of internodes in the current year shoots fig 6 or leaf area fig 7 it is well known that growth in olive is very sensitive to water stress as occurs in other fruit tree species fernández 2014b rosecrance et al 2015 cajias et al 2016 so the lower number of internodes and reduced leaf area in the 45rdi trees was expected this effect of the 45rdi treatments on growth agrees with the lower levels of a max found in these trees fig 5 as compared to the fi trees the reduction both of g s max and a max was not necessarily negative on the one hand reducing g s can improve water use efficiency since the a vs g s relationship in olive shows a becoming asymptotic for g s values above ca 0 2 mol m 2 s 1 fernández et al 2008b on the other hand a reduction in a contributes to avoid excessive growth hernandez santana et al 2017 which may be an advantage in shd olive orchards both to facilitate mechanical harvesting with the vineyard type straddle harvesters normally used in these orchards león et al 2007 and to avoid competency for light among trees gómez del campo et al 2009 connor et al 2012 both factors ensure a long productive life of the orchard fernández et al 2017 in between periods 2 and 3 when rew values ranged most of the time from 0 2 to 0 3 only for the 45rdi treatments fig 1b and maximum values of atmospheric demand were recorded fig 2 the 45rdi trees became severely stressed thus from mid july to the end of august the 45rdi trees showed midday ψ stem values in between ca 3 0 and 4 7 mpa fig 4 g s max values of ca 0 05 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and a max values around 4 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 it is known however that the olive tree is quite tolerant to water stress at this time of the year moriana et al 2003 perez martin et al 2009 and that it is able to recover from severe water stress with a reduced impact on crop performance providing enough water during both period 3 and ripening is available lavee et al 1990 lavee and wodner 1991 this agrees with the dynamics of oil accumulation observed in our orchard which showed a recovery of the oil content in the fruits after the beginning of period 3 fig 8 concerning production oil accumulation in the fruits during pit hardening was affected in the 45rdi trees as compared to the fi trees fig 8 during ripening however similar values were observed in all treatments for fruit and oil yield our statistical analysis showed no differences between treatments table 3 olive presents a linear increase of production with water supply until a certain level from which little increase on production if any is observed when increasing the water supply moriana et al 2003 other authors have reported little impact on fruit and oil yields despite significant reductions on water supply grattan et al 2006 rosecrance et al 2015 in our case and as indicated in section 3 3 the number of replicas we had was too low to properly account for the high tree to tree variability on both fruit and oil yield existing in the orchard it is clear however that similar results on fruit and oil yield were obtained independently of the approach used to schedule the 45rdi treatment which means that for both production variables our irrigation scheduling approach based on the use of the zim system was as effective as that based on the crop coefficient approach the same can be said for the water productivity wp values table 3 in fact at least in 2015 differences on fruit and oil wp were significant in between the fi and the 45rdi treatments with no differences between 45rdicc and 45rditp 4 2 suitability of the scheduling irrigation approach for commercial orchards as detailed above our results suggest similar crop performance for both 45rdicc and 45rditp previous results obtained by our group at the sanabria orchard with similar irrigation strategies as the 45rdi but with different levels of water stress all scheduled with the crop coefficient approach suggested that 45rdicc is a suitable option for shd olive orchards similar to our experimental orchard ndez et al 2013 2017 garcía et al 2017 however and as padilla díaz et al 2016 already pointed out the required values of both the crop coefficient k c and the potential evapotranspiration eto in the area are not available for many olive orchards on the top of that the crop coefficient approach implies a delay in the scheduling of irrigation since weather data must be collected prior to the calculation of eto the irrigation scheduling approach proposed by padilla díaz et al 2016 and further tested in this work relies on continuous and automatic leaf turgor related measurements this real time data information is suitable for irrigation scheduling in olive fernández 2017 fernández 2014b made a comparative study on three different methods to schedule irrigation in shd olive orchards based respectively on sap flow trunk diameter variations and leaf turgor related measurements he reported that the zim system used for leaf turgor related measurements was the easiest to install and use and robust enough to withstand field conditions for long irrigation seasons the potential and limitations of these three plant based variables to derive suitable plant water stress indicators and to schedule irrigation in commercial orchards was analysed not only by fernández 2014b but also by fernández 2017 and fernández et al 2017 and they all agreed on the high potential of leaf turgor related measurements for precision irrigation egea et al 2017 made a financial assessment of the three mentioned methods to schedule regulated deficit irrigation in super high density olive orchards and concluded that scheduling irrigation with the zim method i e from leaf turgor related measurements was the most profitable one our results confirm the advantages of the irrigation scheduling approach proposed by padilla díaz et al 2016 among the main ones is that contrarily to sap flow and trunk diameter variations records no data processing is required because the visual analysis of the p p daily curves is enough to identify the state i e the level of water stress of the monitored trees a procedure for the automatic identification of the state shown by daily p p curves based on the use of random forest models has been recently published by fernandes et al 2017 which will facilitate the application of the irrigation scheduling approach to commercial orchards in addition the method can be combined with airborne imagery for the zoning or zonification of the orchard this allows for differential irrigation doses and frequencies depending on the variation in water requirements identified within the orchard finally the combination of leaf turgor related measurements with the 3 day weather forecast allows for an early response of irrigation management to environmental conditions these features confer our irrigation scheduling approach a high potential for precision irrigation which may significantly contribute to the rational water use in super high density olive orchards fernández 2017 fernández et al 2017 the irrigation scheduling approach has however several limitations first caution must be taken when assuming a particular water stress level to the state shown by the p p curve thus marino et al 2016 found lower threshold values of ψ stem for the olive sicilian genotypes nocellara del belice and olivo di mandanici than those reported by fernández et al 2011 and ehrenberger et al 2012 for arbequina trees further studies are then needed to establish the extent at which the ranges of water stress for states 1 3 depend on the cultivar and orchard conditions second neither the 120 increase in the irrigation amount on the first days of periods 1 3 nor the 15 change in the irrigation amount made afterwards have been contrasted against the crop physiology or crop performance the fact that the average coefficient of variation value of the irrigation needs agrees with the 15 percentage of change on the irrigation amount table 2 suggests that this percentage is reasonable this supports that the use of this percentage recommended for our irrigation scheduling approach is suitable for proper irrigation scheduling in orchards similar to our experimental orchard in any case the empirical character of the two percentages adopted in the irrigation scheduling approach may curtail their reliability when applied to other orchards with different conditions third the zim probe does not work properly beyond a certain level of water stress which in our case was reported to be that occurring at ca ψ stem 1 7 mpa this is not limiting for scheduling irrigation on periods 1 2 and 3 because ψ stem is usually greater than 1 7 mpa thanks to the high irrigation amounts applied on those days still state 3 was often found in between periods when the irrigation amounts are low fig 4 and as explained by ehrenberger et al 2012 the information provided by the zim probes on those days is not useful to assess the actual water stress of the trees irrigation scheduling in between periods must relay therefore on a different method padilla díaz et al 2016 suggested that on those days the farmer could use whatever knowledge they have on the orchard water needs this is a rough solution that may lead to imprecise determinations of the irrigation amounts but the impact on the overall irrigation management will be low because of the reduced number of irrigation events on those days in between periods see fig 1 in padilla díaz et al 2016 in any case we are already working on new water stress indicators derived from the p p values recorded at state 3 any advances on this task together with the approach derived by fernandes et al 2017 for the automatic assessment of the daily p p curve state could highly contribute to the use of the proposed irrigation scheduling approach in a context of precision irrigation 5 conclusions our findings on a greater number of variables than those monitored by padilla díaz et al 2016 confirm that the proposed irrigation scheduling approach is suitable to schedule regulated deficit irrigation in hedgerow olive orchards with similar conditions than those used in the present experiments both calculating the irrigation amounts at the beginning of the periods of high sensitivity to water stress periods 1 3 as 120 of the irrigation needs and changing by 15 the irrigation amounts applied for the rest of each period seem to be adequate for keeping non limiting soil water conditions on those periods nonetheless the fact that the values recorded by the zim probes at state 3 are not informative on the actual leaf turgor curtails the suitability of the proposed irrigations scheduling approach to calculate irrigation amounts in between periods it is expected that both recent advances for the automatic identification of the daily p p curve states and further studies on the information provided by the p p records at state 3 will increase the suitability of the proposed irrigation scheduling approach for precision irrigation of hedgerow olive orchards acknowledgements the present study was funded by the spanish ministry

11518,we evaluated the suitability of scheduling a regulated deficit irrigation strategy in a hedgerow olive orchard with high plant density from leaf turgor related measurements measurements were made for two consecutive years at an olive orchard with 1667 arbequina trees per hectare where we had two deficit irrigation treatments 45rdicc and 45rditp plus a full irrigation as a control the two 45rdi treatments consisted on applying the same regulated deficit irrigation strategy aimed to supply a total of 45 of the irrigation needs the 45rdicc treatment however was scheduled with the crop coefficient approach while the 45rditp treatment was scheduled with an irrigation scheduling approach based on leaf turgor related measurements first suggested by padilla díaz et al 2016 agric water manage 164 28 37 they worked at the orchard in 2014 and made a preliminary evaluation of the irrigation scheduling approach by comparing 45rditp versus 45rdicc in terms of irrigation dose and frequency predawn and midday stem water potential ψ stem and the fruit yields of each treatment in this work we considered the same variables as well as maximum daily values of stomatal conductance and co2 net assimilation the seasonal courses of the number of internodes in current year shoots leaf area and oil accumulation in the fruits and total fruit and oil yields all those variables were monitored both in 2014 and 2015 and we found no differences between the 45rditp and the 45rdicc treatments for any of them the irrigation amounts applied to each treatment differed occasionally but the total water supplies were similar to both 45rdi treatments our results therefore confirm the suitability of the irrigation scheduling approach proposed by padilla díaz et al 2016 to apply regulated deficit irrigation in commercial hedgerow olive orchards we found additional evidence for the 15 changes on the irrigation amount recommended by the irrigation scheduling approach as being suitable for the orchard conditions caution must be taken when applying this approach to other olive orchards since the relations between the tree water status and the shape of the daily curves recorded with the zim probes may depend on the cultivar and orchard conditions keywords irrigation management stem water potential irrigation water productivity leaf patch clamp pressure probe crop coefficient regulated deficit irrigation 1 introduction the world population is expected to increase 1 3 before 2050 fao 2009 in this period rising temperatures and lower precipitation is forecasted for mediterranean areas ipcc 2014 we are facing the challenge therefore of producing more food fibber and biofuel with less water and greater atmospheric demand among the responses of the scientific community to that challenge are the development of new irrigation strategies and effective tools for monitoring plant water stress and scheduling irrigation concerning the irrigation strategy that can vary from full irrigation irrigating with enough water to replace 100 of the crop water needs to supplementary or complementary irrigation just one or very few irrigation events supplying a small fraction of the crop water needs between both the user can choose among a variety of deficit irrigation strategies fereres and soriano 2007 iniesta et al 2009 ruiz sanchez et al 2010 martín vertedor et al 2011 gómez del campo 2013 fernández 2014a for assessing water stress and scheduling irrigation the user can choose among different methods based on soil atmosphere or plant measurements the latter are widely used in fruit trees including olive in fact a variety of methods are available from the conventional non automated methods for assessing leaf or stem water status and stomatal conductance or photosynthesis to methods with systems that run continuously and automatically based on measurements related to sap flow trunk diameter and leaf turgor pressure among other plant variables jones 2004 2007 ben gal et al 2010 fernández 2014b many of those methods apart from running automatically and being easily implemented with data transmission systems for a remote access to the recorded data through the internet can be combined with remote imagery for a precise irrigation of large orchards gonzalez dugo et al 2015 gago et al 2015 bellvert et al 2016 fernández 2017 the most suitable irrigation strategies for fruit trees orchards in arid and semi arid areas are deficit irrigation strategies specifically designed to match both the crop characteristics and main environment conditions rallo et al 2016 deficit irrigation is especially suitable to hedgerow orchards with high tree densities also called super high density shd orchards where excessive growth must be avoided by controlling water and fertilizer supplies for shd olive orchards regulated deficit irrigation rdi has been reported as one of the best deficit irrigation strategies fernández et al 2013 fernández 2014b several experiments at the sanabria orchard a commercial shd arbequina orchard near seville southwest spain representative of those in many other mediterranean olive growing areas proved the suitability of the 45rdi strategy for shd olive orchards ndez et al 2013 2017 hernandez santana et al 2017 the 45rdi strategy consists in irrigating daily to replace 100 of irrigation needs in three periods of the annual growing cycle these periods named as periods 1 2 and 3 are those in which olive is most sensitive to water stress fernández et al 2013 fernández 2014a in between those periods one or two irrigation events per week are recommended as reported by fernández et al 2013 and padilla díaz et al 2016 the total water supplies in between the three mentioned periods amounted to 15 30 of the irrigation needs depending of the time of the year the total water supply for the whole irrigation season in this 45rdi strategy aims at 45 of the irrigation needs the successful application of any rdi strategy requires effective irrigation scheduling for olive different water stress indicators and related systems to schedule irrigation based on sap flow trunk diameter variations and leaf turgor related measurements have been assessed fernández 2014a among them the zim system which uses the leaf patch clamp pressure lpcp or also called zim probe zimmermann et al 2008 has been proved to be useful to assess water stress in commercial orchards fernández et al 2011 fernández 2014a the zim probe records the output pressure p p a variable inversely correlated with the leaf turgor pressure zimmermann et al 2008 a variable closely related to water stress fernández 2014b egea et al 2017 analysed the financial feasibility of scheduling irrigation at the sanabria orchard from the three mentioned plant based type of measurements and concluded that the zim system is the best approach to evaluate the potential of the zim system to assess water stress and to schedule irrigation fernández et al 2011 and ehrenberger et al 2012 analysed the relationship between midday stem water potential ψ stem a variable widely accepted as a reliable indicator of plant water status and the p p values recorded with the zim probe in olive trees they found that the shape of the daily p p curve changes dramatically with the level of water stress and defined three different states or shapes of the curve typical of certain ψ stem levels state 1 for ψ stem 1 2 mpa state 2 for 1 2 ψ stem 1 7 mpa and state 3 for ψ stem 1 7 mpa similar studies has been made for other olive cultivars and environments marino et al 2016 and for other species martínez gimeno et al 2017 the potential for scheduling irrigation from a visual analysis of the curve from which the orchardist easily identifies the state of the p p daily curve and therefore the level of water stress of the trees was already suggested by fernández et al 2011 and ehrenberger et al 2012 this was used by padilla díaz et al 2016 to derive an irrigation scheduling approach for the sanabria olive orchard and to run preliminary evaluation measurements during the irrigation season of 2014 they had two regulated deficit irrigation treatments 45rdicc and 45rditp in both of them they applied the regulated deficit irrigation strategy proposed for shd olive orchards by fernández et al 2013 and fernández 2014a for 45rdicc they scheduled irrigation with the crop coefficient approach while for the 45rditp they designed and applied an irrigation scheduling approach based on the visualization of the daily p p curves recorded with zim sensors see section 2 1 for details they evaluated the performance of their irrigation scheduling approach by comparing 45rdicc versus 45rditp in terms of the irrigation amounts relative extractable water in the soil stem water potential at both predawn and midday and fruit yield padilla díaz et al 2016 confirmed the relationships between the level of plant water stress and the shape states of the daily p p curves first reported by fernández et al 2011 and ehrenberger et al 2012 and concluded that the irrigation scheduling approach applied to the 45rditp treatment showed a performance as good as that of the crop coefficient approach allowing for precise irrigation scheduling in orchards for which the crop coefficient values were unknown they however were concerned on the empirical assumptions of their irrigation scheduling approach e g changing the irrigation amount by 15 as well on their evaluation relying on a reduced number of variables monitored for a single irrigation season the aim of this work was to apply the irrigations scheduling approach proposed by padilla díaz et al 2016 for two consecutive years at the sanabria orchard and to study a wider range of variables with the aim of further assessing the advantages and limitations of the irrigations scheduling approach based on leaf turgor related measurements as compared to the crop coefficient approach we applied the same 45rditp and 45rdicc treatments they used and stem water potential stomatal conductance and co2 net assimilation as well as the number of internodes in shoots of the current year leaf area fruit yield and seasonal oil accumulation in the fruit and total oil yield were monitored on representative trees of each treatment both in 2014 and 2015 we also had a fully irrigated treatment as a control fi treatment in which the trees were daily irrigated for the whole irrigation season to replace 100 of the irrigation needs 2 material and methods 2 1 orchard characteristics and irrigation management the orchard located at 25 km to the east of seville 37 15 n 5 48 w was planted in 2007 with one year old arbequina trees the trees were at the top of 0 4 m high ridges and at 4 m 1 5 m 1667 trees ha 1 measurements described below were made during the irrigation seasons of 2014 and 2015 when the trees were 8 and 9 years old respectively the hedgerows were kept ca 2 10 m wide and ca 2 5 m high by pruning in january we applied the same irrigation treatments described by padilla díaz et al 2016 i e fi 45rdicc and 45rditp and with the same layout four 12 m 6 m plots per treatment in a randomized block design basically daily irrigation was applied to the full irrigation fi trees during the whole irrigation season aimed to replace 100 of the irrigation needs every monday of the irrigation seasons the irrigation needs in were calculated as in etc p e being etc the crop evapotranspiration estimated from the crop coefficient approach and p e the effective precipitation estimated as 75 of precipitation recorded by the weather station in the orchard see padilla díaz et al 2016 for details on the k c and potential evapotranspiration values for the 45rdi trees we applied a regulated deficit irrigation strategy consisting on daily irrigation to replace 100 of the irrigation needs on the periods when the crop is most sensitive to water stress periods 1 2 and 3 shown in fig 1 of padilla díaz et al 2016 while reducing to one or two irrigation events per week in between those periods for both 45rdi treatments the irrigation supply for the whole irrigation season aimed to 45 of the irrigation needs the difference between 45rdicc and 45rditp was that in the 45rdicc treatment irrigation was scheduled from the crop coefficient approach while in the 45rditp treatment irrigation was scheduled from the state of the daily p p curves recorded with zim sensors in representative 45rditp trees according to the irrigation scheduling approach proposed by padilla díaz et al 2016 basically we clamped a zim probe in three 45rditp trees one per plot in three plots out of the four 45rditp plots in 2014 we did not irrigate on period 1 because rainfall was enough at that time of the year to replace the crop water needs in 2015 however we had to irrigate on that period still the irrigations amounts in period 1 in 2015 were calculated with the crop coefficient approach for both the 45rdicc and 45rditp treatments because at that time we were still installing and checking the zim probes and related system at the beginning of both period 2 and period 3 all the 45rditp trees showed moderate to severe levels of water stress because of the lack of rain and the reduced irrigation applied on the weeks before each period consequently most zim probes were in state 3 we then supplied daily irrigation amounts of 120 of the irrigation needs on the first three days of both period 2 and 3 this was enough for the daily p p curves recorded in those trees to change from state 2 or 3 to state 1 for the rest of the period we adjusted irrigation to the 45rditp trees according to the state of the p p curves and the 3 day weather forecast given through internet thus when one out of the three p p curves changed from state 1 to state 2 and the weather forecast announced increasing atmospheric demand irrigation was increased by 15 if atmospheric demand was expected to decrease or the most sensitive instrumented 45rditp tree did not show a change from state 2 to state 3 the irrigation dose was not modified in case of a change from state 2 to state 3 or a second tree changing from state 1 to state 2 irrigation was increased by 15 when the state shown by the p p curves indicated a recovery of the tree water status irrigation was decreased also by 15 outside of periods 2 and 3 when irrigation was applied just once or twice per week irrigation amounts were applied according to fig 1 in padilla díaz et al 2016 on those days i e on the weeks before in between and after periods 2 and 3 we used the irrigation needs calculated for the fi treatments with the crop coefficient approach to derive the required irrigation amounts for the 45rditp trees in 2014 the irrigation season started on april 26th day of year doy 116 and ended on november 20th doy 324 in 2015 the irrigation season lasted from april 8th doy 98 to october 25th doy 298 the calculated irrigation doses were input in an irrigation controller agronic 2000 sistemes electrònics pro grés s a lleida spain and water was applied through a single pipe per tree row with three 2 l h 1 drippers per tree 0 5 m apart fertilizers were injected once per week into the irrigation system to match the tree requirements fernández et al 2013 all treatments received the same amounts of fertilizers climate in the area is typically mediterranean with mild wet winters and little precipitation during the irrigation season may october average values of precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration eto in the area are 522 7 mm and 1531 5 mm respectively period 2002 2015 the soil had a 0 4 m deep sandy layer over a clayey layer with low conductance most roots were in the top sandy layer details in fernández et al 2013 2 2 soil plant and weather measurements all measurements described in this section and in section 2 3 were made on both 2014 and 2015 from the 24 trees of each plot measurements were made in the central 8 trees to avoid any border effect soil water status was assessed as described by fernández et al 2013 basically we used a profile probe delta t devices ltd cambridge uk to record volumetric soil water content θ v values in the root zones of one tree per plot in three plots per treatment the recorded values were used to calculate the seasonal course of the relative extractable water rew for all treatments one central tree per plot in three out of the four plots of the all treatments was instrumented with zim probes also called leaf patch clamp pressure probe and now commercially named yara water sensors yara zim plant technology hennigsdorf germany in each instrumented tree a zim probe was clamped on a leaf of the east side of the canopy at ca 1 5 m above ground once every 5 min the output of the probe was sent via radio to a datalogger with a gprs modem for data transfer to a server owned by yara zim plant technology gmbh to which we accessed via internet details on both the zim probes and their performance when used in olive are given elsewhere see review by fernández 2017 basically the probes were able to measure continuously and automatically for the whole irrigation season since they are not affected by weather conditions dust spraying etc fernández et al 2011 precaution should be taken however with traffic in the orchard since they are magnetic and can be easily removed by tractors and machinery when that happened or when the sampled leave was detached from the tree by any reason reclampling was made that did not affect the application irrigation scheduling approach since the state of the daily p p curve collected before and after reclamplig was the same reclamping was made on a new leaf of the same tree measurements of ψ stem were made every two weeks for the entire irrigation seasons in one leaf per tree sampled from two representative trees per plot and three plots per treatment the selected leaves were close to a main branch and wrapped in aluminum foil ca 2 h before measurements these leaves were sampled from 11 30 gmt to 12 30 gmt and ψ stem measured with a scholander type pressure chamber see padilla díaz et al 2016 for details leaf gas exchange measurements were made on the same days and trees than ψ stem measurements were made at ambient light and co2 conditions we sampled young but fully developed leaves from the east part of the canopy at ca 1 5 m above ground measurements were made with a licor li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor

measurements were made as described by fernández et al 2013 basically main weather variables in the orchard were monitored by a campbell weather station campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk located at the center of the area covered by the experimental plots for the calculation of potential evapotranspiration values eto required to schedule irrigation with the crop coefficient approach data were collected from a nearby standard weather station belonging to the agroclimatic information network of the local government https www juntadeandalucia es 2 3 growth and production measurements shoot growth was assessed by measuring the number of internodes of four current year shoots per tree in two trees per plot each randomly selected from a cardinal point of the canopy and at ca 1 5 m above ground measurements were made once per month from june to november both in 2014 and 2015 leaf area la measurements in each plot were made after pruning in january with a lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor lincoln ne usa see cuevas et al 2013 for details and also during the whole irrigation seasons one every other week fruit and virgin olive oil voo yields were obtained after manual harvesting of three out of the eight trees in the central area of each plot from the four plots per treatment harvesting was made on november 21st 2014 doy 325 and on november 6th 2015 doy 310 total fruits per tree were weighed separately from each plot we took 2 kg of fruit for the oil physical extraction with the abencor method comercial abengoa s a seville spain as detailed by martinez et al 1975 fruit water productivity wp and oil wp were calculated as kilograms of fruit or oil per cubic meter of applied water although the standard definition for wp molden et al 2010 perry 2011 considers the amount of water actually consumed by the crop and not the water applied our soil water measurements suggested that all the water applied was consumed by the crop oil accumulated in the fruits was determined from june to november both in 2014 and 2015 we collected manually around 100 fruits from ca 1 5 m high of five out of the eight central trees of each plot the other three trees were used to determine yield as described above after grinding the fruits we obtained ca 20 g of fresh paste which was dehydrated at 105 c the oil of the dehydrated paste was chemically extracted by using hexane as a

for lmm and for pair comparisons multcomp hothorn et al 2008 3 results 3 1 water supplies atmospheric demand and soil water content results on the irrigation amounts ia supplied to each treatment are shown in table 1 the good agreement between the aimed and the actual doses shows a reasonably good irrigation management still in 2015 total water supplies for the 45rdi treatments were closer to 50 than to 45 of the irrigation needs that was a year of high atmospheric demand 1581 37 mm and low precipitation 237 60 mm so the calculated irrigation needs 5855 m3 ha 1 were unusually high table 1 as compared to previous years in which this amount was usually below 5000 m3 ha 1 fernández et al 2017 the total ia applied in 2015 to both 45rdi treatments was quite similar although with marked differences on periods 2 and 3 table 1 the seasonal courses of ia for the three treatments are displayed in fig 1 a together with the collected precipitation values of relative extractable water rew calculated from the soil water measurements made in 2015 are shown in fig 1b for the fi treatment they were usually around 0 8 suggesting non limiting soil water conditions for olive the low rew value registered in the fi treatment on doy 225 fig 1b was probably due to the peak on atmospheric demand registered on the previous days fig 2 for the two 45rdi treatments rew values showed similar trends with no differences between treatments before periods 2 and 3 the soil in the two 45rdi treatments was very dry but recovered quickly after the increase on irrigation of both periods and hence no differences in rew were observed among the fi and the 45rdi treatments fig 1b in between period 2 and period 3 rew values showed severe soil water depletion in the 45rdi treatments as expected in the autumn the rainfall and ia supplied by irrigation avoided the soil becoming so dry main features of the rew seasonal courses in 2015 were similar to those in 2014 see padilla díaz et al 2016 with no differences among treatments on periods 2 and 3 for any of the two years one of the concerns of padilla díaz et al 2016 was the suitability of the 15 value for changing ia although percentages ranging from 10 to 20 are common in this type of studies goldhamer and fereres 2004 conejero et al 2007 velez et al 2007 fernández et al 2008a they had no evidence on 15 being a proper value to assess whether that value was appropriate we determined the coefficient of variation cv of the daily values of the irrigation needs in calculated at sanabria with the crop coefficient approach on periods 2 and 3 of the two experimental years table 2 the coefficient of variation was calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of the daily in values to the average in for each period expressed in percentage with those values we calculated the mean of the cv and the standard error for daily changes in in as shown in table 2 the average cv for in was 15 14 a value similar to the 15 change in the irrigation amount adopted in our irrigation scheduling approach in addition to the accumulated eto values for the two irrigation seasons table 1 shows the eto values for the whole 2014 and 2015 and for the periods 2 and 3 of each year and fig 2 shows the seasonal eto courses for both irrigation seasons also shown in that figure are the seasonal courses of the crop evapotranspiration etc values calculated with the crop coefficient approach section 2 1 3 2 plant water status versus leaf turgor related measurements fig 3 shows the results from applying the irrigation scheduling approach developed by padilla díaz et al 2016 to schedule irrigation in the 45rditp treatment on periods 2 fig 3a and b and 3 fig 3c and d of 2015 as compared to the crop irrigation approach applied fig 3a and c displays the collected p p curves from the sampled tree that first showed the onset of water stress through the shift from state 1 to state 2 arrows indicate the days in which the irrigation amount was increased arrow up or decreased arrow down by 15 as a response to changes in the state of the daily p p curve the resulting irrigation amounts are displayed in fig 3b period 2 and 3d period 3 on period 2 the total amounts of water supplied to the 45rdicc and 45rditp treatment amounted to 79 and 90 of the irrigation needs calculated for the fi treatment respectively fig 3b on period 3 these values were of 107 and 89 respectively fig 3d see padilla díaz et al 2016 for a similar figure with data of 2014 for 2015 the tree to tree variability in the state of the p p curves from all trees instrumented with zim probes and the seasonal courses of ψ stem for each treatment are shown in fig 4 a similar figure was published by padilla díaz et al 2016 with data from 2014 for all treatments the appearance of state 1 2 or 3 was in accordance to the plant water status as represented by ψ stem thus in periods 2 and 3 most trees showed state 1 or 2 while in between the two periods when the irrigation amounts of the 45rdi trees markedly decreased fig 1 state 3 was common in nearly all 45rdi trees the same was observed in between period 3 and harvesting although on this period the number of days in which the 45rdi trees showed state 3 was lower likely because of the lower atmospheric demand fig 2 and greater water supplies both from irrigation and rainfall fig 1 on these autumn days the 45rditp trees showed state 3 on a greater number of days than the 45rdicc trees despite of both treatments receiving similar amounts of water probably the lower irrigation amounts applied to 45rditp on period 3 as compared to 45rdicc fig 3d led to differences on the soil water status between both treatments which could have caused the observed differences on state the rew data showed no significant differences among treatments for that time of the year but the variability was very high as shown by the standard errors shown in fig 1b such that actual differences in soil water content could have been enough to explain the differences on the state shown in fig 4 3 3 gas exchange growth and production as expected the 45rdi treatments had a significant influence not only on the plant water status as described above and in padilla díaz et al 2016 but also on gas exchange thus significant differences on g s max and a max between the fi and the 45rdi treatments were observed not only in between period 2 and 3 and from period 3 to harvest but also during periods 2 and 3 especially at the beginning of both periods i e on the first days after water recovery fig 5 in 2014 the low g s max and a max values recorded on doy 226 and 268 fig 5a and b were likely due to those days being cloudy with low radiation levels similarly to ψ stem there were no differences for g s max and a max among 45rdi treatments except in the autumn of 2015 fig 5c and d when lower values were sometimes recorded for both variables in 45rditp trees than in 45rdicc trees for the two experimental years the number of internodes in shoots of the year was greater in fi trees than in 45rdi trees fig 6 no differences were detected between the two 45rdi treatments similarly the fi trees showed greater values of leaf area than the 45rdi trees but differences among the two 45rdi treatments were not significant either fig 7 in fig 8 we show the percentage of oil accumulated in the fruits of every treatment along the two irrigation seasons in both years the synthesis of oil began at the end of june ca doy 180 and the greatest rate of oil synthesis occurred from the second week of october ca doy 280 as compared to the fi treatment in july and august the two 45rdi trees lagged behind in oil synthesis during the autumn however no differences among treatments were observed such that at harvesting fruits of all treatments showed similar oil content expressed as percentage of dry weight results from 2014 and 2015 showed that on average with 45rdi treatments we supplied 47 3 of in and obtained 76 2 of fruit yield and 75 1 of oil yield as compared to the fi treatment however differences among treatments for both fruit yield or oil yield were never significant at α 0 05 table 3 in 2015 however the p values were close to the standard significant level 0 068 for fruit production and 0 086 for oil production suggesting an effect of the fi treatment as compared to the 45rdi treatments on both production variables the high standard errors suggested that the number of replications n 4 was too low to account for the high tree to tree variability on production results in table 3 suggested lower differences for both fruit and oil yield between the two 45rdi treatments than in between them and the fi treatment this agrees with results on water productivity wp thus the values of wp showed no statistical differences between fi and 45rdi in 2014 while in 2015 significant differences were detected for wp both for fruit and oil between the fi and the 45rdi treatments differences for the two 45rdi treatments on wp were negligible 4 discussion 4 1 impact of the scheduling irrigation approach on crop physiology and crop performance similarly to 2014 see padilla díaz et al 2016 for details in 2015 no significant differences either on the total irrigation amount applied or on the seasonal course of rew were found between 45rdicc and 45rditp fig 1 for both period 2 and 3 the irrigation amounts supplied to the 45rditp trees was ca 90 of in table 1 fig 3 which means that our irrigation scheduling approach based on the use of leaf turgor related measurements was suitable for ensuring non limiting soil water conditions on these periods of high crop sensitivity to water stress the water status of the 45rditp trees showed in fact no differences on periods 2 and 3 with the fi trees values of ψ stem values were nearly always above 1 2 mpa a threshold value for safe hydraulic functioning in olive torres ruiz et al 2013 hernandez santana et al 2016 this agrees with trees of the 45rdi treatments being in state 1 or 2 most of the days on periods 2 and 3 in fact the number of days in state 2 shown by the 45rdi trees on both periods was similar to that of the fi trees this suggests that the occurrence of state 2 on those periods was due more to the high atmospheric demand recorded on those days fig 2 than to a lack of water in the root zone values of both g s max and a max were also similar for all treatments on periods 2 and 3 fig 5 this is with the exception of the first days of both periods on which gas exchange was lower in the 45rdi trees than in the fi trees this was expected since it is known than in olive ψ stem recovers soon after water stress than gas exchange this the full recovery of g s max and a max may take a few days depending on the severity of the water stress suffered before the recovery irrigation fereres et al 1996 fernández et al 1997 the mechanisms behind that behaviour has not been clearly stablished yet nevertheless torres ruiz et al 2013 suggested that this stomatal behaviour during stress and recovery might be due to the aba synthetized during the water stress period which controlled stomata opening at the beginning of the recovery period the 45rdi strategy applied in the orchard implies a period of water stress before periods 2 and 3 in which the soil can become markedly depleted fig 1b as described above in our irrigation scheduling approach we irrigated with 120 of the irrigation needs on the first days of both periods for a quick recovery of the soil water status aiming to minimise the described delay in the recovery of both g s max and a max plant growth was reduced by the 45rdi treatments as expected but no differences were observed between 45rdicc and 45rditp either for the number of internodes in the current year shoots fig 6 or leaf area fig 7 it is well known that growth in olive is very sensitive to water stress as occurs in other fruit tree species fernández 2014b rosecrance et al 2015 cajias et al 2016 so the lower number of internodes and reduced leaf area in the 45rdi trees was expected this effect of the 45rdi treatments on growth agrees with the lower levels of a max found in these trees fig 5 as compared to the fi trees the reduction both of g s max and a max was not necessarily negative on the one hand reducing g s can improve water use efficiency since the a vs g s relationship in olive shows a becoming asymptotic for g s values above ca 0 2 mol m 2 s 1 fernández et al 2008b on the other hand a reduction in a contributes to avoid excessive growth hernandez santana et al 2017 which may be an advantage in shd olive orchards both to facilitate mechanical harvesting with the vineyard type straddle harvesters normally used in these orchards león et al 2007 and to avoid competency for light among trees gómez del campo et al 2009 connor et al 2012 both factors ensure a long productive life of the orchard fernández et al 2017 in between periods 2 and 3 when rew values ranged most of the time from 0 2 to 0 3 only for the 45rdi treatments fig 1b and maximum values of atmospheric demand were recorded fig 2 the 45rdi trees became severely stressed thus from mid july to the end of august the 45rdi trees showed midday ψ stem values in between ca 3 0 and 4 7 mpa fig 4 g s max values of ca 0 05 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and a max values around 4 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 it is known however that the olive tree is quite tolerant to water stress at this time of the year moriana et al 2003 perez martin et al 2009 and that it is able to recover from severe water stress with a reduced impact on crop performance providing enough water during both period 3 and ripening is available lavee et al 1990 lavee and wodner 1991 this agrees with the dynamics of oil accumulation observed in our orchard which showed a recovery of the oil content in the fruits after the beginning of period 3 fig 8 concerning production oil accumulation in the fruits during pit hardening was affected in the 45rdi trees as compared to the fi trees fig 8 during ripening however similar values were observed in all treatments for fruit and oil yield our statistical analysis showed no differences between treatments table 3 olive presents a linear increase of production with water supply until a certain level from which little increase on production if any is observed when increasing the water supply moriana et al 2003 other authors have reported little impact on fruit and oil yields despite significant reductions on water supply grattan et al 2006 rosecrance et al 2015 in our case and as indicated in section 3 3 the number of replicas we had was too low to properly account for the high tree to tree variability on both fruit and oil yield existing in the orchard it is clear however that similar results on fruit and oil yield were obtained independently of the approach used to schedule the 45rdi treatment which means that for both production variables our irrigation scheduling approach based on the use of the zim system was as effective as that based on the crop coefficient approach the same can be said for the water productivity wp values table 3 in fact at least in 2015 differences on fruit and oil wp were significant in between the fi and the 45rdi treatments with no differences between 45rdicc and 45rditp 4 2 suitability of the scheduling irrigation approach for commercial orchards as detailed above our results suggest similar crop performance for both 45rdicc and 45rditp previous results obtained by our group at the sanabria orchard with similar irrigation strategies as the 45rdi but with different levels of water stress all scheduled with the crop coefficient approach suggested that 45rdicc is a suitable option for shd olive orchards similar to our experimental orchard ndez et al 2013 2017 garcía et al 2017 however and as padilla díaz et al 2016 already pointed out the required values of both the crop coefficient k c and the potential evapotranspiration eto in the area are not available for many olive orchards on the top of that the crop coefficient approach implies a delay in the scheduling of irrigation since weather data must be collected prior to the calculation of eto the irrigation scheduling approach proposed by padilla díaz et al 2016 and further tested in this work relies on continuous and automatic leaf turgor related measurements this real time data information is suitable for irrigation scheduling in olive fernández 2017 fernández 2014b made a comparative study on three different methods to schedule irrigation in shd olive orchards based respectively on sap flow trunk diameter variations and leaf turgor related measurements he reported that the zim system used for leaf turgor related measurements was the easiest to install and use and robust enough to withstand field conditions for long irrigation seasons the potential and limitations of these three plant based variables to derive suitable plant water stress indicators and to schedule irrigation in commercial orchards was analysed not only by fernández 2014b but also by fernández 2017 and fernández et al 2017 and they all agreed on the high potential of leaf turgor related measurements for precision irrigation egea et al 2017 made a financial assessment of the three mentioned methods to schedule regulated deficit irrigation in super high density olive orchards and concluded that scheduling irrigation with the zim method i e from leaf turgor related measurements was the most profitable one our results confirm the advantages of the irrigation scheduling approach proposed by padilla díaz et al 2016 among the main ones is that contrarily to sap flow and trunk diameter variations records no data processing is required because the visual analysis of the p p daily curves is enough to identify the state i e the level of water stress of the monitored trees a procedure for the automatic identification of the state shown by daily p p curves based on the use of random forest models has been recently published by fernandes et al 2017 which will facilitate the application of the irrigation scheduling approach to commercial orchards in addition the method can be combined with airborne imagery for the zoning or zonification of the orchard this allows for differential irrigation doses and frequencies depending on the variation in water requirements identified within the orchard finally the combination of leaf turgor related measurements with the 3 day weather forecast allows for an early response of irrigation management to environmental conditions these features confer our irrigation scheduling approach a high potential for precision irrigation which may significantly contribute to the rational water use in super high density olive orchards fernández 2017 fernández et al 2017 the irrigation scheduling approach has however several limitations first caution must be taken when assuming a particular water stress level to the state shown by the p p curve thus marino et al 2016 found lower threshold values of ψ stem for the olive sicilian genotypes nocellara del belice and olivo di mandanici than those reported by fernández et al 2011 and ehrenberger et al 2012 for arbequina trees further studies are then needed to establish the extent at which the ranges of water stress for states 1 3 depend on the cultivar and orchard conditions second neither the 120 increase in the irrigation amount on the first days of periods 1 3 nor the 15 change in the irrigation amount made afterwards have been contrasted against the crop physiology or crop performance the fact that the average coefficient of variation value of the irrigation needs agrees with the 15 percentage of change on the irrigation amount table 2 suggests that this percentage is reasonable this supports that the use of this percentage recommended for our irrigation scheduling approach is suitable for proper irrigation scheduling in orchards similar to our experimental orchard in any case the empirical character of the two percentages adopted in the irrigation scheduling approach may curtail their reliability when applied to other orchards with different conditions third the zim probe does not work properly beyond a certain level of water stress which in our case was reported to be that occurring at ca ψ stem 1 7 mpa this is not limiting for scheduling irrigation on periods 1 2 and 3 because ψ stem is usually greater than 1 7 mpa thanks to the high irrigation amounts applied on those days still state 3 was often found in between periods when the irrigation amounts are low fig 4 and as explained by ehrenberger et al 2012 the information provided by the zim probes on those days is not useful to assess the actual water stress of the trees irrigation scheduling in between periods must relay therefore on a different method padilla díaz et al 2016 suggested that on those days the farmer could use whatever knowledge they have on the orchard water needs this is a rough solution that may lead to imprecise determinations of the irrigation amounts but the impact on the overall irrigation management will be low because of the reduced number of irrigation events on those days in between periods see fig 1 in padilla díaz et al 2016 in any case we are already working on new water stress indicators derived from the p p values recorded at state 3 any advances on this task together with the approach derived by fernandes et al 2017 for the automatic assessment of the daily p p curve state could highly contribute to the use of the proposed irrigation scheduling approach in a context of precision irrigation 5 conclusions our findings on a greater number of variables than those monitored by padilla díaz et al 2016 confirm that the proposed irrigation scheduling approach is suitable to schedule regulated deficit irrigation in hedgerow olive orchards with similar conditions than those used in the present experiments both calculating the irrigation amounts at the beginning of the periods of high sensitivity to water stress periods 1 3 as 120 of the irrigation needs and changing by 15 the irrigation amounts applied for the rest of each period seem to be adequate for keeping non limiting soil water conditions on those periods nonetheless the fact that the values recorded by the zim probes at state 3 are not informative on the actual leaf turgor curtails the suitability of the proposed irrigations scheduling approach to calculate irrigation amounts in between periods it is expected that both recent advances for the automatic identification of the daily p p curve states and further studies on the information provided by the p p records at state 3 will increase the suitability of the proposed irrigation scheduling approach for precision irrigation of hedgerow olive orchards acknowledgements the present study was funded by the spanish ministry

11519,selecting the rootstock in pistachio orchards is one of the most critical decisions mainly in conditions of water scarcity however there are a few works that report the response of pistachio to water stress according to rootstock nowadays ucb i is one of the most important rootstock around the world however its commercial availability and high prices favour the selection of pistacia terebinthus l or pistacia atlantica desf in some regions the aim of this work is to study the water relations of these three rootstocks using cv kerman as scion thirty pots in the second year after budding were subjected to a 28 days water stress period in outdoor conditions irrigation was stopped in the water stress treatments during all the 28 days period the vegetative response was characterised at the end of the experiment the diameter of the rootstock and scion number of leaves and the percentage of leaves trunk and root were measured along the experiment water relations parameters such as midday water potential and midday leaf conductance was measured in order to compare the effect of rootstock and water stress pressure volume curves were measured before and after the water stress period data of vegetative growth suggest that ucb i was the rootstock less affected for water stress because these data were not clearly affected however water relations parameters suggest that p atlantica was the most resistant to water stress conditions according to the results derivate from the pressure volume curves possible mechanisms of response to water stress are discussed keywords pistacia atlantica pistacia terebinthus drought resistance pv curves ucb i 1 introduction pistachio trees pistacia vera l are a very drought and salinity resistant species behboudian et al 1986 although in the main world pistachio producing countries usa and iran orchards are irrigated in other countries such as spain rainfed conditions are not uncommon even in irrigated orchards some periods of water stress could occur due to water scarcity or deficit irrigation schedules in addition the difficulty of pistachio species to root by cutting make grafting the only reliable method to propagate the trees therefore the combination of rootstock and scion could be used to change the drought resistance capacity in the orchard affecting the irrigation water management there are several rootstocks widely used around the world and their selection is sometimes more dependant on availability than on the actual information about their agronomical aptitude pistacia terebinthus l is the most common in australia italy spain and greece couceiro et al 2013 these regions are characterized for having new orchards probably with a limitation in plant availability such as australia and spain and very local and old production such as italy and greece p terebinthus is considered one of the least vigorous yet most resistant to cold pistachio rootstocks ferguson et al 2005 pistacia atlantica desf is native of north africa and was the main rootstock in the early orchards in california ferguson et al 2005 p atlantica is an intermediate rootstock in terms of vigour and cold resistance but it is very sensitive to verticilium wilt thus it is not used as rootstock in usa nowadays ferguson et al 2005 ucb i is an interspecific hybrid with closed pollination of p atlantica and pistacia integerrima steward ex brandis currently ucb i is one of the most important rootstocks in the usa ucb i is more vigorous than p atlantica which is the least susceptible to verticillium wilt while showing the least tolerance to cold among these three rootstocks ferguson et al 2005 knowledge about the influence of rootstocks in the water relations of pistachio trees is very scarce gijón et al 2010 in a potted experiment compared the response of p atlantica p terebinthus and interspecific hybrid p atlantica x p vera to water stress these authors concluded that p atlantica was the most susceptible to water stress although they pointed out that these results could not be considered conclusive due to problems in the development of the trees grafted on p atlantica ferguson et al 2002 in a salinity potted experiment compared the response of p atlantica ucb i and p integerrima they concluded that p integerrima was more sensitive to salinity than p atlantica and ucbi which showed a very similar response they also reported that the leaf conductance of p atlantica was not affected by the salinity stress suggesting a high resistance to these conditions while it declined around 15 in the other two rootstocks these results disagree with the ones obtained by gijón et al 2010 particularly when considering that both experiments were performed with the same scion cv kerman mehdi tounsi et al 2016 using cv mateur on p atlantica and p vera also suggested a greater salinity resistance of the former rootstock trials in irrigation orchards of california reported that cv kerman is more productive on ucb i than p atlantica ferguson et al 2005 in rainfed experiments in spain also with cv kerman p atlantica presented a greater cumulative yield after 12 years than p terebinthus couceiro et al 2013 the selection of the suitable rootstock is very important particularly in limited water conditions however only indirect information about the water relations and drought resistance is available the aim of this work was to study the response of the three rootstocks ucb i p atlantica and p terebinthus commonly used in pistachio orchards in the mediterranean basin to water stress 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the experiment was conducted during the summer of 2013 at la entresierra research station ciudad real spain 3 56 w 39 0 n altitude 640 m in outdoor conditions ciudad real is a city located in the center of spain climate is semiarid values of reference evapotranspiration eto are higher than rainfall during 9 months in the year fig 1 rainfalls occur mainly during autumn and winter with dry summer the average annual rainfall is around 400 mm fig 1 eto is very high in summer with values around 200 mm month 1 in june july and august thirty potted pistachio plants with two year of age pistacia vera l cv kerman were budded onto three different rootstocks pistacia atlantica desf pistacia terebinthus l and ucb i trees grew in 50 l pots filled with a mixture of gravel sand and peat 5 80 and 15 respectively the experiment took place from day of the year doy 178 until doy 246 and consisted in the implementation of 28 days of water stress to half of the pots from doy 200 to doy 228 each pot had 4 drippers 4 lh 1 and was irrigated until slight drainage occurred during the period of irrigation treatment from doy 200 228 stress trees were no irrigated the experimental design was a split plot with 5 replicates the main factor was the rootstock and the secondary factor was irrigation the different combination of the two factors will be named as follows p atlantica control atl c p atlantica stress atl s p terebinthus control ter c p terebinthus stress ter s ucb i control ucb i c ucb i stress ucb i s 2 2 water relations the water relations were measured using midday stem water potential leaf conductance and pressure volume curves the stem water potential was measured weekly between 12 00 and 02 00 p m in leaves covered with aluminium foil for at least 1 h before their removal measurements were made for one leaf per tree using a pressure chamber soil moisture equip santa barbara ca u s a as pistachio leaves exude turpentine a piece of blotting paper was used to determine the end point turpentine cannot moisten blotting paper but the xylem contents can the abaxial leaf conductance gl was measured with a steady state porometer model licor 1600 u k between 12 00 02 00 p m at the central foliole of three sunlit leaves the same dates than water potential measured was performed pressure volume curves pv curves were prepared before and at the end of the stress period three leaves per treatment were collected at predawn placed immediately in plastic bags and taken to the laboratory there they were rehydrated for 1 h by covering the leaf and placing the cut end of the petiole under water a pressure chamber was used to measure the leaf water potential before placing them in the pressure chamber each leaf was wrapped in moist cheesecloth placed in a black plastic bag and weighed hsiao 1990 the actual fresh weight of each water potential determination was assumed to be the leaf weight measured immediately before the insertion of the leaf in the pressure chamber periodic measurements of fresh weight and water potential were taken until the water potential value reached close to 3 5 mpa then leaves were dried pressure volume curves were generated by the free transpiration method hinckley et al 1980 and 1 water potential was plotted versus relative water content rwc rwc was calculated as the ratio between the differences of actual fresh weight and dry weight vs full rehydrated and dry weight the zero turgor point was determined using a graphical analysis considering the lineal portion of the curve it was calculated with the experimental points that resulted in the maximum determination coefficient r2 of the lineal regression the parameters derived from each curve were osmotic potential at full turgor psif osmotic potential at zero turgor psi0 relative water content at zero turgor rwc0 and percentage of the symplastic water content r and tissue elasticity eo data from the pv curves were used to obtain the relationship between the natural logarithms of osmotic potential independent variable and the rwc this relationship provided the osmotic adjustment index oa index and the breaking point bp turner 2006 the oa index is 1 minus the slope of the lineal relationship the oa index varies between 0 and 1 and it is an estimation of the degree of osmotic adjustment the second parameter derived by turner 2006 is the breaking point bp the relationship between the natural logarithms of osmotic potential and the rwc may be constant with no decrease in rwc until a threshold value bp is reached from which that relationship becomes linear lower values of bp mean higher capacity of drought resistance 2 3 additional measurements the number of leaves was counted at the beginning and at the end of the experiment in order to eliminate the variability between trees the relative increment of the number of the leaves was considered the initial value was 100 the diameter of the rootstock and the scion was measured just before the beginning of the water stress period at the end of the water stress period and at the end of the experiment at the end of the experiment the trees were removed of the pot and the root system was cleaned each tree was separated into roots trunk and leaves these three parts were weighed fresh and dried until constant weight at 70 c data were considered as a percentage of the total fresh or dry weight 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses of variance and tukey test sx 8 0 analytical software were performed for treatment comparison percentage data were transformed using the arcsin function treatment differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results irrigation and rootstock treatments affected the water potential fig 2 shows the midday stem water potential throughout the experiment the rootstock factor was significant in different dates of the experiment on day of the year doy 200 221 232 and 239 in these four dates pistacia terebinthus ter were significantly the lowest while ucb i and pistacia atlantica atl were usually no different only on doy 200 ucb i was significantly higher than atl the irrigation factor was also significant only during the period of water stress conditions on doy 210 214 221 228 significant differences between control and trees subjected to stress were found after 10 days of the beginning of the irrigation restriction but these differences disappeared four days after rehydration on the first date of measurement during the period of water stress the midday stem water potential varied from 1 0 mpa to values slightly lower than 3 0 mpa the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant on any of the dates the leaf conductance was also affected by the irrigation and the rootstock fig 3 the effect of the rootstock was more limited than in water potential data and it only was significant on doy 200 and 246 for the entire water stress period on both dates the ucb i was significantly higher than the atl but only higher than the ter on the last date the irrigation treatments were significantly different for the same period as water potential on doy 210 214 221 and 228 the leaf conductance presented a higher variability than the water potential maximum values were measured at the end of the water stress period around 400 mmol m 2 s 1 while the minimum ones were around 40 mmol m 2 s 1 the interaction irrigation rootstock was significant only on doy 221 but the ter tended to present a more severe stomatal closure in comparison to the other two rootstocks throughout the water stress period the final number of leaves is presented as percentage of the total number at the beginning of the experiment fig 4 these data were not affected significantly by the rootstock factor the variability was very high and there were no clear trends however the effect of irrigation was significant in stressed trees all the rootstocks presented values around 100 therefore the increase in the number of leaves was almost low while in control trees the number of leaves increased from 30 to 80 the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant likely due to the great variability however there was a clear trend towards a greater increase in control ucb 1 than in control ter fig 5 shows the diameter growth rate for the rootstock and the scion in the three periods of the experiment two of irrigation and one of water stress the rootstock growth fig 5a was not significantly affected by the type of rootstock in any of the periods considered and this was likely due to the great variability between trees in the periods with no water stress atl tended to show rates higher than ucb i the irrigation had a significant effect during the period of water stress in this period the growth rate decreased sharply in stress trees for all the rootstocks although the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant there was a clear trend towards a greater reduction of the growth rate in ter and especially ucb i rootstocks in comparison with atl during the period of water stress similar results were obtained when the scion growth rate was considered fig 5b the scion growth was higher than the rootstock growth figs 5b vs 4a the rootstock had no significant effects on this parameter in any of the periods however the irrigation had a considerable impact albeit only during the period of water stress the scion growth decreased in all the rootstocks the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant and in this case there were no clear trends the distribution of assimilates at the end of the experiment in leaves trunk and roots was affected by the rootstock and the irrigation treatment fig 6 in all the treatments both in fresh and dry weight the trunk represents more than 50 of the total weight fig 6 the rootstock effect on the fresh weight fig 6a was significant and atl presented the greatest percentage in leaves 31 and trunk 58 while the lowest was shown in roots 11 ucb i and ter rootstocks were not substantially different with around 20 in leaves 50 in trunk and 30 in roots the irrigation treatment was also important in leaves and roots but not in the trunk water stress conditions reduced the weight of leaves but increased that of roots in all the rootstocks although the trunk percentage was not statistically affected there was a slightly trend towards a reduction in all rootstocks in conditions of water stress the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant however there were clear trends of a greater decrease of leaves and increase of roots in atl and ter than in ucb i which remained almost constant the results in dry weight were similar fig 6b the effect of rootstocks was important only in the percentage of leaves and roots atl presented a percentage of dry weight greater in leaves and lower in roots than ter and ucb i which were similar ucb i tended towards a slightly lower percentage in leaves and higher in roots than ter the rootstock did not have a major impact on the percentage of trunk dry weight although atl tended towards higher values than the rest additionally the irrigation was important only in the percentage of leaves and roots dry weight water stress reduced the percentage of leaves dry weight and increased that of roots with no impact on the percentage of trunk dry weight the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant however there were clear trends of greater decrease of leaves and increase in roots in atl and ter than in ucb i which was almost constant ratio between shoots and roots dry weight at the end of the experiment are presented at fig 7 shoots is the sum of leaves and trunk weight the effect of rootstock irrigation treatment and the interaction between them was significant rootstock atl presented a significant greater ratio than the other two water stress conditions reduced the ratio in all rootstocks significantly such reduction was greater in atl than in the other two rootstocks atl reduced around 50 this ratio while ucb and ter presented a similar reduction with only 24 and 30 respectively data of the pressure volume curves pv curves obtained during the period of no stress are presented at table 1 differences were only considerable in the relative water content at the turgor loss point rwc0 and only due to the rootstock effect the atl rootstock presented a substantially lower rwc0 than ucb i while ter was similar for both rootstocks atl presented a rwc0 of 85 while ucb i was 90 there were no major differences in the rest of parameters although some trends could be considered the water potential at turgor loss point psi0 tended towards lower values in atl 2 85 mpa than the other two rootstocks around 2 50 mpa also the osmotic water potential at full turgor psif was clearly lower in atl than in the rest 2 4 mpa vs values slightly higher than 2 0 mpa no clear trends could be identified in elastic modulus e0 and symplastic water r the osmotic adjustment index oa and the breaking point bp were both slightly higher in ter than in atl and ucb i suggesting a faster and more intensive osmotic adjustment data of pv curves during water stress period are presented in table 2 the effect of rootstock was not substantial in this period but that of the irrigation treatment was the relative water content at turgor loss point rwc0 the osmotic potential at full turgor psif and at turgor loss point psi0 and the breaking point bp were lower in stress trees than in control trees for all rootstocks the interaction rootstock irrigation was not major but there were clear trends suggesting a different response to stress according to the rootstocks the psi0 decreased more clearly in ter than in atl or ucb i while the reduction in psif oa index and bp was slightly higher in atl than in the other two on the other hand ucb i tended towards higher values of rwc0 psi0 psif and bp than ter and atl no clear results were obtained for the eo and r data 4 discussion the response of pistachio trees to water stress during the experiment consisted of a great reduction in the water potential and leaf conductance with a severe level of dehydration figs 2 and 3 such level of dehydration reduced the vegetative growth with a very low increase in the number leaves fig 4 and the diameter growth fig 5 during the water stress but this affection of the vegetative growth promoted the increase of the root weight fig 6 pistachio is considered very resistant to water stress and salinity conditions and very high levels of dehydration have been reported behboudian et al 1986 the growth is known to be a process very sensitive to wager stress conditions hsiao 1990 the rehydration capacity is also very important in this species and the water potential and leaf conductance were quickly recovered figs 2 and 3 the data for vegetative growth and water relations suggest that there are different mechanisms of response to water stress based on the rootstock during the water stress period ter tended towards higher levels of dehydration and reduction of leaf conductance than atl and ucb i figs 2 and 3 the differences in the number of leaves was also greater in ter fig 4 but the maximum reduction in the rootstock diameter occurred in ucb i fig 5a with no differential effects measured in the scion diameter fig 5b according to these results ucb i would be the most tolerance to water stress because the vegetative growth of the scion number of leaves and diameter was almost constant for this rootstock even when the water stress level was the same than other rootstocks ter would be the most sensitive due to the greatest reduction in leaf conductance and number of leaves memmi et al 2016a b suggested that ter is more sensitive than atl but gijón et al 2010 reported the opposite the work produced by gijón et al 2010 was carried out with pots and they reported that the atl size was smaller than ter which could affect the conclusions potted experiments could limit in their conclusions because of limited space for root growth which could affect to water relations in addition the speed and level of water stress would be also higher than in field conditions which could change the trees physiological response and therefore the rootstock effect couceiro et al 2013 in rainfed field conditions reported a higher average and cumulative yield in atl than ter for mature trees ferguson et al 2005 reported that ucb i was less tolerant to salinity but more productive than atl in irrigated conditions although salinity and water stress are similar the response of the trees could be different to each stress and not directly comparable these variations in water stress response are likely related with different adaptations according to the pv curves tables 1 and 2 atl were the most resistant rootstocks significantly lower rwc0 trends to lower psi0 and psif in no water stress conditions the pv curves also suggest that ter presented a more efficient osmotic adjustment than the rest of the rootstocks because in conditions of no stress the oa index and the bp tended towards slightly higher values than ucb i or atl table 1 such result is confirmed by the lower psi0 in water stress conditions table 2 the osmotic adjustment is a process that delays the effect of water stress in the plant physiology but it is not imply higher levels of resistance therefore these data suggest two different ways for water stress tolerance mechanisms atl was more resistant than ter as their pv curves showed though the percentage of root weight was clearly lower probably the absorption capacity of the roots in atl was higher than in ter in addition in water stress conditions atl increased the root weight greatly and even though the root weight was still slightly lower than in ter fig 6 the reduction in water potential leaf conductance and number of leaves in ter was higher figs 2 4 the greater capacity of osmotic adjustment of ter over atl could only offset the low level of water stress none of the pv curves indicators analysed suggested that ucb i was the most resistant although according to the vegetative response it could be only the percentage of root weight was clearly higher in ucb i than in the rest ucb i is an interspecific closed hybrid of pistacia atlantica and pistacia integerrima steward ex brandis because pistacia atlantica is one of the parents of ucb i this hybrid could have also a greater root absorption capacity than ter 5 conclusions pistachio is a very drought resistant tree that tolerates high levels of tissue dehydration with a quick capacity of rehydration the data suggest two main mechanisms for this drought resistance the osmotic adjustment was identified in all the rootstocks but in ter it happened earlier and with more intensity than in atl and ucb i atl was apparently the most drought resistant according to parameter of the pv curves and this could be linked to a greater activity of the roots however the response of the vegetative growth number of leaves diameter of the scion suggest that ucb i was even more resistant than atl as ucb i is an interspecific closed hybrid of atl and the percentage of root weight was the greatest a high capacity of water uptake was associated with this conclusion acknowledgement spanish secretary of state of research development and innovation seidi

11519,selecting the rootstock in pistachio orchards is one of the most critical decisions mainly in conditions of water scarcity however there are a few works that report the response of pistachio to water stress according to rootstock nowadays ucb i is one of the most important rootstock around the world however its commercial availability and high prices favour the selection of pistacia terebinthus l or pistacia atlantica desf in some regions the aim of this work is to study the water relations of these three rootstocks using cv kerman as scion thirty pots in the second year after budding were subjected to a 28 days water stress period in outdoor conditions irrigation was stopped in the water stress treatments during all the 28 days period the vegetative response was characterised at the end of the experiment the diameter of the rootstock and scion number of leaves and the percentage of leaves trunk and root were measured along the experiment water relations parameters such as midday water potential and midday leaf conductance was measured in order to compare the effect of rootstock and water stress pressure volume curves were measured before and after the water stress period data of vegetative growth suggest that ucb i was the rootstock less affected for water stress because these data were not clearly affected however water relations parameters suggest that p atlantica was the most resistant to water stress conditions according to the results derivate from the pressure volume curves possible mechanisms of response to water stress are discussed keywords pistacia atlantica pistacia terebinthus drought resistance pv curves ucb i 1 introduction pistachio trees pistacia vera l are a very drought and salinity resistant species behboudian et al 1986 although in the main world pistachio producing countries usa and iran orchards are irrigated in other countries such as spain rainfed conditions are not uncommon even in irrigated orchards some periods of water stress could occur due to water scarcity or deficit irrigation schedules in addition the difficulty of pistachio species to root by cutting make grafting the only reliable method to propagate the trees therefore the combination of rootstock and scion could be used to change the drought resistance capacity in the orchard affecting the irrigation water management there are several rootstocks widely used around the world and their selection is sometimes more dependant on availability than on the actual information about their agronomical aptitude pistacia terebinthus l is the most common in australia italy spain and greece couceiro et al 2013 these regions are characterized for having new orchards probably with a limitation in plant availability such as australia and spain and very local and old production such as italy and greece p terebinthus is considered one of the least vigorous yet most resistant to cold pistachio rootstocks ferguson et al 2005 pistacia atlantica desf is native of north africa and was the main rootstock in the early orchards in california ferguson et al 2005 p atlantica is an intermediate rootstock in terms of vigour and cold resistance but it is very sensitive to verticilium wilt thus it is not used as rootstock in usa nowadays ferguson et al 2005 ucb i is an interspecific hybrid with closed pollination of p atlantica and pistacia integerrima steward ex brandis currently ucb i is one of the most important rootstocks in the usa ucb i is more vigorous than p atlantica which is the least susceptible to verticillium wilt while showing the least tolerance to cold among these three rootstocks ferguson et al 2005 knowledge about the influence of rootstocks in the water relations of pistachio trees is very scarce gijón et al 2010 in a potted experiment compared the response of p atlantica p terebinthus and interspecific hybrid p atlantica x p vera to water stress these authors concluded that p atlantica was the most susceptible to water stress although they pointed out that these results could not be considered conclusive due to problems in the development of the trees grafted on p atlantica ferguson et al 2002 in a salinity potted experiment compared the response of p atlantica ucb i and p integerrima they concluded that p integerrima was more sensitive to salinity than p atlantica and ucbi which showed a very similar response they also reported that the leaf conductance of p atlantica was not affected by the salinity stress suggesting a high resistance to these conditions while it declined around 15 in the other two rootstocks these results disagree with the ones obtained by gijón et al 2010 particularly when considering that both experiments were performed with the same scion cv kerman mehdi tounsi et al 2016 using cv mateur on p atlantica and p vera also suggested a greater salinity resistance of the former rootstock trials in irrigation orchards of california reported that cv kerman is more productive on ucb i than p atlantica ferguson et al 2005 in rainfed experiments in spain also with cv kerman p atlantica presented a greater cumulative yield after 12 years than p terebinthus couceiro et al 2013 the selection of the suitable rootstock is very important particularly in limited water conditions however only indirect information about the water relations and drought resistance is available the aim of this work was to study the response of the three rootstocks ucb i p atlantica and p terebinthus commonly used in pistachio orchards in the mediterranean basin to water stress 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the experiment was conducted during the summer of 2013 at la entresierra research station ciudad real spain 3 56 w 39 0 n altitude 640 m in outdoor conditions ciudad real is a city located in the center of spain climate is semiarid values of reference evapotranspiration eto are higher than rainfall during 9 months in the year fig 1 rainfalls occur mainly during autumn and winter with dry summer the average annual rainfall is around 400 mm fig 1 eto is very high in summer with values around 200 mm month 1 in june july and august thirty potted pistachio plants with two year of age pistacia vera l cv kerman were budded onto three different rootstocks pistacia atlantica desf pistacia terebinthus l and ucb i trees grew in 50 l pots filled with a mixture of gravel sand and peat 5 80 and 15 respectively the experiment took place from day of the year doy 178 until doy 246 and consisted in the implementation of 28 days of water stress to half of the pots from doy 200 to doy 228 each pot had 4 drippers 4 lh 1 and was irrigated until slight drainage occurred during the period of irrigation treatment from doy 200 228 stress trees were no irrigated the experimental design was a split plot with 5 replicates the main factor was the rootstock and the secondary factor was irrigation the different combination of the two factors will be named as follows p atlantica control atl c p atlantica stress atl s p terebinthus control ter c p terebinthus stress ter s ucb i control ucb i c ucb i stress ucb i s 2 2 water relations the water relations were measured using midday stem water potential leaf conductance and pressure volume curves the stem water potential was measured weekly between 12 00 and 02 00 p m in leaves covered with aluminium foil for at least 1 h before their removal measurements were made for one leaf per tree using a pressure chamber soil moisture equip santa barbara ca u s a as pistachio leaves exude turpentine a piece of blotting paper was used to determine the end point turpentine cannot moisten blotting paper but the xylem contents can the abaxial leaf conductance gl was measured with a steady state porometer model licor 1600 u k between 12 00 02 00 p m at the central foliole of three sunlit leaves the same dates than water potential measured was performed pressure volume curves pv curves were prepared before and at the end of the stress period three leaves per treatment were collected at predawn placed immediately in plastic bags and taken to the laboratory there they were rehydrated for 1 h by covering the leaf and placing the cut end of the petiole under water a pressure chamber was used to measure the leaf water potential before placing them in the pressure chamber each leaf was wrapped in moist cheesecloth placed in a black plastic bag and weighed hsiao 1990 the actual fresh weight of each water potential determination was assumed to be the leaf weight measured immediately before the insertion of the leaf in the pressure chamber periodic measurements of fresh weight and water potential were taken until the water potential value reached close to 3 5 mpa then leaves were dried pressure volume curves were generated by the free transpiration method hinckley et al 1980 and 1 water potential was plotted versus relative water content rwc rwc was calculated as the ratio between the differences of actual fresh weight and dry weight vs full rehydrated and dry weight the zero turgor point was determined using a graphical analysis considering the lineal portion of the curve it was calculated with the experimental points that resulted in the maximum determination coefficient r2 of the lineal regression the parameters derived from each curve were osmotic potential at full turgor psif osmotic potential at zero turgor psi0 relative water content at zero turgor rwc0 and percentage of the symplastic water content r and tissue elasticity eo data from the pv curves were used to obtain the relationship between the natural logarithms of osmotic potential independent variable and the rwc this relationship provided the osmotic adjustment index oa index and the breaking point bp turner 2006 the oa index is 1 minus the slope of the lineal relationship the oa index varies between 0 and 1 and it is an estimation of the degree of osmotic adjustment the second parameter derived by turner 2006 is the breaking point bp the relationship between the natural logarithms of osmotic potential and the rwc may be constant with no decrease in rwc until a threshold value bp is reached from which that relationship becomes linear lower values of bp mean higher capacity of drought resistance 2 3 additional measurements the number of leaves was counted at the beginning and at the end of the experiment in order to eliminate the variability between trees the relative increment of the number of the leaves was considered the initial value was 100 the diameter of the rootstock and the scion was measured just before the beginning of the water stress period at the end of the water stress period and at the end of the experiment at the end of the experiment the trees were removed of the pot and the root system was cleaned each tree was separated into roots trunk and leaves these three parts were weighed fresh and dried until constant weight at 70 c data were considered as a percentage of the total fresh or dry weight 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses of variance and tukey test sx 8 0 analytical software were performed for treatment comparison percentage data were transformed using the arcsin function treatment differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results irrigation and rootstock treatments affected the water potential fig 2 shows the midday stem water potential throughout the experiment the rootstock factor was significant in different dates of the experiment on day of the year doy 200 221 232 and 239 in these four dates pistacia terebinthus ter were significantly the lowest while ucb i and pistacia atlantica atl were usually no different only on doy 200 ucb i was significantly higher than atl the irrigation factor was also significant only during the period of water stress conditions on doy 210 214 221 228 significant differences between control and trees subjected to stress were found after 10 days of the beginning of the irrigation restriction but these differences disappeared four days after rehydration on the first date of measurement during the period of water stress the midday stem water potential varied from 1 0 mpa to values slightly lower than 3 0 mpa the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant on any of the dates the leaf conductance was also affected by the irrigation and the rootstock fig 3 the effect of the rootstock was more limited than in water potential data and it only was significant on doy 200 and 246 for the entire water stress period on both dates the ucb i was significantly higher than the atl but only higher than the ter on the last date the irrigation treatments were significantly different for the same period as water potential on doy 210 214 221 and 228 the leaf conductance presented a higher variability than the water potential maximum values were measured at the end of the water stress period around 400 mmol m 2 s 1 while the minimum ones were around 40 mmol m 2 s 1 the interaction irrigation rootstock was significant only on doy 221 but the ter tended to present a more severe stomatal closure in comparison to the other two rootstocks throughout the water stress period the final number of leaves is presented as percentage of the total number at the beginning of the experiment fig 4 these data were not affected significantly by the rootstock factor the variability was very high and there were no clear trends however the effect of irrigation was significant in stressed trees all the rootstocks presented values around 100 therefore the increase in the number of leaves was almost low while in control trees the number of leaves increased from 30 to 80 the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant likely due to the great variability however there was a clear trend towards a greater increase in control ucb 1 than in control ter fig 5 shows the diameter growth rate for the rootstock and the scion in the three periods of the experiment two of irrigation and one of water stress the rootstock growth fig 5a was not significantly affected by the type of rootstock in any of the periods considered and this was likely due to the great variability between trees in the periods with no water stress atl tended to show rates higher than ucb i the irrigation had a significant effect during the period of water stress in this period the growth rate decreased sharply in stress trees for all the rootstocks although the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant there was a clear trend towards a greater reduction of the growth rate in ter and especially ucb i rootstocks in comparison with atl during the period of water stress similar results were obtained when the scion growth rate was considered fig 5b the scion growth was higher than the rootstock growth figs 5b vs 4a the rootstock had no significant effects on this parameter in any of the periods however the irrigation had a considerable impact albeit only during the period of water stress the scion growth decreased in all the rootstocks the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant and in this case there were no clear trends the distribution of assimilates at the end of the experiment in leaves trunk and roots was affected by the rootstock and the irrigation treatment fig 6 in all the treatments both in fresh and dry weight the trunk represents more than 50 of the total weight fig 6 the rootstock effect on the fresh weight fig 6a was significant and atl presented the greatest percentage in leaves 31 and trunk 58 while the lowest was shown in roots 11 ucb i and ter rootstocks were not substantially different with around 20 in leaves 50 in trunk and 30 in roots the irrigation treatment was also important in leaves and roots but not in the trunk water stress conditions reduced the weight of leaves but increased that of roots in all the rootstocks although the trunk percentage was not statistically affected there was a slightly trend towards a reduction in all rootstocks in conditions of water stress the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant however there were clear trends of a greater decrease of leaves and increase of roots in atl and ter than in ucb i which remained almost constant the results in dry weight were similar fig 6b the effect of rootstocks was important only in the percentage of leaves and roots atl presented a percentage of dry weight greater in leaves and lower in roots than ter and ucb i which were similar ucb i tended towards a slightly lower percentage in leaves and higher in roots than ter the rootstock did not have a major impact on the percentage of trunk dry weight although atl tended towards higher values than the rest additionally the irrigation was important only in the percentage of leaves and roots dry weight water stress reduced the percentage of leaves dry weight and increased that of roots with no impact on the percentage of trunk dry weight the interaction irrigation rootstock was not significant however there were clear trends of greater decrease of leaves and increase in roots in atl and ter than in ucb i which was almost constant ratio between shoots and roots dry weight at the end of the experiment are presented at fig 7 shoots is the sum of leaves and trunk weight the effect of rootstock irrigation treatment and the interaction between them was significant rootstock atl presented a significant greater ratio than the other two water stress conditions reduced the ratio in all rootstocks significantly such reduction was greater in atl than in the other two rootstocks atl reduced around 50 this ratio while ucb and ter presented a similar reduction with only 24 and 30 respectively data of the pressure volume curves pv curves obtained during the period of no stress are presented at table 1 differences were only considerable in the relative water content at the turgor loss point rwc0 and only due to the rootstock effect the atl rootstock presented a substantially lower rwc0 than ucb i while ter was similar for both rootstocks atl presented a rwc0 of 85 while ucb i was 90 there were no major differences in the rest of parameters although some trends could be considered the water potential at turgor loss point psi0 tended towards lower values in atl 2 85 mpa than the other two rootstocks around 2 50 mpa also the osmotic water potential at full turgor psif was clearly lower in atl than in the rest 2 4 mpa vs values slightly higher than 2 0 mpa no clear trends could be identified in elastic modulus e0 and symplastic water r the osmotic adjustment index oa and the breaking point bp were both slightly higher in ter than in atl and ucb i suggesting a faster and more intensive osmotic adjustment data of pv curves during water stress period are presented in table 2 the effect of rootstock was not substantial in this period but that of the irrigation treatment was the relative water content at turgor loss point rwc0 the osmotic potential at full turgor psif and at turgor loss point psi0 and the breaking point bp were lower in stress trees than in control trees for all rootstocks the interaction rootstock irrigation was not major but there were clear trends suggesting a different response to stress according to the rootstocks the psi0 decreased more clearly in ter than in atl or ucb i while the reduction in psif oa index and bp was slightly higher in atl than in the other two on the other hand ucb i tended towards higher values of rwc0 psi0 psif and bp than ter and atl no clear results were obtained for the eo and r data 4 discussion the response of pistachio trees to water stress during the experiment consisted of a great reduction in the water potential and leaf conductance with a severe level of dehydration figs 2 and 3 such level of dehydration reduced the vegetative growth with a very low increase in the number leaves fig 4 and the diameter growth fig 5 during the water stress but this affection of the vegetative growth promoted the increase of the root weight fig 6 pistachio is considered very resistant to water stress and salinity conditions and very high levels of dehydration have been reported behboudian et al 1986 the growth is known to be a process very sensitive to wager stress conditions hsiao 1990 the rehydration capacity is also very important in this species and the water potential and leaf conductance were quickly recovered figs 2 and 3 the data for vegetative growth and water relations suggest that there are different mechanisms of response to water stress based on the rootstock during the water stress period ter tended towards higher levels of dehydration and reduction of leaf conductance than atl and ucb i figs 2 and 3 the differences in the number of leaves was also greater in ter fig 4 but the maximum reduction in the rootstock diameter occurred in ucb i fig 5a with no differential effects measured in the scion diameter fig 5b according to these results ucb i would be the most tolerance to water stress because the vegetative growth of the scion number of leaves and diameter was almost constant for this rootstock even when the water stress level was the same than other rootstocks ter would be the most sensitive due to the greatest reduction in leaf conductance and number of leaves memmi et al 2016a b suggested that ter is more sensitive than atl but gijón et al 2010 reported the opposite the work produced by gijón et al 2010 was carried out with pots and they reported that the atl size was smaller than ter which could affect the conclusions potted experiments could limit in their conclusions because of limited space for root growth which could affect to water relations in addition the speed and level of water stress would be also higher than in field conditions which could change the trees physiological response and therefore the rootstock effect couceiro et al 2013 in rainfed field conditions reported a higher average and cumulative yield in atl than ter for mature trees ferguson et al 2005 reported that ucb i was less tolerant to salinity but more productive than atl in irrigated conditions although salinity and water stress are similar the response of the trees could be different to each stress and not directly comparable these variations in water stress response are likely related with different adaptations according to the pv curves tables 1 and 2 atl were the most resistant rootstocks significantly lower rwc0 trends to lower psi0 and psif in no water stress conditions the pv curves also suggest that ter presented a more efficient osmotic adjustment than the rest of the rootstocks because in conditions of no stress the oa index and the bp tended towards slightly higher values than ucb i or atl table 1 such result is confirmed by the lower psi0 in water stress conditions table 2 the osmotic adjustment is a process that delays the effect of water stress in the plant physiology but it is not imply higher levels of resistance therefore these data suggest two different ways for water stress tolerance mechanisms atl was more resistant than ter as their pv curves showed though the percentage of root weight was clearly lower probably the absorption capacity of the roots in atl was higher than in ter in addition in water stress conditions atl increased the root weight greatly and even though the root weight was still slightly lower than in ter fig 6 the reduction in water potential leaf conductance and number of leaves in ter was higher figs 2 4 the greater capacity of osmotic adjustment of ter over atl could only offset the low level of water stress none of the pv curves indicators analysed suggested that ucb i was the most resistant although according to the vegetative response it could be only the percentage of root weight was clearly higher in ucb i than in the rest ucb i is an interspecific closed hybrid of pistacia atlantica and pistacia integerrima steward ex brandis because pistacia atlantica is one
