10160,smart irrigation techniques have the potential for improving water application efficiencies at the farm level thereby helping to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture and providing an economic advantage to farmers here we gauge the willingness of farmers to use smart irrigation techniques in water management by conducting a cross sectional national survey of 678 farmers in lebanon a primary objective was to find out whether farmers are willing to adopt the use of smart irrigation mobile applications in their cultural practices other survey questions were designed to find out the drivers of the willingness or lack thereof descriptive statistics along with simple multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the associations of sociodemographic variables cultivated land water and fuel cost irrigation system type groundwater depth water source and other irrigation management characteristics with the likelihood of using a free smart irrigation application in the study population results revealed that 90 of farmers agree that better irrigation management can improve the economic productivity of their farms and a similar percentage agreed that they are willing to use free smart mobile applications to assist them in managing scheduling irrigation for their crops results also indicated that among all sociodemographic characteristics considered in this study age nationality and region were significantly associated with the use of a paid smart irrigation app willingness to pay was 57 with younger farmers and those using energy or electricity and those paying more for energy and water more willing to pay farmers planting citrus and banana trees were more likely to use smart irrigation apps than those planting other crops such as potatoes and vegetables the findings help identify the factors influencing the adoption of smart irrigation applications in agriculture which will provide insights into the interlinkages between irrigation management and infrastructure and sociodemographic variables keywords precision agriculture smart apps climate smart farming irrigation management middle east and north africa region 1 introduction a sizeable proportion 85 of the total water resources available around the world are exclusively used for irrigation purposes vaishali et al 2017 the smart management of these freshwater resources for precision irrigation in agriculture is essential for enhancing crop yield and water productivity improving irrigation scheduling decreasing farming costs while sustaining the environment dobbs et al 2014 paredes et al 2018 pereira et al 2015 rosa et al 2012 seidel et al 2016 zotarelli et al 2011 jaafar et al 2017 irrigation practices will have to evolve and meet the increasing global demand for water and food smart irrigation techniques have a potential for improving water application efficiencies at the farm level which would help reduce the environmental impact of agriculture and at the same time provide an economic advantage to farmers levidow et al 2014 the adoption of technologies in agriculture especially irrigation technologies can result in improvements in crop yields but many of these technologies require the availability of extension services which still fall short of providing the required expertize to farmers for proper adaptation and implementation in many developing countries farmers do not have enough incentives to adopt such high cost investments on their own mclaren et al 2009 while the costs of some irrigation scheduling systems are decreasing such as sensors web platforms apps and online irrigation services these solutions may still be cost unaffordable if it does not significantly increase farmers income especially with moderate to low profit crops levidow et al 2014 with the advancement of climate based methods in estimating agricultural water requirements and use ou√©draogo et al 2018 irrigation information can be provided for farmers via smartphone applications that can relay such information information about precise irrigation applications and schedules can enhance the resilience of the irrigated agriculture sector under a changing climate padgham 2009 while a significant percentage of agricultural stakeholders in some areas of the world have been reported to be willing to pay for such applications bartlett et al 2015 farmers preferences for using smart irrigation applications are still not well understood incentives for farmers willingness to better manage their irrigations are not always apparent or existing understanding the drivers of improved water management among farmers can lead to improved environmental benefits while at the same time increasing agricultural productivity and improving farmers livelihood the adoption of climate smart agricultural technologies among farmers is marked by commonalities as well as differences with local climate and socio economic characteristics being the significant factors in affecting the adoption khatri chhetri et al 2017 the objective of this study is to identify how sociodemographic and economic variables such as age education and cost of irrigation associate with irrigation decision drivers and farmers perception of water management and a willingness to use smart irrigation apps we assess current irrigation management practices that are implemented by farmers in lebanon and gauge the possibility for farmers adopting an emerging technology in irrigation a smart irrigation mobile app the outcome of this study could potentially help to propose new smart irrigation management approaches that would not only help farmers to better manage their irrigated land but also help them reduce their energy fertilizers and water costs this study will help answer the following questions 1 are the farmers willing to manage their irrigation water 2 are they willing to use some technology to do so how is their perception of technology use namely smart mobile applications affected by their crops irrigation systems water sources and irrigation operation costs 3 do farmers relate better irrigation management to improved crop yields and reduced energy and fertilizers input 2 methods 2 1 data collection procedure a descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted among farmers in lebanon from september 2019 to february 2020 these farmers either operate their farms or work on rented land or land farmed on shares farmers from the main irrigated agricultural areas of lebanon south lebanon akkar nabatiye mount lebanon baalbeck hermel and bekaa governorates were approached farmers who own land over one hectare were the primary sampling unit and selected from an existing list compiled by the ministry of agriculture moa using a stratified random sampling approach the governorates mentioned above formed the various strata farmers within each stratum governorate were chosen randomly from the list of all farmers in that stratum based on probability proportional to size sampling sample size calculations showed that a sample of 577 farmers would be necessary to estimate a prevalence of 50 with a 95 confidence interval ci and at 5 significance level a final sample of 678 farmers was chosen from the moa list to account for a refusal rate of 15 to be eligible to participate in the study the farmer ought to 1 be aged 18 and above 2 own land more than 1 ha because of the difficulty in identifying parcels less than 1 ha on freely available satellite imagery farmers who reported to hold less than this area were excluded from the study 3 have no mental disability that would prevent reading and understanding and 4 be acquainted in either english or arabic languages the study was ethically approved by the institutional review board irb at the american university of beirut prior to the sampling interested farmers who met the eligibility criteria were provided with a consent form that explained the objective of the study procedures to be undertaken potential risks and benefits of participation and all related information farmers were urged to ask any questions regarding the research study or request further clarification before they agree to take part in the survey farmers who agreed to participate had to sign the consent form before the initiation of the study a copy of the consent form was kept with farmers in case they had any complaints or concerns regarding the study farmers were excluded if they refused to give consent for the study further if a farmer in a chosen farm was unable or refused to take part in the study the farmer in the closest farm was approached when more than one eligible farmer was found on the farm one was randomly chosen by the interviewer 2 2 survey instrument the data collection approach was conducted on the selected farm in a private setting a multicomponent questionnaire was filled out by eligible farmers during a face to face interview session which lasted between 10 and 30 min the interview sessions were performed by field workers who underwent intensive training on the application of the interview protocol and administration of the questionnaire before the initiation of the survey the questionnaire was initially developed in english subsequently translated to the arabic language since most of the farmers talked arabic and then back translated to english the two translations were carried out to verify the parallel form reliability of the questionnaire any disagreement that occurred in the back translated version was resolved to provide a precise reading the questionnaire consisted of four sections section 1 included questions linked to sociodemographic and education such as age sex nationality village governorate and the highest level of education attained primary school intermediate school high school university degree or technical section 2 addressed questions related to farmer s cultivated land or agricultural area such as place village number of irrigated plots the area of each plot irrigation decision drivers such as soil moisture based or weather station based irrigation scheduling or cropstress based irrigation scheduling and the irrigation interval another key question related to the farmer s ability to locate their land s on google maps and or satellite imagery using their phone or internet other issues covered type of crop length of the growing season duration in days the distance between trees or plants m the quantity of production ton season or ton ha and hours of irrigation hr specific questions were related to water for irrigation such as hours of flooding hr quantity m3 cost season and fuel for irrigation such as quantity liter or kilowatt and cost season section 3 included questions assessing the farmer s current irrigation system such as water source and capacity river or spring irrigation channel well or purchase water type of the well drill or reservoir characteristics of the well and the pump depth of well m pump size whether it operates using fuel or electricity water pressure psi or bar flow m3 hr pump power h p other questions covered the irrigation network such as the main pipeline size mm lateral size mm lateral length m number of laterals laterals spacing m irrigation systems used solid set sprinkler micro sprinkler periodic move drip bubbler or surface irrigation and whether they have used irrigation metering and control devices the last section of the questionnaire addressed the farmer s attitude towards improving irrigation management and adopting smart irrigation a total of seven questions were selected four of which tackling the view on whether irrigation management helps to increase the yield to reduce the cost of irrigation to reduce the cost of fuel and to reduce the cost of electricity the other three questions related to the farmer s willingness to manage irrigation for their crops better and to use a free or non free smart mobile application to assist them in managing scheduling irrigation system for their crops here the questionnaire employed a 5 point likert rating scale in which 1 denoted strongly disagree and 5 denoted strongly agree a final question in the survey related to the type of information the famer s view to better manage their irrigated land such as innovative irrigation practices equipment irrigation scheduling guidelines standards crop management guidelines crop water requirements or soil management guidelines a pilot study was conducted on a convenient sample of 10 farmers to check for consistency clarity and culture sensitivity the results of the pilot testing phase of the questionnaire were not included in this study a copy of the questionnaire used in data collection is available from the authors upon request 2 3 statistical analysis data entry and statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences spss software version 24 for windows frequencies and proportions were used to describe categorical variables and means standard deviations sd for continuous ones we use the independent t and chi square tests to calculate significant differences among continuous and categorical variables respectively examples of differences are sociodemographic characteristics farmer s ability to locate their land s on google maps using their phone or internet and farmer s likelihood to use a free and or non free smart mobile application to assist them in managing scheduling irrigation system for their crops simple and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to explore which factors are associated with the odds of using a free or non free smart mobile application sociodemographic variables age gender highest educational credential the region of residence number of irrigated plots and irrigation related variables water source hours quantity cost of irrigation and quantity cost of fuel for irrigation were included in the regression model as independent variables the likelihood to use a free and or non free smart mobile application to assist them in managing scheduling irrigation system for their crops which was coded as 0 unlikely combined strongly disagree disagree and neither agree or disagree and 1 likely combined agree and strongly agree was included as the dependent variable all sociodemographic and irrigation related characteristics which were statistically significant in the simple logistic model were incorporated into the multiple one as independent variables the multiple logistic regression model was applied to investigate the associations of the sociodemographic variables cultivated land and irrigation management characteristics with the likelihood of using a free smart irrigation application in the study population the multiple regression analysis was used to estimate the association between a given independent variable and the likelihood of using a free smart irrigation application while controlling for potentially confounding variables that have been used in the model findings from the logistic regression were expressed in terms of odds ratios or and their respective 95 confidence intervals all analyses used in the study were two tailed and a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant farmers imposed no direct input into the design conduct or reporting of the survey 3 results 3 1 description characteristics and statistics 3 1 1 characteristics of the overall study population table 1a displays the sociodemographic

the willingness of farmers to adopt free smart irrigation technologies that require a minimal level of knowledge and skills it focused on different farmers from several agro climatic zones sub humid semi arid and therefore various crops citrus banana tropical fruits other fruit trees field crops vegetables irrigation systems and educational background the cost of irrigation appeared to be a significant factor in willingness to pay survey results showed that farmers who pay more for their irrigations and those who irrigate tree crops were more willing to pay for smart apps specifically farmers who reported using a combination of surface and pressurized irrigation systems were seven times more likely to agree or strongly agree to use a free smart irrigation mobile application which is attributed to the combined cost of surface water from canals and pumped groundwater as well as to the area of the irrigated parcels the lack of a continuous electrical supply forces farmers in lebanon to rely more on diesel which is a more expensive option than oil fuel in lebanon is also heavily taxed a combination of a fixed irrigation interval a 67 reliance on diesel adds to the high irrigation cost per irrigated area with this high energy cost and a majority of farmers agreeing that they can reduce costs by managing their water smart apps in the country have a promising future particularly because 90 and 60 were willing to use a free and paid for smart app respectively although we did not find a direct relation between well depth and the willingness to use a paid smart app it was evident that farmers who are paying more for their irrigation and those who irrigate tree crops are more willing to pay for such smart apps we attribute this to a higher volume of water being pumped per year which we could not verify due to the lack of adoption of flow measurements in the country by the farmers the dependency of most farmers on deep wells for irrigation is the main reason for the high water and energy cost as revealed in the survey results the energy costs for irrigation in lebanon which ranged from 470 to 778 ha are much higher than those in the usa for example which are at 153 ha usda 2018 the fact that farmers who reported using a combination of surface and pressurized irrigation systems were seven times more likely to agree or strongly agree to use a free smart irrigation mobile application is attributed to the combined cost of surface water from canals and pumped groundwater as well as to the extent of irrigated parcels on average the total fuel cost in ha of drip irrigation was 542 4 29 7 for sprinkler and drip irrigation system was 778 7 83 4 for surface and pressurized irrigation was 538 7 55 7 for sprinkler irrigation was 474 3 46 9 and for surface irrigation was 474 7 49 7 a significant association was found between fuel cost and irrigation system post hoc analysis using the bonferroni test revealed that participants using sprinkler and drip irrigation had significantly higher fuel costs compared to participants using any other method of irrigation p 0 001 despite this no significant association was found between the type of irrigation system used by the farmer and the willingness to use the smart app likewise a significant association was found between water cost and irrigation systems post hoc analysis using bonferroni test revealed that participants using drip irrigation had significantly higher water cost compared to sprinkler and drip sprinkler only and surface only 376 2 28 2 ha vs 183 3 37 3 vs 210 3 35 8 vs 217 2 52 4 ha p 0 004 p 0 005 and p 0 013 respectively it is also evident from the results that farmers who are using both drip and sprinkler irrigation are paying the largest cost of water per ha 940 ha yr and more than 70 of these farmers who happen to irrigated citrus and banana trees are willing to pay for a smart irrigation app education was not the major driver for adoption of this technology in lebanon we attribute the willingness to pay for a smart app in the south region of the country to the following the analysis showed a significant association between the geographical area and the major crops in the present study sample in particular a significantly p 0 001 higher proportion of study participants residing in the sub humid south lebanon 95 5 had citrus banana and other tropical fruits crops compared to those with vegetables 3 5 and other fruit trees 1 0 and a significantly greater proportion of participants residing in north lebanon 60 5 had potato crops compared to their counterparts in the semi arid bekaa region a larger number of participants had potato 42 6 fruit trees 31 1 followed by vegetables 26 3 the analysis also showed while there is a significant association between region and education level of lebanese farmers in the present study sample education alone was not a significant driver for adoption for example despite that 48 of farmers in the bekaa had a secondary school education or higher only 42 agreed to pay for a smart app as compared to 73 of farmers in the south of whom only 30 had secondary education or higher the fact that two thirds of the study sample had only intermediate school education may explain why only 52 of the farmers said they were able to locate their land on google maps 5 conclusion this study reveals novel findings in terms of the willingness of farmers to manage their farm water applications and adopt free smart irrigation technologies that will help them do so it can guide as to the profile of farmers that can be targeted when deploying such apps our findings indicate that farmers in lebanon relate better irrigation management to improved crop yields reduced energy and fertilizers input which provides hope for improving economic water productivity in agriculture overall the results of the survey were promising for the future of agricultural water management in a developing and medium to low income country farmers in general are willing to adopt smart irrigation technologies with younger farmers being attracted the most to our knowledge this study is the first national study in the middle east and north africa mena region that targets the willingness of farmers to adopt smart apps in irrigation management and therefore neighboring countries would benefit from these results until similar studies are conducted in the region we showed that while lebanese farmers do not adequately measure or know their crop water requirements and the amount of water applied they seem to be willing to adopt better irrigation management techniques when guided especially in the form of a mobile smart irrigation application although this is a national survey spanning only farmers in the country of lebanon we strongly believe that our survey results can be extended to other countries in the mena region where farmers in such region share similar culture and persona which reflect fundamental similarities in agriculture and irrigation practices we believe the results can guide stakeholders and private sector interested in digital technologies in agriculture in areas in which farmers have similar educational profile plant similar crops rely mainly on groundwater for their irrigations and use similar irrigation methods it is anticipated that academicians researchers policy makers and public officials will frequently refer to these results in comparable settings we showed in this study how complicated the interlinkages between demography age region irrigation system types water source and water costs are and how these factors affect the choice of adopting smart technology most farmers in lebanon are willing to adopt a free app but when it comes to payment the situation gets more complicated as affordability and the added value of irrigation management are not always clear to the farmers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

10160,smart irrigation techniques have the potential for improving water application efficiencies at the farm level thereby helping to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture and providing an economic advantage to farmers here we gauge the willingness of farmers to use smart irrigation techniques in water management by conducting a cross sectional national survey of 678 farmers in lebanon a primary objective was to find out whether farmers are willing to adopt the use of smart irrigation mobile applications in their cultural practices other survey questions were designed to find out the drivers of the willingness or lack thereof descriptive statistics along with simple multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the associations of sociodemographic variables cultivated land water and fuel cost irrigation system type groundwater depth water source and other irrigation management characteristics with the likelihood of using a free smart irrigation application in the study population results revealed that 90 of farmers agree that better irrigation management can improve the economic productivity of their farms and a similar percentage agreed that they are willing to use free smart mobile applications to assist them in managing scheduling irrigation for their crops results also indicated that among all sociodemographic characteristics considered in this study age nationality and region were significantly associated with the use of a paid smart irrigation app willingness to pay was 57 with younger farmers and those using energy or electricity and those paying more for energy and water more willing to pay farmers planting citrus and banana trees were more likely to use smart irrigation apps than those planting other crops such as potatoes and vegetables the findings help identify the factors influencing the adoption of smart irrigation applications in agriculture which will provide insights into the interlinkages between irrigation management and infrastructure and sociodemographic variables keywords precision agriculture smart apps climate smart farming irrigation management middle east and north africa region 1 introduction a sizeable proportion 85 of the total water resources available around the world are exclusively used for irrigation purposes vaishali et al 2017 the smart management of these freshwater resources for precision irrigation in agriculture is essential for enhancing crop yield and water productivity improving irrigation scheduling decreasing farming costs while sustaining the environment

demand for water and food smart irrigation techniques have a potential for improving water application efficiencies at the farm level which would help reduce the environmental impact of agriculture and at the same time provide an economic advantage to farmers levidow et al 2014 the adoption of technologies in agriculture especially irrigation technologies can result in improvements in crop yields but many of these technologies require the availability of extension services which still fall short of providing the required expertize to farmers for proper adaptation and implementation in many developing countries farmers do not have enough incentives to adopt such high cost investments on their own mclaren et al 2009 while the costs of some irrigation scheduling systems are decreasing such as sensors web platforms apps and online irrigation services these solutions may still be cost unaffordable if it does not significantly increase farmers income especially with moderate to low profit crops levidow et al 2014 with the advancement of climate based methods in estimating agricultural water requirements and use ou√©draogo et al 2018 irrigation information can be provided for farmers via smartphone applications that can relay such information information about precise irrigation applications and schedules can enhance the resilience of the irrigated agriculture sector under a changing climate padgham 2009 while a significant percentage of agricultural stakeholders in some areas of the world have been reported to be willing to pay for such applications bartlett et al 2015 farmers preferences for using smart irrigation applications are still not well understood incentives for farmers willingness to better manage their irrigations are not always apparent or existing understanding the drivers of improved water management among farmers can lead to improved environmental benefits while at the same time increasing agricultural productivity and improving farmers livelihood the adoption of climate smart agricultural technologies among farmers is marked by commonalities as well as differences with local climate and socio economic characteristics being the significant factors in affecting the adoption khatri chhetri et al 2017 the objective of this study is to identify how sociodemographic and economic variables such as age education and cost of irrigation associate with irrigation decision drivers and farmers perception of water management and a willingness to use smart irrigation apps we assess current irrigation management practices that are implemented by farmers in lebanon and gauge the possibility for farmers adopting an emerging technology in irrigation a smart irrigation mobile app the outcome of this study could potentially help to propose new smart irrigation management approaches that would not only help farmers to better manage their irrigated land but also help them reduce their energy fertilizers and water costs this study will help answer the following questions 1 are the farmers willing to manage their irrigation water 2 are they willing to use some technology to do so how is their perception of technology use namely smart mobile applications affected by their crops irrigation systems water sources and irrigation operation costs 3 do farmers relate better irrigation management to improved crop yields and reduced energy and fertilizers input 2 methods 2 1 data collection procedure a descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted among farmers in lebanon from september 2019 to february 2020 these farmers either operate their farms or work on rented land or land farmed on shares farmers from the main irrigated agricultural areas of lebanon south lebanon akkar nabatiye mount lebanon baalbeck hermel and bekaa governorates were approached farmers who own land over one hectare were the primary sampling unit and selected from an existing list compiled by the ministry of agriculture moa using a stratified random sampling approach the governorates mentioned above formed the various strata farmers within each stratum governorate were chosen randomly from the list of all farmers in that stratum based on probability proportional to size sampling sample size calculations showed that a sample of 577 farmers would be necessary to estimate a prevalence of 50 with a 95 confidence interval ci and at 5 significance level a final sample of 678 farmers was chosen from the moa list to account for a refusal rate of 15 to be eligible to participate in the study the farmer ought to 1 be aged 18 and above 2 own land more than 1 ha because of the difficulty in identifying parcels less than 1 ha on freely available satellite imagery farmers who reported to hold less than this area were excluded from the study 3 have no mental disability that would prevent reading and understanding and 4 be acquainted in either english or arabic languages the study was ethically approved by the institutional review board irb at the american university of beirut prior to the sampling interested farmers who met the eligibility criteria were provided with a consent form that explained the objective of the study procedures to be undertaken potential risks and benefits of participation and all related information farmers were urged to ask any questions regarding the research study or request further clarification before they agree to take part in the survey farmers who agreed to participate had to sign the consent form before the initiation of the study a copy of the consent form was kept with farmers in case they had any complaints or concerns regarding the study farmers were excluded if they refused to give consent for the study further if a farmer in a chosen farm was unable or refused to take part in the study the farmer in the closest farm was approached when more than one eligible farmer was found on the farm one was randomly chosen by the interviewer 2 2 survey instrument the data collection approach was conducted on the selected farm in a private setting a multicomponent questionnaire was filled out by eligible farmers during a face to face interview session which lasted between 10 and 30 min the interview sessions were performed by field workers who underwent intensive training on the application of the interview protocol and administration of the questionnaire before the initiation of the survey the questionnaire was initially developed in english subsequently translated to the arabic language since most of the farmers talked arabic and then back translated to english the two translations were carried out to verify the parallel form reliability of the questionnaire any disagreement that occurred in the back translated version was resolved to provide a precise reading the questionnaire consisted of four sections section 1 included questions linked to sociodemographic and education such as age sex nationality village governorate and the highest level of education attained primary school intermediate school high school university degree or technical section 2 addressed questions related to farmer s cultivated land or agricultural area such as place village number of irrigated plots the area of each plot irrigation decision drivers such as soil moisture based or weather station based irrigation scheduling or cropstress based irrigation scheduling and the irrigation interval another key question related to the farmer s ability to locate their land s on google maps and or satellite imagery using their phone or internet other issues covered type of crop length of the growing season duration in days the distance between trees or plants m the quantity of production ton season or ton ha and hours of irrigation hr specific questions were related to water for irrigation such as hours of flooding hr quantity m3 cost season and fuel for irrigation such as quantity liter or kilowatt and cost season section 3 included questions assessing the farmer s current irrigation system such as water source and capacity river or spring irrigation channel well or purchase water type of the well drill or reservoir characteristics of the well and the pump depth of well m pump size whether it operates using fuel or electricity water pressure psi or bar flow m3 hr pump power h p other questions covered the irrigation network such as the main pipeline size mm lateral size mm lateral length m number of laterals laterals spacing m irrigation systems used solid set sprinkler micro sprinkler periodic move drip bubbler or surface irrigation and whether they have used irrigation metering and control devices the last section of the questionnaire addressed the farmer s attitude towards improving irrigation management and adopting smart irrigation a total of seven questions were selected four of which tackling the view on whether irrigation management helps to increase the yield to reduce the cost of irrigation to reduce the cost of fuel and to reduce the cost of electricity the other three questions related to the farmer s willingness to manage irrigation for their crops better and to use a free or non free smart mobile application to assist them in managing scheduling irrigation system for their crops here the questionnaire employed a 5 point likert rating scale in which 1 denoted strongly disagree and 5 denoted strongly agree a final question in the survey related to the type of information the famer s view to better manage their irrigated land such as innovative irrigation practices equipment irrigation scheduling guidelines standards crop management guidelines crop water requirements or soil management guidelines a pilot study was conducted on a convenient sample of 10 farmers to check for consistency clarity and culture sensitivity the results of the pilot testing phase of the questionnaire were not included in this study a copy of the questionnaire used in data collection is available from the authors upon request 2 3 statistical analysis data entry and statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences spss software version 24 for windows frequencies and proportions were used to describe categorical variables and means standard deviations sd for continuous ones we use the independent t and chi square tests to calculate significant differences among continuous and categorical variables respectively examples of differences are sociodemographic characteristics farmer s ability to locate their land s on google maps using their phone or internet and farmer s likelihood to use a free and or non free smart mobile application to assist them in managing scheduling irrigation system for their crops simple and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to explore which factors are associated with the odds of using a free or non free smart mobile application sociodemographic variables age gender highest educational credential the region of residence number of irrigated plots and irrigation related variables water source hours quantity cost of irrigation and quantity cost of fuel for irrigation were included in the regression model as independent variables the likelihood to use a free and or non free smart mobile application to assist them in managing scheduling irrigation system for their crops which was coded as 0 unlikely combined strongly disagree disagree and neither agree or disagree and 1 likely combined agree and strongly agree was included as the dependent variable all sociodemographic and irrigation related characteristics which were statistically significant in the simple logistic model were incorporated into the multiple one as independent variables the multiple logistic regression model was applied to investigate the associations of the sociodemographic variables cultivated land and irrigation management characteristics with the likelihood of using a free smart irrigation application in the study population the multiple regression analysis was used to estimate the association between a given independent variable and the likelihood of using a free smart irrigation application while controlling for potentially confounding variables that have been used in the model findings from the logistic regression were expressed in terms of odds ratios or and their respective 95 confidence intervals all analyses used in the study were two tailed and a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant farmers imposed no direct input into the design conduct or reporting of the survey 3 results 3 1 description characteristics and statistics 3 1 1 characteristics of the overall study population table 1a displays the sociodemographic

the willingness of farmers to adopt free smart irrigation technologies that require a minimal level of knowledge and skills it focused on different farmers from several agro climatic zones sub humid semi arid and therefore various crops citrus banana tropical fruits other fruit trees field crops vegetables irrigation systems and educational background the cost of irrigation appeared to be a significant factor in willingness to pay survey results showed that farmers who pay more for their irrigations and those who irrigate tree crops were more willing to pay for smart apps specifically farmers who reported using a combination of surface and pressurized irrigation systems were seven times more likely to agree or strongly agree to use a free smart irrigation mobile application which is attributed to the combined cost of surface water from canals and pumped groundwater as well as to the area of the irrigated parcels the lack of a continuous electrical supply forces farmers in lebanon to rely more on diesel which is a more expensive option than oil fuel in lebanon is also heavily taxed a combination of a fixed irrigation interval a 67 reliance on diesel adds to the high irrigation cost per irrigated area with this high energy cost and a majority of farmers agreeing that they can reduce costs by managing their water smart apps in the country have a promising future particularly because 90 and 60 were willing to use a free and paid for smart app respectively although we did not find a direct relation between well depth and the willingness to use a paid smart app it was evident that farmers who are paying more for their irrigation and those who irrigate tree crops are more willing to pay for such smart apps we attribute this to a higher volume of water being pumped per year which we could not verify due to the lack of adoption of flow measurements in the country by the farmers the dependency of most farmers on deep wells for irrigation is the main reason for the high water and energy cost as revealed in the survey results the energy costs for irrigation in lebanon which ranged from 470 to 778 ha are much higher than those in the usa for example which are at 153 ha usda 2018 the fact that farmers who reported using a combination of surface and pressurized irrigation systems were seven times more likely to agree or strongly agree to use a free smart irrigation mobile application is attributed to the combined cost of surface water from canals and pumped groundwater as well as to the extent of irrigated parcels on average the total fuel cost in ha of drip irrigation was 542 4 29 7 for sprinkler and drip irrigation system was 778 7 83 4 for surface and pressurized irrigation was 538 7 55 7 for sprinkler irrigation was 474 3 46 9 and for surface irrigation was 474 7 49 7 a significant association was found between fuel cost and irrigation system post hoc analysis using the bonferroni test revealed that participants using sprinkler and drip irrigation had significantly higher fuel costs compared to participants using any other method of irrigation p 0 001 despite this no significant association was found between the type of irrigation system used by the farmer and the willingness to use the smart app likewise a significant association was found between water cost and irrigation systems post hoc analysis using bonferroni test revealed that participants using drip irrigation had significantly higher water cost compared to sprinkler and drip sprinkler only and surface only 376 2 28 2 ha vs 183 3 37 3 vs 210 3 35 8 vs 217 2 52 4 ha p 0 004 p 0 005 and p 0 013 respectively it is also evident from the results that farmers who are using both drip and sprinkler irrigation are paying the largest cost of water per ha 940 ha yr and more than 70 of these farmers who happen to irrigated citrus and banana trees are willing to pay for a smart irrigation app education was not the major driver for adoption of this technology in lebanon we attribute the willingness to pay for a smart app in the south region of the country to the following the analysis showed a significant association between the geographical area and the major crops in the present study sample in particular a significantly p 0 001 higher proportion of study participants residing in the sub humid south lebanon 95 5 had citrus banana and other tropical fruits crops compared to those with vegetables 3 5 and other fruit trees 1 0 and a significantly greater proportion of participants residing in north lebanon 60 5 had potato crops compared to their counterparts in the semi arid bekaa region a larger number of participants had potato 42 6 fruit trees 31 1 followed by vegetables 26 3 the analysis also showed while there is a significant association between region and education level of lebanese farmers in the present study sample education alone was not a significant driver for adoption for example despite that 48 of farmers in the bekaa had a secondary school education or higher only 42 agreed to pay for a smart app as compared to 73 of farmers in the south of whom only 30 had secondary education or higher the fact that two thirds of the study sample had only intermediate school education may explain why only 52 of the farmers said they were able to locate their land on google maps 5 conclusion this study reveals novel findings in terms of the willingness of farmers to manage their farm water applications and adopt free smart irrigation technologies that will help them do so it can guide as to the profile of farmers that can be targeted when deploying such apps our findings indicate that farmers in lebanon relate better irrigation management to improved crop yields reduced energy and fertilizers input which provides hope for improving economic water productivity in agriculture overall the results of the survey were promising for the future of agricultural water management in a developing and medium to low income country farmers in general are willing to adopt smart irrigation technologies with younger farmers being attracted the most to our knowledge this study is the first national study in the middle east and north africa mena region that targets the willingness of farmers to adopt smart apps in irrigation management and therefore neighboring countries would benefit from these results until similar studies are conducted in the region we showed that while lebanese farmers do not adequately measure or know their crop water requirements and the amount of water applied they seem to be willing to adopt better irrigation management techniques when guided especially in the form of a mobile smart irrigation application although this is a national survey spanning only farmers in the country of lebanon we strongly believe that our survey results can be extended to other countries in the mena region where farmers in such region share similar culture and persona which reflect fundamental similarities in agriculture and irrigation practices we believe the results can guide stakeholders and private sector interested in digital technologies in agriculture in areas in which farmers have similar educational profile plant similar crops rely mainly on groundwater for their irrigations and use similar irrigation methods it is anticipated that academicians researchers policy makers and public officials will frequently refer to these results in comparable settings we showed in this study how complicated the interlinkages between demography age region irrigation system types water source and water costs are and how these factors affect the choice of adopting smart technology most farmers in lebanon are willing to adopt a free app but when it comes to payment the situation gets more complicated as affordability and the added value of irrigation management are not always clear to the farmers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

10161,moistube irrigation mti is a newly developed irrigation technique which uses semipermeable membranes to deliver water to the root zone precisely and slowly the major objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different parameters operating pressure head placement depth of moistube of mti on infiltration behaviors and irrigation efficiency in clay loam soil the results show that hydrus 2d model had a high accuracy in simulating water movement under mti operating pressure head had substantial effect on the infiltration behaviors the discharge of moistube and the wetting area in soil increased with the increasing operating pressure heads placement depth of moistube appreciably affected the time when wetting fronts reached the surface and bottom boundaries but had little effect on the discharge of moistube and advancing velocity of wetting fronts irrigation intensity was dominated by operating pressure head high operating pressure head would decrease the capacity of water saving while low pressure head may reduce crop yield burying the moistube at half the depth of the crop root zone is recommended for high irrigation efficiency when irrigating in clay loam soil this study is expected to promote the understanding of mti and bear some recommendations for improving water use efficiency in crop production keywords sub surface irrigation moistube irrigation hydrus 2d operating pressure head placement depth water use efficiency 1 introduction due to the growing competition for water among agricultural municipal and industrial users kandelous et al 2011 water scarcity has become an increasing problem in today s irrigated agriculture consequently irrigated agriculture is required to continuously improve the water use efficiency with the limited fresh water resources ayars et al 2015 two immediate approaches are the use of alternatives of fresh water and the application of water saving irrigation techniques hassanli et al 2010 during the last several decades many water saving irrigation techniques have been proposed among which sub surface irrigation is well recognized to be an efficient irrigation technique that has been broadly employed in many regions and gained a lot of interests bainbridge 2001 sub surface irrigation can be divided into many types according to different emitters such as drip irrigation porous pipe irrigation and pitcher irrigation among others mart√≠nez de azagra paredes and del r√≠o san jos√© 2019 singh et al 2006 siyal et al 2013 under sub surface irrigation water is directly delivered to the root zone at slow rates by the emitters installed underground while avoiding water logging of top soils thereby markedly reducing the surface evaporation runoff and deep percolation jordan et al 2014 romero et al 2004 yao et al 2011 sub surface irrigation especially sub surface drip irrigation has been evaluated in a variety of agronomic and vegetable crops and proved to be capable of improving water use efficiency without compromising crop yield ahmed et al 2015 mart√≠nez gimeno et al 2018 parthasarathi et al 2018 h zhang et al 2017 sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2002 compared the effect of sub surface drip irrigation and surface drip irrigation on sugar beet crop performance and reported that sub surface drip irrigation resulted in higher yield and sugar content with less water use by comparing sub surface drip irrigation with flood irrigation godoy avila et al 2003 found that sub surface drip irrigation improved the yield of alfalfa by 16 23 with 32 51 less water another comparison conducted in a citrus orchard by mart√≠nez gimeno et al 2018 indicated that sub surface drip irrigation saved 23 water on average as opposed to surface drip irrigation while no significant differences were observed in either yield or fruit composition apart from improving water use efficiency other advantages of sub surface irrigation have also been found and highlighted such as preventing weeds growth mitigating soil n2o emissions and facilitating the use of degraded quality water palacios d√≠az et al 2009 provenzano 2007 wei et al 2018 ye et al 2018 moistube irrigation mti is a new type of high efficient sub surface irrigation technique originated in china similar to porous pipe in sub surface irrigation the moistube buried underground functions as a conduit pipe as well as an emitter during operation fig 1 shows the three generations of the moistube the second generation moistube has more stable discharge and higher mechanical strength than the first generation moistube the third generation moistube was developed based on the second generation and the discharge stability has been further enhanced zou et al 2017 the moistube is made of polymer semipermeable membranes with densely distributed nano pores about 1 10 5 pores per square centimeter fan et al 2018 since the pores are at nanoscale the moistube will be hardly clogged by soil particles or other substances larger than nanoscale the irrigation water is emitted from moistube due to the difference of the water potential between inside and outside the tube previous studies involving laboratory experiments have shown that the discharge of moistube is proportional to the difference of the water potential niu et al 2013 niu et al 2017 xue et al 2013a this means if the irrigation system is well designed and managed mti can supply water to root zone precisely and continuously under low pressure with the discharge being automatically adjusted according to soil moisture condition which can reduce the cost of manual management additionally due to the auto regulative capability of mti the water status of soil can be maintained at appropriate levels with small fluctuations which is beneficial for crop growth sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 taken together mti is a promising sub surface irrigation technique with high potential in saving water it attracted some researchers attention in recent years bi et al 2018 kanda et al 2020a niu et al 2017 k m zhang et al 2017 niu et al 2017 clarified that the effect of influencing factors on the discharge of moistube was in the order of operating pressure soil bulk density initial soil water content based on correlation analysis and variance analysis kanda et al 2018 investigated the hydraulic and clogging characteristics of mti as affected by suspended solids in irrigation water sun et al 2019 revealed the distribution characteristics of water fertilizer in wetted soil under moistube fertigation based on a series of indoor soil box infiltration experiments however this technique has not received the attention it deserves in general so far there is limited information about mti how to optimize mti system for improving the water use efficiency by adjusting design or management parameters including operating pressure placement depth of moistube and placement spacing of moistube among others is still unclear and thus in need of investigation hydrus 2d was developed for simulating two dimensional movement of water solute and heat in variably saturated porous media ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2012 it has been successfully used in modeling water or solute movement for sub surface irrigation conditions by many researchers for instance siyal and skaggs 2009 compared the simulated with hydrus 2d and measured wetting patterns under sub surface porous clay pipe irrigation and reported that they were in good agreements r 2 0 98 provenzano 2007 simulated sub surface drip irrigation using hydrus 2d and found the simulated matric potential values corresponded well with the measured values similarly kandelous and ≈°im≈Ønek 2010 assessed the accuracy of hydru 2d in modeling water distributions in clay loam soil under sub surface drip irrigation by comparing the simulated and observed results they found that the root mean square error at different locations was negligible varying between 0 011 and 0 045 for volumetric water contents and between 0 98 and 4 36 cm for wetting dimensions cai et al 2018 concluded that hydrus 2d could be used to simulate water movement under sub surface irrigation with ceramic emitters based on the satisfactory agreement kanda et al 2020b concluded that the soil water dynamics of mti under loamy sand and sandy loam can be precisely simulated by hydrus 2d generally speaking research on the use of hydrus 2d in simulation for mti is relatively sparse to date the specific objectives of this study were i to assess the suitability of hydrus 2d for simulation of water movement in clay loam soil under mti ii to investigate the effects of operating pressure head and placement depth of moistube on infiltration behaviors and iii to evaluate the irrigation efficiency of mti with different parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments 2 1 1 water infiltration experiment a water infiltration experiment was carried out indoors at hohai university in nanjing 31¬∫57 n 118¬∫50 e jiangsu province china the soil used in this study was collected from the upper 20 cm layer of the experimental field it is classified as clay loam which is the typical soil in nanjing city and the surrounding areas properties of the tested soil are shown in table 1 following loosening by a rotary cultivator the soil in the field was sieved through a 3 mm aperture screen mesh then it was left air dried the average gravimetric water content was 10 prior to the infiltration experiment the experimental setup mainly consisted of a plexiglas soil tank 60 cm 5 cm 55 cm and a mti system fig 2 the air dried soil was uniformly backfilled into the tank with an average dry bulk density of 1 25 g cm3 the final height of the soil specimen was controlled at 50 cm the moistube used in this study was the third generation moistube fig 1c produced by the shenzhen moistube irrigation co ltd as stated above this tube has high mechanical strength and stability of discharge a 5 cm long moistube was installed at a depth of 23 cm during soil backfilling the moistube was connected to a mariotte bottle which supplied water with a constant pressure head 120 cm in this study they jointly functioned as a simple mti system during operation the tube bulged due to the inside water pressure and the cross section was actually an ellipse close to a circle 1 5 cm in inside diameter the evolution of wetting front was captured by a digital camera fixed in front of the tank and the infiltration amount was obtained from the variation of liquid level in the mariotte bottle the total infiltration amount was controlled at 1000 ml after infiltration the water content of soil profile was measured by tdr time domain reflectometry the tdr model is tdr mux mpts which was developed by the institute of agrophysics polish academy of sciences ia pas the laboratory miniprobes on the tdr instrument were calibrated before the experiment the potential evaporation rate was monitored based on open water evaporation measurement for the collected images of the wetting front the core 60 cm 50 cm was cropped and resized to a resolution of 6000 5000 0 1 mm pixel 1 owing to the strong contrast in color between the wet and dry soil these two zones were easily segmented by employing an automatic threshold algorithm named otsu otsu 1979 then the images were transformed into binary images in which the wet zone was white the pixel value equals to 1 while the dry zone was black the pixel value equals to 0 based on the binary images the wetting area and advancing distance of wetting fronts were computed by morphological algorithms all these operations were performed in matlab r2016a by programing based on the intrinsic image processing functions 2 1 2 hydraulic conductivity of moistube another experiment was conducted indoors to measure the moistube hydraulic conductivity by monitoring the discharge of moistube in air under different pressure heads a 10 cm long moistube was connected to a mariotte bottle via a rubber pipe the height of mariotte bottle was adjusted to supply different operating pressure heads ranging from 0 to 150 cm the discharge of moistube was measured according to the variation of liquid level of the mariotte bottle the discharge of moistube per unit length at different pressure heads is plotted in fig 3 a linear relationship is observed between the two variables 1 q 3 4232 10 4 h where q is the discharge of moistube per unit length ml min 1 cm 1 h is the pressure head supplied by the mariotte bottle cm the discharge of moistube is dependent on the difference of water potential between inside and outside the tube the moistube could be considered as a barrier through which water has to flow from high potential inside to low potential outside therefore we could try to describe the relationship between the discharge of moistube and the difference of water potential based on darcy s law 2 q k s h 1 Œ¥ œÄ d where q is the discharge of moistube per unit length k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of moistube h 1 is the difference of water potential between inside and outside of moistube Œ¥ is the thickness of moistube d is the diameter of moistube here Œ¥ 0 1 cm d 1 5 cm when the moistube is exposed to air the difference of water potential between inside and outside of the moistube h 1 is equal to the pressure head supplied by the mariotte bottle h therefore the saturated hydraulic conductivity of moistube could be derived with eqs 1 and 2 k s 7 26 10 6 cm min 1 2 1 3 soil hydraulic properties the characteristic of soil water retention was derived by the suction plate method m1 0802e eijkelkamp the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s of soil was measured by the constant head method 2 2 hydrus 2d simulations 2 2 1 numerical modeling theory water movement under mti is simulated using the hydrus 2d software package ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2012 it solves the richards equation by galerkin finite element method assuming the soil is homogeneous and isotropic the water movement can be considered a two dimensional process in the direction along the moistube the governing richards equation is written as follows 3 Œ∏ t x k h h x z k h h z k h z where Œ∏ is volumetric water content l3 l 3 h is soil water pressure head l t is time t x and z are respectively horizontal and vertical space coordinate l k is hydraulic conductivity l t 1 the soil hydraulic properties are described by the van genuchten mualem model as follows van genuchten 1980 4 Œ∏ h Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± h n m h 0 Œ∏ s h 0 5 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where Œ∏ r and Œ∏ s are respectively the residual and saturated water content l3 l 3 Œ± is an empirical parameter that is approximately equal to the inverse of the air entry value l 1 n m and l are shape parameters unitless m 1 1 n k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 s e is the effective saturation s e Œ∏ Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 2 2 2 input hydraulic parameters the hydraulic parameters of the tested soil were determined by fitting the data of soil water retention with the van genuchten mualem model using the software of retc schaap et al 2001 for the moistube the saturated hydraulic conductivity has been determined from the laboratory experiment the value of Œ± is supposed to be very small to ensure that the moistube was saturated throughout the whole process and since the thickness of the moistube is very small and the moistube remains saturated during infiltration the other parameters Œ∏ r Œ∏ s n l are not sensitive factors for simulated results siyal and skaggs 2009 the values of hydraulic parameters of the soil and the moistube are listed in table 2 2 2 3 system geometry the depth of the active root zone for certain crops was assumed to be 50 cm in order to study the deep percolation during irrigation a deeper soil profile with a depth of 60 cm was used in the simulations the width of the computational domain was 60 cm for model validation while it was 40 cm for model prediction based on a hypothesis that the moistube in field was installed at a spacing of 40 cm due to the bilateral symmetry only the right side of the vertical cross section was simulated with the moistube located at the depth of d cm for model validation d 23 cm for model prediction d 10 15 20 25 30 cm on the left side of the rectangular computational domain fig 4 the moistube was included in the flow domain represented by a half circular wall with a thickness of 0 1 cm the domain within and near the moistube wall was discretized with smaller spacing 2 2 4 initial and boundary conditions the initial soil water content values were set uniform across the flow domain the water content was converted to pressure head based on the soil water retention curve given by eq 4 using the parameter values for the soil listed in table 2 for model validation the soil water content was 0 125 cm3 cm 3 and the corresponding pressure head was 8000 cm for model prediction the soil water content was 0 150 cm3 cm 3 and the corresponding pressure head was 2760 cm the moistube is initially saturated hence the values of all nodes were set as zero except for the internal boundary the internal boundary of the moistube was assigned constant head of which the value was variable according to the pressure heads in specified simulation conditions the remaining part of the left boundary and the right boundary were assigned no flux an atmospheric boundary condition was used for the surface boundary for model validation the potential evaporation rate was 0 058 cm d 1 which was measured during water infiltration experiment for model prediction the potential evaporation rate was 0 500 cm d 1 daily variations in the evaporation rate were not considered the bottom boundary was set as free drainage it must be mentioned that in all simulations the wetting fronts did not reach the bottom boundary at the end of irrigation thus in fact the bottom boundary condition had little effect on the water movement 2 3 evaluation of model simulation the agreement of the hydrus 2d simulation results with the measured data was quantified using the mean relative error mre the normalized root mean square error nrmse cai et al 2018 and the index of agreement ia willmott 1982 6 mre 1 n i 1 n s i m i m i 7 nrmse 1 m 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 8 ia 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n s i m m i m 2 where n is the total number of data points s i and m i are respectively the i th simulated and measured data point m is the mean of the measured data mre simply reflects the bias under estimation or overestimation in the simulated data nrmse gives the overall measure of deviation degree of the simulated and measured results ia ranges from 0 to 1 with higher value indicating better agreement between the two results specifically satisfactory model performances are obtained when mre and nrmse are very small and ia is close to 1 2 4 model prediction and simulation treatments the infiltration behaviors under mti are likely to be affected by the design and management parameters therefore predictions of 25 treatments with five levels of operating pressure heads 50 cm 75 cm 100 cm 125 cm 150 cm and also five levels of placement depth of moistube 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm 30 cm were implemented by model simulation to investigate the effects of different parameters on infiltration behaviors the irrigation duration was set to 120 h 2 5 evaluation indices of irrigation efficiency based on the results of predictions irrigation efficiency for the treatments was evaluated using application efficiency e a wang et al 1996 irrigation uniformity that was adopted by the christiansen s coefficient of uniformity e u and ratio of effective infiltration volume e v qi et al 2020 they are calculated as follows 9 e a v s v d 100 v s v d v l v e 10 e u 1 1 n Œ∏ i Œ∏ k Œ∏ 100 11 e v v w v t 100 where v s is the volume of water stored in root zone v d is the volume of water delivered to root zone v l is the volume of water loss during irrigation including surface evaporation and deep percolation v e is the volume of basic surface evaporation which was determined from simulation without the moistube Œ∏ is the mean of soil water content of the root zone Œ∏ i is the soil water content at measuring point i k is the total number of measuring points v w is the volume of soil where water infiltrate in root zone v t is the total volume of the root zone the volume of soil where water infiltrate was calculated by programmed morphological algorithms in matlab r2016a based on the resulting images in hydrus 2d 3 results 3 1 validation of the hydrus model comparisons between the measured and simulated cumulative infiltration amount horizontal wetting front and soil water distribution are shown in fig 5 a good agreement is obtained between the simulated and measured cumulative infiltration amount with the values of mre nrmse and ia respectively being 0 075 0 085 and 0 995 which reflects that the cumulative infiltration of mti can be well predicted by the hydrus 2d model simulation for reasons of brevity only the data of horizontal wetting front are presented in this study the plot also shows the similar patterns of wetting front evolution in the measured and simulated results the wetting front propagated quickly at the early stage of infiltration however as the infiltration proceeded the advancing velocity of wetting front gradually decreased the values of mre nrmse and ia are 0 065 0 110 and 0 979 respectively indicating a slight deviation between the measured and simulated wetting front evolution besides it was observed that the water distribution in the measured and simulated condition was very similar with the irrigation water concentrated in the layers near the moistube the values of mre nrmse and ia are 0 042 0 092 and 0 976 respectively which reveals that the model is well suited for simulating the water distribution under mti the values of mre in these three aspects show that the model underestimates the cumulative infiltration amount and wetting front evolution while it overestimates the soil water content however the absolute values of mre are below 0 15 the nrmse values are less than 0 20 and ia values are close to 1 indicating that both the underestimation and the overestimation are very slight and can be neglected based on the comparison between the measured and simulated cumulative infiltration amount horizontal wetting front and soil water distribution it can be concluded that hydrus 2d model gives highly accurate predictions of water movement under mti and is suitable for investigating the optimization of mti system 3 2 predicted infiltration behaviors under different parameters 3 2 1 operating pressure head fig 6a shows the predicted discharge of moistube versus irrigation time for different operating pressure heads note that the discharge of moistube is equal to infiltration rate for brevity only the data of treatments with placement depth of 20 cm are given it was observed that the operating pressure head had substantial effect on the discharge of moistube the discharge of moistube was very different across the treatments with different operating pressure heads and was in the order of 150 cm 125 cm 100 cm 75 cm 50 cm all the time during the irrigation the discharge increased with the increasing pressure heads because the higher pressure head enlarged the difference of water potential between inside and outside the moistube which dominated the flux of moistube meanwhile it was found that in general the discharge of moistube for all treatments showed the similar trend throughout the irrigation specifically the discharge was relatively large at the beginning of irrigation but it fell quickly in less than 10 h and afterwards gradually decreased until the end of irrigation the soil was initially dry with the soil water potential being 2760 cm the low soil water potential resulted in a very large difference of water potential between inside and outside the moistube and thus a large discharge of moistube however once the soil around the moistube was moistened the soil water potential rapidly increased markedly reducing the difference of water potential as well as the discharge as the infiltration proceeded the increment of soil water potential was progressively decreasing so that the decline in the discharge of moistube slowed down after several hours fig 6b fig 7 presents the predicted wetting patterns in the root zone after 120 h for different operating pressure heads for simplicity only the data of treatments with placement depth of 20 cm are given the horizontal wetting front for all treatments has already arrived at the right boundary of the flow domain which meant that the irrigation water from adjacent moistubes has intersected in less than 120 h as expected the wetting area in soil increased as the operating pressure head increased because the discharge of moistube was accelerated by the higher pressure head with regard to soil water distribution it was clearly observed that in general the soil water content was very high near the moistube and decreased with the distance away from the tube for all pressure heads 3 2 2 placement depth of moistube fig 8 shows the predicted total discharge of moistube after 120 h irrigation for different placement depths of moistube for a given operating pressure head the relative difference in the total discharge between treatments of different placement depths was less than 3 5 indicating that the total discharge for treatments with different placement depths of moistube was very close to each other in fact the discharge of moistube for different placement depths was similar all the time during irrigation data not shown these results signified that the placement depth of moistube unlike the operating pressure head had little effect on the discharge of moistube on the other hand it was observed that the total discharge of moistube for placement depth of 10 cm was slightly larger than the others which was probably due to the effect of evaporation on water movement the actual evaporation rate was bound to be larger when the moistube was buried at a very shallow depth fig 9 presents the predicted wetting patterns in the root zone at varying times during irrigation for different placement depths of moistube under the operating pressure head of 100 cm the wetting geometries across these treatments were nearly identical during the early stage when the wetting fronts did not reach the boundaries they were all close to semi circles though the downward wetting fronts advanced slightly faster than the upward wetting fronts due to the effect of gravitational potential besides the size of wetting area for the treatments was also close to each other before encountering the boundaries in other words the wetting fronts advanced almost at the same speeds despite the difference in placement depth of moistube therefore the horizontal wetting fronts in these treatments all arrived at the right boundary after about 72 h however it was clearly observed that the placement depth of moistube appreciably influenced the time when the wetting fronts arrived at the surface and bottom boundaries the wetting front arrived at the soil surface after about 24 h when the placement depth was 10 cm whereas the surface was still not moistened at the end of the irrigation when the placement depth was 30 cm on the other hand compared with the treatments with shallower placement depths the wetting front in the treatments with deeper placement depths was more prone to reach the bottom of the root zone giving rise to the deep percolation this influence resulted in the distinct wetting patterns after 120 h irrigation among the treatments which would in large part dominate the irrigation efficiency 3 3 irrigation efficiency fig 10 presents the application efficiency and water loss for all treatments the lowest application efficiency was found in treatments with placement depth of 10 cm the values were approximately 75 suggesting that almost a quarter of irrigation water was lost during the irrigation the largest values of application efficiency were found in treatments with placement depth of 25 cm which were close to 100 in general the value of application efficiency increased as the placement depth of moistube increased when the placement depth was less than 25 cm which was because the shallower placement depths resulted in more evaporation loss all the values for treatments with placement depth of 20 and 30 cm exceeded 90 and they were nearly identical under a given operating pressure head however it was noteworthy that the treatments with placement depth of 30 cm had caused deep percolation and the water loss caused by deep percolation was larger than the evaporation loss due to the deep placement depth the irrigation water was more prone to reach below the root zone on the whole the application efficiency decreased with the increasing pressure heads this was because larger pressure head increased the discharge of moistube and expanded the wetting area supplying more water to the soil surface however the treatments with placement depth of 10 cm was an exception due to the very shallow placement depth the evaporation amount was very large even though the operating pressure head was only 50 cm as the operating pressure head increased the proportion of increased evaporation was less than that of increased irrigation amount therefore the application efficiency increased with the increasing pressure heads when the moistube was buried at a depth of 10 cm for clarity 3d contour views of irrigation uniformity and ratio of effective infiltration volume are plotted based on the values of 25 treatments fig 11 it was clearly observed that the values of irrigation uniformity ranged from 71 9 to 83 1 and the highest value was derived from the treatment with operating pressure head of 150 cm and placement depth of 25 cm while the lowest value was found in the treatment with operating pressure head of 50 cm and placement depth of 10 cm in general the value of irrigation uniformity rose as the operating pressure head increased which was primarily because the higher pressure head effectively enlarged the wetting area in soil thereby reducing the difference in water content between soils near and away from the moistube besides for a given pressure head the irrigation uniformity firstly increased with the placement depth and reached the peak values at a placement depth of 25 cm and then began to decrease as the placement depth increased as can be seen in fig 11 the 3d contour view of ratio of effective infiltration volume is very similar to that of irrigation uniformity specifically the value of the ratio was positively correlated with the operating pressure head in addition the ratio increased with the increasing placement depth of moistube within 10 25 cm and once the placement depth exceeded 25 cm the ratio began to decrease as the depth increased the lowest value of ratio of effective infiltration volume was 54 90 which was found in the treatment with operating pressure head of 50 cm and placement depth of moistube of 10 cm indicating that only about half of the volume of root zone was irrigated after 120 h irrigation the treatment with pressure head of 150 cm and placement depth of 25 cm exhibited the highest value of the ratio that approached 98 which meant almost the entire root zone was moistened after the irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 effect of different parameters on infiltration behaviors the simulation results revealed that operating pressure head had significant effect on the infiltration behaviors of mti the discharge of moistube and the wetting area in soil increased with the increasing operating pressure head because the difference of water potential between inside and outside moistube was enlarged by the increasing pressure head which was analogous to the results in previous studies bi et al 2018 xue et al 2013a for a given operating pressure head the discharge of moistube was nearly identical across treatments with different placement depths indicating placement depth of moistube had little effect on the discharge of moistube this was because the soil matric potential was similar across the treatments despite the different placement depths similar phenomenon was observed in niu et al 2013 s experiment where there was no significant difference in cumulative infiltration amounts among treatments with placement depth of 5 10 and 15 cm however they found that the cumulative infiltration amount was obviously lower when the placement depth was 20 cm that was probably because the surrounding soil pressure caused severe deformation of the moistube and impacted the discharge stability the tube they used in the experiment was the first generation moistube which had low mechanical strength and unstable discharge performance for a given operating pressure head and irrigation duration the wetting area in soil was very similar in size and shape before wetting fronts reached boundary in treatments with different placement depths of moistube it indicated that placement depth of moistube also had little effect on the advancing velocity of wetting front which was also because the placement depth did not cause appreciable change of the matric potential of ambient soil across treatments this phenomenon coincided with the observation of siyal and skaggs 2009 who conducted similar simulation for sub surface porous pipe irrigation and found that placement depth of the porous pipe did not affect the extent of horizontal wetting 4 2 optimization of mti system this study adopts application efficiency irrigation uniformity and ratio of effective infiltration volume to evaluate irrigation efficiency application efficiency mainly reflects the capacity for water saving while irrigation uniformity and ratio of effective infiltration volume appreciably affect crop growth and yield hence it is expected to simultaneously get high values of these three indices in a treatment which means high irrigation efficiency and also suggests high water use efficiency without compromising yield it must be mentioned that the cases simulated in this study were continuous mti for five days apparently had the irrigation duration been set as another values the irrigation efficiency would have been different nevertheless some useful suggestions for optimizing mti system could be derived from the evaluation of irrigation efficiency the evaluation of irrigation efficiency showed that both operating pressure head and placement depth of moistube had substantial effects on application efficiency irrigation uniformity and ratio of effective infiltration volume the application efficiency decreased with the increasing operating pressure heads except for treatments with placement depth of 10 cm while the irrigation uniformity and the ratio of effective infiltration volume increased as the operating pressure head increased these results suggested that too high and too low operating pressure head will result in a decreased capacity for water saving and a decline in crop yield respectively how to determine appropriate operating pressure heads under which benefits from water saving and crop yield are both satisfactory depends on crop types degree of water scarcity and so on and is beyond the scope of this study further studies are needed to weigh the benefits from water saving and crop yield for specific regions it must be mentioned that the effect of operating pressure head on irrigation efficiency originated from the dependence of discharge of moistube on the pressure head this study demonstrates that operating pressure head had dominant effect on the discharge of moistube while placement depth of moistube had little which meant that irrigation intensity of mti was determined by the pressure head thus the determination of operating pressure head should take into consideration the water requirement of crop in priority with regard to the placement depth of moistube it was found that all the three indices achieved highest values when the placement depth was 25 cm as mentioned in section 3 2 2 placement depth of moistube did not affect the advancing velocity of wetting front besides due to the relatively good water retention capacity of clay loam soil and that the water movement in soil under mti is mainly driven by soil suction sun et al 2018 the ratio of length to width of wetting area was close to one fig 9 as a result 25 cm was the most reasonable placement depth in this study when the placement depth was 20 cm the surface evaporation was obviously increased when the placement depth was 30 cm the irrigation uniformity and the ratio of effective infiltration volume was decreased and evidently the risk of deep percolation was apparently increased therefore burying moistube at half the depth of active root zone is recommended when designing mti system in soils with good water retention capacity which will be conducive to improve water use efficiency 4 3 competitive edges of mti based on the results of this study it could be reasonably inferred that mti has strong competitive edges compared to other sub surface irrigation techniques due to the low hydraulic conductivity of moistube water is emitted from the tube at very slow rates which allows continuous irrigation during crop growth by using this technique sun et al 2018 have conducted a field experiment on tomato to investigate the effects of continuous irrigation on plant yield and water use efficiency by comparing with intermittent irrigation they found that intermittent irrigation caused large fluctuations of soil water content thus giving rise to high water uptake and redundant transpiration of the plant while continuous irrigation treatment did not cause that and consequently improved plant yield as well as water use efficiency at both leaf and yield level besides mti has less negative effect on soil aeration soil aeration is very important for the normal growth of crops bhattarai et al 2006 zhao et al 2018 for soil oxygen deficiency can cause damages to crops by dramatically reducing root respiration and the efficiency of cellular adenosine triphosphate production fukao and bailey serres 2004 zhu et al 2019 many studies have shown that sub surface irrigation such as drip irrigation ceramic emitter irrigation intensively supplies water to root zone causing the soil air to be replaced by water and even leading to saturated zone around the emitter thereby impeding the root growth ben gal et al 2004 bhattarai et al 2008 cai et al 2018 chen et al 2010 warrick and shani 1996 zhu et al 2019 by contrast under long term mti the soil around moistube will hardly become saturated because there is little probability of the discharge of moistube being larger than the maximum infiltration capacity of soil unless the operating pressure head is too high in this study in fact the values of soil water potential around moistube for all treatments were negative after 120 h irrigation though only the data of treatments with placement depth of 20 cm are shown in fig 6 the ultimate soil water potential in the treatment with operating pressure head of 150 cm and placement depth of 20 cm was approximately 28 cm corresponding soil water content was 0 37 cm3 cm 3 and from the trend of the curve it could be reasonably inferred that even if the irrigation continued the soil water potential around moistube would not reach zero in a short time therefore mti can mitigate the negative effect of soil oxygen deficiency during irrigation as opposed to other sub surface irrigation techniques moreover mti reduces the risk of deep percolation due to the slow discharge of moistube the water movement after seepage from moistube is mainly driven by soil suction not gravity sun et al 2018 the content of gravity driven water is decreased under mti in contrast to other irrigation techniques which leads to slow downward infiltration and thus a decrease in the risk of deep percolation especially in soils containing macropores which provide preferential flow paths for movement of gravity driven water wang et al 2018 in recent years some studies have been carried out to compare the actual effect of mti with other conventional water saving irrigation techniques by field experiments he et al 2012 found that the water use efficiency of mti was higher than that of drip irrigation under mulch and mti was beneficial for the maize seed development xue et al 2013b reported that compared with drip irrigation mti increased the plant height and the stem diameter of tomato by 6 36 and 3 11 respectively and the yield and water use efficiency were also higher under mti a study conducted by m z zhang et al 2017 showed that the water use efficiency was significantly increased for both summer maize and winter wheat under mti than sub surface drip irrigation though mti decreased the maize yield li et al 2019 found that mti significantly increased the water use efficiency for tomato in contrast to drip irrigation and concluded that high yield and water use efficiency could be obtained simultaneously when the operating pressure head was 200 cm to sum up mti is a promising irrigation technique with apparent competitive edges and evidently further research on the design and management of mti system for specific regions and crops is required to maximize the benefit of this technique 5 summary and conclusions moistube irrigation mti is a newly developed efficient sub surface irrigation technique this study investigated the effects of operating pressure head and placement depth of moistube on infiltration behaviors and irrigation efficiency by hydraulically characterizing the moistube hydrus 2d model was used to simulate water movement under mti the validity of model was confirmed by the good agreement between the simulated results cumulative infiltration amount horizontal wetting front and soil water distribution and experimental results simulations with hydrus 2d showed that infiltration behaviors were appreciably affected by the operating pressure head higher operating pressure head enlarged the difference of the water potential between inside and outside moistube leading to larger discharge of moistube and wetting area in soil placement depth of moistube affected the vertical position of wetting area while had little effect on the discharge of moistube and the advancing velocity of wetting fronts evaluation of irrigation efficiency revealed that large operating pressure head would result in waste of irrigation water while low pressure head may limit crop growth irrigation intensity was determined by the operating pressure head thus water demand of crop should be taken into consideration firstly in management of operating pressure head it is recommended to bury the moistube at half the depth of crop root zone for achieving high irrigation efficiency when irrigating in clay loam soil this study also suggested some other competitive edges of mti as opposed to other sub surface irrigation techniques such as capability of continuous irrigation relieving soil oxygen deficiency and reducing deep percolation our findings will be useful for further understanding of mti and

10161,moistube irrigation mti is a newly developed irrigation technique which uses semipermeable membranes to deliver water to the root zone precisely and slowly the major objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different parameters operating pressure head placement depth of moistube of mti on infiltration behaviors and irrigation efficiency in clay loam soil the results show that hydrus 2d model had a high accuracy in simulating water movement under mti operating pressure head had substantial effect on the infiltration behaviors the discharge of moistube and the wetting area in soil increased with the increasing operating pressure heads placement depth of moistube appreciably affected the time when wetting fronts reached the surface and bottom boundaries but had little effect on the discharge of moistube and advancing velocity of wetting fronts irrigation intensity was dominated by operating pressure head high operating pressure head would decrease the capacity of water saving while low pressure head may reduce crop yield burying the moistube at half the depth of the crop root zone is recommended for high irrigation efficiency when irrigating in clay loam soil this study is expected to promote the understanding of mti and bear some recommendations for improving water use efficiency in crop production keywords sub surface irrigation moistube irrigation hydrus 2d operating pressure head placement depth water use efficiency 1 introduction due to the growing competition for water among agricultural municipal and industrial users kandelous et al 2011 water scarcity has become an increasing problem in today s irrigated agriculture consequently irrigated agriculture is required to continuously improve the water use efficiency with the limited fresh water resources ayars et al 2015 two immediate approaches are the use of alternatives of fresh water and the application of water saving irrigation techniques hassanli et al 2010 during the last several decades many water saving irrigation techniques have been proposed among which sub surface irrigation is well recognized to be an efficient irrigation technique that has been broadly employed in many regions and gained a lot of interests bainbridge 2001 sub surface irrigation can be divided into many types according to different emitters such as drip irrigation porous pipe irrigation and pitcher irrigation among others mart√≠nez de azagra paredes and del r√≠o san jos√© 2019 singh et al 2006 siyal et al 2013 under sub surface irrigation water is directly delivered to the root zone at slow rates by the emitters installed underground while avoiding water logging of top soils thereby markedly reducing the surface evaporation runoff and deep percolation jordan et al 2014 romero et al 2004 yao et al 2011 sub surface irrigation especially sub surface drip irrigation has been evaluated in a variety of agronomic and vegetable crops and proved to be capable of improving water use efficiency without compromising crop yield ahmed et al 2015 mart√≠nez gimeno et al 2018 parthasarathi et al 2018 h zhang et al 2017 sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2002 compared the effect of sub surface drip irrigation and surface drip irrigation on sugar beet crop performance and reported that sub surface drip irrigation resulted in higher yield and sugar content with less water use by comparing sub surface drip irrigation with flood irrigation godoy avila et al 2003 found that sub surface drip irrigation improved the yield of alfalfa by 16 23 with 32 51 less water another comparison conducted in a citrus orchard by mart√≠nez gimeno et al 2018 indicated that sub surface drip irrigation saved 23 water on average as opposed to surface drip irrigation while no significant differences were observed in either yield or fruit composition apart from improving water use efficiency other advantages of sub surface irrigation have also been found and highlighted such as preventing weeds growth mitigating soil n2o emissions and facilitating the use of degraded quality water palacios d√≠az et al 2009 provenzano 2007 wei et al 2018 ye et al 2018 moistube irrigation mti is a new type of high efficient sub surface irrigation technique originated in china similar to porous pipe in sub surface irrigation the moistube buried underground functions as a conduit pipe as well as an emitter during operation fig 1 shows the three generations of the moistube the second generation moistube has more stable discharge and higher mechanical strength than the first generation moistube the third generation moistube was developed based on the second generation and the discharge stability has been further enhanced zou et al 2017 the moistube is made of polymer semipermeable membranes with densely distributed nano pores about 1 10 5 pores per square centimeter fan et al 2018 since the pores are at nanoscale the moistube will be hardly clogged by soil particles or other substances larger than nanoscale the irrigation water is emitted from moistube due to the difference of the water potential between inside and outside the tube previous studies involving laboratory experiments have shown that the discharge of moistube is proportional to the difference of the water potential niu et al 2013 niu et al 2017 xue et al 2013a this means if the irrigation system is well designed and managed mti can supply water to root zone precisely and continuously under low pressure with the discharge being automatically adjusted according to soil moisture condition which can reduce the cost of manual management additionally due to the auto regulative capability of mti the water status of soil can be maintained at appropriate levels with small fluctuations which is beneficial for crop growth sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 taken together mti is a promising sub surface irrigation technique with high potential in saving water it attracted some researchers attention in recent years bi et al 2018 kanda et al 2020a niu et al 2017 k m zhang et al 2017 niu et al 2017 clarified that the effect of influencing factors on the discharge of moistube was in the order of operating pressure soil bulk density initial soil water content based on correlation analysis and variance analysis kanda et al 2018 investigated the hydraulic and clogging characteristics of mti as affected by suspended solids in irrigation water sun et al 2019 revealed the distribution characteristics of water fertilizer in wetted soil under moistube fertigation based on a series of indoor soil box infiltration experiments however this technique has not received the attention it deserves in general so far there is limited information about mti how to optimize mti system for improving the water use efficiency by adjusting design or management parameters including operating pressure placement depth of moistube and placement spacing of moistube among others is still unclear and thus in need of investigation hydrus 2d was developed for simulating two dimensional movement of water solute and heat in variably saturated porous media ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2012 it has been successfully used in modeling water or solute movement for sub surface irrigation conditions by many researchers for instance siyal and skaggs 2009 compared the simulated with hydrus 2d and measured wetting patterns under sub surface porous clay pipe irrigation and reported that they were in good agreements r 2 0 98 provenzano 2007 simulated sub surface drip irrigation using hydrus 2d and found the simulated matric potential values corresponded well with the measured values similarly kandelous and ≈°im≈Ønek 2010 assessed the accuracy of hydru 2d in modeling water distributions in clay loam soil under sub surface drip irrigation by comparing the simulated and observed results they found that the root mean square error at different locations was negligible varying between 0 011 and 0 045 for volumetric water contents and between 0 98 and 4 36 cm for wetting dimensions cai et al 2018 concluded that hydrus 2d could be used to simulate water movement under sub surface irrigation with ceramic emitters based on the satisfactory agreement kanda et al 2020b concluded that the soil water dynamics of mti under loamy sand and sandy loam can be precisely simulated by hydrus 2d generally speaking research on the use of hydrus 2d in simulation for mti is relatively sparse to date the specific objectives of this study were i to assess the suitability of hydrus 2d for simulation of water movement in clay loam soil under mti ii to investigate the effects of operating pressure head and placement depth of moistube on infiltration behaviors and iii to evaluate the irrigation efficiency of mti with different parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments 2 1 1 water infiltration experiment a water infiltration experiment was carried out indoors at hohai university in nanjing 31¬∫57 n 118¬∫50 e jiangsu province china the soil used in this study was collected from the upper 20 cm layer of the experimental field it is classified as clay loam which is the typical soil in nanjing city and the surrounding areas properties of the tested soil are shown in table 1 following loosening by a rotary cultivator the soil in the field was sieved through a 3 mm aperture screen mesh then it was left air dried the average gravimetric water content was 10 prior to the infiltration experiment the experimental setup mainly consisted of a plexiglas soil tank 60 cm 5 cm 55 cm and a mti system fig 2 the air dried soil was uniformly backfilled into the tank with an average dry bulk density of 1 25 g cm3 the final height of the soil specimen was controlled at 50 cm the moistube used in this study was the third generation moistube fig 1c produced by the shenzhen moistube irrigation co ltd as stated above this tube has high mechanical strength and stability of discharge a 5 cm long moistube was installed at a depth of 23 cm during soil backfilling the moistube was connected to a mariotte bottle which supplied water with a constant pressure head 120 cm in this study they jointly functioned as a simple mti system during operation the tube bulged due to the inside water pressure and the cross section was actually an ellipse close to a circle 1 5 cm in inside diameter the evolution of wetting front was captured by a digital camera fixed in front of the tank and the infiltration amount was obtained from the variation of liquid level in the mariotte bottle the total infiltration amount was controlled at 1000 ml after infiltration the water content of soil profile was measured by tdr time domain reflectometry the tdr model is tdr mux mpts which was developed by the institute of agrophysics polish academy of sciences ia pas the laboratory miniprobes on the tdr instrument were calibrated before the experiment the potential evaporation rate was monitored based on open water evaporation measurement for the collected images of the wetting front the core 60 cm 50 cm was cropped and resized to a resolution of 6000 5000 0 1 mm pixel 1 owing to the strong contrast in color between the wet and dry soil these two zones were easily segmented by employing an automatic threshold algorithm named otsu otsu 1979 then the images were transformed into binary images in which the wet zone was white the pixel value equals to 1 while the dry zone was black the pixel value equals to 0 based on the binary images the wetting area and advancing distance of wetting fronts were computed by morphological algorithms all these operations were performed in matlab r2016a by programing based on the intrinsic image processing functions 2 1 2 hydraulic conductivity of moistube another experiment was conducted indoors to measure the moistube hydraulic conductivity by monitoring the discharge of moistube in air under different pressure heads a 10 cm long moistube was connected to a mariotte bottle via a rubber pipe the height of mariotte bottle was adjusted to supply different operating pressure heads ranging from 0 to 150 cm the discharge of moistube was measured according to the variation of liquid level of the mariotte bottle the discharge of moistube per unit length at different pressure heads is plotted in fig 3 a linear relationship is observed between the two variables 1 q 3 4232 10 4 h where q is the discharge of moistube per unit length ml min 1 cm 1 h is the pressure head supplied by the mariotte bottle cm the discharge of moistube is dependent on the difference of water potential between inside and outside the tube the moistube could be considered as a barrier through which water has to flow from high potential inside to low potential outside therefore we could try to describe the relationship between the discharge of moistube and the difference of water potential based on darcy s law 2 q k s h 1 Œ¥ œÄ d where q is the discharge of moistube per unit length k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of moistube h 1 is the difference of water potential between inside and outside of moistube Œ¥ is the thickness of moistube d is the diameter of moistube here Œ¥ 0 1 cm d 1 5 cm when the moistube is exposed to air the difference of water potential between inside and outside of the moistube h 1 is equal to the pressure head supplied by the mariotte bottle h therefore the saturated hydraulic conductivity of moistube could be derived with eqs 1 and 2 k s 7 26 10 6 cm min 1 2 1 3 soil hydraulic properties the characteristic of soil water retention was derived by the suction plate method m1 0802e eijkelkamp the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s of soil was measured by the constant head method 2 2 hydrus 2d simulations 2 2 1 numerical modeling theory water movement under mti is simulated using the hydrus 2d software package ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2012 it solves the richards equation by galerkin finite element method assuming the soil is homogeneous and isotropic the water movement can be considered a two dimensional process in the direction along the moistube the governing richards equation is written as follows 3 Œ∏ t x k h h x z k h h z k h z where Œ∏ is volumetric water content l3 l 3 h is soil water pressure head l t is time t x and z are respectively horizontal and vertical space coordinate l k is hydraulic conductivity l t 1 the soil hydraulic properties are described by the van genuchten mualem model as follows van genuchten 1980 4 Œ∏ h Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± h n m h 0 Œ∏ s h 0 5 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where Œ∏ r and Œ∏ s are respectively the residual and saturated water content l3 l 3 Œ± is an empirical parameter that is approximately equal to the inverse of the air entry value l 1 n m and l are shape parameters unitless m 1 1 n k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 s e is the effective saturation s e Œ∏ Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 2 2 2 input hydraulic parameters the hydraulic parameters of the tested soil were determined by fitting the data of soil water retention with the van genuchten mualem model using the software of retc schaap et al 2001 for the moistube the saturated hydraulic conductivity has been determined from the laboratory experiment the value of Œ± is supposed to be very small to ensure that the moistube was saturated throughout the whole process and since the thickness of the moistube is very small and the moistube remains saturated during infiltration the other parameters Œ∏ r Œ∏ s n l are not sensitive factors for simulated results siyal and skaggs 2009 the values of hydraulic parameters of the soil and the moistube are listed in table 2 2 2 3 system geometry the depth of the active root zone for certain crops was assumed to be 50 cm in order to study the deep percolation during irrigation a deeper soil profile with a depth of 60 cm was used in the simulations the width of the computational domain was 60 cm for model validation while it was 40 cm for model prediction based on a hypothesis that the moistube in field was installed at a spacing of 40 cm due to the bilateral symmetry only the right side of the vertical cross section was simulated with the moistube located at the depth of d cm for model validation d 23 cm for model prediction d 10 15 20 25 30 cm on the left side of the rectangular computational domain fig 4 the moistube was included in the flow domain represented by a half circular wall with a thickness of 0 1 cm the domain within and near the moistube wall was discretized with smaller spacing 2 2 4 initial and boundary conditions the initial soil water content values were set uniform across the flow domain the water content was converted to pressure head based on the soil water retention curve given by eq 4 using the parameter values for the soil listed in table 2 for model validation the soil water content was 0 125 cm3 cm 3 and the corresponding pressure head was 8000 cm for model prediction the soil water content was 0 150 cm3 cm 3 and the corresponding pressure head was 2760 cm the moistube is initially saturated hence the values of all nodes were set as zero except for the internal boundary the internal boundary of the moistube was assigned constant head of which the value was variable according to the pressure heads in specified simulation conditions the remaining part of the left boundary and the right boundary were assigned no flux an atmospheric boundary condition was used for the surface boundary for model validation the potential evaporation rate was 0 058 cm d 1 which was measured during water infiltration experiment for model prediction the potential evaporation rate was 0 500 cm d 1 daily variations in the evaporation rate were not considered the bottom boundary was set as free drainage it must be mentioned that in all simulations the wetting fronts did not reach the bottom boundary at the end of irrigation thus in fact the bottom boundary condition had little effect on the water movement 2 3 evaluation of model simulation the agreement of the hydrus 2d simulation results with the measured data was quantified using the mean relative error mre the normalized root mean square error nrmse cai et al 2018 and the index of agreement ia willmott 1982 6 mre 1 n i 1 n s i m i m i 7 nrmse 1 m 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 8 ia 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n s i m m i m 2 where n is the total number of data points s i and m i are respectively the i th simulated and measured data point m is the mean of the measured data mre simply reflects the bias under estimation or overestimation in the simulated data nrmse gives the overall measure of deviation degree of the simulated and measured results ia ranges from 0 to 1 with higher value indicating better agreement between the two results specifically satisfactory model performances are obtained when mre and nrmse are very small and ia is close to 1 2 4 model prediction and simulation treatments the infiltration behaviors under mti are likely to be affected by the design and management parameters therefore predictions of 25 treatments with five levels of operating pressure heads 50 cm 75 cm 100 cm 125 cm 150 cm and also five levels of placement depth of moistube 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm 30 cm were implemented by model simulation to investigate the effects of different parameters on infiltration behaviors the irrigation duration was set to 120 h 2 5 evaluation indices of irrigation efficiency based on the results of predictions irrigation efficiency for the treatments was evaluated using application efficiency e a wang et al 1996 irrigation uniformity that was adopted by the christiansen s coefficient of uniformity e u and ratio of effective infiltration volume e v qi et al 2020 they are calculated as follows 9 e a v s v d 100 v s v d v l v e 10 e u 1 1 n Œ∏ i Œ∏ k Œ∏ 100 11 e v v w v t 100 where v s is the volume of water stored in root zone v d is the volume of water delivered to root zone v l is the volume of water loss during irrigation including surface evaporation and deep percolation v e is the volume of basic surface evaporation which was determined from simulation without the moistube Œ∏ is the mean of soil water content of the root zone Œ∏ i is the soil water content at measuring point i k is the total number of measuring points v w is the volume of soil where water infiltrate in root zone v t is the total volume of the root zone the volume of soil where water infiltrate was calculated by programmed morphological algorithms in matlab r2016a based on the resulting images in hydrus 2d 3 results 3 1 validation of the hydrus model comparisons between the measured and simulated cumulative infiltration amount horizontal wetting front and soil water distribution are shown in fig 5 a good agreement is obtained between the simulated and measured cumulative infiltration amount with the values of mre nrmse and ia respectively being 0 075 0 085 and 0 995 which reflects that the cumulative infiltration of mti can be well predicted by the hydrus 2d model simulation for reasons of brevity only the data of horizontal wetting front are presented in this study the plot also shows the similar patterns of wetting front evolution in the measured and simulated results the wetting front propagated quickly at the early stage of infiltration however as the infiltration proceeded the advancing velocity of wetting front gradually decreased the values of mre nrmse and ia are 0 065 0 110 and 0 979 respectively indicating a slight deviation between the measured and simulated wetting front evolution besides it was observed that the water distribution in the measured and simulated condition was very similar with the irrigation water concentrated in the layers near the moistube the values of mre nrmse and ia are 0 042 0 092 and 0 976 respectively which reveals that the model is well suited for simulating the water distribution under mti the values of mre in these three aspects show that the model underestimates the cumulative infiltration amount and wetting front evolution while it overestimates the soil water content however the absolute values of mre are below 0 15 the nrmse values are less than 0 20 and ia values are close to 1 indicating that both the underestimation and the overestimation are very slight and can be neglected based on the comparison between the measured and simulated cumulative infiltration amount horizontal wetting front and soil water distribution it can be concluded that hydrus 2d model gives highly accurate predictions of water movement under mti and is suitable for investigating the optimization of mti system 3 2 predicted infiltration behaviors under different parameters 3 2 1 operating pressure head fig 6a shows the predicted discharge of moistube versus irrigation time for different operating pressure heads note that the discharge of moistube is equal to infiltration rate for brevity only the data of treatments with placement depth of 20 cm are given it was observed that the operating pressure head had substantial effect on the discharge of moistube the discharge of moistube was very different across the treatments with different operating pressure heads and was in the order of 150 cm 125 cm 100 cm 75 cm 50 cm all the time during the irrigation the discharge increased with the increasing pressure heads because the higher pressure head enlarged the difference of water potential between inside and outside the moistube which dominated the flux of moistube meanwhile it was found that in general the discharge of moistube for all treatments showed the similar trend throughout the irrigation specifically the discharge was relatively large at the beginning of irrigation but it fell quickly in less than 10 h and afterwards gradually decreased until the end of irrigation the soil was initially dry with the soil water potential being 2760 cm the low soil water potential resulted in a very large difference of water potential between inside and outside the moistube and thus a large discharge of moistube however once the soil around the moistube was moistened the soil water potential rapidly increased markedly reducing the difference of water potential as well as the discharge as the infiltration proceeded the increment of soil water potential was progressively decreasing so that the decline in the discharge of moistube slowed down after several hours fig 6b fig 7 presents the predicted wetting patterns in the root zone after 120 h for different operating pressure heads for simplicity only the data of treatments with placement depth of 20 cm are given the horizontal wetting front for all treatments has already arrived at the right boundary of the flow domain which meant that the irrigation water from adjacent moistubes has intersected in less than 120 h as expected the wetting area in soil increased as the operating pressure head increased because the discharge of moistube was accelerated by the higher pressure head with regard to soil water distribution it was clearly observed that in general the soil water content was very high near the moistube and decreased with the distance away from the tube for all pressure heads 3 2 2 placement depth of moistube fig 8 shows the predicted total discharge of moistube after 120 h irrigation for different placement depths of moistube for a given operating pressure head the relative difference in the total discharge between treatments of different placement depths was less than 3 5 indicating that the total discharge for treatments with different placement depths of moistube was very close to each other in fact the discharge of moistube for different placement depths was similar all the time during irrigation data not shown these results signified that the placement depth of moistube unlike the operating pressure head had little effect on the discharge of moistube on the other hand it was observed that the total discharge of moistube for placement depth of 10 cm was slightly larger than the others which was probably due to the effect of evaporation on water movement the actual evaporation rate was bound to be larger when the moistube was buried at a very shallow depth fig 9 presents the predicted wetting patterns in the root zone at varying times during irrigation for different placement depths of moistube under the operating pressure head of 100 cm the wetting geometries across these treatments were nearly identical during the early stage when the wetting fronts did not reach the boundaries they were all close to semi circles though the downward wetting fronts advanced slightly faster than the upward wetting fronts due to the effect of gravitational potential besides the size of wetting area for the treatments was also close to each other before encountering the boundaries in other words the wetting fronts advanced almost at the same speeds despite the difference in placement depth of moistube therefore the horizontal wetting fronts in these treatments all arrived at the right boundary after about 72 h however it was clearly observed that the placement depth of moistube appreciably influenced the time when the wetting fronts arrived at the surface and bottom boundaries the wetting front arrived at the soil surface after about 24 h when the placement depth was 10 cm whereas the surface was still not moistened at the end of the irrigation when the placement depth was 30 cm on the other hand compared with the treatments with shallower placement depths the wetting front in the treatments with deeper placement depths was more prone to reach the bottom of the root zone giving rise to the deep percolation this influence resulted in the distinct wetting patterns after 120 h irrigation among the treatments which would in large part dominate the irrigation efficiency 3 3 irrigation efficiency fig 10 presents the application efficiency and water loss for all treatments the lowest application efficiency was found in treatments with placement depth of 10 cm the values were approximately 75 suggesting that almost a quarter of irrigation water was lost during the irrigation the largest values of application efficiency were found in treatments with placement depth of 25 cm which were close to 100 in general the value of application efficiency increased as the placement depth of moistube increased when the placement depth was less than 25 cm which was because the shallower placement depths resulted in more evaporation loss all the values for treatments with placement depth of 20 and 30 cm exceeded 90 and they were nearly identical under a given operating pressure head however it was noteworthy that the treatments with placement depth of 30 cm had caused deep percolation and the water loss caused by deep percolation was larger than the evaporation loss due to the deep placement depth the irrigation water was more prone to reach below the root zone on the whole the application efficiency decreased with the increasing pressure heads this was because larger pressure head increased the discharge of moistube and expanded the wetting area supplying more water to the soil surface however the treatments with placement depth of 10 cm was an exception due to the very shallow placement depth the evaporation amount was very large even though the operating pressure head was only 50 cm as the operating pressure head increased the proportion of increased evaporation was less than that of increased irrigation amount therefore the application efficiency increased with the increasing pressure heads when the moistube was buried at a depth of 10 cm for clarity 3d contour views of irrigation uniformity and ratio of effective infiltration volume are plotted based on the values of 25 treatments fig 11 it was clearly observed that the values of irrigation uniformity ranged from 71 9 to 83 1 and the highest value was derived from the treatment with operating pressure head of 150 cm and placement depth of 25 cm while the lowest value was found in the treatment with operating pressure head of 50 cm and placement depth of 10 cm in general the value of irrigation uniformity rose as the operating pressure head increased which was primarily because the higher pressure head effectively enlarged the wetting area in soil thereby reducing the difference in water content between soils near and away from the moistube besides for a given pressure head the irrigation uniformity firstly increased with the placement depth and reached the peak values at a placement depth of 25 cm and then began to decrease as the placement depth increased as can be seen in fig 11 the 3d contour view of ratio of effective infiltration volume is very similar to that of irrigation uniformity specifically the value of the ratio was positively correlated with the operating pressure head in addition the ratio increased with the increasing placement depth of moistube within 10 25 cm and once the placement depth exceeded 25 cm the ratio began to decrease as the depth increased the lowest value of ratio of effective infiltration volume was 54 90 which was found in the treatment with operating pressure head of 50 cm and placement depth of moistube of 10 cm indicating that only about half of the volume of root zone was irrigated after 120 h irrigation the treatment with pressure head of 150 cm and placement depth of 25 cm exhibited the highest value of the ratio that approached 98 which meant almost the entire root zone was moistened after the irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 effect of different parameters on infiltration behaviors the simulation results revealed that operating pressure head had significant effect on the infiltration behaviors of mti the discharge of moistube and the wetting area in soil increased with the increasing operating pressure head because the difference of water potential between inside and outside moistube was enlarged by the increasing pressure head which was analogous to the results in previous studies bi et al 2018 xue et al 2013a for a given operating pressure head the discharge of moistube was nearly identical across treatments with different placement depths indicating placement depth of moistube had little effect on the discharge of moistube this was because the soil matric potential was similar across the treatments despite the different placement depths similar phenomenon was observed in niu et al 2013 s experiment where there was no significant difference in cumulative infiltration amounts among treatments with placement depth of 5 10 and 15 cm however they found that the cumulative infiltration amount was obviously lower when the placement depth was 20 cm that was probably because the surrounding soil pressure caused severe deformation of the moistube and impacted the discharge stability the tube they used in the experiment was the first generation moistube which had low mechanical strength and unstable discharge performance for a given operating pressure head and irrigation duration the wetting area in soil was very similar in size and shape before wetting fronts reached boundary in treatments with different placement depths of moistube it indicated that placement depth of moistube also had little effect on the advancing velocity of wetting front which was also because the placement depth did not cause appreciable change of the matric potential of ambient soil across treatments this phenomenon coincided with the observation of siyal and skaggs 2009 who conducted similar simulation for sub surface porous pipe irrigation and found that placement depth of the porous pipe did not affect the extent of horizontal wetting 4 2 optimization of mti system this study adopts application efficiency irrigation uniformity and ratio of effective infiltration volume to evaluate irrigation efficiency application efficiency mainly reflects the capacity for water saving while irrigation uniformity and ratio of effective infiltration volume appreciably affect crop growth and yield hence it is expected to simultaneously get high values of these three indices in a treatment which means high irrigation efficiency and also suggests high water use efficiency without compromising yield it must be mentioned that the cases simulated in this study were continuous mti for five days apparently had the irrigation duration been set as another values the irrigation efficiency would have been different nevertheless some useful suggestions for optimizing mti system could be derived from the evaluation of irrigation efficiency the evaluation of irrigation efficiency showed that both operating pressure head and placement depth of moistube had substantial effects on application efficiency irrigation uniformity and ratio of effective infiltration volume the application efficiency decreased with the increasing operating pressure heads except for treatments with placement depth of 10 cm while the irrigation uniformity and the ratio of effective infiltration volume increased as the operating pressure head increased these results suggested that too high and too low operating pressure head will result in a decreased capacity for water saving and a decline in crop yield respectively how to determine appropriate operating pressure heads under which benefits from water saving and crop yield are both satisfactory depends on crop types degree of water scarcity and so on and is beyond the scope of this study further studies are needed to weigh the benefits from water saving and crop yield for specific regions it must be mentioned that the effect of operating pressure head on irrigation efficiency originated from the dependence of discharge of moistube on the pressure head this study demonstrates that operating pressure head had dominant effect on the discharge of moistube while placement depth of moistube had little which meant that irrigation intensity of mti was determined by the pressure head thus the determination of operating pressure head should take into consideration the water requirement of crop in priority with regard to the placement depth of moistube it was found that all the three indices achieved highest values when the placement depth was 25 cm as mentioned in section 3 2 2 placement depth of moistube did not affect the advancing velocity of wetting front besides due to the relatively good water retention capacity of clay loam soil and that the water movement in soil under mti is mainly driven by soil suction sun et al 2018 the ratio of length to width of wetting area was close to one fig 9 as a result 25 cm was the most reasonable placement depth in this study when the placement depth was 20 cm the surface evaporation was obviously increased when the placement depth was 30 cm the irrigation uniformity and the ratio of effective infiltration volume was decreased and evidently the risk of deep percolation was apparently increased therefore burying moistube at half the depth of active root zone is recommended when designing mti system in soils with good water retention capacity which will be conducive to improve water use efficiency 4 3 competitive edges of mti based on the results of this study it could be reasonably inferred that mti has strong competitive edges compared to other sub surface irrigation techniques due to the low hydraulic conductivity of moistube water is emitted from the tube at very slow rates which allows continuous irrigation during crop growth by using this technique sun et al 2018 have conducted a field experiment on tomato to investigate the effects of continuous irrigation on plant yield and water use efficiency by comparing with intermittent irrigation they found that intermittent irrigation caused large fluctuations of soil water content thus giving rise to high water uptake and redundant transpiration of the plant while continuous irrigation treatment did not cause that and consequently improved plant yield as well as water use efficiency at both leaf and yield level besides mti has less negative effect on soil aeration soil aeration is very important for the normal growth of crops bhattarai et al 2006 zhao et al 2018 for soil oxygen deficiency can cause damages to crops by dramatically reducing root respiration and the efficiency of cellular adenosine triphosphate production fukao and bailey serres 2004 zhu et al 2019 many studies have shown that sub surface irrigation such as drip irrigation ceramic emitter irrigation intensively supplies water to root zone causing the soil air to be replaced by water and even leading to saturated zone around the emitter thereby impeding the root growth ben gal et al 2004 bhattarai et al 2008 cai et al 2018 chen et al 2010 warrick and shani 1996 zhu et al 2019 by contrast under long term mti the soil around moistube will hardly become saturated because there is little probability of the discharge of moistube being larger than the maximum infiltration capacity of soil unless the operating pressure head is too high in this study in fact the values of soil water potential around moistube for all treatments were negative after 120 h irrigation though only the data of treatments with placement depth of 20 cm are shown in fig 6 the ultimate soil water potential in the treatment with operating pressure head of 150 cm and placement depth of 20 cm was approximately 28 cm corresponding soil water content was 0 37 cm3 cm 3 and from the trend of the curve it could be reasonably inferred that even if the irrigation continued the soil water potential around moistube would not reach zero in a short time therefore mti can mitigate the negative effect of soil oxygen deficiency during irrigation as opposed to other sub surface irrigation techniques moreover mti reduces the risk of deep percolation due to the slow discharge of moistube the water movement after seepage from moistube is mainly driven by soil suction not gravity sun et al 2018 the content of gravity driven water is decreased under mti in contrast to other irrigation techniques which leads to slow downward infiltration and thus a decrease in the risk of deep percolation especially in soils containing macropores which provide preferential flow paths for movement of gravity driven water wang et al 2018 in recent years some studies have been carried out to compare the actual effect of mti with other conventional water saving irrigation techniques by field experiments he et al 2012 found that the water use efficiency of mti was higher than that of drip irrigation under mulch and mti was beneficial for the maize seed development xue et al 2013b reported that compared with drip irrigation mti increased the plant height and the stem diameter of tomato by 6 36 and 3 11 respectively and the yield and water use efficiency were also higher under mti a study conducted by m z zhang et al 2017 showed that the water use efficiency was significantly increased for both summer maize and winter wheat under mti than sub surface drip irrigation though mti decreased the maize yield li et al 2019 found that mti significantly increased the water use efficiency for tomato in contrast to drip irrigation and concluded that high yield and water use efficiency could be obtained simultaneously when the operating pressure head was 200 cm to sum up mti is a promising irrigation technique with apparent competitive edges and evidently further research on the design and management of mti system for specific regions and crops is required to maximize the benefit of this technique 5 summary and conclusions moistube irrigation mti is a newly developed efficient sub surface irrigation technique this study investigated the effects of operating pressure head and placement depth of moistube on infiltration behaviors and irrigation efficiency by hydraulically characterizing the moistube hydrus 2d model was used to simulate water movement under mti the validity of model was confirmed by the good agreement between the simulated results cumulative infiltration amount horizontal wetting front and soil water distribution and experimental results simulations with hydrus 2d showed that infiltration behaviors were appreciably affected by the operating pressure head higher operating pressure head enlarged the difference of the water potential between inside and outside moistube leading to larger discharge of moistube and wetting area in soil placement depth of moistube affected the vertical position of wetting area while had little effect on the discharge of moistube and the advancing velocity of wetting fronts evaluation of irrigation efficiency revealed that large operating pressure head would result in waste of irrigation water while low pressure head may limit crop growth irrigation intensity was determined by the operating pressure head thus water demand of crop should be taken into consideration firstly in management of operating pressure head it is recommended to bury the moistube at half the depth of crop root zone for achieving high irrigation efficiency when irrigating in clay loam soil this study also suggested some other competitive edges of mti as opposed to other sub surface irrigation techniques such as capability of continuous irrigation relieving soil oxygen deficiency and reducing deep percolation our findings will be useful for further understanding of mti and optimization of the irrigation system which can help improve the water use efficiency in crop production declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10162,saline water is an alternative resource that could be used to meet agriculture irrigation demands fouling particularly that caused by calcium carbonate caco3 often occurs in saline irrigation water distribution systems and severely restricts the utilization of saline irrigation water so far water acidification is the common practice for avoiding caco3 fouling however this approach is often ineffective and regularly contributes to environmental pollution this study investigated an effective practice to overcome caco3 fouling issues by regulating shear stress temperature and ions in saline irrigation water irrigation systems the effects of different near wall shear stress at 0 05 0 20 0 40 and 0 60 pa coupling with temperature of 10 20 30 and 40 ¬∫c and cations mg2 and fe3 were analyzed results demonstrated that the caco3 fouling rate was linearly increased at initial shear stress while decreased at higher shear stress and the highest fouling rate was observed at 0 40 pa ranging between 21 4 80 3 the coupling of temperature and cations with shear stress significantly p 0 05 affected the fouling growth rate at each shear stress the differences in fouling rate fitting curves slopes k 1 among different shear stress get larger with increasing temperature while they decreased and increased with the addition of mg2 and fe3 respectively when compared with pure solution of caco3 refinement analysis showed the largest unit cell volume and lattice parameter of calcite at shear stress of 0 40 pa resulting in a significant effect on distribution of fouling particle sizes and morphologies moreover some anti fouling measures were further proposed based on the formation behavior of caco3 fouling these findings might provide a new perspective to control caco3 with potential implications for sustainable saline water management for irrigation keywords clogging near wall shear stress temperature ions rietveld refinement 1 introduction fresh water scarcity is the major constraint for global food security and sustainable development of human society agricultural irrigation accounts for 69 of global freshwater consumption fao 2016 but its demand is forecasted to increase by 19 till 2050 liu et al 2019 widespread saline water is an alternative resource that could fulfill agriculture irrigation demands muhammad et al 2021 however the high concentrations of cations and anions present in saline water often produce fouling in saline irrigation water distribution systems siwds zhangzhong et al 2016 calcium carbonate caco3 is a predominant fouling sediment that accounts for 52 4 94 1 of total fouling in siwds li et al 2019 ma et al 2020 leading to numerous deleterious issues i e decrease the system hydraulic efficiency li et al 2019 pipeline surface corrosion hasson et al 2019 partial or complete clogging of irrigation emitters alsadaie and mujtaba 2019 negative effects on crop yield production ngan and habimana 2020 as well as increases both capital and operational costs of irrigation systems zhou et al 2017 so far the caco3 fouling in siwds is often prevented by strong acids injection to lower the water ph perag√≥n et al 2017 however these applications brought severe drawbacks such as soil environmental hazards song et al 2019 and crop yield reductions khoshravesh et al 2018 therefore investigating an acceptable physical anti fouling operating conditions in siwds are key challenges recent studies began to characterize the hydrodynamic operating conditions which play an important role in minimizing fouling on pipeline surfaces kaya et al 2014 shear stress is an important hydrodynamic operating condition with a direct effect on caco3 fouling freeman et al 1990 jaffrin et al 2004 paz et al 2012 several studies have explored the influence of near wall shear stress hou et al 2020 duration and frequency of shear stress chan et al 2011 and constant shear stress rochex et al 2008 cowle et al 2019 on fouling these studies have clearly demonstrated a signiÔ¨Åcant correlation between the shear stress and fouling process however the latest research advancement have been mainly focused on the characteristics of biofouling formation the impacts of near wall shear stress on caco3 fouling in siwds are still elusive it is well understood that shear stress significantly alter the fouling growth helalizadeh et al 2000 fouling nucleation mechanism yang et al 2011 restructuring and breakage of agglomerates soos et al 2008 and morphologies and sizes distribution of crystal sonwai and mackley 2006 however caco3 fouling process is not only depending on shear stress but fluid temperature and ionic composition also play a critical role in fouling growth thus fouling process is influenced by mass transfer ca2 and hco3 ion hasan et al 2012 surface integration p√§√§kk√∂nen et al 2012 and sometimes the combination of both wang et al 2016 these experimental parameters should be operated together korchef 2019 which is therefore essential to explicitly understand the fouling mechanism furthermore the formation of caco3 fouling is related to the unit cell parameters such as cell volumes crystal sizes and lattice parameters zhang et al 2015 the development of rietveld refinement technique has made it possible to investigate the characteristics of crystal which might expose the potential interaction mechanism of shear stress and caco3 fouling thus considering the fouling behavior in siwds under actual field conditions caco3 fouling was cultured on drip irrigation pipelines under the conditions of different near wall shear stress temperature and ions the objectives of this work were to 1 investigate the caco3 fouling mechanism under different near wall shear stresses and operating conditions temperature and added ions 2 determine the control threshold of near wall shear stresses for mitigating caco3 fouling and 3 elucidate the impacts of near wall shear stresses on the lattice parameters of caco3 fouling and the potential action mechanisms of shear stresses 2 materials and methods 2 1 shear stress and water source preparation an experiment was conducted applying four types of near wall shear stress 0 05 0 20 0 40 and 0 60 pa which were in the domain of laminar Ô¨Çow in siwds and were comparable with previous studies hou et al 2020 the applied shear stress was coupled with water temperature 10 20 30 and 40 ¬∫c and two types of cations fe3 and mg2 accumulatively the experiment had a total of 48 treatments being their specific arrangements summarized in table s1 the experiment of caco3 fouling was carried out with an accelerated co2 dissolved technique at first the caco3 solution was prepared by dissolving 3 0 g of solid caco3 in 10 l of deionized water until no solids were lift in solution co2 gas was continuously fed into the solution overnight until ca2 co3 2 hco3 were prepared a total of three solutions were prepared i e pure solution of caco3 cc fecl3 fc and mgcl2 mc during the experiment the concentrations of the solutions were maintained as 0 2 g l and ph at a steady state of 5 5 5 7 hereafter to avoid any possible effects of left over solids in solutions that might act as seed material and might affect the caco3 fouling the solutions were Ô¨Åltered through a 0 22 ¬µm membrane Ô¨Ålter before being introduced to the test devices 2 2 shear stress apparatus configuration and operation an accelerated scale method using an annular reactor ar device previously developed by hou et al 2020 was used a total of 48 identical ar devices were used for fouling the ar consisted of water storage bucket a peristaltic pump latex tubes and a simulator as depicted in fig 1 the detailed description of ar device dimensions and operating conditions are detailed in table s2 the device was composed of two exterior and interior concentric rotating cylinders the rotation speed of internal cylinder was controlled by a servo head pump generating desired near wall shear stress at the internal surface of exterior stationary cylinder the share stress simulation methodology is briefly explained in supplementary materials section 1 1 applied temperatures were carefully controlled by putting the ar devices in temperature controlled incubators a total of 8 incubators were set up and each incubator consisted of 6 ars every individual ar was equipped with 24 polyethylene pe slides pieces of drip irrigation laterals used for irrigation water distribution in agriculture fields having dimensions of 19 1 cm which were fixed at internal surface of exterior cylinder the physical characteristics of pe were measured as roughness surface sq 145 nm 6 1 nm maximum height sy 1504 nm 15 3 nm and specific surface area sdr 0 18 0 02 thereafter the arrangement and fixation of pe slides against the interior surface were done as described by hou et al 2020 peristaltic water pumps with latex tubes and 10 08 ml min flow rate were used to gently feed the prepared water solution from buckets to ar devices and recirculate to solution buckets the temperature of solutions was checked on daily basis using a thermometer type o 264wt range 10 300 ¬∫c accuracy 1 ¬∫c

randomly selecting 3 pe slides which were cut out from each ar 2 3 sampling and characterization methods 2 3 1 fouling dry weight extraction the three selected pe pieces from each device at every sampling event were taken to analyze the fouling dry weight the collected samples were dried in an oven for 20 min at 60 ¬∫c a high precision electronic weight balance accuracy 10 4 g was used to weight the samples with fouling substances on it the pieces were then placed in zip lock bags and 20 ml of deionized water were added to detach the fouling substances using an ultrasonic cleaner manufacturer chaowei type gvs 10 l working rate of power 240 w frequency 60 hz hereafter the clean and dried pe pieces without fouling substances on it were weighed again and the difference between two weights was characterized as fouling dry weight 2 3 2 fouling characterization and evaluation at the end of experiment the phase composition and structure of fouling particles were identiÔ¨Åed by x ray diffractometry xrd the samples were vacuum dried at 15 ¬∫c and scanned using a x ray diffractometer manufacture bruker germany type d8 advance the basic test conditions of the test process were voltage 40 kv current 40 ma cu target and wavelength Œª 1 5406 √• the xrd patterns were recorded in the scanning range of 2Œ∏ 15 80 using a small angular step of 2Œ∏ equal to 0 017 and a Ô¨Åxed counting time of 4 s the obtained polycrystalline diffraction patterns were then ameliorated by rietveld refinement using the general structure analysis system gsas larson and von dreele 1994 to calculate the composition distribution unit cell volume lattice parameters of the obtained crystals xiao et al 2021 finally the obtained xrd map was analyzed using the supporting topas software bruker axs 2009 to determine the relative proportions of composed caco3 polymorphs 2 3 3 apparent morphology of fouling particles the caco3 fouling particles sizes and morphologies were examined using a scanning electron microscope sem manufacturer japan jeol model jsm 6510a at an operating voltage of 20 kv after sputtered gold Ô¨Ålm and magnification ranging from 400 to 15 000 the aspect ratios of particles size distributions were obtained by analyzing a minimum of 100 particles using morphologi g2 malven instrument and its software 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analyses were carried

effect of applied shear stress temperature and ions on content of calcite and aragonite and fouling total dry weight 3 results and analysis 3 1 effects of near wall shear stress on fouling dry weight overall the growth of caco3 fouling under each operating condition was divided in three phase development growth induction nucleation phase 0 50 h rapid growth phase 50 200 h and stability phase 200 300 h fig 2 the fouling growth augmented with increase of shear stress from 0 05 to 0 40 pa while it decreased at 0 60 pa as observed from fig 2 the highest fouling dry weight at 0 40 pa ranged between 0 18 and 1 83 mg cm2 which was 71 3 80 3 35 6 56 3 and 21 4 54 2 higher than 0 05 0 20 and 0 60 pa respectively meanwhile significant p 0 05 differences were found among all shear stress treatments at each temperature and ions table s4 the significance analysis table 1 showed that the coupling of shear stress with each temperature and ions significantly affected p 0 05 the fouling growth rate in order to estimate the coupling effect of temperature and ions on fouling growth at shear stress linear correlations between 0 05 pa and other shear stresses were performed fig s1 significant linear correlations r2 0 65 p 0 05 were obtained at each temperature and ion the increased temperature positively increased fouling growth rate characterized by the larger slopes k 1 of the fitting curves table s5 for instance k values at 0 40 pa compared with 0 05 pa at 10 ¬∫c reached to 3 22 4 28 while these were increased to 3 93 4 96 4 41 5 41 and 4 77 5 41 showing that the fouling rate was increased by 81 9 86 3 73 1 79 1 and 67 5 79 1 at 20 30 and 40 ¬∫c respectively similarly the k variation among different ions was analyzed at each temperature the k variation at 0 40 pa in cc ranged from 3 89 to 5 40 while fc tended to slightly increase and reached 4 28 5 71 however mc were found to comparatively declined the k values reached 3 22 4 77 at 10 40 ¬∫c respectively on the other hand the different shear stresses significantly affected the fouling growth rate at each temperature and ions table s6 the slope k of fouling growth rate increased with greater shear stress taking the example of k values at 40 ¬∫c when compared with 10 ¬∫c under 0 05 pa reached 2 54 3 48 which were increased to 3 85 5 10 3 56 5 23 and 4 27 6 23 with shear rates of 0 20 0 40 and 0 60 pa respectively besides the k values under different shear stress in fc varied noticeably increasing from 3 48 5 20 5 28 and 6 24 for 0 05 0 20 0 40 and 0 60 pa respectively 3 2 effects of near wall shear stress on fouling phase change fig 3 shows x ray powder diffraction and rietveld refinement patterns obtained for the samples at the end point 300 h of system operation and the mineral component proportions the x ray results revealed that the calcite was the most stable phase under each treatment since it contributed as 81 6 93 3 while aragonite ranged between 12 4 24 9 the t test analysis table s4 showed that the quantity of calcite and aragonite mineral were significantly p 0 05 different among different shear stress in each operating condition except for aragonite between 0 2 and 0 4 pa among the treatments the maximum amount of calcite was obtained at 0 40 pa ranging between 0 02 and 1 54 mg cm2 and being 25 8 75 9 35 1 82 6 and 4 7 66 3 higher than 0 05 pa 0 20 pa and 0 60 pa respectively fig 3d e f the coupling of shear stress with each temperature and ion presented a significant effect p 0 01 on calcite growth table 1 the content of calcite showed linear increasing trend with increase of temperature at each shear stress however addition of ions obviously changed the growth of calcite at each shear rate for instance the lowest content of calcite at constant temperature 40 ¬∫c ranged between 0 20 and 1 06 mg cm2 and was obtained with mc fig 3 e which was 12 7 34 1 and 32 7 36 8 lower than that for cc and fc respectively fig 3 d f moreover the content of aragonite in presence of mc increased considerably reaching 0 03 0 08 mg cm2 fig 3 h which was 14 7 66 1 and 79 3 77 9 higher than with cc and fc respectively fig 3 g i 3 3 caco3 particles size and morphology evaluation the variation of caco3 fouling particles sizes and apparent morphologies were determined under each shear stress in presence absence of ions and at different temperatures the average largest particle sizes across the treatments were obtained at 0 40 pa ranging between 1 35 and 7 45 ¬µm fig 4 a b c the fouling particle sizes increased positively with higher temperatures considering a constant shear stress of 0 4 pa the largest crystals were found at 40 ¬∫c sized 6 18 1 39 and 6 67 ¬µm for cc mc and fc respectively fig 5 shows the sem images of caco3 fouling particles obtained at 40 ¬∫c 40 ¬∫c were taken as example the detailed sem images at 10 20 and 30 ¬∫c are summarized in fig s2 the sem images clearly agreed with the xrd results indicating that caco3 particles typically contain dominant proportion of calcite and small quantity of aragonite the apparent morphologies of caco3 particles exhibited a certain difference with the different treatments those particles in cc and fc at initial shear stress 0 05 and 0 20 pa were the mixture of calcite fig 5 a b and aragonite fig 5 i j but with increasing of shear rates 0 40 0 60 pa pure crystals of calcite were typically obtained as large particles of euhedral pseudo hexagonal platelets exhibiting dense tight thick layers fig 5 c d k l on the other hand a higher quantity of aragonite with a smaller mono crystalline loose and distorted morphologies was obtained in mc fig 5 e f g h 3 4 variation of crystal unit cell and lattice parameters the xrd rietveld refinement analysis was performed to determine the variation in caco3 crystals structure and sizes affected by shear stress temperature and ions fig 6 the x ray results showed that the two phases acquired of caco3 fouling particles were calcite and aragonite therefore rietveld refinement analysis was performed with calcite space group of r 3c 167 and aragonite pmcn 62 crystallography open database cod the calcite unit cell volume cv was 367 47 and lattice parameters were a 4 98 √• b 4 98 √• and c 17 05 √• aragonite were 227 03 √• a 4 96 √• b 7 96 √• and c 5 741 √• fig 6 shows that the average rwp 0 003 0 04 and x 2 values 0 13 0 43 were recorded for all samples the unit cell volume of calcite exhibited largest expansion patterns at 0 40 pa whereas it increased cv by 3 57 9 73 2 44 5 62 and 1 13 3 24 when compared to 0 05 0 20 and 0 60 pa respectively meanwhile lattice parameters at 0 40 pa were also increased by a axis 0 001 0 003 0 0009 0 001 and 0 0003 0 001 √• b axis 0 0008 0 002 0 0009 0 002 and 0 0004 0 0008 √• and c axis 0

the cv and lattice parameters a b and c of aragonite were almost kept unchanged and most of the treatments were found non significantly p 0 05 different 3 5 structural equation modeling analysis sema this study also performed structural equation modeling analysis sema to further validate the hypothesis fig 7 consistent with experiment results shear stress showed the strongest direct effects on calcite growth Œ≤ 0 46 p 0 01 and presented weak correlation with aragonite Œ≤ 0 22 p 0 05 at the same time ions also showed the strongest correlation with both calcite and aragonite Œ≤ 0 53 0 58 p 0 01 however temperature was in a weak and non significant correlation with calcite and aragonite Œ≤ 0 23 0 06 p 0 05 respectively matching with results of coupling effect of shear stress with temperature and ion on fouling growth slope the inter correlation among these three factors was found significant finally both calcite and aragonite directly affected the total weight of caco3 fouling with a significant correlation Œ≤ 0 73 0 27 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different operating conditions on caco3 fouling growth a set of experiments were designed to systematically determine the influence of varying operating conditions i e near wall shear stress water temperature and ions on fouling growth in siwds the obtained results demonstrated that the growth of caco3 fouling significantly p 0 05 depended on shear stress temperature and ions fig 2 some studies postulated that the higher shear stress cross section flow velocity sometimes linearly increases andritsos et al 1997 or decreases fouling growth rate crittenden et al 2015 lee et al 2013 the caco3 fouling is mainly controlled by mass transfer surface integration or both mechanisms mwaba et al 2006 in this study the effects of applied near wall shear stress on caco3 fouling presented a quadratic correlation r2 0 90 p 0 05 for each temperature and ion types fig s3 this indicated that the fouling growth rate was positively increased at initial shear stress from 0 05 to 0 40 pa and then there was a remarkable transition from positive to negative at higher shear rate of 0 60 pa the highest fouling rate at each temperature was obtained when the near wall shear stress and flow velocity were 0 40 pa and 0 24 m s respectively fig s3 thereafter the fouling rate was significantly decreased when the shear rate reached 0 60 pa and flow velocity was 0 41 m s these observations indicated that caco3 fouling process was likely mass transfer controlled before reaching 0 40 pa and changed to activation controlled at higher shear rate of 0 60 pa however these results were quite different from those reported by helalizadeh et al 2000 who applied flow velocities between 0 5 and 2 m s and found that the fouling process was mass transfer controlled when the flow velocity was between 0 40 and 0 80 m s thereafter the mechanism was activation controlled when flow velocity increased to 0 80 1 m s which could be probably explained by the high temperature 50 90 ¬∫c and ions solution concentration 0 25 1 mg l applied in the experiment wang et al 2016 applied a flow velocity range of 0 06 0 80 m s and explained this phenomenon as the laminar boundary layer was increased linearly until 0 06 0 30 m s increasing the fouling average growth rate however when velocity was increased above 0 30 m s the turbulence flow increased the shear stress on surface of pipeline and fouling removal rate as well as shortened the Ô¨Çuid residence time at the wall surface thus reducing the probability of the depositing material to adhere to the surface p√§√§kk√∂nen et al 2012 the effects of different temperature on fouling growth demonstrated that the increase in temperature linearly increased caco3 fouling growth similar results were reported by hasan et al 2012 who found the higher the solution temperature the lower the fouling resistance they further explained that the wall temperature directly increases with the increase of solution temperature which increases the supersaturation at wall surface the increased wall temperature decreases the inverse solubility of caco3 increasing the supersaturation at the wall surface and eventually further leads to increase fouling rate wang et al 2016 in addition the rietveld reÔ¨Ånement analysis demonstrated significant expansion of unit cell volume and lattice parameters of calcite with increase of temperature at each shear stress fig 6 these results were also in a good agreement with previous reports chang et al 2017 furthermore the nature of caco3 fouling growth was not obviously changed under fc but slightly increased the fouling rate when compared to cc the growth of caco3 fouling regardless of shear stress and temperature were significantly p 0 05 inhibited under mc when compared with cc and fc however mc strongly promoted the formation of aragonite at each shear stress and temperature the effect of mg2 has been reported briefly by several authors martos et al 2010 rodriguez blanco et al 2012 suggesting that the dehydration energy difference between ca2 and mg2 ion is responsible for the inhibition of the caco3 precipitation the rietveld reÔ¨Ånement of x ray diffraction demonstrated that the lattice parameters of calcite were exclusively changed with added ions thus lattice parameters of calcite were slightly increased in cc and fc ma et al 2016 postulated this occurrence as doped ca2 probably would be introduced to the host lattice of caco3 crystal in cc or fc thus causing the expansion of lattice parameters however lattice parameters in mc were comparatively lower than those in cc and fc this was due to the substitution of the ca2 ions in caco3 by the mg2 since the atomic ion radius of mg2 1 598 √• is smaller than that of ca2 1 974 √• mejri et al 2014 the xrd diffraction results and sem images indicated that the caco3 fouling was a mixture of calcite and aragonite minerals however with the exception of mc calcite minerals were the predominant phase under each condition fig 3 the total fouling particle size of calcite was positively increased with shear stress and temperature fig 4 furthermore the calcite crystal cell volume and lattice parameters showed obvious expansion with increase of particle size several previous studies have demonstrated the significant p 0 05 positive or negative correlation between crystal size and lattice parameters mhadhbi et al 2010 sheng et al 2010 our results were in strong agreement with results previously reported mhadhbi et al 2010 qi and wang 2005 the calcite crystals were tightly compact and smooth surfaces with very small quantity of aragonite particles were found at higher shear rates according to daoyin et al 2018 the higher shear stress results in breakup of aggregates since the stable size of aggregates decreases with increasing shear stress 4 2 coupling effects of temperature and ions on shear stress fouling this study also investigated the coupling effects of water temperature and added ions on caco3 fouling at different near wall shear stress the coupling of shear stress at each temperature demonstrated that the fouling rate was positively increased at initial shear stress while decreased at higher shear stress rates this could be attributed to increased convective heat transfer where increasing flow velocity decrease the wall temperature xiao et al 2020 p√§√§kk√∂nen et al 2012 found that increased velocity from 0 20 to 0 40 m s reduced the wall temperature by 15 ¬∫c which strongly described the variation in fouling rate on the other hand the coupling of varied temperature at shear stress and added ions fouling rate demonstrated that the rise in temperature from 10 to 40 ¬∫c linearly increased caco3 fouling growth table s5 which has been discussed earlier similarly the coupling effects of added ions on fouling growth at each shear stress were estimated table s7 the coupling of shear stress with added ions indicated that the fouling growth rate was reduced by higher shear stresses this was due to greater mass transfer boundary layer thickness at lower flow velocities therefore molecular diffusion strongly affected fouling growth however the higher flow velocities decreased the boundary layer thickness and fouling process was changed from mass transfer to reaction controlled therefore water temperature and ions addition are two important factors that should be taken into consideration when applying shear stress to alleviate caco3 fouling 4 3 engineering implications for anti fouling in siwds this study clearly demonstrated that caco3 fouling was significantly affected by near wall shear stress under different operating conditions i e different temperature and ions it is important to evaluate the engineering implications to further validate the results for successful application in siwds the average thickness of caco3 fouling reached its maximum at a shear stress of 0 40 pa and at a velocity of 0 24 m s while the higher shear stress 0 60 pa at 0 41 m s decreased its growth rate previous studies li et al 2015 puig bargu√©s and lamm 2013 suggested that better sediments removal rate is achieved when flushing velocity was around 0 45 m s considering these results this study strongly recommends the shear stress equal or above 0 60 pa should be maintained in siwds in addition the emitter complex labyrinth channels create discontinuity in flow velocity liu et al 2016 and consequently create high speed and low speed flow zones which significantly alter the solid particles deposition rate at inlet mid and end parts of emitter flow channels xiao et al 2020 we suggest a careful design to minimize the dead areas regions that allow suspended particles to settle and deposit in siwds and to avoid shear forces around 0 4 pa on emitter surfaces on other hand the increasing temperature linearly increased the fouling growth rate therefore evening irrigation events are recommended to the crop fields when using siwds particularly in summer season or in hot weather areas dong et al 2016 reported that night drip irrigation decreased the soil shallow root zone temperature by 0 6 ¬∫c promoted plant height and crop yield by 2 and 10 respectively furthermore the coupling of water temperature with shear stress demonstrated the higher shear stress promoted the convective heat transfer at each temperature thus reducing the rate of fouling growth it is suggested the higher shear stress should be used in siwds during high temperature irrigation events our results also demonstrated that fe3 increased the fouling growth rate when compared with mg2 the coupling of shear stress with ions indicated that the higher shear stress reduced the boundary layer thickness in each added ion which resulted in decrease of the fouling growth rate therefore we suggest that firstly when using high saline irrigation water which contains co3 2 po4 3 so4 2 sio3 2 oh fe3 fe2 mn2 ca2 s2 etc application in siwds integrated with fertigation particular attention should be paid to the concentration of foreign added ions through fertilizers secondly the results demonstrated the calcite fouling was easier formed at 0 40 pa indicating that the shear stress should be maintained at 0 20 pa or 0 60 pa however due to the main function of an emitter being energy dissipation if the shear stresses were controlled at less than 0 2 pa the flow in emitter channel would be almost in low speed regions in emitters with good energy dissipation the lengths of emitter channels are mostly very long the flow indexes are very high hydraulic performance is comparatively reduced and have higher manufacturing costs feng et al 2018 therefore we recommend the higher flow velocity shear stress 0 60 pa should be maintained in siwds synergistically improving the emitter hydraulic performance and alleviating the calcium carbonate precipitation in summary the present experimental results pave the way for studies of various aspects of fouling including effect of near wall shear stress temperature gradients and added ions on controlling of caco3 fouling in siwds the results suggested that higher shear stress could be effective in mitigating caco3 fouling nonetheless the meaningful findings were acquired in this study to greater insight on near wall shear stress in siwds the issues of integrated application of saline irrigation and fertilizer in siwds sufficient number of cations should be considered in future studies 5 conclusion the main conclusions derived from the experiment carried out in the present study are 1 overall the fouling growth rate under different near wall shear stress shows significant p 0 05 differences under each operating condition of temperature and added ions the highest fouling rate ranged between 0 30 and 1 83 mg cm2 and was observed at 0 40 pa which was 59 3 80 3 37 6 56 3 and 21 4 50 2 higher than 0 05 0 20 and 0 60 pa respectively 2 temperature and added ions significantly p 0 01 affected caco3 fouling rate under each shear stress the fouling growth fitting curves k slope difference between 0 40 and 0 05 pa linearly increased with increase of temperature 20 40 ¬∫c similarly these slopes varied significantly with addition of ions where fc tend to increase while mc decline the fouling growth slope when compared with cc 3 the xrd and sem observation revealed that the caco3 fouling in cc and fc were predominantly caused by calcite minerals while the content of aragonite became more stable in mc crystal apparent morphologies in fc exhibited as dense tight thick layered structure and mc was observed with loose and distorted structures declaration of competing

10162,saline water is an alternative resource that could be used to meet agriculture irrigation demands fouling particularly that caused by calcium carbonate caco3 often occurs in saline irrigation water distribution systems and severely restricts the utilization of saline irrigation water so far water acidification is the common practice for avoiding caco3 fouling however this approach is often ineffective and regularly contributes to environmental pollution this study investigated an effective practice to overcome caco3 fouling issues by regulating shear stress temperature and ions in saline irrigation water irrigation systems the effects of different near wall shear stress at 0 05 0 20 0 40 and 0 60 pa coupling with temperature of 10 20 30 and 40 ¬∫c and cations mg2 and fe3 were analyzed results demonstrated that the caco3 fouling rate was linearly increased at initial shear stress while decreased at higher shear stress and the highest fouling rate was observed at 0 40 pa ranging between 21 4 80 3 the coupling of temperature and cations with shear stress significantly p 0 05 affected the fouling growth rate at each shear stress the differences in fouling rate fitting curves slopes k 1 among different shear stress get larger with increasing temperature while they decreased and increased with the addition of mg2 and fe3 respectively when compared with pure solution of caco3 refinement analysis showed the largest unit cell volume and lattice parameter of calcite at shear stress of 0 40 pa resulting in a significant effect on distribution of fouling particle sizes and morphologies moreover some anti fouling measures were further proposed based on the formation behavior of caco3 fouling these findings might provide a new perspective to control caco3 with potential implications for sustainable saline water management for irrigation keywords clogging near wall shear stress temperature ions rietveld refinement 1 introduction fresh water scarcity is the major constraint for global food security and sustainable development of human society agricultural irrigation accounts for 69 of global freshwater consumption fao 2016 but its demand is forecasted to increase by 19 till 2050 liu et al 2019 widespread saline water is an alternative resource that could fulfill agriculture irrigation demands muhammad et al 2021 however the high concentrations of cations and anions present in saline water often produce fouling in saline irrigation water distribution systems siwds zhangzhong et al 2016 calcium carbonate caco3 is a predominant fouling sediment that accounts for 52 4 94 1 of total fouling in siwds li et al 2019 ma et al 2020 leading to numerous deleterious issues i e decrease the system hydraulic efficiency li et al 2019 pipeline surface corrosion hasson et al 2019 partial or complete clogging of irrigation emitters alsadaie and mujtaba 2019 negative effects on crop yield production ngan and habimana 2020 as well as increases both capital and operational costs of irrigation systems zhou et al 2017 so far the caco3 fouling in siwds is often prevented by strong acids injection to lower the water ph perag√≥n et al 2017 however these applications brought severe drawbacks such as soil environmental hazards song et al 2019 and crop yield reductions khoshravesh et al 2018 therefore investigating an acceptable physical anti fouling operating conditions in siwds are key challenges recent studies began to characterize the hydrodynamic operating conditions which play an important role in minimizing fouling on pipeline surfaces kaya et al 2014 shear stress is an important hydrodynamic operating condition with a direct effect on caco3 fouling freeman et al 1990 jaffrin et al 2004 paz et al 2012 several studies have explored the influence of near wall shear stress hou et al 2020 duration and frequency of shear stress chan et al 2011 and constant shear stress rochex et al 2008 cowle et al 2019 on fouling these studies have clearly demonstrated a signiÔ¨Åcant correlation between the shear stress and fouling process however the latest research advancement have been mainly focused on the characteristics of biofouling formation the impacts of near wall shear stress on caco3 fouling in siwds are still elusive it is well understood that shear stress significantly alter the fouling growth helalizadeh et al 2000 fouling nucleation mechanism yang et al 2011 restructuring and breakage of agglomerates soos et al 2008 and morphologies and sizes distribution of crystal sonwai and mackley 2006 however caco3 fouling process is not only depending on shear stress but fluid temperature and ionic composition also play a critical role in fouling growth thus fouling process is influenced by mass transfer ca2 and hco3 ion hasan et al 2012 surface integration p√§√§kk√∂nen et al 2012 and sometimes the combination of both wang et al 2016 these experimental parameters should be operated together korchef 2019 which is therefore essential to explicitly understand the fouling mechanism furthermore the formation of caco3 fouling is related to the unit cell parameters such as cell volumes crystal sizes and lattice parameters zhang et al 2015 the development of rietveld refinement technique has made it possible to investigate the characteristics of crystal which might expose the potential interaction mechanism of shear stress and caco3 fouling thus considering the fouling behavior in siwds under actual field conditions caco3 fouling was cultured on drip irrigation pipelines under the conditions of different near wall shear stress temperature and ions the objectives of this work were to 1 investigate the caco3 fouling mechanism under different near wall shear stresses and operating conditions temperature and added ions 2 determine the control threshold of near wall shear stresses for mitigating caco3 fouling and 3 elucidate the impacts of near wall shear stresses on the lattice parameters of caco3 fouling and the potential action mechanisms of shear stresses 2 materials and methods 2 1 shear stress and water source preparation an experiment was conducted applying four types of near wall shear stress 0 05 0 20 0 40 and 0 60 pa which were in the domain of laminar Ô¨Çow in siwds and were comparable with previous studies hou et al 2020 the applied shear stress was coupled with water temperature 10 20 30 and 40 ¬∫c and two types of cations fe3 and mg2 accumulatively the experiment had a total of 48 treatments being their specific arrangements summarized in table s1 the experiment of caco3 fouling was carried out with an accelerated co2 dissolved technique at first the caco3 solution was prepared by dissolving 3 0 g of solid caco3 in 10 l of deionized water until no solids were lift in solution co2 gas was continuously fed into the solution overnight until ca2 co3 2 hco3 were prepared a total of three solutions were prepared i e pure solution of caco3 cc fecl3 fc and mgcl2 mc during the experiment the concentrations of the solutions were maintained as 0 2 g l and ph at a steady state of 5 5 5 7 hereafter to avoid any possible effects of left over solids in solutions that might act as seed material and might affect the caco3 fouling the solutions were Ô¨Åltered through a 0 22 ¬µm membrane Ô¨Ålter before being introduced to the test devices 2 2 shear stress apparatus configuration and operation an accelerated scale method using an annular reactor ar device previously developed by hou et al 2020 was used a total of 48 identical ar devices were used for fouling the ar consisted of water storage bucket a peristaltic pump latex tubes and a simulator as depicted in fig 1 the detailed description of ar device dimensions and operating conditions are detailed in table s2 the device was composed of two exterior and interior concentric rotating cylinders the rotation speed of internal cylinder was controlled by a servo head pump generating desired near wall shear stress at the internal surface of exterior stationary cylinder the share stress simulation methodology is briefly explained in supplementary materials section 1 1 applied temperatures were carefully controlled by putting the ar devices in temperature controlled incubators a total of 8 incubators were set up and each incubator consisted of 6 ars every individual ar was equipped with 24 polyethylene pe slides pieces of drip irrigation laterals used for irrigation water distribution in agriculture fields having dimensions of 19 1 cm which were fixed at internal surface of exterior cylinder the physical characteristics of pe were measured as roughness surface sq 145 nm 6 1 nm maximum height sy 1504 nm 15 3 nm and specific surface area sdr 0 18 0 02 thereafter the arrangement and fixation of pe slides against the interior surface were done as described by hou et al 2020 peristaltic water pumps with latex tubes and 10 08 ml min flow rate were used to gently feed the prepared water solution from buckets to ar devices and recirculate to solution buckets the temperature of solutions was checked on daily basis using a thermometer type o 264wt range 10 300 ¬∫c accuracy 1 ¬∫c

randomly selecting 3 pe slides which were cut out from each ar 2 3 sampling and characterization methods 2 3 1 fouling dry weight extraction the three selected pe pieces from each device at every sampling event were taken to analyze the fouling dry weight the collected samples were dried in an oven for 20 min at 60 ¬∫c a high precision electronic weight balance accuracy 10 4 g was used to weight the samples with fouling substances on it the pieces were then placed in zip lock bags and 20 ml of deionized water were added to detach the fouling substances using an ultrasonic cleaner manufacturer chaowei type gvs 10 l working rate of power 240 w frequency 60 hz hereafter the clean and dried pe pieces without fouling substances on it were weighed again and the difference between two weights was characterized as fouling dry weight 2 3 2 fouling characterization and evaluation at the end of experiment the phase composition and structure of fouling particles were identiÔ¨Åed by x ray diffractometry xrd the samples were vacuum dried at 15 ¬∫c and scanned using a x ray diffractometer manufacture bruker germany type d8 advance the basic test conditions of the test process were voltage 40 kv current 40 ma cu target and wavelength Œª 1 5406 √• the xrd patterns were recorded in the scanning range of 2Œ∏ 15 80 using a small angular step of 2Œ∏ equal to 0 017 and a Ô¨Åxed counting time of 4 s the obtained polycrystalline diffraction patterns were then ameliorated by rietveld refinement using the general structure analysis system gsas larson and von dreele 1994 to calculate the composition distribution unit cell volume lattice parameters of the obtained crystals xiao et al 2021 finally the obtained xrd map was analyzed using the supporting topas software bruker axs 2009 to determine the relative proportions of composed caco3 polymorphs 2 3 3 apparent morphology of fouling particles the caco3 fouling particles sizes and morphologies were examined using a scanning electron microscope sem manufacturer japan jeol model jsm 6510a at an operating voltage of 20 kv after sputtered gold Ô¨Ålm and magnification ranging from 400 to 15 000 the aspect ratios of particles size distributions were obtained by analyzing a minimum of 100 particles using morphologi g2 malven instrument and its software 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analyses were carried out using spss ver 22 0 ibm usa paired t test was applied to determine significant difference among pair of shear stress treatments p adjusted 0 05 linear regression and analysis of variance anova

effect of applied shear stress temperature and ions on content of calcite and aragonite and fouling total dry weight 3 results and analysis 3 1 effects of near wall shear stress on fouling dry weight overall the growth of caco3 fouling under each operating condition was divided in three phase development growth induction nucleation phase 0 50 h rapid growth phase 50 200 h and stability phase 200 300 h fig 2 the fouling growth augmented with increase of shear stress from 0 05 to 0 40 pa while it decreased at 0 60 pa as observed from fig 2 the highest fouling dry weight at 0 40 pa ranged between 0 18 and 1 83 mg cm2 which was 71 3 80 3 35 6 56 3 and 21 4 54 2 higher than 0 05 0 20 and 0 60 pa respectively meanwhile significant p 0 05 differences were found among all shear stress treatments at each temperature and ions table s4 the significance analysis table 1 showed that the coupling of shear stress with each temperature and ions significantly affected p 0 05 the fouling growth rate in order to estimate the coupling effect of temperature and ions on fouling growth at shear stress linear correlations between 0 05 pa and other shear stresses were performed fig s1 significant linear correlations r2 0 65 p 0 05 were obtained at each temperature and ion the increased temperature positively increased fouling growth rate characterized by the larger slopes k 1 of the fitting curves table s5 for instance k values at 0 40 pa compared with 0 05 pa at 10 ¬∫c reached to 3 22 4 28 while these were increased to 3 93 4 96 4 41 5 41 and 4 77 5 41 showing that the fouling rate was increased by 81 9 86 3 73 1 79 1 and 67 5 79 1 at 20 30 and 40 ¬∫c respectively similarly the k variation among different ions was analyzed at each temperature the k variation at 0 40 pa in cc ranged from 3 89 to 5 40 while fc tended to slightly increase and reached 4 28 5 71 however mc were found to comparatively declined the k values reached 3 22 4 77 at 10 40 ¬∫c respectively on the other hand the different shear stresses significantly affected the fouling growth rate at each temperature and ions table s6 the slope k of fouling growth rate increased with greater shear stress taking the example of k values at 40 ¬∫c when compared with 10 ¬∫c under 0 05 pa reached 2 54 3 48 which were increased to 3 85 5 10 3 56 5 23 and 4 27 6 23 with shear rates of 0 20 0 40 and 0 60 pa respectively besides the k values under different shear stress in fc varied noticeably increasing from 3 48 5 20 5 28 and 6 24 for 0 05 0 20 0 40 and 0 60 pa respectively 3 2 effects of near wall shear stress on fouling phase change fig 3 shows x ray powder diffraction and rietveld refinement patterns obtained for the samples at the end point 300 h of system operation and the mineral component proportions the x ray results revealed that the calcite was the most stable phase under each treatment since it contributed as 81 6 93 3 while aragonite ranged between 12 4 24 9 the t test analysis table s4 showed that the quantity of calcite and aragonite mineral were significantly p 0 05 different among different shear stress in each operating condition except for aragonite between 0 2 and 0 4 pa among the treatments the maximum amount of calcite was obtained at 0 40 pa ranging between 0 02 and 1 54 mg cm2 and being 25 8 75 9 35 1 82 6 and 4 7 66 3 higher than 0 05 pa 0 20 pa and 0 60 pa respectively fig 3d e f the coupling of shear stress with each temperature and ion presented a significant effect p 0 01 on calcite growth table 1 the content of calcite showed linear increasing trend with increase of temperature at each shear stress however addition of ions obviously changed the growth of calcite at each shear rate for instance the lowest content of calcite at constant temperature 40 ¬∫c ranged between 0 20 and 1 06 mg cm2 and was obtained with mc fig 3 e which was 12 7 34 1 and 32 7 36 8 lower than that for cc and fc respectively fig 3 d f moreover the content of aragonite in presence of mc increased considerably reaching 0 03 0 08 mg cm2 fig 3 h which was 14 7 66 1 and 79 3 77 9 higher than with cc and fc respectively fig 3 g i 3 3 caco3 particles size and morphology evaluation the variation of caco3 fouling particles sizes and apparent morphologies were determined under each shear stress in presence absence of ions and at different temperatures the average largest particle sizes across the treatments were obtained at 0 40 pa ranging between 1 35 and 7 45 ¬µm fig 4 a b c the fouling particle sizes increased positively with higher temperatures considering a constant shear stress of 0 4 pa the largest crystals were found at 40 ¬∫c sized 6 18 1 39 and 6 67 ¬µm for cc mc and fc respectively fig 5 shows the sem images of caco3 fouling particles obtained at 40 ¬∫c 40 ¬∫c were taken as example the detailed sem images at 10 20 and 30 ¬∫c are summarized in fig s2 the sem images clearly agreed with the xrd results indicating that caco3 particles typically contain dominant proportion of calcite and small quantity of aragonite the apparent morphologies of caco3 particles exhibited a certain difference with the different treatments those particles in cc and fc at initial shear stress 0 05 and 0 20 pa were the mixture of calcite fig 5 a b and aragonite fig 5 i j but with increasing of shear rates 0 40 0 60 pa pure crystals of calcite were typically obtained as large particles of euhedral pseudo hexagonal platelets exhibiting dense tight thick layers fig 5 c d k l on the other hand a higher quantity of aragonite with a smaller mono crystalline loose and distorted morphologies was obtained in mc fig 5 e f g h 3 4 variation of crystal unit cell and lattice parameters the xrd rietveld refinement analysis was performed to determine the variation in caco3 crystals structure and sizes affected by shear stress temperature and ions fig 6 the x ray results showed that the two phases acquired of caco3 fouling particles were calcite and aragonite therefore rietveld refinement analysis was performed with calcite space group of r 3c 167 and aragonite pmcn 62 crystallography open database cod the calcite unit cell volume cv was 367 47 and lattice parameters were a 4 98 √• b 4 98 √• and c 17 05 √• aragonite were 227 03 √• a 4 96 √• b 7 96 √• and c 5 741 √• fig 6 shows that the average rwp 0 003 0 04 and x 2 values 0 13 0 43 were recorded for all samples the unit cell volume of calcite exhibited largest expansion patterns at 0 40 pa whereas it increased cv by 3 57 9 73 2 44 5 62 and 1 13 3 24 when compared to 0 05 0 20 and 0 60 pa respectively meanwhile lattice parameters at 0 40 pa were also increased by a axis 0 001 0 003 0 0009 0 001 and 0 0003 0 001 √• b axis 0 0008 0 002 0 0009 0 002 and 0 0004 0 0008 √• and c axis 0 04 0 11 0 02 0 07 and 0 008 0 04 √• compared to 0 05 0 20 and 0 60 pa respectively calcite lattice parameters were found significantly p 0 05 different among different shear stress table s8 however the cv and lattice parameters a b and c of aragonite were almost kept unchanged and most of the treatments were found non significantly p 0 05 different 3 5 structural equation modeling analysis sema this study also performed structural equation modeling analysis sema to further validate the hypothesis fig 7 consistent with experiment results shear stress showed the strongest direct effects on calcite growth Œ≤ 0 46 p 0 01 and presented weak correlation with aragonite Œ≤ 0 22 p 0 05 at the same time ions also showed the strongest correlation with both calcite and aragonite Œ≤ 0 53 0 58 p 0 01 however temperature was in a weak and non significant correlation with calcite and aragonite Œ≤ 0 23 0 06 p 0 05 respectively matching with results of coupling effect of shear stress with temperature and ion on fouling growth slope the inter correlation among these three factors was found significant finally both calcite and aragonite directly affected the total weight of caco3 fouling with a significant correlation Œ≤ 0 73 0 27 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different operating conditions on caco3 fouling growth a set of experiments were designed to systematically determine the influence of varying operating conditions i e near wall shear stress water temperature and ions on fouling growth in siwds the obtained results demonstrated that the growth of caco3 fouling significantly p 0 05 depended on shear stress temperature and ions fig 2 some studies postulated that the higher shear stress cross section flow velocity sometimes linearly increases andritsos et al 1997 or decreases fouling growth rate crittenden et al 2015 lee et al 2013 the caco3 fouling is mainly controlled by mass transfer surface integration or both mechanisms mwaba et al 2006 in this study the effects of applied near wall shear stress on caco3 fouling presented a quadratic correlation r2 0 90 p 0 05 for each temperature and ion types fig s3 this indicated that the fouling growth rate was positively increased at initial shear stress from 0 05 to 0 40 pa and then there was a remarkable transition from positive to negative at higher shear rate of 0 60 pa the highest fouling rate at each temperature was obtained when the near wall shear stress and flow velocity were 0 40 pa and 0 24 m s respectively fig s3 thereafter the fouling rate was significantly decreased when the shear rate reached 0 60 pa and flow velocity was 0 41 m s these observations indicated that caco3 fouling process was likely mass transfer controlled before reaching 0 40 pa and changed to activation controlled at higher shear rate of 0 60 pa however these results were quite different from those reported by helalizadeh et al 2000 who applied flow velocities between 0 5 and 2 m s and found that the fouling process was mass transfer controlled when the flow velocity was between 0 40 and 0 80 m s thereafter the mechanism was activation controlled when flow velocity increased to 0 80 1 m s which could be probably explained by the high temperature 50 90 ¬∫c and ions solution concentration 0 25 1 mg l applied in the experiment wang et al 2016 applied a flow velocity range of 0 06 0 80 m s and explained this phenomenon as the laminar boundary layer was increased linearly until 0 06 0 30 m s increasing the fouling average growth rate however when velocity was increased above 0 30 m s the turbulence flow increased the shear stress on surface of pipeline and fouling removal rate as well as shortened the Ô¨Çuid residence time at the wall surface thus reducing the probability of the depositing material to adhere to the surface p√§√§kk√∂nen et al 2012 the effects of different temperature on fouling growth demonstrated that the increase in temperature linearly increased caco3 fouling growth similar results were reported by hasan et al 2012 who found the higher the solution temperature the lower the fouling resistance they further explained that the wall temperature directly increases with the increase of solution temperature which increases the supersaturation at wall surface the increased wall temperature decreases the inverse solubility of caco3 increasing the supersaturation at the wall surface and eventually further leads to increase fouling rate wang et al 2016 in addition the rietveld reÔ¨Ånement analysis demonstrated significant expansion of unit cell volume and lattice parameters of calcite with increase of temperature at each shear stress fig 6 these results were also in a good agreement with previous reports chang et al 2017 furthermore the nature of caco3 fouling growth was not obviously changed under fc but slightly increased the fouling rate when compared to cc the growth of caco3 fouling regardless of shear stress and temperature were significantly p 0 05 inhibited under mc when compared with cc and fc however mc strongly promoted the formation of aragonite at each shear stress and temperature the effect of mg2 has been reported briefly by several authors martos et al 2010 rodriguez blanco et al 2012 suggesting that the dehydration energy difference between ca2 and mg2 ion is responsible for the inhibition of the caco3 precipitation the rietveld reÔ¨Ånement of x ray diffraction demonstrated that the lattice parameters of calcite were exclusively changed with added ions thus lattice parameters of calcite were slightly increased in cc and fc ma et al 2016 postulated this occurrence as doped ca2 probably would be introduced to the host lattice of caco3 crystal in cc or fc thus causing the expansion of lattice parameters however lattice parameters in mc were comparatively lower than those in cc and fc this was due to the substitution of the ca2 ions in caco3 by the mg2 since the atomic ion radius of mg2 1 598 √• is smaller than that of ca2 1 974 √• mejri et al 2014 the xrd diffraction results and sem images indicated that the caco3 fouling was a mixture of calcite and aragonite minerals however with the exception of mc calcite minerals were the predominant phase under each condition fig 3 the total fouling particle size of calcite was positively increased with shear stress and temperature fig 4 furthermore the calcite crystal cell volume and lattice parameters showed obvious expansion with increase of particle size several previous studies have demonstrated the significant p 0 05 positive or negative correlation between crystal size and lattice parameters mhadhbi et al 2010 sheng et al 2010 our results were in strong agreement with results previously reported mhadhbi et al 2010 qi and wang 2005 the calcite crystals were tightly compact and smooth surfaces with very small quantity of aragonite particles were found at higher shear rates according to daoyin et al 2018 the higher shear stress results in breakup of aggregates since the stable size of aggregates decreases with increasing shear stress 4 2 coupling effects of temperature and ions on shear stress fouling this study also investigated the coupling effects of water temperature and added ions on caco3 fouling at different near wall shear stress the coupling of shear stress at each temperature demonstrated that the fouling rate was positively increased at initial shear stress while decreased at higher shear stress rates this could be attributed to increased convective heat transfer where increasing flow velocity decrease the wall temperature xiao et al 2020 p√§√§kk√∂nen et al 2012 found that increased velocity from 0 20 to 0 40 m s reduced the wall temperature by 15 ¬∫c which strongly described the variation in fouling rate on the other hand the coupling of varied temperature at shear stress and added ions fouling rate demonstrated that the rise in temperature from 10 to 40 ¬∫c linearly increased caco3 fouling growth table s5 which has been discussed earlier similarly the coupling effects of added ions on fouling growth at each shear stress were estimated table s7 the coupling of shear stress with added ions indicated that the fouling growth rate was reduced by higher shear stresses this was due to greater mass transfer boundary layer thickness at lower flow velocities therefore molecular diffusion strongly affected fouling growth however the higher flow velocities decreased the boundary layer thickness and fouling process was changed from mass transfer to reaction controlled therefore water temperature and ions addition are two important factors that should be taken into consideration when applying shear stress to alleviate caco3 fouling 4 3 engineering implications for anti fouling in siwds this study clearly demonstrated that caco3 fouling was significantly affected by near wall shear stress under different operating conditions i e different temperature and ions it is important to evaluate the engineering implications to further validate the results for successful application in siwds the average thickness of caco3 fouling reached its maximum at a shear stress of 0 40 pa and at a velocity of 0 24 m s while the higher shear stress 0 60 pa at 0 41 m s decreased its growth rate previous studies li et al 2015 puig bargu√©s and lamm 2013 suggested that better sediments removal rate is achieved when flushing velocity was around 0 45 m s considering these results this study strongly recommends the shear stress equal or above 0 60 pa should be maintained in siwds in addition the emitter complex labyrinth channels create discontinuity in flow velocity liu et al 2016 and consequently create high speed and low speed flow zones which significantly alter the solid particles deposition rate at inlet mid and end parts of emitter flow channels xiao et al 2020 we suggest a careful design to minimize the dead areas regions that allow suspended particles to settle and deposit in siwds and to avoid shear forces around 0 4 pa on emitter surfaces on other hand the increasing temperature linearly increased the fouling growth rate therefore evening irrigation events are recommended to the crop fields when using siwds particularly in summer season or in hot weather areas dong et al 2016 reported that night drip irrigation decreased the soil shallow root zone temperature by 0 6 ¬∫c promoted plant height and crop yield by 2 and 10 respectively furthermore the coupling of water temperature with shear stress demonstrated the higher shear stress promoted the convective heat transfer at each temperature thus reducing the rate of fouling growth it is suggested the higher shear stress should be used in siwds during high temperature irrigation events our results also demonstrated that fe3 increased the fouling growth rate when compared with mg2 the coupling of shear stress with ions indicated that the higher shear stress reduced the boundary layer thickness in each added ion which resulted in decrease of the fouling growth rate therefore we suggest that firstly when using high saline irrigation water which contains co3 2 po4 3 so4 2 sio3 2 oh fe3 fe2 mn2 ca2 s2 etc application in siwds integrated with fertigation particular attention should be paid to the concentration of foreign added ions through fertilizers secondly the results demonstrated the calcite fouling was easier formed at 0 40 pa indicating that the shear stress should be maintained at 0 20 pa or 0 60 pa however due to the main function of an emitter being energy dissipation if the shear stresses were controlled at less than 0 2 pa the flow in emitter channel would be almost in low speed regions in emitters with good energy dissipation the lengths of emitter channels are mostly very long the flow indexes are very high hydraulic performance is comparatively reduced and have higher manufacturing costs feng et al 2018 therefore we recommend the higher flow velocity shear stress 0 60 pa should be maintained in siwds synergistically improving the emitter hydraulic performance and alleviating the calcium carbonate precipitation in summary the present experimental results pave the way for studies of various aspects of fouling including effect of near wall shear stress temperature gradients and added ions on controlling of caco3 fouling in siwds the results suggested that higher shear stress could be effective in mitigating caco3 fouling nonetheless the meaningful findings were acquired in this study to greater insight on near wall shear stress in siwds the issues of integrated application of saline irrigation and fertilizer in siwds sufficient number of cations should be considered in future studies 5 conclusion the main conclusions derived from the experiment carried out in the present study are 1 overall the fouling growth rate under different near wall shear stress shows significant p 0 05 differences under each operating condition of temperature and added ions the highest fouling rate ranged between 0 30 and 1 83 mg cm2 and was observed at 0 40 pa which was 59 3 80 3 37 6 56 3 and 21 4 50 2 higher than 0 05 0 20 and 0 60 pa respectively 2 temperature and added ions significantly p 0 01 affected caco3 fouling rate under each shear stress the fouling growth fitting curves k slope difference between 0 40 and 0 05 pa linearly increased with increase of temperature 20 40 ¬∫c similarly these slopes varied significantly with addition of ions where fc tend to increase while mc decline the fouling growth slope when compared with cc 3 the xrd and sem observation revealed that the caco3 fouling in cc and fc were predominantly caused by calcite minerals while the content of aragonite became more stable in mc crystal apparent morphologies in fc exhibited as dense tight thick layered structure and mc was observed with loose and distorted structures declaration of competing

10163,agriculture is a major consumptive user of water through evapotranspiration et quantification of actual et eta is of significant interest to better address water management and improve decision making in the agricultural sector many methods to estimate et are available however due to the increasing need of validation of estimates of et from various techniques there arises a call for a critical comparison of eta estimated from a combination of methods this research presents a critical comparison of eta estimates obtained using ground based eddy covariance remotely sensed et ensemble

instruments the need for better quality and reliable eta data is increasing being required for irrigation management scheduling and computing crop water requirements however measuring and estimating it accurately is difficult although there are many methods there is a lack of comparison and error assessment among their results there are various methods for estimating eta at different scales such as evaporation pans lysimeters eddy covariance ec remote sensing land surface models lsms surface water budget modelling and soil water balance methods wang et al 2015 among the methods on site measurements can be performed by ec stations installed in the field more than 500 stations are part of the global fluxnet fluxnet fluxdata org network which is a global networked community composed of regional networks such as ameriflux asiaflux and euroflux because of its direct measurement ec is considered to be among one of the most accurate methods available for gas flux measurement burba 2013 the high cost and time consuming nature of ec measurements make them unsuitable for routine measurements however allen et al 1998 and measurements are characteristic of a specific location and land cover type et from ec serves as an observed field dataset which can be used for comparing estimates with those from other products correction of flux measurements and estimation of et from ec have been reported in various studies twine et al 2000 uddin et al 2013 the use of empirical models in the agricultural sector is fundamental in estimation of crop water requirements and simulation of

mapping et anderson et al 2007a 2007b satellite based methods can be biased due to poor calibration and little no verification with ground data so data must be validated research needs to be conducted regarding whether eta from different approaches is significantly different from each other or in agreement and to help validate newer methods there have been studies on various methods for measuring eta uddin et al 2013 rana and katerji 2000 but to date the comparison between estimates from different methods is not sufficient and as such the differences between them are not fully ascertained while some combinations of methods are compared including field remote sensed and modeled data kite and droogers 2000a 2000b ha et al 2015 glenn et al 2011 wang et al 2015 many combinations of methods are not compared with each other this requires a critical comparison between the estimates of eta derived from different methods in situ simulation models remote sensing assessing how the methods are different from each other in terms of eta estimation as well as the applicability of methods in particular situations this research compares and analyzes eta estimates obtained from three methods at the same locations the methods are 1 ground based observations from ec stations 2 satellite based remotely sensed data from the et ensemble dataset hessels 2017 3 empirical simulation using simetaw mancosu et al 2016 the three methods have not been compared with each other at the same time and in the same place the study applies the methods to three sites in the usa with different crops in different growing seasons which give this research a perspective from varied physical and meteorological conditions comparison of estimates from such diverse methods contributes to assessment of the differences in the estimate of eta and as such offers more information for water resources planners 2 materials and methodology 2 1 methods this research estimates and compares eta obtained from the

boundary layer of atmosphere above vegetation and are most accurate in steady atmosphere homogeneous underlying vegetation and on flat terrain kumar et al 2017 data measured from ec stations is obtained from the ameriflux management project http ameriflux lbl gov apart from flux data other data such as soil type soil depth crop type growing season and irrigation system are collected from literature as well as from questionnaires sent to the principal investigators of each site the reliability of measured ec data is assessed by computing the energy balance closure ebc the climate data

heat h and latent heat le site measurements available in the fluxnet database and used in this work are gap filled using the marginal distribution sampling mds method reichstein et al 2005 the data are downscaled to site level from era interim re analysis data where possible as described by vuichard and papale 2015 in this work a combination of these two products is used more details about fluxnet dataset and data processing are available in pastorello et al 2020 the processing of climate crop and soil data from the ec sites which are used as input to simetaw is discussed in the following section 2 1 2 simetaw simetaw mancosu et al 2016 is a crop soil water balance model that calculates daily eto crop evapotranspiration etc etaw crop coefficient kc effective rainfall and irrigation requirement for water resources planning and water allocation it simulates hypothetical irrigation schedules for use in irrigated agriculture management the etaw or irrigation requirement is the estimated volume of irrigation water needed to refill water losses from the soil root zone due to etc that is not replaced by other sources of water etaw is computed as the sum of the mean depth of applied water infiltrated into the low quarter during the crop growing season simetaw adjusts the estimated eto by including in the canopy resistance equation the changes of co2 concentration in the atmosphere adaptation strategies can be proposed for sustainable use of water in irrigation snyder et al 2012 mancosu et al 2016 crop information such as crop coefficients seasonal start and end dates are required by the model soil depth rooting depth and soil water holding capacity are also required in simetaw the crop coefficient of the midseason kc mid is adjusted as a function of local climate and computed as k c mid k c tab 0 261 et o 7 3 k c tab 1 where kc mid is the corrected midseason crop coefficient and kc tab is the tabular midseason crop coefficient it is possible to change default crop coefficients according to the area under investigation during the off season most of the evaporation is from bare soil for this a bare soil coefficient ke is used in the model the end points of the growth periods are defined as a percentage of the duration of the crop growing season snyder et al 2012 simetaw takes input of eto computed using hargreaves samani or penman monteith equations due to limitation of available data a simplified version of hargreaves samani samani 2000 temperature based equation was modified to account for solar radiation this is achieved by combining the original hargreaves samani equation with the equation for solar radiation r s kt r a td 0 5 where rs is solar radiation kt is empirical coefficient calculated from kt 0 00185 td 2 0 0433 td 0 4023 ra is extra terrestrial radiation mm day 1 and td is difference of maximum and minimum temperature c the modified equation for calculating eto is et o 0 0135 kt r a td 0 5 tc 17 8 where tc is average daily temperature c this equation accounts for solar radiation and temperature and reduces errors in estimation of solar radiation from temperature and in the estimation of eto this equation enables the estimation of eto using minimal climatological data 2 1 2 1 simetaw input data two types of climate data are used as input to simetaw i ec data and ii nldas data crop and soil data are used as input and collected through literature review and questionnaire filled by the principal investigators of the experimental sites from ec climate data i e precipitation minimum temperature and maximum

taken for california and oklahoma the daily maximum and minimum temperature are used in modified hargreaves samani equation samani 2000 haie et al 2018 to compute solar radiation and eto eto and precipitation along with soil and crop data i e soil depth rooting depth soil water holding capacity crop type irrigation system crop coefficients planting and harvesting dates and allowable depletion

hourly daily and monthly the resolution of data is 0 125 and the grid spacing is 1 8th degree the data from 1979 comes under nldas 2 also called nldas 2 noah model https ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas the resolution is 12 km x 12 km here data from 2001 to 2014 are used at daily time scale a python script extracts the precipitation and temperature data for all growing seasons in the three sites the maximum and minimum temperature are used in modified hargreaves samani equation samani 2000 haie et al 2018 to compute solar radiation and eto the crop and soil data for running simetaw is the same as for ec input data see above with the only difference being the climate data source eto and precipitation along with crop and soil data from ec stations see above are used as input to obtain eta estimates 2 1 3 et ensemble for the remote sensed data an ensemble product of et measurements called et ensemble is used which is a combination of seven different products hofste 2014 suggests that using an ensemble or merged et product gives better results as compared to a single remote sensing et product et ensemble is developed for latitudes 40 to 40 hessels 2017 the first version et ensemble v1 0 was generated as continuous monthly data spanning the period from january 2003 to december 2014 the resolution is 250 m x 250 m pixel size 0 0025 the products in et ensemble include mod16 mu et

2017 when all the et products match pixel size the standard deviation of the ensemble is calculated it is possible to apply an outlier method for each pixel and the coefficient of variation cv is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean of the et estimates of all the products outliers are removed and the et average and standard deviation of the pixels are re calculated until there are no further outliers two types of data are obtained for estimating eta from et ensemble in single pixel data the pixel coinciding with the exact location of the ec stations was selected in data using an average of nine pixels an average of the study site pixel and the eight surrounding pixels is taken the average of nine pixels is taken to account for variation and thus validation of the single pixel data 2 2 data for the three above mentioned methods there are three sources of data 1 ameriflux ec station data for measured flux and simetaw simulations 2 nldas data for simetaw

flux data for assessing the quality of flux data obtained from ec stations energy balance closure wilson et al 2002 culf et al 2004 stoy et al 2013 is evaluated by statistical regression of turbulent energy fluxes sensible heat and latent heat against available energy net radiation and soil heat flux the energy balance closure is also evaluated by solving for the energy balance ratio ebr gu et al 1999 wilson et al 2002 or the relative energy balance closure aubinet et al 1999 which is the ratio of turbulent energy fluxes to available energy i e ebr Œªet h rn g 2 2 2 triple collocation method for comparison of results dual comparisons are often made for calibration of results however implicit assumptions limit the accuracy of such comparisons between two datasets with one dataset being taken as reference here results are compared using the triple collocation method stoffelen 1998 this method has been widely used to characterize errors in remote sensed in situ and modeled data for global soil moisture products and is used to compare three datasets with an independent error structure while not requiring the availability of a high quality reference dataset mccoll et al 2014 as is the case in this research this method quantifies the random error variances for large datasets when the accurate dataset or the truth is not known errors of a dataset exist from residual and random errors systematic errors of a dataset can be correcting using a bias but random errors make the dataset less reliable the triple collocation method separates the total error into random and systematic error components an advantage of triple collocation is that it limits the effect of systematic and random errors of two sets of data on the third dataset scipal et al 2013 the main assumption is that the three datasets are independent from each other which means that the input sources must be from different measurement systems and not linked to each other because of this the usage of this method becomes limiting vogelzang and stoffelen 2012 errors are calibrated by neutral regression which is performed to minimize the systematic errors of a dataset and reach convergence after successive iterations according to scipal and dorigo 2010 each dataset differs from the hypothetical truth by a residual error the variance of these residuals after removing the bias is calculated to quantify the quality of each dataset the higher the random error of a dataset the lower the quality this research fulfills the conditions for application of this method gruber et al 2016 the following combinations of datasets are considered for comparison using triple collocation comparison1 et a 1vs et a 2bvs et a 3a comparison2 et a 1vs et a 2bvs et a 3b comparison3 et a 1vs et a 2avs et a 3a

carried out in three experimental sites table 2 selected from the ameriflux management project of the fluxnet network they are located in nebraska oklahoma and california in the usa an ec tower is installed at each site and all these sites have the requisite data available for full comparison of the three measurement methods at each site a different crop is grown in different growing seasons in different types of soil and using different irrigation systems apart from the literature consulted for some data a questionnaire was circulated among the principal investigators of the ec sites to collect further information 3 results 3 1 eta estimates the eta results are obtained for the complete duration of the growing seasons for all three sites table 2 as the et ensemble data are estimated at monthly scale the daily data obtained from other methods are aggregated to obtain monthly eta so that all results are comparable only months of the growing seasons which consist of more than 15 days are included in the comparison and plotted 3 1 1 nebraska the results for maize growing seasons 2001 2002 and 2003 are shown in fig 2 the et ensemble data is only available for the 2003 growing season in 2001 eta 2a and eta 2b are underestimated compared to eta 1 and are closely related to each other the estimates of eta 1 are higher particularly towards the middle of the growing season fig 2a in 2002 eta 2a and eta 2b values are very close until the end of the last stage of the growing season when eta 2a values slightly increase fig 2b the same trend is shown in 2003 where the difference between eta 2a and eta 2b in the late season is higher the difference estimated in 2002 fig 2c the difference increases towards the end of the growing season eta 1 estimates are higher initially and lower later in comparison to eta 2a and eta 2b eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble are almost the same although simetaw uses two different input datasets the trend of eta 2a and eta 2b is similar the mid to late season underestimation by simetaw is reported also by mancosu et al 2016 at a peach site in california for years 2002 2003 and 2004 eta 1 shows the highest values of eta eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble are lower than other estimates the difference between eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble is negligible the energy balance closure is acceptable mean r2 0 95 the correlation between turbulent fluxes and available energy which is indicated by the ebr is close to unity mean ebr 0 99 indicating that the turbulent fluxes and the available energy are almost equal to each other 3 1 2 oklahoma the results for wheat growing seasons 2003 04 2005 06 2008 09 2009 10 and 2011 12 are shown in fig 3 in the 2003 04 growing season all eta estimates are close to each other except eta 3a and eta 3b fig 3a the difference between eta 3a and eta 3b is negligible eta 2a is higher than eta 2b in the 2003 04 growing season around the middle of the 2005 06 growing season eta 2b is higher than eta 2a because of higher rainfall measurements by nldas fig 3b eta 1 is lower than eta 2a and eta 2b in the 2008 09 growing season eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble are the lowest fig 3c similar overall trends are observed in 2009 10 and 2011 12 growing seasons figs 3d and 3e eta 1 shows slight underestimation in the early season and overestimation in the late season as compared to eta 2a and eta 2b a similar trend was observed for a rain fed wheat crop cultivated in california mancosu et al 2016 in which the difference between observed and modeled estimates was because of water stress eta 2a and eta 2b show the highest estimates of eta eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble are lower than all estimates the difference between the two is negligible the energy balance closure is acceptable mean r2 0 91 the ebr is acceptable and close to unity 3 1 3 california the results for rice growing seasons 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2014 are shown in fig 4 in the 2009 growing season eta 3a and eta 3b are very low compared to estimates from other methods fig 4a in 2010 eta 2a is higher than eta 2b fig 4b in 2011 mid season eta 1 is higher than eta 2a and eta 2b and it means that simetaw is underestimating in this case fig 4c this trend was observed in a peach crop site for the growing seasons of 2002 2003 and 2004 in california mancosu et al 2016 similar overall trends are observed in 2012 and 2014 growing seasons fig 4d and e the energy balance closure is acceptable mean r2 0 83 and the energy balance ratio is close to unity 3 2 standard deviation using triple collocation as the estimates from et ensemble i e eta 3a 1 pixel and eta 3b 9 pixels average are very similar only eta 3a is plotted in section 3 2 3 2 1 standard deviation of eta in nebraska for nebraska the data from et ensemble is unavailable thus only comparison 7 is possible fig 5 both the modeled results eta 2a and eta 2b have a low standard deviation i e error from the hypothetical truth and are close to each other whereas error from eta 1 is relatively high this implies that the climate data used for simetaw from ameriflux and nldas are in close agreement and support the respective eta estimates greater error in eta 1 does not necessarily imply that it is inaccurate rather it differs more from the hypothetical truth than the other results the error increases with successive growing seasons 3 2 2 standard deviation of eta in oklahoma in comparison 1 the error in eta 1 is low whereas the error in eta 3a is comparatively high error in eta 2b fluctuates fig 6 similarly in comparison 3 error in eta 2a fluctuates however eta 1 and eta 3a show more agreement with lower error indicating that estimates from ec and et ensemble are closer to the hypothetical truth in comparison 5 eta 2a and eta 2b show reasonable agreement indicating that the model gives similar results using different datasets eta 3a shows higher error and deviates more from the hypothetical truth in comparison 7 results show moderate error with eta 2a and eta 2b showing some agreement eta 1 shows slightly higher error overall modeled results show considerable fluctuation eta 1 gives consistent results mostly and the error is in almost the same range in various comparisons 3 2 3 standard deviation of eta in california in comparison 1 eta 3a generally shows the least error which could be due to the high resolution et ensemble data whereas eta 1 shows a stable error fig 7 eta 2b shows increasing error in comparison 3 eta 1 and eta 3a show good agreement along with lower error meaning that both of these are closer to the hypothetical truth whereas eta 2a shows higher and increasing error similar to the pattern of eta 2b in comparison 1 in comparison 5 eta 2a and eta 2b show close agreement with eta 3a though with fluctuating error in comparison 7 eta 1 and eta 2a show good correspondence in error with eta 2b showing lower error 3 3 summary of results in nebraska eta 1 from flux data is higher than eta 2a and eta 2b in particular in the mid season eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble are very close to each other the et ensemble exhibits the lowest eta estimates similarly in oklahoma eta 3a and eta 3b show the least variation possibly owing to the high resolution in california eta 1 from flux data shows slight overestimation during the mid season the estimates and the standard deviation in the three methods are summarized below 3 3 1 eta from eddy covariance the eta estimates from ec eta 1 show very good correlation with r2 in the range 0 88 0 99 for the evaluation of energy balance closure from this it can be inferred that the measurements of turbulent fluxes and available energy have very high closure and that the data from ec stations under ameriflux are of good quality considering the energy balance ratio it is concluded that the turbulent fluxes and available energy are very much in balance with a ratio ranging from 0 99 to 1 00 in comparison to the modeled eta estimates the estimates from ec show some overestimation 3 3 2 eta from simetaw the eta estimates from simetaw eta 2a and eta 2b are slightly overestimated in the start of growing season and slightly underestimated in mid or mid to late season with respect to the other methods a similar trend is reported by mancosu et al 2016 this can be related to the model midseason crop coefficient eta 2a is slightly higher than eta 2b overall the trend between both simulated estimates eta 2a and eta 2b does not show significant deviation the difference between estimates from ec eta 1 and simetaw eta 2a and eta 2b is slightly higher in california and in nebraska the trends of estimates from both these methods correspond towards the end of growing seasons in california indicating that there is some agreement this can be seen in nebraska where the simulated eta 2a and eta 2b and observed eta 1 eta correspond in the start and end of the growing season whereas the middle of growing season differs and can be attributed to the corrected mid season crop coefficient in simetaw the rice crop in california shows a trend similar to that of the wheat crop in california in late season mancosu et al 2016 eta 1 has a trend similar to that of eta 2a and eta 2b for the winter wheat crop in oklahoma however the differences between them can arise because of measurement errors due to rainfall the difference between the results from simetaw and other methods can be related to the crop soil climate input data the adjusted crop coefficients the agricultural practices and the equation used for estimating eto and used for calculating eta in the model 3 3 3 eta from et ensemble estimates from et ensemble eta 3a and eta 3b are lower in all growing seasons in the three sites in comparison to the other methods to check whether the estimates from a single pixel eta 3a are acceptable or not the estimates from average of nine pixels eta 3b show that they are close to each other which demonstrates that the chosen pixel is consistent with the surrounding 8 pixels and is representative of them this can be seen in comparison of all eta 3a estimates with eta 3b estimates a possible reason for the lower values during the growing seasons can be the use of the land surface temperature from global weather models that many of the et products use as input over irrigated areas those products tends to give elevated land surface temperature values the weather models do not include irrigation and therefor a higher soil moisture content is not taken into account in irrigated areas which will result in less cooling more sensible heat flux and less evapotranspiration 3 3 4 eta in comparison the estimates from simetaw eta 2a and eta 2b and et ensemble eta 3a and eta 3b are lower in most of the growing seasons in the three sites as compared with the estimates from ec eta 1 the ec data can be considered accurate because of the direct field measurements although the spatial extent of the measurements is very limited for considering a greater areal extent for eta estimates ec method is not suitable unless data from multiple stations is obtained ec does show a good correlation r2 and energy balance ratio for energy balance closure but the estimates depend on periodic maintenance and calibration of the instruments simetaw shows variation in its estimates from overestimating in early season to underestimating in mid to late season and vice versa in nebraska the model shows good correspondence with ec though with fluctuation in estimates simetaw overestimates results using ameriflux data eta 2a in comparison to using nldas data eta 2b but underestimates generally in comparison to ec eta 1 and overestimates in comparison to et ensemble eta 3a and eta 3b although simetaw is data intensive it offers many scenario options including climate change water deficit and water allocation et ensemble takes advantage in utilizing high resolution data usage of combination of multiple datasets and a wide range of spatial and temporal scales estimates from et ensemble eta 3a show low standard deviation both estimates from simetaw eta 2a and eta 2b show moderate standard deviation which is in close agreement and mostly lower than the third estimate in any comparison estimates from ec eta 1 show least standard deviation when compared with modeled estimates eta 2a and eta 2b and et ensemble estimates eta 3a in a single comparison and show relatively high standard deviation when compared with both modeled estimates eta 2a and eta 2b the higher standard deviation in estimates from ec eta 1 as compared to modelled results eta 2a and eta 2b does not imply that estimates from ec are inaccurate as the standard deviation of datasets from triple collocation is independent of the accuracies of the datasets a dataset can have a high standard deviation by taking the total errors into account but this can be the result of a high systematic error the standard deviation of the random errors tells more about the inaccuracy of the dataset which is shown by the triple collocation method 4 discussion increasing demand for water from different sectors can threaten long term sustainability of water supply in arid regions such as the south western united states particularly california where a model california simetaw was developed for coping with unsustainable irrigation practices orang et al 2013 with the water deficit and increasing demand there is pressure for better water resources management irrigated agriculture is one of the major water users and therefore it is important to accurately estimate agricultural water consumption although several methods have been compared for estimating eta there still remains a gap in comparing certain methods and assessing the relative differences between their estimates data availability and requirements for each method can affect the applicability of the three methods can limit the performance of the methods and affect their results for the flux data the ec station sites could not be chosen for any terrain other than cropland since simetaw is applicable only on cropland the widely accepted ec method provides eta estimates based on field data from direct atmospheric measurements the estimates are accurate but only at the measurement location limiting their wider spatial applicability ec estimates can vary due to poor calibration of instruments lack of proper maintenance and supervision the flux data used in this research was already gap filled and corrections were applied by fluxnet for the ec estimates of eta the correlation between the turbulent fluxes and the available energy for all the flux data is acceptable with an r2 value up to 0 96 in the case of nebraska the energy balance ratio for the flux data is close to unity which indicates a good energy balance closure the high level of energy balance closure is attributed to application of the bowen ratio correction by the fluxnet2015 data processing system the equation used for estimating eto adjusting the crop coefficient as well as the input data regarding climate soil crops and irrigation system can have a combined effect on performance of simetaw estimation from simetaw is dependent on inputs of agricultural practices and irrigation systems management although the model has the ability to consider all these factors input data is another factor that can affect the results for using the model to estimate eta details about crop seasonal start and end dates rooting depth soil depth allowable depletion irrigation type and soil water holding capacity are required this makes the model data intensive opens up areas for error propagation and limits the possibility of its application in this study the simulated eta from simetaw is dependent on a simplified version of the original hargreaves samani eto equation samani 2000 the original equation was modified by introducing an equation to estimate solar radiation samani 2000 the simulated results using this modified equation in simetaw have shown acceptable eta estimates obtained with minimal climatological data and an improved estimate of solar radiation from temperature other equations for estimating eto can be used instead of the modified hargreaves samani eto equation when data are available as was done in the estimation of eta in canada martel et al 2018 the hargreaves samani equation does not account for variations in wind speed and humidity in windier and humid locations hargreaves samani equation will underestimate eto the equation performs well for estimation in california since it is neither windy nor humid there is a good correlation between results from simetaw using nldas and ameriflux data although both have entirely different spatial and temporal scales hence the model performs well with different input datasets due to a combination of seven products used within the et ensemble dataset it is possible to underestimate eta due to one or more remote sensing model underestimations a general comment regarding the underestimation of et ensemble products is avoided here since it is a recently developed dataset in this case however the underestimation in comparison to observed data is possibly due to absence of irrigation or precipitation data that could influence the results the eta estimates from et ensemble are underestimated in all sites compared to the estimates from ec and simetaw any conclusions made about the performance of these methods should be considered in the context of the sites included in this research for applying any one of the methods in a different situation care should be taken to choose suitable methods for estimating eta as none of them is claimed to be more accurate or reliable than another researchers should utilize their preferred methods based on research needs such as time and spatial scale data resolution availability of data from eddy covariance stations availability of crop climate and soil input data and information necessary to run the model the possibility to meet the required conditions for applying the triple collocation methods and the methods performance as is described in this research these comparisons can serve as a reference for water managers dealing with irrigated agriculture to better assess the consumptive use of water with the results from the methods giving a reasonable range for real eta values the trend of estimates from these methods can help determine consumptive water use although there is some variation the results are relatively similar giving a reasonable impression of expected eta at a site including variability which offers useful information for water resources planning in addition simetaw can support policy making by suggesting water demand requirements possible irrigation schedules and computation of etaw this can trigger decision making and implementation among the water managing authorities for proper water allocation this is especially pertinent in areas having irrigated agriculture with water deficit such as california the research offers a stepping stone for estimation and comparison of eta using a variety of methods 5 conclusion this research aimed at estimation and comparison of actual evapotranspiration using 1 eddy covariance 2 simetaw 3 et ensemble the work provides a comparison using triple collocation regarding how the different methods perform against each other for regions with irrigated agriculture with a water deficit it is important to know the consumptive use thus the estimation of eta from these methods provides a comprehensive view of the results in different climatological conditions with different crops at different sites the data collected from ameriflux ec stations nldas and et ensemble are used to estimate eta for various growing seasons in the three sites in the usa nebraska oklahoma and california while the methods showed some variability in the results this variation is relatively small and much of the variation is consistent between the three methods for example results from et ensemble consistently underestimated eta with respect to the other two methods simetaw was forced with different climate input data to generate two sets of independent outputs however these are in very close agreement suggesting that the model performs similarly with different input datasets the results presented here offer information on consumptive water demand at the three study sites with crops with the variation in results giving a reasonable range of likely actual water consumption such information derived from three independent sources provides more certain estimates to water resources planners on which to make water allocation and supply decisions both in terms of volume and timing through growing seasons and for different crops under different climatological physiographical regimes this research further adds to the comparison of et estimation from multiple independent products with a demonstrative practical application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10163,agriculture is a major consumptive user of water through evapotranspiration et quantification of actual et eta is of significant interest to better address water management and improve decision making in the agricultural sector many methods to estimate et are available however due to the increasing need of validation of estimates of et from various techniques there arises a call for a critical comparison of eta estimated from a combination of methods this research presents a critical comparison of eta estimates obtained using ground based eddy covariance remotely sensed et ensemble and simulated data a crop soil water balance model simetaw the study focuses on experimental sites in nebraska oklahoma and california usa results show a relatively small and consistent variation between the three methods the results are relatively close giving a reasonable impression of the expected eta at a site including variability which is useful to address agricultural practices the estimates from remote sensing deviate from the other two methods since the method used is relatively new and requires further research to improve measurements and et estimation this study offers water managers at the sites new information for reliable multi source et estimation for water resources planning and the study is in principle replicable at different locations keywords actual

to efficient water use and irrigation management practices allen et al 2007 measuring et from crops under actual growing conditions i e actual evapotranspiration eta allen et al 1998 requires special instruments the need for better quality and reliable eta data is increasing being required for irrigation management scheduling and computing crop water requirements however measuring and estimating it accurately is difficult although there are many methods there is a lack of comparison and error assessment among their results there are various methods for estimating eta at different scales such as evaporation pans lysimeters eddy covariance ec remote sensing land surface models lsms surface water budget modelling and soil water balance methods wang et al 2015 among the methods on site measurements can be performed by ec stations installed in the field more than 500 stations are part of the global fluxnet fluxnet fluxdata org network which is a global networked community composed of regional networks such as ameriflux asiaflux and euroflux because of its direct measurement ec is considered to be among one of the most accurate methods available for gas flux measurement burba 2013 the high cost and time consuming nature of ec measurements make them unsuitable for routine measurements however allen et al 1998 and measurements are characteristic of a specific location and land cover type et from ec serves as an observed field dataset which can be used for comparing estimates with those from other products correction of flux measurements and estimation of et from ec have been reported in various studies twine et al 2000 uddin et al 2013 the use of empirical models in the agricultural sector is fundamental in estimation of crop water requirements and simulation of scenarios the simulation of evapotranspiration of applied water simetaw mancosu et al 2016 is a crop soil water balance model that estimates daily reference evapotranspiration eto crop evapotranspiration etc eta crop coefficients effective rainfall hypothetical irrigation schedules and crop water requirement for water resources planning models have larger areal estimation extent compared to ec stations however they are dependent on data from different sources such as climate models and thus any error in input data is reflected in results simetaw computes the evapotranspiration of applied water etaw and takes into account the impacts of climate change on it sustainable use of water for irrigation can be estimated by adjusting the simulated reference

mapping et anderson et al 2007a 2007b satellite based methods can be biased due to poor calibration and little no verification with ground data so data must be validated research needs to be conducted regarding whether eta from different approaches is significantly different from each other or in agreement and to help validate newer methods there have been studies on various methods for measuring eta uddin et al 2013 rana and katerji 2000 but to date the comparison between estimates from different methods is not sufficient and as such the differences between them are not fully ascertained while some combinations of methods are compared including field remote sensed and modeled data kite and droogers 2000a 2000b ha et al 2015 glenn et al 2011 wang et al 2015 many combinations of methods are not compared with each other this requires a critical comparison between the estimates of eta derived from different methods in situ simulation models remote sensing assessing how the methods are different from each other in terms of eta estimation as well as the applicability of methods in particular situations this research compares and analyzes eta estimates obtained from three methods at the same locations the methods are 1 ground based observations from ec stations 2 satellite based remotely sensed data from the et ensemble dataset hessels 2017 3 empirical simulation using simetaw mancosu et al 2016 the three methods have not been compared with each other at the same time and in the same place the study applies the methods to three sites in the usa with different crops in different growing seasons which give this research a perspective from varied physical and meteorological conditions comparison of estimates from such diverse methods contributes to assessment of the differences in the estimate of eta and as such offers more information for water resources planners 2 materials and methodology 2 1 methods this research estimates and compares eta obtained from the following methods 1 ground based eddy covariance stations fluxnet ameriflux this method provides in situ ground based observed data from ec stations baldocchi et al 2001 fluxnet fluxdata org ameriflux

coefficient between vertical wind speed fluctuation and humidity as averages of periods of 20 60 min at a frequency of about 10 hz shuttleworth 2008 the measurements are carried out in the surface boundary layer of atmosphere above vegetation and are most accurate in steady atmosphere homogeneous underlying vegetation and on flat terrain kumar et al 2017 data measured from ec stations is obtained from the ameriflux management project http ameriflux lbl gov apart from flux data other data such as soil type soil depth crop type growing season and irrigation system are collected from literature as well as from questionnaires sent to the principal investigators of each site the reliability of measured ec data is assessed by computing the energy balance closure ebc the climate data measured at ec stations are used in simetaw to estimate daily eto for the latent heat flux data from ec towers the energy balance corrected version of latent heat fluxes is obtained in w m 2 which are multiplied by 0 0864 to be converted into mj m 2 day 1 the fluxes in mj m 2 day 1 are multiplied by 0 408 to be converted into the equivalent eta in mm day 1 allen et al 1998 the energy flux sensible heat h and latent heat le site measurements available in the fluxnet database and used in this work are gap filled using the marginal distribution sampling mds method reichstein et al 2005 the data are downscaled to site level from era interim re analysis data where possible as described by vuichard and papale 2015 in this work a combination of these two products is used more details about fluxnet dataset and data processing are available in pastorello et al 2020 the processing of climate crop and soil data from the ec sites which are used as input to simetaw is discussed in the following section 2 1 2 simetaw simetaw mancosu et al 2016 is a crop soil water balance model that calculates daily eto crop evapotranspiration etc etaw crop coefficient kc effective rainfall and irrigation requirement for water resources planning and water allocation it simulates hypothetical irrigation schedules for use in irrigated agriculture management the etaw or irrigation requirement is the estimated volume of irrigation water needed to refill water losses from the soil root zone due to etc that is not replaced by other sources of water etaw is computed as the sum of the mean depth of applied water infiltrated into the low quarter during the crop growing season simetaw adjusts the estimated eto by including in the canopy resistance equation the changes of co2 concentration in the atmosphere adaptation strategies can be proposed for sustainable use of water in irrigation snyder et al 2012 mancosu et al 2016 crop information such as crop coefficients seasonal start and end dates are required by the model soil depth rooting depth and soil water holding capacity are also required in simetaw the crop coefficient of the midseason kc mid is adjusted as a function of local climate and computed as k c mid k c tab 0 261 et o 7 3 k c tab 1 where kc mid is the corrected midseason crop coefficient and kc tab is the tabular midseason crop coefficient it is possible to change default crop coefficients according to the area under investigation during the off season most of the evaporation is from bare soil for this a bare soil coefficient ke is used in the model the end points of the growth periods are defined as a percentage of the duration of the crop growing season snyder et al 2012 simetaw takes input of eto computed using hargreaves samani or penman monteith equations due to limitation of available data a simplified version of hargreaves samani samani 2000 temperature based equation was modified to account for solar radiation this is achieved by combining the original hargreaves samani equation with the equation for solar radiation r s kt r a td 0 5 where rs is solar radiation kt is empirical coefficient calculated from kt 0 00185 td 2 0 0433 td 0 4023 ra is extra terrestrial radiation mm day 1 and td is difference of maximum and minimum temperature c the modified equation for calculating eto is et o 0 0135 kt r a td 0 5 tc 17 8 where tc is average daily temperature c this equation accounts for solar radiation and temperature and reduces errors in estimation of solar radiation from temperature and in the estimation of eto this equation enables the estimation of eto using minimal climatological data 2 1 2 1 simetaw input data two types of climate data are used as input to simetaw i ec data and ii nldas data crop and soil data are used as input and collected through literature review and questionnaire filled by the principal investigators of the experimental sites from ec climate data i e precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature are obtained from ameriflux hourly and half hourly data were obtained and elaborated to get daily maximum and minimum hourly data were taken for nebraska whereas half hourly data were taken for california and oklahoma the daily maximum and minimum temperature are used in modified hargreaves samani equation samani 2000 haie et al 2018 to compute solar radiation and eto eto and precipitation along with soil and crop data i e soil depth rooting depth soil water holding capacity crop type irrigation system crop coefficients planting and harvesting dates and allowable depletion are used as input to obtain eta for the three sites when the planting and harvesting dates are input simetaw determines the growth stages the soil and crop data at the three sites used as input are shown in table 1 the nldas dataset contains standard meteorological data for north america it is based on observations and model output and is available from 1979 various time scales are available e g hourly daily and monthly the resolution of data is 0 125 and the grid spacing is 1 8th degree the data from 1979 comes under nldas 2 also called nldas 2 noah model https ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas the resolution is 12 km x 12 km here data from 2001 to 2014 are used at daily time scale a python script extracts the precipitation and temperature data for all growing seasons in the three sites the maximum and minimum temperature are used in modified hargreaves samani equation samani 2000 haie et al 2018 to compute solar radiation and eto the crop and soil data for running simetaw is the same as for ec input data see above with the only difference being the climate data source eto and precipitation along with crop and soil data from ec stations see above are used as input to obtain eta estimates 2 1 3 et ensemble for the remote sensed data an ensemble product of et measurements called et ensemble is used which is a combination of seven different products hofste 2014 suggests that using an ensemble or merged et product gives better results as compared to a single remote sensing et product et ensemble is developed for latitudes 40 to 40 hessels 2017 the first version et ensemble v1 0 was generated as continuous monthly data spanning the period from january 2003 to december 2014 the resolution is 250 m x 250 m pixel size 0 0025 the products in et ensemble include mod16 mu et al 2011 alexi anderson et al 2007a 2007b global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam miralles et al 2011 surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 simplified surface energy balance model for operational applications ssebop senay et al 2013 cmrset guerschman et al 2009 and etmonitor hu and jia 2015 downscaling is carried out for gleam sebs alexi mod16 and cmrset hessels 2017 when all the et products match pixel size the standard deviation of the ensemble is calculated it is possible to apply an outlier method for each pixel and the coefficient of variation cv is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean of the et estimates of all the products outliers are removed and the et average and standard deviation of the pixels are re calculated until there are no further outliers two types of data are obtained for estimating eta from et ensemble in single pixel data the pixel coinciding with the exact location of the ec stations was selected in data using an average of nine pixels an average of the study site pixel and the eight surrounding pixels is taken the average of nine pixels is taken to account for variation and thus validation of the single pixel data 2 2 data for the three above mentioned methods there are three sources of data 1 ameriflux ec station data for measured flux and simetaw simulations 2 nldas data for simetaw simulations 3 et ensemble data for remote sensed estimations from these sources of data four types of information are obtained 1 measured le from ameriflux ec stations 2 climate soil and crop information from ameriflux ec stations literature and questionnaire inputs for simetaw 3 climate information from nldas soil and crop information from ec stations literature and questionnaires inputs for simetaw 4 et ensemble data based on the types of data and sources described above this study yields five independent results 1 et a 1 ec flux this is the measured le obtained from flux data from ameriflux ec stations 2 et a 2a simetaw using ameriflux this is the eta obtained by running simetaw where climate crop and soil data from ameriflux ec stations literature and questionnaires were used as input 3 et a 2b simetaw using nldas this is the eta obtained by running simetaw where climate data from nldas along with crop and soil data from ameriflux ec stations literature and questionnaires were used as input 4 et a 3a et ensemble 1 pixel this is the eta obtained from et ensemble data by single pixel 5 et a 3b et ensemble 9 pixels averaged this is the eta obtained from et ensemble data by taking average of nine pixels the above stated methods sources of data and results are summarized in the conceptual framework for methodology of the research fig 1 2 2 1 energy balance closure for flux data for assessing the quality of flux data obtained from ec stations energy balance closure wilson et al 2002 culf et al 2004 stoy et al 2013 is evaluated by statistical regression of turbulent energy fluxes sensible heat and latent heat against available energy net radiation and soil heat flux the energy balance closure is also evaluated by solving for the energy balance ratio ebr gu et al 1999 wilson et al 2002 or the relative energy balance closure aubinet et al 1999 which is the ratio of turbulent energy fluxes to available energy i e ebr Œªet h rn g 2 2 2 triple collocation method for comparison of results dual comparisons are often made for calibration of results however implicit assumptions limit the accuracy of such comparisons between two datasets with one dataset being taken as reference here results are compared using the triple collocation method stoffelen 1998 this method has been widely used to characterize errors in remote sensed in situ and modeled data for global soil moisture products and is used to compare three datasets with an independent error structure while not requiring the availability of a high quality reference dataset mccoll et al 2014 as is the case in this research this method quantifies the random error variances for large datasets when the accurate dataset or the truth is not known errors of a dataset exist from residual and random errors systematic errors of a dataset can be correcting using a bias but random errors make the dataset less reliable the triple collocation method separates the total error into random and systematic error components an advantage of triple collocation is that it limits the effect of systematic and random errors of two sets of data on the third dataset scipal et al 2013 the main assumption is that the three datasets are independent from each other which means that the input sources must be from different measurement systems and not linked to each other because of this the usage of this method becomes limiting vogelzang and stoffelen 2012 errors are calibrated by neutral regression which is performed to minimize the systematic errors of a dataset and reach convergence after successive iterations according to scipal and dorigo 2010 each dataset differs from the hypothetical truth by a residual error the variance of these residuals after removing the bias is calculated to quantify the quality of each dataset the higher the random error of a dataset the lower the quality this research fulfills the conditions for application of this method gruber et al 2016 the following combinations of datasets are considered for comparison using triple collocation comparison1 et a 1vs et a 2bvs et a 3a comparison2 et a 1vs et a 2bvs et a 3b comparison3 et a 1vs et a 2avs et a 3a

carried out in three experimental sites table 2 selected from the ameriflux management project of the fluxnet network they are located in nebraska oklahoma and california in the usa an ec tower is installed at each site and all these sites have the requisite data available for full comparison of the three measurement methods at each site a different crop is grown in different growing seasons in different types of soil and using different irrigation systems apart from the literature consulted for some data a questionnaire was circulated among the principal investigators of the ec sites to collect further information 3 results 3 1 eta estimates the eta results are obtained for the complete duration of the growing seasons for all three sites table 2 as the et ensemble data are estimated at monthly scale the daily data obtained from other methods are aggregated to obtain monthly eta so that all results are comparable only months of the growing seasons which consist of more than 15 days are included in the comparison and plotted 3 1 1 nebraska the results for maize growing seasons 2001 2002 and 2003 are shown in fig 2 the et ensemble data is only available for the 2003 growing season in 2001 eta 2a and eta 2b are underestimated compared to eta 1 and are closely related to each other the estimates of eta 1 are higher particularly towards the middle of the growing season fig 2a in 2002 eta 2a and eta 2b values are very close until the end of the last stage of the growing season when eta 2a values slightly increase fig 2b the same trend is shown in 2003 where the difference between eta 2a and eta 2b in the late season is higher the difference estimated in 2002 fig 2c the difference increases towards the end of the growing season eta 1 estimates are higher initially and lower later in comparison to eta 2a and eta 2b eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble are almost the same although simetaw uses two different input datasets the trend of eta 2a and eta 2b is similar the mid to late season underestimation by simetaw is reported also by mancosu et al 2016 at a peach site in california for years 2002 2003 and 2004 eta 1 shows the highest values of eta eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble are lower than other estimates the difference between eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble is negligible the energy balance closure is acceptable mean r2 0 95 the correlation between turbulent fluxes and available energy which is indicated by the ebr is close to unity mean ebr 0 99 indicating that the turbulent fluxes and the available energy are almost equal to each other 3 1 2 oklahoma the results for wheat growing seasons 2003 04 2005 06 2008 09 2009 10 and 2011 12 are shown in fig 3 in the 2003 04 growing season all eta estimates are close to each other except eta 3a and eta 3b fig 3a the difference between eta 3a and eta 3b is negligible eta 2a is higher than eta 2b in the 2003 04 growing season around the middle of the 2005 06 growing season eta 2b is higher than eta 2a because of higher rainfall measurements by nldas fig 3b eta 1 is lower than eta 2a and eta 2b in the 2008 09 growing season eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble are the lowest fig 3c similar overall trends are observed in 2009 10 and 2011 12 growing seasons figs 3d and 3e eta 1 shows slight underestimation in the early season and overestimation in the late season as compared to eta 2a and eta 2b a similar trend was observed for a rain fed wheat crop cultivated in california mancosu et al 2016 in which the difference between observed and modeled estimates was because of water stress eta 2a and eta 2b show the highest estimates of eta eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble are lower than all estimates the difference between the two is negligible the energy balance closure is acceptable mean r2 0 91 the ebr is acceptable and close to unity 3 1 3 california the results for rice growing seasons 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2014 are shown in fig 4 in the 2009 growing season eta 3a and eta 3b are very low compared to estimates from other methods fig 4a in 2010 eta 2a is higher than eta 2b fig 4b in 2011 mid season eta 1 is higher than eta 2a and eta 2b and it means that simetaw is underestimating in this case fig 4c this trend was observed in a peach crop site for the growing seasons of 2002 2003 and 2004 in california mancosu et al 2016 similar overall trends are observed in 2012 and 2014 growing seasons fig 4d and e the energy balance closure is acceptable mean r2 0 83 and the energy balance ratio is close to unity 3 2 standard deviation using triple collocation as the estimates from et ensemble i e eta 3a 1 pixel and eta 3b 9 pixels average are very similar only eta 3a is plotted in section 3 2 3 2 1 standard deviation of eta in nebraska for nebraska the data from et ensemble is unavailable thus only comparison 7 is possible fig 5 both the modeled results eta 2a and eta 2b have a low standard deviation i e error from the hypothetical truth and are close to each other whereas error from eta 1 is relatively high this implies that the climate data used for simetaw from ameriflux and nldas are in close agreement and support the respective eta estimates greater error in eta 1 does not necessarily imply that it is inaccurate rather it differs more from the hypothetical truth than the other results the error increases with successive growing seasons 3 2 2 standard deviation of eta in oklahoma in comparison 1 the error in eta 1 is low whereas the error in eta 3a is comparatively high error in eta 2b fluctuates fig 6 similarly in comparison 3 error in eta 2a fluctuates however eta 1 and eta 3a show more agreement with lower error indicating that estimates from ec and et ensemble are closer to the hypothetical truth in comparison 5 eta 2a and eta 2b show reasonable agreement indicating that the model gives similar results using different datasets eta 3a shows higher error and deviates more from the hypothetical truth in comparison 7 results show moderate error with eta 2a and eta 2b showing some agreement eta 1 shows slightly higher error overall modeled results show considerable fluctuation eta 1 gives consistent results mostly and the error is in almost the same range in various comparisons 3 2 3 standard deviation of eta in california in comparison 1 eta 3a generally shows the least error which could be due to the high resolution et ensemble data whereas eta 1 shows a stable error fig 7 eta 2b shows increasing error in comparison 3 eta 1 and eta 3a show good agreement along with lower error meaning that both of these are closer to the hypothetical truth whereas eta 2a shows higher and increasing error similar to the pattern of eta 2b in comparison 1 in comparison 5 eta 2a and eta 2b show close agreement with eta 3a though with fluctuating error in comparison 7 eta 1 and eta 2a show good correspondence in error with eta 2b showing lower error 3 3 summary of results in nebraska eta 1 from flux data is higher than eta 2a and eta 2b in particular in the mid season eta 3a and eta 3b from et ensemble are very close to each other the et ensemble exhibits the lowest eta estimates similarly in oklahoma eta 3a and eta 3b show the least variation possibly owing to the high resolution in california eta 1 from flux data shows slight overestimation during the mid season the estimates and the standard deviation in the three methods are summarized below 3 3 1 eta from eddy covariance the eta estimates from ec eta 1 show very good correlation with r2 in the range 0 88 0 99 for the evaluation of energy balance closure from this it can be inferred that the measurements of turbulent fluxes and available energy have very high closure and that the data from ec stations under ameriflux are of good quality considering the energy balance ratio it is concluded that the turbulent fluxes and available energy are very much in balance with a ratio ranging from 0 99 to 1 00 in comparison to the modeled eta estimates the estimates from ec show some overestimation 3 3 2 eta from simetaw the eta estimates from simetaw eta 2a and eta 2b are slightly overestimated in the start of growing season and slightly underestimated in mid or mid to late season with respect to the other methods a similar trend is reported by mancosu et al 2016 this can be related to the model midseason crop coefficient eta 2a is slightly higher than eta 2b overall the trend between both simulated estimates eta 2a and eta 2b does not show significant deviation the difference between estimates from ec eta 1 and simetaw eta 2a and eta 2b is slightly higher in california and in nebraska the trends of estimates from both these methods correspond towards the end of growing seasons in california indicating that there is some agreement this can be seen in nebraska where the simulated eta 2a and eta 2b and observed eta 1 eta correspond in the start and end of the growing season whereas the middle of growing season differs and can be attributed to the corrected mid season crop coefficient in simetaw the rice crop in california shows a trend similar to that of the wheat crop in california in late season mancosu et al 2016 eta 1 has a trend similar to that of eta 2a and eta 2b for the winter wheat crop in oklahoma however the differences between them can arise because of measurement errors due to rainfall the difference between the results from simetaw and other methods can be related to the crop soil climate input data the adjusted crop coefficients the agricultural practices and the equation used for estimating eto and used for calculating eta in the model 3 3 3 eta from et ensemble estimates from et ensemble eta 3a and eta 3b are lower in all growing seasons in the three sites in comparison to the other methods to check whether the estimates from a single pixel eta 3a are acceptable or not the estimates from average of nine pixels eta 3b show that they are close to each other which demonstrates that the chosen pixel is consistent with the surrounding 8 pixels and is representative of them this can be seen in comparison of all eta 3a estimates with eta 3b estimates a possible reason for the lower values during the growing seasons can be the use of the land surface temperature from global weather models that many of the et products use as input over irrigated areas those products tends to give elevated land surface temperature values the weather models do not include irrigation and therefor a higher soil moisture content is not taken into account in irrigated areas which will result in less cooling more sensible heat flux and less evapotranspiration 3 3 4 eta in comparison the estimates from simetaw eta 2a and eta 2b and et ensemble eta 3a and eta 3b are lower in most of the growing seasons in the three sites as compared with the estimates from ec eta 1 the ec data can be considered accurate because of the direct field measurements although the spatial extent of the measurements is very limited for considering a greater areal extent for eta estimates ec method is not suitable unless data from multiple stations is obtained ec does show a good correlation r2 and energy balance ratio for energy balance closure but the estimates depend on periodic maintenance and calibration of the instruments simetaw shows variation in its estimates from overestimating in early season to underestimating in mid to late season and vice versa in nebraska the model shows good correspondence with ec though with fluctuation in estimates simetaw overestimates results using ameriflux data eta 2a in comparison to using nldas data eta 2b but underestimates generally in comparison to ec eta 1 and overestimates in comparison to et ensemble eta 3a and eta 3b although simetaw is data intensive it offers many scenario options including climate change water deficit and water allocation et ensemble takes advantage in utilizing high resolution data usage of combination of multiple datasets and a wide range of spatial and temporal scales estimates from et ensemble eta 3a show low standard deviation both estimates from simetaw eta 2a and eta 2b show moderate standard deviation which is in close agreement and mostly lower than the third estimate in any comparison estimates from ec eta 1 show least standard deviation when compared with modeled estimates eta 2a and eta 2b and et ensemble estimates eta 3a in a single comparison and show relatively high standard deviation when compared with both modeled estimates eta 2a and eta 2b the higher standard deviation in estimates from ec eta 1 as compared to modelled results eta 2a and eta 2b does not imply that estimates from ec are inaccurate as the standard deviation of datasets from triple collocation is independent of the accuracies of the datasets a dataset can have a high standard deviation by taking the total errors into account but this can be the result of a high systematic error the standard deviation of the random errors tells more about the inaccuracy of the dataset which is shown by the triple collocation method 4 discussion increasing demand for water from different sectors can threaten long term sustainability of water supply in arid regions such as the south western united states particularly california where a model california simetaw was developed for coping with unsustainable irrigation practices orang et al 2013 with the water deficit and increasing demand there is pressure for better water resources management irrigated agriculture is one of the major water users and therefore it is important to accurately estimate agricultural water consumption although several methods have been compared for estimating eta there still remains a gap in comparing certain methods and assessing the relative differences between their estimates data availability and requirements for each method can affect the applicability of the three methods can limit the performance of the methods and affect their results for the flux data the ec station sites could not be chosen for any terrain other than cropland since simetaw is applicable only on cropland the widely accepted ec method provides eta estimates based on field data from direct atmospheric measurements the estimates are accurate but only at the measurement location limiting their wider spatial applicability ec estimates can vary due to poor calibration of instruments lack of proper maintenance and supervision the flux data used in this research was already gap filled and corrections were applied by fluxnet for the ec estimates of eta the correlation between the turbulent fluxes and the available energy for all the flux data is acceptable with an r2 value up to 0 96 in the case of nebraska the energy balance ratio for the flux data is close to unity which indicates a good energy balance closure the high level of energy balance closure is attributed to application of the bowen ratio correction by the fluxnet2015 data processing system the equation used for estimating eto adjusting the crop coefficient as well as the input data regarding climate soil crops and irrigation system can have a combined effect on performance of simetaw estimation from simetaw is dependent on inputs of agricultural practices and irrigation systems management although the model has the ability to consider all these factors input data is another factor that can affect the results for using the model to estimate eta details about crop seasonal start and end dates rooting depth soil depth allowable depletion irrigation type and soil water holding capacity are required this makes the model data intensive opens up areas for error propagation and limits the possibility of its application in this study the simulated eta from simetaw is dependent on a simplified version of the original hargreaves samani eto equation samani 2000 the original equation was modified by introducing an equation to estimate solar radiation samani 2000 the simulated results using this modified equation in simetaw have shown acceptable eta estimates obtained with minimal climatological data and an improved estimate of solar radiation from temperature other equations for estimating eto can be used instead of the modified hargreaves samani eto equation when data are available as was done in the estimation of eta in canada martel et al 2018 the hargreaves samani equation does not account for variations in wind speed and humidity in windier and humid locations hargreaves samani equation will underestimate eto the equation performs well for estimation in california since it is neither windy nor humid there is a good correlation between results from simetaw using nldas and ameriflux data although both have entirely different spatial and temporal scales hence the model performs well with different input datasets due to a combination of seven products used within the et ensemble dataset it is possible to underestimate eta due to one or more remote sensing model underestimations a general comment regarding the underestimation of et ensemble products is avoided here since it is a recently developed dataset in this case however the underestimation in comparison to observed data is possibly due to absence of irrigation or precipitation data that could influence the results the eta estimates from et ensemble are underestimated in all sites compared to the estimates from ec and simetaw any conclusions made about the performance of these methods should be considered in the context of the sites included in this research for applying any one of the methods in a different situation care should be taken to choose suitable methods for estimating eta as none of them is claimed to be more accurate or reliable than another researchers should utilize their preferred methods based on research needs such as time and spatial scale data resolution availability of data from eddy covariance stations availability of crop climate and soil input data and information necessary to run the model the possibility to meet the required conditions for applying the triple collocation methods and the methods performance as is described in this research these comparisons can serve as a reference for water managers dealing with irrigated agriculture to better assess the consumptive use of water with the results from the methods giving a reasonable range for real eta values the trend of estimates from these methods can help determine consumptive water use although there is some variation the results are relatively similar giving a reasonable impression of expected eta at a site including variability which offers useful information for water resources planning in addition simetaw can support policy making by suggesting water demand requirements possible irrigation schedules and computation of etaw this can trigger decision making and implementation among the water managing authorities for proper water allocation this is especially pertinent in areas having irrigated agriculture with water deficit such as california the research offers a stepping stone for estimation and comparison of eta using a variety of methods 5 conclusion this research aimed at estimation and comparison of actual evapotranspiration using 1 eddy covariance 2 simetaw 3 et ensemble the work provides a comparison using triple collocation regarding how the different methods perform against each other for regions with irrigated agriculture with a water deficit it is important to know the consumptive use thus the estimation of eta from these methods provides a comprehensive view of the results in different climatological conditions with different crops at different sites the data collected from ameriflux ec stations nldas and et ensemble are used to estimate eta for various growing seasons in the three sites in the usa nebraska oklahoma and california while the methods showed some variability in the results this variation is relatively small and much of the variation is consistent between the three methods for example results from et ensemble consistently underestimated eta with respect to the other two methods simetaw was forced with different climate input data to generate two sets of independent outputs however these are in very close agreement suggesting that the model performs similarly with different input datasets the results presented here offer information on consumptive water demand at the three study sites with crops with the variation in results giving a reasonable range of likely actual water consumption such information derived from three independent sources provides more certain estimates to water resources planners on which to make water allocation and supply decisions both in terms of volume and timing through growing seasons and for different crops under different climatological physiographical regimes this research further adds to the comparison of et estimation from multiple independent products with a demonstrative practical application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10164,the persistent monitoring of evapotranspiration et over the regions suffering from water scarcity is critical for sustainable agricultural water management remote sensing provides time and cost effective capability to investigate daily et rates at large scales satellite based actual evapotranspiration eta algorithms typically rely on specifying the upper and lower boundaries of eta rate over agricultural and pasture fields commonly known as hot dry and cold wet pixels selection these boundaries are to be recognized by an expert through a subjective and labor intensive task in this study a method has been introduced to automatically select appropriate anchor pixels i e hot and cold pixels independent from land use cover maps with the simplest possible way quickly applied even by an inexperienced operator subsequently eta was calculated using mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and surface energy balance system sebs algorithms and evaluated against measured data in this method the mountains and foothills were removed using the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem and the subsequent product was a slope mask then filters were applied based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi albedo and land surface temperature lst images to identify potential candidate pixels for hot and cold pixels in the end the best conditioned pixel being closest to the meteorological station was selected the method was assessed in five different regions with different topographic and climatic conditions the selected pixels were first visually validated in landsat images and then the fluctuations and values were discussed in time series of anchor pixels and lst histograms the visual interpretation was indicative of selecting the anchor pixels in fallow hot pixel and densely vegetated cold pixel surfaces also the hot and cold pixels were suitably situated in the upper and lower quartiles of the lst histogram respectively the range of cold pixels variations throughout the study periods was lower compared with the hot pixels 44 2 55 3 35 5 66 5 and 25 2 k for hot pixels against 34 2 45 7 25 6 52 2 and 17 k for cold pixels as expected which emanated from the lower fluctuations of temperature over vegetation against the soil the results were indicative of the better performance of metric compared with sebal and sebs with greater values of r2 in all the regions therefore using the introduced method the expert subjective interference was eliminated and processing time reduced significantly from about 1 h per image to a few minutes keywords automated hot and cold pixels digital elevation model land surface temperature metric sebal sebs 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the most prominent factor for agricultural water management and one of the water balance equation s key components therefore remote sensing helped researchers expedite the et calculation process instead of measuring it using costly instrumentations such as eddy covariance ec bowen ratio br and lysimeters previous studies have shown that satellite based actual et eta can be used in farm water management and irrigation scheduling mokhtari et al 2018 biomass mapping lobell et al 2003 water stress detection bhattarai et al 2017a b soil moisture calculation dhungel et al 2016 and drought studies eden 2012 satellite based eta algorithms require the operator s interference therefore manually calculating eta would be problematic in hydrological long term water balance monitoring using satellite images bartholie et al 1972 pioneered the remote sensing based eta estimation using a surface energy balance seb model while bastiaanssen et al 1998 presented the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and further developed the one source eta estimation algorithms they took into account an iterative based method for solving the sensible heat flux h equation h calculation required distinguishing upper and lower boundaries for eta rate known as anchor pixels i e hot dry and cold wet pixels selection su 2002 developed the surface energy balance system sebs model for satellite based eta calculation which was also a one source model inducing the canopy cover cc impact on the eta rate h was defined for each pixel based on dry and wet limits of land surface temperature lst at a given cc however it was still in need of a manual selection of hot and cold pixels allen et al 2007a notably refined the sebal algorithm and developed the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric yet the algorithm was dependent on hot and cold pixels selection several algorithms were also developed in the recent two decades including simple surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 simplified surface energy balance for operational applications ssebop senay et al 2013 lst vi triangle jiang and islam 1999 sebal advection sebal a mkhwanazi et al 2015 and modified sebal m sebal almhab and busu 2008 several studies have reported that metric sebal and sebs algorithms outperformed other methods wagle et al 2017 bhattarai et al 2017b 2019a elkatoury et al 2020 for more details on eta algorithms it is recommended to read the review written by chen and liu 2020 satellite based eta algorithms are sensitive to anchor pixel selection feng 2015 however proper identification of hot and cold pixels requires an expert s skill it would inevitably be time consuming and erroneous even under specialist supervision especially in the case of multiple satellite images since manually selecting the anchor pixels induces errors on algorithms such as sebal metric and sebs long and singh 2012 researchers have been making an effort to identify the anchor pixels automatically allen et al 2013 was among the first to introduce an automatic anchor pixel selection method although their methodology was simple with reliable accuracy the final hot and cold pixel was selected visually from candidate pixels olmedo et al 2017 introduced the water package under the calcanchor function which automatically selected the anchor pixels they considered 5 of the upper and lower ranges of the lst images for the hot and cold pixels respectively also they masked the images based on albedo 0 18 0 25 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi 0 76 1 leaf area index lai 3 6 and surface roughness length for momentum zom 0 03 0 08 in order to find the hot pixel and they respectively set these parameters 0 13 0 15 0 1 0 28 and lower than 0 005 for the cold pixel selection the problem with this method is the uncertainties in the lai and zom calculation because they are empirically calculated and require ground measured data for calibration bhattarai et al 2017a used an exhaustive search algorithm to identify anchor pixels their algorithm was in critical need of land cover maps to separate the agricultural fields from other land uses silva et al 2019 generated classification maps over the study area using landsat 7 and 8 with a supervised algorithm and used the classified image to identify the vegetated and soil surfaces jaafar and ahmad 2020 also took the water package into account but considered the proximity of hot and cold pixels to the meteorological station and defined a value for elevation representative of the bekaa valley which they calculated eta for they assumed that the whole valley consists of short crops crop height 1 m therefore their assumption was problematic in the case of trees so they recommended using a land cover map existing land use cover maps are not accurate enough and are mostly provided in coarse resolutions also creating a high spatial resolution classification map for an extended period can be time consuming a few automated applications such as earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux allen et al 2015 and simple operational surface energy balance ssebop have been developed on google earth engine for automated calculation of eta however one cannot choose between algorithms and input arbitrary meteorological data obtained from local stations therefore the need for automating the hot and cold pixels is necessary for choosing an algorithm freely simplicity is the key to a robust methodology because a simple yet accurate method can be of more generous help for an amateur user than a complicated approach therefore the objective of this study was to present a simple method for automating the anchor pixels selection for eta algorithms including sebal metric and sebs using the minimum pre prepared data such as land use cover maps the method was based on land topography ndvi albedo and lst masks we finally evaluated the sebal metric and sebs algorithms in five regions with different topographic and climatic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas in this study we evaluated our method in five different regions with differences in weather and topographic conditions 1 nebraska agricultural research and development center in nebraska u s us ne 1 3 2 lawrence berkeley national

forest canopy cover between 10 and 30 fig 1 the juniper savanna site is located in the southwestern tablelands in central new mexico on a private ranch its vegetation is composed of juniperus monosperma and intermittently grazed c4 perennial grasses of which the dominant species is bouteloua gracilis the 30 min data were downloaded from ameriflux and were used for model evaluation 2 1 5 mirranatwa catchment mirranatwa catchment is 230 km west of melbourne victoria australia fig 2 the area is vastly used for sheep grazing with uniform pasture cover the area is surrounded to the east and west by sandstone ridges of the grampians ranges and lies within an area of granite hills an ec tower was installed at 37 39 degrees south and 142 39 degrees east with 30 min eta data 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 remotely sensed data the landsat satellite images have been being used for water resources management studies for several years due to the ability to capture images in the multispectral and thermal portions of the spectrum anderson et al 2012 bhattarai et al 2015 2017b therefore we used cloudless images of landsat 5 7 and 8 in the studied areas the landsat series used in each area depended on the measured ec flux towers time period the level 2 data were preprocessed cloud and water bodies were masked and clipped in google earth engine also scan line corrector slc failure for landsat 7 had no data pixels in the images which were ignored in the calculations in this study we took advantage of the 30 meter srtm dem for creating the elevation and slope masks and it was also used in the sebal and metric algorithms dem images were also downloaded from google earth engine 2 2 2 climatic conditions the meteorological data used in this study consisted of air temperature wind speed solar radiation relative humidity and sunshine hours the statistical details on the long term meteorological data of us ne us arm us kl us wjs and mirranatwa were laid out in table 1 in the us national centers for environmental information ncei data from noaa database https www ncdc noaa gov and in australia the mirranatwa station were used us ne climate is humid continental humid with severe winter no dry season hot summer us arm is humid subtropical mild with no dry season hot summer us kl is humid us wjs is steppe warm winter and mirranatwa is humid warm winter and mild summer with low range of temperature throughout a year fig 3 shows the climatic conditions of each region as a time series of long term daily average et0 et0 from fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 is a function of air temperature wind speed and relative humidity which can be a reliable factor to indicate the climatic condition of a region et0 is the power of the atmosphere for evapotranspiration therefore in this case us wjs us arm us ne and us kl had respectively greater evapotranspiration strengths being in the southern hemisphere mirranatwa catchment s et0 variations was reversed compared to the us datasets and its range was almost the same as us ne 2 2 3 evapotranspiration data 2 2 3 1 field measured data 2 2 3 1 1 us ne there were 3 ec tower sites namely us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 fig

in the mirranatwa catchment fig 3 13 data from march 2012 until march 2013 were used although there was an overlap in landsat 7 satellite images in the area we lost many images due to several cloudy days 2 2 3 2 remotely sensed products the use of remotely sensed data assimilation products has proven to be of reliable accuracy khan et al 2018 2020 and always been beneficial for double validation of a model bhattarai et al 2019b 2 2 3 2 1 gldas global land data assimilation system gldas uses a land surface model which is the means of simulating interactions between the land surface and atmosphere rodell et al 2004 the gldas noah product with the spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 degrees and a temporal resolution of 3 h was used in this study to investigate the eta variations over the study areas 2 2 3 2 2 gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam is a set of algorithms that estimates the components of land evaporation or evapotranspiration miralles et al 2011 the 2018 product was available globally with the spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 degrees and daily temporal resolution once eta using the landsat imagery was calculated the spatial resolution was changed using the areal average to match the gldas and gleam products in order to check the validity of the model 2 3 the metric sebal and sebs algorithms implementation eta in metric sebal and sebs was obtained based on the residual component of the energy balance equation 1 le r n g h where le is the latent heat flux w m2 also known as the energy consumed for eta rn is the net radiation w m2 g is the soil heat flux w m2 and h is the sensible heat flux w m2 there were three major steps in solving the eq 1 1 rn calculation 2 g calculation based on rn values and 3 h calculation using an iterative approach which was the challenging part of the satellite based eta calculation procedure containing the anchor pixel selection rn was the result of incoming radiations minus outgoing radiations bastiaanssen

which was calculated based on bastiaanssen 1995 wang et al 2014 10 z om exp 5 3 ndvi 5 2 h was obtained through an iterative process in which rah and u were sustained using the monin obukhov similarity brutsaert 1999 businger et al 1971 the process was conducted based on the anchor pixels hot and cold pixels selection in the algorithms it was considered that the h value in the cold pixel was 0 and eta was at its maximum which means that le rn g densely vegetated surface and on the contrary in the hot pixel eta rate was 0 dry soil without vegetation cover the primary values of dt for the hot and cold pixels were calculated and by achieving the a and b coefficients the below equation was solved for the whole image 11 dt a b lst this equation is indicative of a linear relationship between lst and dt which is a significant assumption in these algorithms allen 2011 bastiaanssen 1995 consequently the dt image was used under the uncorrected conditions of the atmosphere for h calculation the values of the stability corrections for momentum and heat transport are zero œàm œàh 0 the stability condition of the atmosphere was defined by the monin obukhov length parameter l as formulated below 12 l œÅ a c p u 3 lst kgh where g is the gravitational constant m s2 according to the value of l l 0 unstable l 0 neutral and l 0 stable the stability correction factors œàm and œàh were calculated based on paulson 1970 and webb 1970 the stability factors in eqs 8 and 9 were used to update the rah and u images in each iteration and subsequently dt was updated with different values of a and b the parameters including l h rah u dt a and b were being refined until we reached the constant values of h allen et al 2007b allen 2011 bastiaanssen 2000 h iteration in the sebs

mentioned in the sebal algorithm also the whole process has been drawn up as a flowchart fig 4 2 4 automation of hot and cold pixels the automation was performed without the need for land use cover maps the methodology was based on avoiding complicated calculations and has been simplified as much as possible it was tested in three different regions with fairly different climatic conditions the methodology was categorized into three major steps 1 the use of the elevation and slope masks in order to remove the unwanted pixels superimposed over mountainous and some urban areas 2 defining boundaries according to the characteristics of the hot and cold pixels for lst albedo and ndvi images in order to obtain the candidates for the anchor pixels and 3 defining a filter for the candidate pixels based on their distance to the meteorological station to increase the chance of selecting a pixel over an agricultural field therefore first the pixels containing shadow cloud and water were identified using the predefined quality band of the level 2 landsat images and eventually excluded in order to remove the high and low altitude areas a dem mask was created fig 5 two hundred pixels surrounding the meteorological station were chosen and the range between the minimum and maximum values of the dem dem200 was selected as the appropriate pixels because stations are usually in a flat area in order to remove the steep areas a slope mask was created using the dem images first two hundred pixels from the slope image around the station were chosen and then assuming that the values were normally distributed near to 1 of the pixels were removed the procedure for eliminating 1 of the pixels was as follows instead of using the minimum and maximum values which may contain outliers the range between three times of the standard deviation std greater and lesser than the average of the slope200 99 of the data were selected the number 200 is optional which was reduced in the mirranatwa catchment due to proximity to the ridges 2 4 1 cold pixel considering that cold pixels are those with the optimum evapotranspiration conditions which was well irrigated the ndvi values were close to the maximum also the values of albedo and lst were close to the minimum therefore for the first step a mask was made using the ndvi image ndvi max ndvi 0 2 which considering this threshold the method will automatically select a pixel over agricultural areas al zayed and elagib 2017 albedo is the lowest around 0 1 over vegetated surfaces wang et al 2017 therefore the other mask was built based on the albedo values albedo min albedo 0 1 consequently the vegetated areas were selected through these filters in order to remove the unwanted pixels in the lst image the ndvi and albedo masks were multiplied by lst to identify the primary candidate pixels for cold 1st lst cold candidates lst is the most crucial factor for the water stress condition of the crops and the lesser the lst value the lesser the water stress would be hence the next step was creating the second round of candidates 2nd lst cold candidates by choosing the pixels lower than the average between the areal average and minimum value of 1st lst cold candidates this step was necessary to ascertain that the selected pixels fall into the lst histogram s lower quartile hence the resulting cold pixel candidates were distributed across the entire image including farms urban green spaces pastures and orchards since weather stations are preferably chosen in areas with simple topography far from urban areas world meteorological organization 1993 the closest pixel among the 2nd lst cold candidates to the meteorological station was selected as the cold pixel for further calculations this step was essential to increase the probability of selecting the anchor pixels with the optimum temperature wind and humidity conditions the flowchart fig 7 illustrates the steps in the cold pixel selection procedure 2 4 2 hot pixel hot pixels must fall into fallow fields with the lowest amount of soil moisture content therefore the ndvi value should be greater than 0 but lower than the value representing the vegetated areas usually ndvi 0 25 is considered a non vegetated surface al zayed and elagib 2017 the ndvi value being close to 0 usually lower than 0 05 is likely to indicate urban or stony pixels deng and wu 2012 accordingly we excluded this range of values for hot pixel selection on the other hand the albedo for fallow fields was relatively high however based on our experience and the results presented in fujimaki et al 2003 nonsaline soils had albedo of maximum 0 3 and salty soils possessed the maximum values in an image usually albedo 0 3 therefore the mid range values of albedo were the best choice for hot pixel selection also lst should be among the high values in the upper quartile the primary candidates for hot pixel selection 1st lst hot candidates were chosen based on 0 08 ndvi 0 25 and then 0 15 albedo 0 3 and consequently the resulted mask was multiplied by the lst image in order to obtain the 2nd lst hot candidates we chose the pixels with greater values than the value of the average between the spatial average and maximum values of the first mask 1st lst hot candidates there was a small possibility that the resulting pixels may fall into the urban and stony areas which had not been removed through the previous filtrations therefore we calculated the distance of each pixel from the meteorological station and then the closest one was chosen for the final selection the flowchart drawn up in fig 8 comprehensively illustrates the steps a significant time for satellite based eta calculation is always wasted in selecting the hot and cold pixels manually using this method the time was reduced from an hour per each image to a few minutes matlab was used for this purpose 3 results and discussion 3 1 field and topographic conditions in order to better analyze the location of the hot and cold pixels we classified the images of us ne us arm us kl us wjs and mirranatwa where the vegetation cover was fig 8 the classification images were not used in the methodology and were to identify the predominant groundcover in the regions the classes were categorized into vegetation urban and unused areas grasslands vegetated surface on a slope and water bodies the classification method was the maximum likelihood a subset of the supervised classification approach in us ne us arm us kl and mirranatwa the agricultural fields and pastures were distributed across the region however in us wjs only about one third of the region was covered in farms us kl had denser vegetation areas compared with us ne and us arm the mirranatwa catchment was mostly covered by pastures and agricultural fields with a small region consisting of mountainous areas due to steep and hillshades the grassland areas were covered with shadows that were not removed by using the quality band and became problematic in the cold pixel selection procedure the substantial difference between the percentages of regions vegetation surfaces emanated from their topography fig 9 the topographic spatial variations in us wjs were different from those of us ne us arm us kl and mirranatwa in wjs the agricultural fields are sparse and the northwestern vegetative area fig 8 is forest over mountains with higher altitude fig 9 with high values of lst and low values of ndvi the mountainous areas were making problems in the hot pixel selection procedure so they were quickly removed using the dem and slope masks not all regions of the world have access to pre prepared classification maps in order to separate the agricultural fields also classifying each image with high accuracy is time consuming and requires access to high spatial resolution images however the method presented in this study was independent of classified images 3 2 evaluation of the pixels location the hot and cold pixels were obtained through the methodology presented in this study without using land use cover maps and in the simplest possible way our emphasis on not being dependent on pre prepared data is that access to such information is extremely limited in developing countries or the accuracy is not reliable with coarse spatial resolution one image over each region was chosen to illustrate the changes made in every step of the study october 1 2010 march 13 2018 april 29 2018 may 11 2015 and october 29 2012 for us ne us arm us kl us wjs and mirranatwa respectively the dem and slope masks were built fig 10 and then applied to the images to automatically make sure that the cold and hot pixels were not selected in mountains and valleys the white pixels passed the filter and the black pixels did not meet the requirements defined earlier in the study in mirranatwa due to the fact that the ec tower was in between mountains and close to the ridges the cold pixels were frequently being chosen in the shadows of vegetated mountains and hills grasslands due to the low lst therefore it was decided to reduce the optional value of 200 pixels around the station section 2 4 to remove the mountains near the ec tower however the hot pixel was selected based on the 200 pixel procedure hence we had two sets of masks for hot and cold pixels in mirranatwa applying the dem and slope masks to the images the number of candidate pixels for anchor pixels selection was considerably reduced the remaining pixels were those which had fallen into flat to low slope areas it should be noted that agricultural fields and pastures are commonly established in such areas because plowing and irrigating the fields is much easier than foothills and mountainous areas therefore the chance to select the hot and cold pixels in flat vegetated and fallow fields was increased then upon applying the ndvi albedo and lst filters figs 6 and 7 the final candidates 2nd lst hot cold candidates for selecting the endmembers were recognized fig 11 the cold pixel candidates were all in the vegetative areas in us ne and us arm most of the cold pixel candidates were along the river where the conditions of the farms were much closer to that of optimum evapotranspiration condition so consequently in this case the methodology proved to be accurate due to the smaller dem mask in mirranatwa fig 11 the number of cold pixel candidates was lower compared with the two other regions in other us regions cold pixels fell in agricultural areas us wjs had a greater number of hot pixel candidates than cold pixels due to the vast number of non vegetative pixels also cold pixels were not selected in the forest areas of the northwestern part of the image in the end the distance of each candidate from the meteorological stations were calculated and the closest one was chosen this method increased the chance of selecting the pixels in agricultural fields or well grown pastures specifically the hot pixel selection was more challenging and the last step was crucial for choosing the dry point in a fallow field avoiding the urban areas fig 12 shows that these pixels were properly selected over the fields the images are presented in false color so the darker the red color the denser the vegetation therefore the cold pixels were selected in fully vegetated surfaces and hot pixels were in the fallow fields cold pixels in all the regions were inside the fields with a fair distance from the edges which means that the candidates were fully vegetated the hot pixels were mainly those selected over rectangular fields indicating uncultivated agricultural farms 3 3 evaluation of the pixels values it is expected that cold pixel is selected from the lower quartile and hot pixel from the lst histogram s upper quartile the expectation was met through the methodology fig 13 the histogram of us wjs exhibits right skewness due to the lower surface area of vegetated surfaces across the region on the contrary in other regions there were farms and pastures across the region that caused the histogram to be more symmetric compared with us wjs the cold and hot pixels values fell into the proper locations on the histogram chart the cold pixels temperatures were among the lowest lsts after removing snow cloud and water bodies the hot pixels had high values of lst however the pixel over desert areas must have possessed the maximum value there were still shadowed vegetated surfaces in the mirranatwa s image therefore the cold pixel was closer to the histogram s average value with several lsts lower than the selected one compared with other regions the differences between wet and dry years were explicitly shown in the histograms especially in us arm where precipitation in the wet year was significantly greater than that of the dry year table 1 in general wet years had thicker histograms at the lower half of them the time series of the hot and cold lst pixels were drawn up fig 15 the hot and cold pixels primary values were first selected without considering the topography masks and the thresholds however when applying the filters to the images the final values were identified the primary values of cold pixels might be those selected over urban areas vegetation on mountains or shadows of clouds and mountains the primary values of hot pixels could be those in deserts and rocky areas the statistical parameters including maximum minimum and average of the cold pixels in us ne us arm us kl us wjs and mirranatwa were analyzed table 2 overall the average lst in us wjs was higher as et0 was changing above other regions fig 3 us wjs and mirranatwa had almost the same average lst however the difference in et0 may be emanated from the higher humidity in mirranatwa which caused a reduction in et0 the range of the variations of the hot pixels was fairly higher than that of the cold pixel variations also through visual examination of the time series the fluctuations in the cold pixels were relatively lower than that of the hot pixels throughout the study period in the regions the reason emanated from the lower temperature changes over canopy compared with the soil similar results were found in silva et al 2019 generally the visual interpretation of the anchor pixels location and also the evaluation of the hot and cold pixels values in the lst histogram and their time series throughout the study period indicated that lst pixels were properly selected in the regions using the proposed methodology with the simplest possible way and lived up to our expectations 3 4 evaluation of the metric sebal and sebs algorithms automatically calculated 3 4 1 measured ec data investigating the time series of eta from the metric sebal and sebs algorithms fig 15 using the automated hot and cold pixels selection methodology presented in this study showed that their variations aligned with the hot and cold pixels fluctuations fig 14 sebal and sebs were consistently underestimating however in us ne us kl and us wjs metric slightly overestimated daily eta us arm data where the difference between the precipitation in wet and dry years was considerable compared with other regions showed that metric had underestimation during wet years in comparison to 2014 with the lowest precipitation in mirranatwa metric slightly underestimated with closer values to that of ec compared with sebal and sebs the daily eta in the five regions was separately evaluated against the measured data with the 95 confidence bounds fig 16 the results exhibited a better performance of the metric algorithm in all the regions compared to sebal and sebs table 3 the higher correlation of eta from the metric algorithm was due to the internalized calibration using the et0 which made it more compatible with different weather conditions while sebal and sebs always underestimated eta values in all the regions especially under eta 3 mm on the other hand metric showed more consistency with the measured data for the whole ranges of eta the differences between the correlations in different regions might be emanated from the empirical and semi empirical equations used in the satellite based eta algorithms which caused differences in accuracy using the instructions proposed in this study the satellite based eta calculation relying on the hot and cold pixels selection would be conducted in a short time therefore water resources management from remotely sensed data can be more efficient 3 4 2 gldas and gleam data the metric based eta had a stronger correlation against the gldas and gleam data in the regions but mostly had greater rmse table 3 as observed against the measured data the results also showed that not in every locations the eta obtained from gldas and gleam as freely accessible products aligns with the metric sebal and sebs algorithms calculated using the automated method presented in this study fig 17 4 conclusions in order to reduce the expert interference and time of the image processing for selecting the anchor pixels a methodology was introduced based on removing the unwanted pixels for the anchor pixels selection using topography and vegetation information from dem and ndvi albedo lst images the study was conducted in five different regions with different topographic and climatic conditions us ne us arm us kl us wjs and the mirranatwa catchment first a general filtration was applied using the quality image to exclude snow cloud shadow and water bodies second the topography information elevation and slope was extracted from the dem images in order to remove pixels on the mountains and foothills third the ndvi and albedo images were taken into account to acknowledge the fully vegetated surfaces 1st lst hot cold candidates fourth the water stress condition was recognized using the lst image 2nd lst hot cold candidates due to the thermal radiation s susceptibility to the moisture change in the end the closest pixel to the meteorological station was selected from the 2nd lst hot cold candidates the visual interpretation of the pixels locations using the false color images indicated that the hot pixels were in fallow fields and the cold pixels were in densely vegetated surfaces with a fair distance from the edges the pixels values were investigated on the lst histogram which showed that the hot pixels were selected in the upper quartile and the cold pixels were in the lower quartile as expected also the time series of hot cold pixels showed a lower range and fluctuations in cold pixels compared with the hot pixels due to the lower variations of temperature over vegetation eventually the methodology was applied to the metric sebal and sebs algorithms for the eta estimation and it was shown that the resulted eta had a strong relationship with the measured data the method did not rely on land use cover maps and was so simple that an inexperienced operator could apply to every satellite based eta algorithm in a short time declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10164,the persistent monitoring of evapotranspiration et over the regions suffering from water scarcity is critical for sustainable agricultural water management remote sensing provides time and cost effective capability to investigate daily et rates at large scales satellite based actual evapotranspiration eta algorithms typically rely on specifying the upper and lower boundaries of eta rate over agricultural and pasture fields commonly known as hot dry and cold wet pixels selection these boundaries are to be recognized by an expert through a subjective and labor intensive task in this study a method has been introduced to automatically select appropriate anchor pixels i e hot and cold pixels independent from land use cover maps with the simplest possible way quickly applied even by an inexperienced operator subsequently eta was calculated using mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and surface energy balance system sebs algorithms and evaluated against measured data in this method the mountains and foothills were removed using the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem and the subsequent product was a slope mask then filters were applied based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi albedo and land surface temperature lst images to identify potential candidate pixels for hot and cold pixels in the end the best conditioned pixel being closest to the meteorological station was selected the method was assessed in five different regions with different topographic and climatic conditions the selected pixels were first visually validated in landsat images and then the fluctuations and values were discussed in time series of anchor pixels and lst histograms the visual interpretation was indicative of selecting the anchor pixels in fallow hot pixel and densely vegetated cold pixel surfaces also the hot and cold pixels were suitably situated in the upper and lower quartiles of the lst histogram respectively the range of cold pixels variations throughout the study periods was lower compared with the hot pixels 44 2 55 3 35 5 66 5 and 25 2 k for hot pixels against 34 2 45 7 25 6 52 2 and 17 k for cold pixels as expected which emanated from the lower fluctuations of temperature over vegetation against the soil the results were indicative of the better performance of metric compared with sebal and sebs with greater values of r2 in all the regions therefore using the introduced method the expert subjective interference was eliminated and processing time reduced significantly from about 1 h per image to a few minutes keywords automated hot and cold pixels digital elevation model land surface temperature metric sebal sebs 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the most prominent factor for agricultural water management and one of the water balance equation s key components therefore remote sensing helped researchers expedite the et calculation process instead of measuring it using costly instrumentations such as eddy covariance ec bowen ratio br and lysimeters previous studies have shown that satellite based actual et eta can be used in farm water management and irrigation scheduling mokhtari et al 2018 biomass mapping lobell et al 2003 water stress detection bhattarai et al 2017a b soil moisture calculation dhungel et al 2016 and drought studies eden 2012 satellite based eta algorithms require the operator s interference therefore manually calculating eta would be problematic in hydrological long term water balance monitoring using satellite images bartholie et al 1972 pioneered the remote sensing based eta estimation using a surface energy balance seb model while bastiaanssen et al 1998 presented the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and further developed the one source eta estimation algorithms they took into account an iterative based method for solving the sensible heat flux h equation h calculation required distinguishing upper and lower boundaries for eta rate known as anchor pixels i e hot dry and cold wet pixels selection su 2002 developed the surface energy balance system sebs model for satellite based eta calculation which was also a one source model inducing the canopy cover cc impact on the eta rate h was defined for each pixel based on dry and wet limits of land surface temperature lst at a given cc however it was still in need of a manual selection of hot and cold pixels allen et al 2007a notably refined the sebal algorithm and developed the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric yet the algorithm was dependent on hot and cold pixels selection several algorithms were also developed in the recent two decades including simple surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 simplified surface energy balance for operational applications ssebop senay et al 2013 lst vi triangle jiang and islam 1999 sebal advection sebal a mkhwanazi et al 2015 and modified sebal m sebal almhab and busu 2008 several studies have reported that metric sebal and sebs algorithms outperformed other methods wagle et al 2017 bhattarai et al 2017b 2019a elkatoury et al 2020 for more details on eta algorithms it is recommended to read the review written by chen and liu 2020 satellite based eta algorithms are sensitive to anchor pixel selection feng 2015 however proper identification of hot and cold pixels requires an expert s skill it would inevitably be time consuming and erroneous even under specialist supervision especially in the case of multiple satellite images since manually selecting the anchor pixels induces errors on algorithms such as sebal metric and sebs long and singh 2012 researchers have been making an effort to identify the anchor pixels automatically allen et al 2013 was among the first to introduce an automatic anchor pixel selection method although their methodology was simple with reliable accuracy the final hot and cold pixel was selected visually from candidate pixels olmedo et al 2017 introduced the water package under the calcanchor function which automatically selected the anchor pixels they considered 5 of the upper and lower ranges of the lst images for the hot and cold pixels respectively also they masked the images based on albedo 0 18 0 25 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi 0 76 1 leaf area index lai 3 6 and surface roughness length for momentum zom 0 03 0 08 in order to find the hot pixel and they respectively set these parameters 0 13 0 15 0 1 0 28 and lower than 0 005 for the cold pixel selection the problem with this method is the uncertainties in the lai and zom calculation because they are empirically calculated and require ground measured data for calibration bhattarai et al 2017a used an exhaustive search algorithm to identify anchor pixels their algorithm was in critical need of land cover maps to separate the agricultural fields from other land uses silva et al 2019 generated classification maps over the study area using landsat 7 and 8 with a supervised algorithm and used the classified image to identify the vegetated and soil surfaces jaafar and ahmad 2020 also took the water package into account but considered the proximity of hot and cold pixels to the meteorological station and defined a value for elevation representative of the bekaa valley which they calculated eta for they assumed that the whole valley consists of short crops crop height 1 m therefore their assumption was problematic in the case of trees so they recommended using a land cover map existing land use cover maps are not accurate enough and are mostly provided in coarse resolutions also creating a high spatial resolution classification map for an extended period can be time consuming a few automated applications such as earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux allen et al 2015 and simple operational surface energy balance ssebop have been developed on google earth engine for automated calculation of eta however one cannot choose between algorithms and input arbitrary meteorological data obtained from local stations therefore the need for automating the hot and cold pixels is necessary for choosing an algorithm freely simplicity is the key to a robust methodology because a simple yet accurate method can be of more generous help for an amateur user than a complicated approach therefore the objective of this study was to present a simple method for automating the anchor pixels selection for eta algorithms including sebal metric and sebs using the minimum pre prepared data such as land use cover maps the method was based on land topography ndvi albedo and lst masks we finally evaluated the sebal metric and sebs algorithms in five regions with different topographic and climatic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas in this study we evaluated our method in five different regions with differences in weather and topographic conditions 1 nebraska agricultural research and development center in nebraska u s us ne 1 3 2 lawrence berkeley national

mirranatwa catchment mirranatwa catchment is 230 km west of melbourne victoria australia fig 2 the area is vastly used for sheep grazing with uniform pasture cover the area is surrounded to the east and west by sandstone ridges of the grampians ranges and lies within an area of granite hills an ec tower was installed at 37 39 degrees south and 142 39 degrees east with 30 min eta data 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 remotely sensed data the landsat satellite images have been being used for water resources management studies for several years due to the ability to capture images in the multispectral and thermal portions of the spectrum anderson et al 2012 bhattarai et al 2015 2017b therefore we used cloudless images of landsat 5 7 and 8 in the studied areas the landsat series used in each area depended on the measured ec flux towers time period the level 2 data were preprocessed cloud and water bodies were masked and clipped in google earth engine also scan line corrector slc failure for landsat 7 had no data pixels in the images which were ignored in the calculations in this study we took advantage of the 30 meter srtm dem for creating the elevation and slope masks and it was also used in the sebal and metric algorithms dem images were also downloaded from google earth engine 2 2 2 climatic conditions the meteorological data used in this study consisted of air temperature wind speed solar radiation relative humidity and sunshine hours the statistical details on the long term meteorological data of us ne us arm us kl us wjs and mirranatwa were laid out in table 1 in the us national centers for environmental information ncei data from noaa database https www ncdc noaa gov and in australia the mirranatwa station were used us ne climate is humid continental humid with severe winter no dry season hot summer us arm is humid subtropical mild with no dry season hot summer us kl is humid us wjs is steppe warm winter and mirranatwa is humid warm winter and mild summer with low range of temperature throughout a year fig 3 shows the climatic conditions of each region as a time series of long term daily average et0 et0 from fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 is a function of air temperature wind speed and relative humidity which can be a reliable factor to indicate the climatic condition of a region et0 is the power of the atmosphere for evapotranspiration therefore in this case us wjs us arm us ne and us kl had respectively greater evapotranspiration strengths being in the southern hemisphere mirranatwa catchment s et0 variations was reversed compared to the us datasets and its range was almost the same as us ne 2 2 3 evapotranspiration data 2 2 3 1 field measured data 2 2 3 1 1 us ne there were 3 ec tower sites namely us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 fig

in the mirranatwa catchment fig 3 13 data from march 2012 until march 2013 were used although there was an overlap in landsat 7 satellite images in the area we lost many images due to several cloudy days 2 2 3 2 remotely sensed products the use of remotely sensed data assimilation products has proven to be of reliable accuracy khan et al 2018 2020 and always been beneficial for double validation of a model bhattarai et al 2019b 2 2 3 2 1 gldas global land data assimilation system gldas uses a land surface model which is the means of simulating interactions between the land surface and atmosphere rodell et al 2004 the gldas noah product with the spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 degrees and a temporal resolution of 3 h was used in this study to investigate the eta variations over the study areas 2 2 3 2 2 gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam is a set of algorithms that estimates the components of land evaporation or evapotranspiration miralles et al 2011 the 2018 product was available globally with the spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 degrees and daily temporal resolution once eta using the landsat imagery was calculated the spatial resolution was changed using the areal average to match the gldas and gleam products in order to check the validity of the model 2 3 the metric sebal and sebs algorithms implementation eta in metric sebal and sebs was obtained based on the residual component of the energy balance equation 1 le r n g h where le is the latent heat flux w m2 also known as the energy consumed for eta rn is the net radiation w m2 g is the soil heat flux w m2 and h is the sensible heat flux w m2 there were three major steps in solving the eq 1 1 rn calculation 2 g calculation based on rn values and 3 h calculation using an iterative approach which was the challenging part of the satellite based eta calculation procedure containing the anchor pixel selection rn was the result of incoming radiations minus outgoing radiations bastiaanssen

which was calculated based on bastiaanssen 1995 wang et al 2014 10 z om exp 5 3 ndvi 5 2 h was obtained through an iterative process in which rah and u were sustained using the monin obukhov similarity brutsaert 1999 businger et al 1971 the process was conducted based on the anchor pixels hot and cold pixels selection in the algorithms it was considered that the h value in the cold pixel was 0 and eta was at its maximum which means that le rn g densely vegetated surface and on the contrary in the hot pixel eta rate was 0 dry soil without vegetation cover the primary values of dt for the hot and cold pixels were calculated and by achieving the a and b coefficients the below equation was solved for the whole image 11 dt a b lst this equation is indicative of a linear relationship between lst and dt which is a significant assumption in these algorithms allen 2011 bastiaanssen 1995 consequently the dt image was used under the uncorrected conditions of the atmosphere for h

formulated below 12 l œÅ a c p u 3 lst kgh where g is the gravitational constant m s2 according to the value of l l 0 unstable l 0 neutral and l 0 stable the stability correction factors œàm and œàh were calculated based on paulson 1970 and webb 1970 the stability factors in eqs 8 and 9 were used to update the rah and u images in each iteration and subsequently dt was updated with different values of a and b the parameters including l h rah u dt a and b were being refined until we reached the constant values of h allen et al 2007b allen 2011 bastiaanssen 2000 h iteration in the sebs

mentioned in the sebal algorithm also the whole process has been drawn up as a flowchart fig 4 2 4 automation of hot and cold pixels the automation was performed without the need for land use cover maps the methodology was based on avoiding complicated calculations and has been simplified as much as possible it was tested in three different regions with fairly different climatic conditions the methodology was categorized into three major steps 1 the use of the elevation and slope masks in order to remove the unwanted pixels superimposed over mountainous and some urban areas 2 defining boundaries according to the characteristics of the hot and cold pixels for lst albedo and ndvi images in order to obtain the candidates for the anchor pixels and 3 defining a filter for the candidate pixels based on their distance to the meteorological station to increase the chance of selecting a pixel over an agricultural field therefore first the pixels containing shadow cloud and water were identified using the predefined quality band of the level 2 landsat images and eventually excluded in order to remove the high and low altitude areas a dem mask was created fig 5 two hundred pixels surrounding the meteorological station were chosen and the range between the minimum and maximum values of the dem dem200 was selected as the appropriate pixels because stations are usually in a flat area in order to remove the steep areas a slope mask was created using the dem images first two hundred pixels from the slope image around the station were chosen and then assuming that the values were normally distributed near to 1 of the pixels were removed the procedure for eliminating 1 of the pixels was as follows instead of using the minimum and maximum values which may contain outliers the range between three times of the standard deviation std greater and lesser than the average of the slope200 99 of the data were selected the number 200 is optional which was reduced in the mirranatwa catchment due to proximity to the ridges 2 4 1 cold pixel considering that cold pixels are those with the optimum evapotranspiration conditions which was well irrigated the ndvi values were close to the maximum also the values of albedo and lst were close to the minimum therefore for the first step a mask was made using the ndvi image ndvi max ndvi 0 2 which considering this threshold the method will automatically select a pixel over agricultural areas al zayed and elagib 2017 albedo is the lowest around 0 1 over vegetated surfaces wang et al 2017 therefore the other mask was built based on the albedo values albedo min albedo 0 1 consequently the vegetated areas were selected through these filters in order to remove the unwanted pixels in the lst image the ndvi and albedo masks were multiplied by lst to identify the primary candidate pixels for cold 1st lst cold candidates lst is the most crucial factor for the water stress condition of the crops and the lesser the lst value the lesser the water stress would be hence the next step was creating the second round of candidates 2nd lst cold candidates by choosing the pixels lower than the average between the areal average and minimum value of 1st lst cold candidates this step was necessary to ascertain that the selected pixels fall into the lst histogram s lower quartile hence the resulting cold pixel candidates were distributed across the entire image including farms urban green spaces pastures and orchards since weather stations are preferably chosen in areas with simple topography far from urban areas world meteorological organization 1993 the closest pixel among the 2nd lst cold candidates to the meteorological station was selected as the cold pixel for further calculations this step was essential to increase the probability of selecting the anchor pixels with the optimum temperature wind and humidity conditions the flowchart fig 7 illustrates the steps in the cold pixel selection procedure 2 4 2 hot pixel hot pixels must fall into fallow fields with the lowest amount of soil moisture content therefore the ndvi value should be greater than 0 but lower than the value representing the vegetated areas usually ndvi 0 25 is considered a non vegetated surface al zayed and elagib 2017 the ndvi value being close to 0 usually lower than 0 05 is likely to indicate urban or stony pixels deng and wu 2012 accordingly we excluded this range of values for hot pixel selection on the other hand the albedo for fallow fields was relatively high however based on our experience and the results presented in fujimaki et al 2003 nonsaline soils had albedo of maximum 0 3 and salty soils possessed the maximum values in an image usually albedo 0 3 therefore the mid range values of albedo were the best choice for hot pixel selection also lst should be among the high values in the upper quartile the primary candidates for hot pixel selection 1st lst hot candidates were chosen based on 0 08 ndvi 0 25 and then 0 15 albedo 0 3 and consequently the resulted mask was multiplied by the lst image in order to obtain the 2nd lst hot candidates we chose the pixels with greater values than the value of the average between the spatial average and maximum values of the first mask 1st lst hot candidates there was a small possibility that the resulting pixels may fall into the urban and stony areas which had not been removed through the previous filtrations therefore we calculated the distance of each pixel from the meteorological station and then the closest one was chosen for the final selection the flowchart drawn up in fig 8 comprehensively illustrates the steps a significant time for satellite based eta calculation is always wasted in selecting the hot and cold pixels manually using this method the time was reduced from an hour per each image to a few minutes matlab was used for this purpose 3 results and discussion 3 1 field and topographic conditions in order to better analyze the location of the hot and cold pixels we classified the images of us ne us arm us kl us wjs and mirranatwa where the vegetation cover was fig 8 the classification images were not used in the methodology and were to identify the predominant groundcover in the regions the classes were categorized into vegetation urban and unused areas grasslands vegetated surface on a slope and water bodies the classification method was the maximum likelihood a subset of the supervised classification approach in us ne us arm us kl and mirranatwa the agricultural fields and pastures were distributed across the region however in us wjs only about one third of the region was covered in farms us kl had denser vegetation areas compared with us ne and us arm the mirranatwa catchment was mostly covered by pastures and agricultural fields with a small region consisting of mountainous areas due to steep and hillshades the grassland areas were covered with shadows that were not removed by using the quality band and became problematic in the cold pixel selection procedure the substantial difference between the percentages of regions vegetation surfaces emanated from their topography fig 9 the topographic spatial variations in us wjs were different from those of us ne us arm us kl and mirranatwa in wjs the agricultural fields are sparse and the northwestern vegetative area fig 8 is forest over mountains with higher altitude fig 9 with high values of lst and low values of ndvi the mountainous areas were making problems in the hot pixel selection procedure so they were quickly removed using the dem and slope masks not all regions of the world have access to pre prepared classification maps in order to separate the agricultural fields also classifying each image with high accuracy is time consuming and requires access to high spatial resolution images however the method presented in this study was independent of classified images 3 2 evaluation of the pixels location the hot and cold pixels were obtained through the methodology presented in this study without using land use cover maps and in the simplest possible way our emphasis on not being dependent on pre prepared data is that access to such information is extremely limited in developing countries or the accuracy is not reliable with coarse spatial resolution one image over each region was chosen to illustrate the changes made in every step of the study october 1 2010 march 13 2018 april 29 2018 may 11 2015 and october 29 2012 for us ne us arm us kl us wjs and mirranatwa respectively the dem and slope masks were built fig 10 and then applied to the images to automatically make sure that the cold and hot pixels were not selected in mountains and valleys the white pixels passed the filter and the black pixels did not meet the requirements defined earlier in the study in mirranatwa due to the fact that the ec tower was in between mountains and close to the ridges the cold pixels were frequently being chosen in the shadows of vegetated mountains and hills grasslands due to the low lst therefore it was decided to reduce the optional value of 200 pixels around the station section 2 4 to remove the mountains near the ec tower however the hot pixel was selected based on the 200 pixel procedure hence we had two sets of masks for hot and cold pixels in mirranatwa applying the dem and slope masks to the images the number of candidate pixels for anchor pixels selection was considerably reduced the remaining pixels were those which had fallen into flat to low slope areas it should be noted that agricultural fields and pastures are commonly established in such areas because plowing and irrigating the fields is much easier than foothills and mountainous areas therefore the chance to select the hot and cold pixels in flat vegetated and fallow fields was increased then upon applying the ndvi albedo and lst filters figs 6 and 7 the final candidates 2nd lst hot cold candidates for selecting the endmembers were recognized fig 11 the cold pixel candidates were all in the vegetative areas in us ne and us arm most of the cold pixel candidates were along the river where the conditions of the farms were much closer to that of optimum evapotranspiration condition so consequently in this case the methodology proved to be accurate due to the smaller dem mask in mirranatwa fig 11 the number of cold pixel candidates was lower compared with the two other regions in other us regions cold pixels fell in agricultural areas us wjs had a greater number of hot pixel candidates than cold pixels due to the vast number of non vegetative pixels also cold pixels were not selected in the forest areas of the northwestern part of the image in the end the distance of each candidate from the meteorological stations were calculated and the closest one was chosen this method increased the chance of selecting the pixels in agricultural fields or well grown pastures specifically the hot pixel selection was more challenging and the last step was crucial for choosing the dry point in a fallow field avoiding the urban areas fig 12 shows that these pixels were properly selected over the fields the images are presented in false color so the darker the red color the denser the vegetation therefore the cold pixels were selected in fully vegetated surfaces and hot pixels were in the fallow fields cold pixels in all the regions were inside the fields with a fair distance from the edges which means that the candidates were fully vegetated the hot pixels were mainly those selected over rectangular fields indicating uncultivated agricultural farms 3 3 evaluation of the pixels values it is expected that cold pixel is selected from the lower quartile and hot pixel from the lst histogram s upper quartile the expectation was met through the methodology fig 13 the histogram of us wjs exhibits right skewness due to the lower surface area of vegetated surfaces across the region on the contrary in other regions there were farms and pastures across the region that caused the histogram to be more symmetric compared with us wjs the cold and hot pixels values fell into the proper locations on the histogram chart the cold pixels temperatures were among the lowest lsts after removing snow cloud and water bodies the hot pixels had high values of lst however the pixel over desert areas must have possessed the maximum value there were still shadowed vegetated surfaces in the mirranatwa s image therefore the cold pixel was closer to the histogram s average value with several lsts lower than the selected one compared with other regions the differences between wet and dry years were explicitly shown in the histograms especially in us arm where precipitation in the wet year was significantly greater than that of the dry year table 1 in general wet years had thicker histograms at the lower half of them the time series of the hot and cold lst pixels were drawn up fig 15 the hot and cold pixels primary values were first selected without considering the topography masks and the thresholds however when applying the filters to the images the final values were identified the primary values of cold pixels might be those selected over urban areas vegetation on mountains or shadows of clouds and mountains the primary values of hot pixels could be those in deserts and rocky areas the statistical parameters including maximum minimum and average of the cold pixels in us ne us arm us kl us wjs and mirranatwa were analyzed table 2 overall the average lst in us wjs was higher as et0 was changing above other regions fig 3 us wjs and mirranatwa had almost the same average lst however the difference in et0 may be emanated from the higher humidity in mirranatwa which caused a reduction in et0 the range of the variations of the hot pixels was fairly higher than that of the cold pixel variations also through visual examination of the time series the fluctuations in the cold pixels were relatively lower than that of the hot pixels throughout the study period in the regions the reason emanated from the lower temperature changes over canopy compared with the soil similar results were found in silva et al 2019 generally the visual interpretation of the anchor pixels location and also the evaluation of the hot and cold pixels values in the lst histogram and their time series throughout the study period indicated that lst pixels were properly selected in the regions using the proposed methodology with the simplest possible way and lived up to our expectations 3 4 evaluation of the metric sebal and sebs algorithms automatically calculated 3 4 1 measured ec data investigating the time series of eta from the metric sebal and sebs algorithms fig 15 using the automated hot and cold pixels selection methodology presented in this study showed that their variations aligned with the hot and cold pixels fluctuations fig 14 sebal and sebs were consistently underestimating however in us ne us kl and us wjs metric slightly overestimated daily eta us arm data where the difference between the precipitation in wet and dry years was considerable compared with other regions showed that metric had underestimation during wet years in comparison to 2014 with the lowest precipitation in mirranatwa metric slightly underestimated with closer values to that of ec compared with sebal and sebs the daily eta in the five regions was separately evaluated against the measured data with the 95 confidence bounds fig 16 the results exhibited a better performance of the metric algorithm in all the regions compared to sebal and sebs table 3 the higher correlation of eta from the metric algorithm was due to the internalized calibration using the et0 which made it more compatible with different weather conditions while sebal and sebs always underestimated eta values in all the regions especially under eta 3 mm on the other hand metric showed more consistency with the measured data for the whole ranges of eta the differences between the correlations in different regions might be emanated from the empirical and semi empirical equations used in the satellite based eta algorithms which caused differences in accuracy using the instructions proposed in this study the satellite based eta calculation relying on the hot and cold pixels selection would be conducted in a short time therefore water resources management from remotely sensed data can be more efficient 3 4 2 gldas and gleam data the metric based eta had a stronger correlation against the gldas and gleam data in the regions but mostly had greater rmse table 3 as observed against the measured data the results also showed that not in every locations the eta obtained from gldas and gleam as freely accessible products aligns with the metric sebal and sebs algorithms calculated using the automated method presented in this study fig 17 4 conclusions in order to reduce the expert interference and time of the image processing for selecting the anchor pixels a methodology was introduced based on removing the unwanted pixels for the anchor pixels selection using topography and vegetation information from dem and ndvi albedo lst images the study was conducted in five different regions with different topographic and climatic conditions us ne us arm us kl us wjs and the mirranatwa catchment first a general filtration was applied using the quality image to exclude snow cloud shadow and water bodies second the topography information elevation and slope was extracted from the dem images in order to remove pixels on the mountains and foothills third the ndvi and albedo images were taken into account to acknowledge the fully vegetated surfaces 1st lst hot cold candidates fourth the water stress condition was recognized using the lst image 2nd lst hot cold candidates due to the thermal radiation s susceptibility to the moisture change in the end the closest pixel to the meteorological station was selected from the 2nd lst hot cold candidates the visual interpretation of the pixels locations using the false color images indicated that the hot pixels were in fallow fields and the cold pixels were in densely vegetated surfaces with a fair distance from the edges the pixels values were investigated on the lst histogram which showed that the hot pixels were selected in the upper quartile and the cold pixels were in the lower quartile as expected also the time series of hot cold pixels showed a lower range and fluctuations in cold pixels compared with the hot pixels due to the lower variations of temperature over vegetation eventually the methodology was applied to the metric sebal and sebs algorithms for the eta estimation and it was shown that the resulted eta had a strong relationship with the measured data the method did not rely on land use cover maps and was so simple that an inexperienced operator could apply to every satellite based eta algorithm in a short time declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
