carbon nitride g c3n4 this study investigates the performance of g c3n4 on photodegradation of mb in this study polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibres embedded with g c3n4 photocatalyst was successfully prepared using electrospinning technique which produced liquid permeable self supporting photocatalytic nanofibre mats that can be handled easily different configurations of g c3n4 were synthesised bulk g c3n4 bg c3n4 and nanosheets g c3n4 nsg c3n4 from urea using a green facile template free method effective photocatalytic activity of the g c3n4 nanofibres was confirmed by 97 3 degradation of mb under visible light irradiation photodegradation of mb in aqueous solution by g c3n4 nanofibres predominantly attributed to the synergetic effects of mb adsorption by pan nanofibres and photocatalytic degradation of mb by g c3n4 photocatalyst this present work not only presents the simplest ecofriendly and economical approach to fabricate g c3n4 nanofibre photocatalyst but also paves new opportunities for this advanced photocatalyst as great potential in environmental remediation for treatment of industrial mb wastewater keywords adsorption photocatalytic degradation graphitic carbon nitride nanofibres wastewater 1 introduction graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is one of the oldest material described in the chemical literature which has recently experienced renaissance as highly active photocatalyst previously 1 2 mentioned that historically in 1830s berzelius and liebig have reported on the general formula of carbon nitride family as c3n3h n which traced in embryonic form melon a linear polymer consisting of interconnected tri s triazines via secondary nitrogen meanwhile g c3n4 in the form of 2d sheets consisting of tri triazines interconnected via tertiary amines previous breakthrough studies have revealed several intrinsic features of g c3n4 previous breakthrough studies have revealed several intrinsic features of g c3n4 being a metal free heterogeneous catalyst with simple constitution elements of c n and residual hydrogen in defects the g c3n4 is able to renders the materials nontoxic and biocompatible for some applications 3 in addition g c3n4 shows onset on bandgap adsorption around 420 nm and exhibit strong blue photoluminescence at range of 430 550 nm at room temperature most importantly g c3n4 owns a band gap of 2 7 ev that suitable as visible light active photoresponse photocatalyst with conductive band cb of 1 1 ev and valence band vb of 1 6 ev respectively and normal hydrogen electrodes nhes as reference 4 with remarkable discovery on g c3n4 that owns appealing electronic band gap extraordinary physicochemical stability facile synthesis and earth abundant nature 5 7 this study investigated the photodegradation capability of g c3n4 on methylene blue mb in aqueous based on our previous works the synthesised bulk g c3n4 bg c3n4 was obtained as agglomerated powder 8 thus with reduced in effective surface area it suffers from narrow visible light absorption range and high recombination probability of photogenerated charge carriers and finally limits its photocatalytic activity 9 therefore to achieve high photocatalytic activity to irradiation nanosheets graphitic carbon nitride nsg c3n4 was synthesised from bg c3n4 using liquid exfoliation method 10 moreover basic requirement to design and operate separation process requires a separation material that is easy to be handled therefore electrospinning technique was employed in this study to fabricate a specific shaped of g c3n4 with high surface area made from polymer nanofibres composite this technique can effectively dispersed nanoparticles photocatalyst into polymer based nanofibres 11 12 recently study by 13 14 have reported that addition of other materials through facile blending have improved the properties of polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibres to generate composite nanofibres with synergistic properties in this work g c3n4 was dispersed into pan spinning solution to produce nonwoven mat of pan nanofibres embedded with g c3n4 previous literature only reported on photodegradation of mb contaminant using g c3n4 powder photocatalyst but none has reported by using nsg c3n4 embedded pan nanofibres dyeing industries particularly textile industries utilise colour and massive amount of water during production operations 15 there are several groups of dye such as basic acidic diazo azo metal based dyes and anthraquinone based which pose a threat to environment and public health 16 20 therefore decolorization and detoxification of dye containing wastewater need to be conducted before discharging the wastewater into natural water bodies 21 23 physical and chemical methods including adsorption membrane separation precipitation and coalescence have conventionally been developed to treat mb from water and wastewater 18 24 however these methods only decrease the pollutant dye concentration in water and a non destructive process a substantial amount of research for the treatment and management on large amount of textile effluents such as methylene blue mb dye has rapidly been conducted to minimise its impact towards the environment 25 26 furthermore removal of mb dye does not only become an important but challenging area of research for wastewater treatment therefore the superior surface area and promising electronic properties rendered by the nanofibres embedded g c3n4 is expected to improve the photocatalytic performance through synergetic effects of mb adsorption in nanofibre polymer matrix and in situ photodegradation as such electrospun g c3n4 nanofibres could be an alternatively feasible candidate for both adsorption and photocatalysis for dye wastewater treatment 2 experimental 2 1 materials the g c3n4 powders were synthesised using urea ar grade and isopropanol ipa purchased from qrec malaysia dimethylformamide dmf rci labscan and polyacrylonitrile pan 150 000 g mol sigma aldrich were used as a solvent and polymer binder respectively for the electrospinning dope solution methylene blue mb reag ph eur used in photocatalytic measurement was supplied by sigma aldrich fig 1 illustrates the structure of mb in this work all the analytical reagent and chemicals were used without further purification the reverse osmosis ro water used was from millipore astm type iii 2 2 sample preparation a green facile template free method was employed to synthesise g c3n4 powder as reported in our previous work 28 29 ten grams of urea powder was calcined at 500 c at ambient atmosphere in an ashing furnace aaf 1100 carbolite for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 c min the as synthesised bulk graphitic carbon nitride bg c3n4 powder in pale yellow was obtained and ground using a mortar a sonication assisted liquid exfoliation method was used to treat bg c3n4 further to synthesise nanosheets graphitic carbon nitride nsg c3n4 a total of 100 mg bg c3n4 powder was mixed with 100 ml of ipa as a dispersion solvent and further sonicated for 10 h the solution was dried overnight in an oven at 80 c to obtain light yellow powder denoted as nsg c3n4 the electrospinning of dope solution was prepared using a method reported in a previous study 28 a quantity of g c3n4 was mixed with dmf before the solution was sonicated using an ultrasonicator delta ultrasonic dc150 h for 5 h at 40 khz next 90 wt of pan powder was added into the mixture before it was sonicated homogenously for another 5 h to fabricate pan nanofibres containing g c3n4 a nanofibres electrospinning unit progene link sdn bhd nf 1000 was employed and the experimental setup was illustrated in fig 2 a a 10 ml hypodermic syringe that was connected with a blunt tip metallic needle was filled with electrospinning dope solution and placed inside the electrospinning chamber where the flow rate of a syringe pump was set at 1 ml h the applied voltage for the electrospinning unit was set at 15 kv and the tip to collector distance was set at 18 cm the dope solution was electrospun on an aluminium collector and was peeled off manually after the electrospinning completed the resulted nanofibres comprising bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 were named as bulk graphitic carbon nitride nanofibres nfbg c3n4 and nanosheets graphitic carbon nitride nanofibres nfnsg c3n4 respectively 2 3 characterisation the surface morphology of the samples was observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem hitachi high tech co hitachi su8020 the mean nanofibres diameter was analysed using gaussian function approximation by origin software transmission electron microscopy was performed using hr tem hitachi high tech co hitachi ht7700 under 120 kv voltage acceleration nitrogen adsorption desorption measurement at 196 c was performed using an automatic gas adsorption instrument bel japan belsorp max brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh methods were used to obtain the specific surface area sbet and pore size distributions of the samples respectively the chemical structures of the samples were characterised using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir jasco inc ft ir 6100 with absorbance configuration uv visible nir spectrophotometer shidmadzu co uv 3101pc was used to record the absorption spectra of the g c3n4 the obtained reflectance values were converted to absorbance based on kubelka munk function equation photoluminescence analysis jasco inc fp 6500 was employed to record the photoluminescence spectra of the g c3n4 the g c3n4 were excited under illumination at 360 nm and the emission spectra were recorded from 350 to 750 nm including the peak wavelength of the excitation light software provided by jasco inc was used to calculate the photoluminescence efficiency 2 4 photocatalysis measurement an aqueous solution of methylene blue mb was freshly prepared at 10 ppm fig 2b shows the suspension mode photocatalytic reactor that was used to conduct all the photocatalytic measurements a 450 ml beaker containing suspension solution was placed inside the photocatalytic reactor at 15 cm distance from the source of light a suspension solution was prepared by adding 0 20 g of photocatalyst in 200 ml of mb solution during photocatalytic activity a white light emitting diode led lamp 30 w was used as a source of visible light with a wavelength region of 420 nm air bubbles were continuously supplied using an air diffuser to ensure adequate supply of oxygen to the reaction the suspension solution was stirred for 60 min in the dark to ensure adsorption equilibrium before irradiation at every 30 min interval during irradiation 5 ml of suspension was collected to measure the absorbance using uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr5000 the mb concentration was determined based on the absorbance value of mb recorded at 662 nm the photocatalytic activity is expressed in the percentage mb removal according to eq 1 1 mb removal efficiency c o c t c o 100 where co is the initial absorbance of the suspension solution and ct is the absorbance at time of 0 300 min is 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of g c3n4 powders and g c3n4 pan nanofibres fig 3 shows the sem and tem images of the as synthesised bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 it can be clearly seen that bg c3n4 is a porous particle with a pore size of approximately 0 1 2 μm fig 3a the tem images confirm the porous structure of bg c3n4 based on its edge regions which exhibit a relatively dark brightness fig 3b the formation of this porous structure was due to decomposition of urea which generated gas bubbles during thermal treatment the existence of this porous structure is favourable as it facilitates high surface area and accommodates numerous channels to enable mass diffusion to enhance separation processes 2 meanwhile the sem image of nsg c3n4 presented in fig 3c shows a flower like structure of thin graphitic nanosheet layers embedded in open pores in addition two dimensional 2d layers of g c3n4 with laminar morphology like silk veil that nearly transparent than bg c3n4 is presented in the tem images of nsg c3n4 fig 3d thus these findings prove that sonication assisted liquid exfoliation performed on bg c3n4 successfully exfoliated its bulk structure to form nsg c3n4 polymer nanofibre was embedded with g c3n4 using electrospinning to produce g c3n4 pan nanofibre mats with high surface area and easy to handle manually pan polymer was selected as a polymer matrix for nanofibres because it has no optical absorbance in visible light region furthermore owing a similar molecular structure with that of g c3n4 pan polymer is favourable for dispersion and miscibility with g c3n4 electrospinning technique successfully generated nanofibers containing g c3n4 powder as shown in the sem images in fig 4 a and b for nfng c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 respectively interestingly the electrospun nanofibre mats have a network of a highly well interconnected open pore structure in several micrometre size furthermore the noduleless structure of nanofibres formed indicates a uniform distribution of g c3n4 along the pan nanofibres surface the electrospun fibre formed was also straight with an average diameter in nanometre size the mean nanofibre diameters for nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 were also examined using digital imaging analysis of the sem images where the mean nanofibre diameters for nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 were 207 2 and 262 6 nm respectively in comparison to smooth straight shape of pan nanofibres nfbg c3n4 have numerous lumps on the smooth nanofibres shape these spherical lumps with a few micrometre size corresponded to the bulky shape of bg c3n4 embedded in the nanofibres in contrast due to the successful exfoliation of bulky bg c3n4 to form thin nanosheets of nsg c3n4 nfnsg c3n4 had less numbers of thin lumps compared to nfbg c3n4 indicating that nsg c3n4 were uniformly distributed along the pan nanofibres surface 28 29 these uniform smooth and straight in infinite length structure of nfnsg c3n4 produced a slightly higher mean nanofibre diameter of nfnsg c3n4 compared to nfbg c3n4 table 1 summarises the results of sbet total pore volume and mean pore diameter of bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 measured via nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms the sbet of bg c3n4 is 41 3 m2 g which is slightly higher than that of nsg c3n4 36 7 m2 g most likely the lower sbet after exfoliation might be due to the lower recovery of g c3n4 layer restacking during the drying process of nsg c3n4 however after exfoliation the total pore volume and mean pore diameter of g c3n4 increased thus enhancement in pore volume and size improved the characteristic for nsg c3n4 for better adsorption properties fig 5 presents the ftir spectra of bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 the typical peaks of the spectra obtained were consistent with those of g c3n4 reported elsewhere 30 31 generally the obtained spectra of nsg c3n4 matched the spectra of bg c3n4 indicating similar chemical structures and confirming that the exfoliation process did not involve any reaction the sharp band at 810 cm 1 corresponds to the condensed cn heterocycles which originated from breathing of the tri s triazine units ring the absorption bands at 1568 and 1630 cm 1 correspond to the cn stretching while the three bands around 1253 1326 and 1417 cm 1 are attributed to the cn stretching the peaks at 900 1800 cm 1 are mainly attributed to the aromatic cn heterocycles which contain either trigonal n c 3 as fully condensed or bridging cnhc units as partially condensed 30 32 meanwhile under broad shoulder of 3000 3500 cm 1 the two weak peaks at 3176 and 3329 cm 1 correspond to the stretching modes of uncondensed amine groups nh2 or nh overall these ftir results suggest that g c3n4 units mainly consist of various chemical bonds made from c and n atoms such as cn bond cn bond n c 3 and cnhc bridges the electronic structures of bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 are presented by uv vis absorption shown in fig 6 comparing the two g c3n4 fig 6a the diffuse reflectance spectra of nsg c3n4 exhibited a red shift of absorption wavelength the increase in red shift of 10 nm absorption under visible light region promoted the generation of more electron hole pairs under sunlight irradiation thus improving the photocatalytic activity of nsg c3n4 33 the kubelka munk function was used to estimate the band gap energy of the samples by plotting αhυ 2 versus hυ where α is the absorption coefficient and hυ is the photon energy 34 based on the intercept of the tangent plot it is estimated that the band gap energies were 2 72 and 2 68 ev for bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 respectively fig 6b therefore the resulted red shift in absorption spectra was attributed by the band gap energy narrowing of 0 04 ev which certainly suggests that the exfoliation of bg c3n4 affected the electronic properties of g c3n4 it is well acknowledged that photoluminescence pl emission originates from electron recombination 35 therefore pl intensity was used to reflect the photocatalyst separation efficiency to assess the catalytic function the pl spectra of g c3n4 comprise a broad peak at 400 650 nm with the peak maximum observed at 448 nm fig 6c the shape of pl spectra for bg c3n4 is almost same with that for nsg c3n4 however the peak intensity of nsg c3n4 is much smaller than that of bg c3n4 based on integral sphere assembly pl quantum efficiency of the g c3n4 samples was quantitatively determined and the efficiency of nsg c3n4 was 1 0 which is one third of that of bg c3n4 3 1 these promising results prove that nsg c3n4 has higher photocatalytic activity due to the disturbance of electron hole recombination from nitrogen adsorption measurement the sbet values of nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 were 15 4 and 13 3 m2 g respectively the sbet values of nanofibres were much smaller compared to that of g c3n4 most likely the sbet values of nanofibres were only contributed by the outer surface of pan nanofibres not by g c3n4 embedded into the pan matrix therefore to verify these hypotheses we calculated the geometric surface area of nanofibres using eq 2 where a is the area of the nanofibres v is the volume ρ is the density of pan d is the diameter of the nanofibres l is the length and s is the specific surface area 2 s a ρ v π d l ρ π d 2 4 l 4 ρ d by using the values of sbet 15 4 m2 g for bg c3n4 and 13 3 m2 g for nsg c3n4 and ρ of 1 18 g cm3 36 the calculated average diameter of nanofibre was 220 nm for bg c3n4 and 255 nm for nsg c3n4 these calculated diameters are similar with the mean diameter obtained from the digital image analysis of the sem images therefore this evidence suggests that the sbet value only represents the surface area of nanofibres surface but not the porous structure of g c3n4 this finding is possibly due to the porous g c3n4 encapsulated in the matrix of pan polymer meanwhile the total pore volumes of nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 were much lower than that of g c3n4 which is attributed to the less dense stacking of nanofibres to form nanopores which were accessible by a gas adsorption measurement pore size smaller than 200 nm the ftir spectra of nfbg c3n4 nfnsg c3n4 and pan nanofibres are shown in fig 7 the characteristic peaks of pan exist in both nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 spectra such as the stretching vibration of nitrile group cn at 2242 cm 1 and the stretching vibration and bending vibration of methylene ch2 at 2936 and 1453 cm 1 37 the weight ratio of pan to g c3n4 of 10 1 explains that the nanofibres were mostly made of the pan polymer matrix other than the peaks of pan the characteristic peaks of g c3n4 were found at 810 cm 1 aromatic cn heterocycles 1243 and 1320 cm 1 cn stretching 1563 cm 1 and 1621 cm 1 cn stretching and 3000 3380 cm 1 amine groups nh2 or nh which confirm that g c3n4 was successfully embedded into the pan polymer matrix these electrospun nanofibres nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 have the excellent features of large surface area and defined open pores which could facilitate mass diffusion and rapid adsorption of targeted pollutant molecules furthermore uniform dispersion of g c3n4 embedded into the pan polymer matrix would help to promote vast numbers of active sites for effective interactions between the reactant and photocatalyst and finally improves the photocatalytic activity 3 2 photodegradation of methylene blue mb the removal efficiency of mb was investigated using mb solution with the initial concentration of 10 ppm the removal efficiency of mb was measured based on adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of mb solution before irradiation the mixture of mb and photocatalyst was stirred for 60 min in the dark to achieve adsorption equilibrium and to make sure that adsorption reading does not interfere with the reading of photocatalytic degradation of mb therefore when the suspension of photocatalyst and mb solution was irradiated with light the removal of mb is specifically referred to the photocatalytic degradation the photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 on mb was observed under visible light irradiation λ 420 nm fig 8 a shows the photodegradation removal of mb with the presence of bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 powder under visible light for 300 min with samples collected at an interval of 30 min photolysis was conducted to evaluate the stability of mb solution under visible light irradiation without the presence of photocatalyst the direct decomposition of mb in the absence of photocatalyst was not detected about 23 9 of mb was decomposed under visible light illumination after 300 min without the presence of photocatalyst in general the rapid increase in degradation just after visible light was activated indicates the effective photodegradation by g c3n4 the incorporation of bg c3n4 decreased 10 of te mb concentration under dark condition which indicates that bg c3n4 can adsorb the mb due to porous structure the bg c3n4 illuminated with visible light effectively decomposed 77 6 of mb after 300 min the result reveals photocatalytic activity of bg c3n4 under visible light illumination the degradation of mb by nsg c3n4 was 85 1 which is higher than that by bg c3n4 that might be due to the narrowed band gap and improved photoresponse of nsg c3n4 implying better photocatalytic activity on mb the obtained nsg c3n4 changed in colour from light yellow bg c3n4 to brown yellow corresponding to the expanded adsorption in visible light region 38 thus narrowed the band gap and improved light absorbance that is useful for photocatalytic performance moreover the higher adsorption capacity and photocatalytic degradation efficiency of nsg c3n4 may originate from a well dispersed nsg c3n4 in mb aqueous solution by electrostatic repulsive interaction 30 the photocatalytic degradation of mb might be due to the absorption of photon energy by nsg c3n4 that caused electron excitation from valence band vb to conduction band cb leaving the positive holes at vb according to 39 nsg c3n4 was unable to generate hydroxyl radicals oh for mb degradation due to less positive vb position of nsg c3n4 compared to the standard redox potential oh oh 1 99 ev nevertheless the high oxidative potential of photogenerated holes at vb of nsg c3n4 enables simultaneous direct oxidation and degradation of mb 40 therefore the possible mechanism for photodegradation of mb could be proposed as follows 39 absorption of efficient photons hv eg 2 68 ev by nsg c3n4 eq 3 direct oxidation of mb is possible due to the high oxidation potential of the hole h v b on nsg c3n4 eq 4 3 n s g c 3 n 4 h v n s g c 3 n 4 e c b h v b 4 h v b m b d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t in contrast cb position of nsg c3n4 is more negative than the reduction potential o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe as reported by 39 therefore molecular oxygen o2 can be reduced to superoxide radicals o2 by photogenerated electron of nsg c3n4 ecb eq 5 5 e c b o 2 o 2 6 o 2 h h o 2 7 h o 2 m b d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t 8 o 2 2 h e c b h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 m b d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t the produce superoxide radicals o2 might also react with h to form ho2 and h2o2 eqs 6 8 that are capable to degrade mb eqs 7 9 besides the strong adsorption of mb on nsg c3n4 could be attributed to strong π π interaction between mb and nsg c3n4 that causes mb and solid photocatalyst to be strongly held together fundamentally mb is a cationic dye molecule in nature and evidence from ftir spectra fig 7 shows that nsg c3n4 has unique properties of delocalised π electrons in the s heptazine ring and it also consists of terminal n atom with lone pair of electrons therefore the strong interaction at solid dye interface is due to cationic columbic interaction of mb and nsg c3n4 41 langmuir hinshelwood model is widely applied for analysis of photocatalytic degradation kinetics of pollutant in aqueous phase 42 43 to describe the photodegradation kinetics of mb langmuir hinshelwood model as expressed in the following eq 10 was employed 10 r o d c d t k k c 1 k c where ro is the initial rate of reaction mg l min c is the concentration of pollutant mg l t is the reaction time min k is the langmuir hinshelwood reaction rate constant mg l min and k is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant l mg at a relatively weak adsorption or at a diluted concentration of pollutant eq 10 could be assumed and simplified to be pseudofirst order kinetics model as shown in eq 11 this equation was further integrated between the limits c co at t 0 c ce at t and c ct at t t to obtain a new expression in eq 12 11 r o d c d t k k c k a p p c 12 c t c o c e e x p k a p p t c e where kapp is the apparent rate constant min 1 co is the initial concentration of pollutant and ce and ct are the concentrations of pollutant at equilibrium and at respective contact time respectively the experimental data for photodegradation of mb in aqueous solution were fitted to the nonlinearised pseudo first order kinetic model as shown in fig 8a and b rearranging eq 11 and eq 12 yields the nonlinearised pseudo first order kinetic model eq 13 13 r r e 1 e x p k a p p t where r mb removal and r e c o c e c o 100 is the percentage of mb removal at equilibrium based on the fitted nonlinearised pseudo first order model the apparent rate constant kapp min 1 can be determined quantitively all the parameters for pseudo first order kinetic models obtained are shown in table 2 the nsg c3n4 exhibited the fastest reaction at with the apparent rate constant kapp of 0 0202 min 1 compared to photolysis and bg c3n4 at 0 0037 and 0 0166 min 1 respectively the re values obtained for bg c3n4 74 49 and nsg c3n4 82 04 are approximately close to the experimental data at 300 min indicating that mb photodegradation process reached the equilibrium the powder g c3n4 was separated using 10 min centrifugation at 3000 rpm before measuring the absorbance of the solution since both bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 are fine powder that dispersed well in the mb solution knowing that it is inconvenient for the practical application of mb removal a liquid permeable self supporting nanofibre with embedded g c3n4 photocatalysts that can be handled manually was produced in this study this form of photocatalyst is effective to recover catalyst from a treated solution compared to a dispersed powder sample fig 8b compares the degradation of mb by nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 as well as bare pan nanofibres the results demonstrate that nfnsg c3n4 performed the highest degradation of mb at 97 3 after 300 min this excellent degradation resulted from the synergetic effects of adsorption by pan nanofibres and degradation by nsg c3n4 embedded in pan nanofibres the lower band gap with less electron recombination than nfbg c3n4 allowed nfnsg c3n4 to effectively degrade mb with high removal owing to the high surface area both g c3n4 nanofibres provided more photocatalytic active sites and produced more hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radical anions to improve the degradation of mb compared to the powder g c3n4 this finding correlates with the statement that efficiency of dye degradation depends on the particle size and morphology of the photocatalyst 44 the result also confirms that g c3n4 embedded in pan nanofibres showed sufficient photocatalytic activity similar with the result showed by g c3n4 that directly dispersed in a suspension solution meanwhile 65 5 of mb was adsorbed using bare pan nanofibres after 300 min mainly attributed by the adsorption action by the pan nanofibres although in real photocatalysis process 300 min of photodegradation would take a longer time to complete and achieve 97 3 removal of mb the prepared nfnsg c3n4 showed a decent removal at 90 after 120 min of photodegradation process compared to previous studies in comparison the mb photodegradation using g c3n4 photocatalysts only obtained 62 6 of mb removal after 120 min 45 meanwhile in another study the mb removal with g c3n4 was found at 70 after 120 min of photodegradation under visible light irradiation 46 although without the embedment of g c3n4 in pan nanofibres the removal of mb gradually increased most probably not because of photodegradation but due to the adsorption of mb molecules into pan nanofibres however pan nanofibres can only assist in adsorption process of mb pan nanofibres without g c3n4 is not useful for mb removal because it can finally lose adsorption capacity due to saturation photodegradation by g c3n4 has a role in insitu removal of adsorbed mb by chemical decomposition which is useful for continuous mb removal operation moreover pan polymer does not have photodegradation ability because it has no optical absorption at visible wavelength range with respect to microstructures of nanofibre mats that have a network of highly well interconnected open pore with the size of several micrometres the mb molecules were likely to be small enough to permeate in the nanofibre mat moreover the mb molecules could sometimes collide with pan nanofibres and eventually adsorbed in the nanofibre due to favourable affinity of mb molecules to pan polymers during electrospinning process to produce pan nanofibres large free volume between polymer chains of pan was plausibly developed because of the rapid evaporation of solvent that caused polymer conformation to be frozen in nonequilibrium state 47 48 moreover freeman and yampollskii 49 also mentioned that diffusion rates of small molecules increase with excess free volume of a polymer matrix therefore the small diameter and excess volume in nanofibre potentially facilitate rapid molecular diffusion of mb molecules in the whole surface of nanofibres according to samitsu et al 50 the excess volume also enhanced the absorption due to langmuir type adsorption site of mb molecules alias et al 28 also reported that pan nanofibres revealed excellent oil adsorption capability of nanofibres by increasing the concentration of oil species more than 300 times based on the nonlinearised pseudo first order kinetic model fittings nfnsg c3n4 showed the fastest reaction with the apparent rate constant kapp of 0 0424 min 1 compared to bare pan nanofibre and nfbg c3n4 at 0 0145 and 0 0269 min 1 respectively meanwhile the re values obtained for bare pan nanofibre 61 99 nfbg c3n4 87 82 and nfnsg c3n4 94 40 only differ less than 5 from the experimental data at 300 min demonstrating that all the photodegradation reactions reached equilibrium before 300 min the overall findings prove that g c3n4 embedded pan nanofibres can be considered as a potential candidate for dye removal with significant removal efficiency the photocatalytic activity and removal efficiency of g c3n4 and nanofibres increased in the order of bg c3n4 nsg c3n4 nfbg c3n4 nfnsg c3n4 the summary for the degradation of mb under visible light irradiations and parameters for pseudo first order kinetic model of the as prepared samples is presented in table 2 also the comparison on the reported literature relating on the photodegradation of methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb under visible light irradiation using various g c3n4 and nanofibres photocatalysts is presented in table 3 4 conclusions a green facile synthesis of urea formed graphitic carbon nitride bg c3n4 photocatalyst and further liquid exfoliation done on g c3n4 successfully transformed bg c3n4 into nanosheet graphitic carbon nitride nsg c3n4 without any chemical reaction involved the g c3n4 photocatalysts were embedded into pan nanofibres using electrospinning technique and formed nonwoven nanofibre mats that have excellent features such as high specific surface area nodules nanofibres shape and self supported sheet which is easy to handle manually g c3n4 and nanofibres can photodegrade mb species under visible light irradiation the degradation of mb was found at 77 6 using bg c3n4 and the degradation improved to 85 1 using nsg c3n4 the pan nanofibre was found to effectively adsorb mb species inside the nanofibres most notably the nsg c3n4 incorporated into nanofibres exhibited mb degradation of 97 3 under visible light irradiation which is the highest value recorded in this study the synergetic effects of concentration and degradation of mb species are the important factors for high photodegradation efficiency of mb suggesting that nfnsg c3n4 can be a better option for the treatment application of wastewater containing mb

14180,effective capture and in situ photodegradation of methylene blue mb dye is a promising technique to purify wastewater containing mb with recently elicited ripples of discovery on graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 this study investigates the performance of g c3n4 on photodegradation of mb in this study polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibres embedded with g c3n4 photocatalyst was successfully prepared using electrospinning technique which produced liquid permeable self supporting photocatalytic nanofibre mats that can be handled easily different configurations of g c3n4 were synthesised bulk g c3n4 bg c3n4 and nanosheets g c3n4 nsg c3n4 from urea using a green facile template free method effective photocatalytic activity of the g c3n4 nanofibres was confirmed by 97 3 degradation of mb under visible light irradiation photodegradation of mb in aqueous solution by g c3n4 nanofibres predominantly attributed to the synergetic effects of mb adsorption by pan nanofibres and photocatalytic degradation of mb by g c3n4 photocatalyst this present work not only presents the simplest ecofriendly and economical approach to fabricate g c3n4 nanofibre photocatalyst but also paves new opportunities for this advanced photocatalyst as great potential in environmental remediation for treatment of industrial mb wastewater keywords adsorption photocatalytic degradation graphitic carbon nitride nanofibres wastewater 1 introduction graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is one of the oldest material described in the chemical literature which has recently experienced renaissance as highly active photocatalyst previously 1 2 mentioned that historically in 1830s berzelius and liebig have reported on the general formula of carbon nitride family as c3n3h n which traced in embryonic form melon a linear polymer consisting of interconnected tri s triazines via secondary nitrogen meanwhile g c3n4 in the form of 2d sheets consisting of tri triazines interconnected via tertiary amines previous breakthrough studies have revealed several intrinsic features of g c3n4 previous breakthrough studies have revealed several intrinsic features of g c3n4 being a metal free heterogeneous catalyst with simple constitution elements of c n and residual hydrogen in defects the g c3n4 is able to renders the materials nontoxic and biocompatible for some applications 3 in addition g c3n4 shows onset on bandgap adsorption around 420 nm and exhibit strong blue photoluminescence at range of 430 550 nm at room temperature most importantly g c3n4 owns a band gap of 2 7 ev that suitable as visible light active photoresponse photocatalyst with conductive band cb of 1 1 ev and valence band vb of 1 6 ev respectively and normal hydrogen electrodes nhes as reference 4 with remarkable discovery on g c3n4 that owns appealing electronic band gap extraordinary physicochemical stability facile synthesis and earth abundant nature 5 7 this study investigated the photodegradation capability of g c3n4 on methylene blue mb in aqueous based on our previous works the synthesised bulk g c3n4 bg c3n4 was obtained as agglomerated powder 8 thus with reduced in effective surface area it suffers from narrow visible light absorption range and high recombination probability of photogenerated charge carriers and finally limits its photocatalytic activity 9 therefore to achieve high photocatalytic activity to irradiation nanosheets graphitic carbon nitride nsg c3n4 was synthesised from bg c3n4 using liquid exfoliation method 10 moreover basic requirement to design and operate separation process requires a separation material that is easy to be handled therefore electrospinning technique was employed in this study to fabricate a specific shaped of g c3n4 with high surface area made from polymer nanofibres composite this technique can effectively dispersed nanoparticles photocatalyst into polymer based nanofibres 11 12 recently study by 13 14 have reported that addition of other materials through facile blending have improved the properties of polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibres to generate composite nanofibres with synergistic properties in this work g c3n4 was dispersed into pan spinning solution to produce nonwoven mat of pan nanofibres embedded with g c3n4 previous literature only reported on photodegradation of mb contaminant using g c3n4 powder photocatalyst but none has reported by using nsg c3n4 embedded pan nanofibres dyeing industries particularly textile industries utilise colour and massive amount of water during production operations 15 there are several groups of dye such as basic acidic diazo azo metal based dyes and anthraquinone based which pose a threat to environment and public health 16 20 therefore decolorization and detoxification of dye containing wastewater need to be conducted before discharging the wastewater into natural water bodies 21 23 physical and chemical methods including adsorption membrane separation precipitation and coalescence have conventionally been developed to treat mb from water and wastewater 18 24 however these methods only decrease the pollutant dye concentration in water and a non destructive process a substantial amount of research for the treatment and management on large amount of textile effluents such as methylene blue mb dye has rapidly been conducted to minimise its impact towards the environment 25 26 furthermore removal of mb dye does not only become an important but challenging area of research for wastewater treatment therefore the superior surface area and promising electronic properties rendered by the nanofibres embedded g c3n4 is expected to improve the photocatalytic performance through synergetic effects of mb adsorption in nanofibre polymer matrix and in situ photodegradation as such electrospun g c3n4 nanofibres could be an alternatively feasible candidate for both adsorption and photocatalysis for dye wastewater treatment 2 experimental 2 1 materials the g c3n4 powders were synthesised using urea ar grade and isopropanol ipa purchased from qrec malaysia dimethylformamide dmf rci labscan and polyacrylonitrile pan 150 000 g mol sigma aldrich were used as a solvent and polymer binder respectively for the electrospinning dope solution methylene blue mb reag ph eur used in photocatalytic measurement was supplied by sigma aldrich fig 1 illustrates the structure of mb in this work all the analytical reagent and chemicals were used without further purification the reverse osmosis ro water used was from millipore astm type iii 2 2 sample preparation a green facile template free method was employed to synthesise g c3n4 powder as reported in our previous work 28 29 ten grams of urea powder was calcined at 500 c at ambient atmosphere in an ashing furnace aaf 1100 carbolite for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 c min the as synthesised bulk graphitic carbon nitride bg c3n4 powder in pale yellow was obtained and ground using a mortar a sonication assisted liquid exfoliation method was used to treat bg c3n4 further to synthesise nanosheets graphitic carbon nitride nsg c3n4 a total of 100 mg bg c3n4 powder was mixed with 100 ml of ipa as a dispersion solvent and further sonicated for 10 h the solution was dried overnight in an oven at 80 c to obtain light yellow powder denoted as nsg c3n4 the electrospinning of dope solution was prepared using a method reported in a previous study 28 a quantity of g c3n4 was mixed with dmf before the solution was sonicated using an ultrasonicator delta ultrasonic dc150 h for 5 h at 40 khz next 90 wt of pan powder was added into the mixture before it was sonicated homogenously for another 5 h to fabricate pan nanofibres containing g c3n4 a nanofibres electrospinning unit progene link sdn bhd nf 1000 was employed and the experimental setup was illustrated in fig 2 a a 10 ml hypodermic syringe that was connected with a blunt tip metallic needle was filled with electrospinning dope solution and placed inside the electrospinning chamber where the flow rate of a syringe pump was set at 1 ml h the applied voltage for the electrospinning unit was set at 15 kv and the tip to collector distance was set at 18 cm the dope solution was electrospun on an aluminium collector and was peeled off manually after the electrospinning completed the resulted nanofibres comprising bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 were named as bulk graphitic carbon nitride nanofibres nfbg c3n4 and nanosheets graphitic carbon nitride nanofibres nfnsg c3n4 respectively 2 3 characterisation the surface morphology of the samples was observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem hitachi high tech co hitachi su8020 the mean nanofibres diameter was analysed using gaussian function approximation by origin software transmission electron microscopy was performed using hr tem hitachi high tech co hitachi ht7700 under 120 kv voltage acceleration nitrogen adsorption desorption measurement at 196 c was performed using an automatic gas adsorption instrument bel japan belsorp max brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh methods were used to obtain the specific surface area sbet and pore size distributions of the samples respectively the chemical structures of the samples were characterised using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir jasco inc ft ir 6100 with absorbance configuration uv visible nir spectrophotometer shidmadzu co uv 3101pc was used to record the absorption spectra of the g c3n4 the obtained reflectance values were converted to absorbance based on kubelka munk function equation photoluminescence analysis jasco inc fp 6500 was employed to record the photoluminescence spectra of the g c3n4 the g c3n4 were excited under illumination at 360 nm and the emission spectra were recorded from 350 to 750 nm including the peak wavelength of the excitation light software provided by jasco inc was used to calculate the photoluminescence efficiency 2 4 photocatalysis measurement an aqueous solution of methylene blue mb was freshly prepared at 10 ppm fig 2b shows the suspension mode photocatalytic reactor that was used to conduct all the photocatalytic measurements a 450 ml beaker containing suspension solution was placed inside the photocatalytic reactor at 15 cm distance from the source of light a suspension solution was prepared by adding 0 20 g of photocatalyst in 200 ml of mb solution during photocatalytic activity a white light emitting diode led lamp 30 w was used as a source of visible light with a wavelength region of 420 nm air bubbles were continuously supplied using an air diffuser to ensure adequate supply of oxygen to the reaction the suspension solution was stirred for 60 min in the dark to ensure adsorption equilibrium before irradiation at every 30 min interval during irradiation 5 ml of suspension was collected to measure the absorbance using uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr5000 the mb concentration was determined based on the absorbance value of mb recorded at 662 nm the photocatalytic activity is expressed in the percentage mb removal according to eq 1 1 mb removal efficiency c o c t c o 100 where co is the initial absorbance of the suspension solution and ct is the absorbance at time of 0 300 min is 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of g c3n4 powders and g c3n4 pan nanofibres fig 3 shows the sem and tem images of the as synthesised bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 it can be clearly seen that bg c3n4 is a porous particle with a pore size of approximately 0 1 2 μm fig 3a the tem images confirm the porous structure of bg c3n4 based on its edge regions which exhibit a relatively dark brightness fig 3b the formation of this porous structure was due to decomposition of urea which generated gas bubbles during thermal treatment the existence of this porous structure is favourable as it facilitates high surface area and accommodates numerous channels to enable mass diffusion to enhance separation processes 2 meanwhile the sem image of nsg c3n4 presented in fig 3c shows a flower like structure of thin graphitic nanosheet layers embedded in open pores in addition two dimensional 2d layers of g c3n4 with laminar morphology like silk veil that nearly transparent than bg c3n4 is presented in the tem images of nsg c3n4 fig 3d thus these findings prove that sonication assisted liquid exfoliation performed on bg c3n4 successfully exfoliated its bulk structure to form nsg c3n4 polymer nanofibre was embedded with g c3n4 using electrospinning to produce g c3n4 pan nanofibre mats with high surface area and easy to handle manually pan polymer was selected as a polymer matrix for nanofibres because it has no optical absorbance in visible light region furthermore owing a similar molecular structure with that of g c3n4 pan polymer is favourable for dispersion and miscibility with g c3n4 electrospinning technique successfully generated nanofibers containing g c3n4 powder as shown in the sem images in fig 4 a and b for nfng c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 respectively interestingly the electrospun nanofibre mats have a network of a highly well interconnected open pore structure in several micrometre size furthermore the noduleless structure of nanofibres formed indicates a uniform distribution of g c3n4 along the pan nanofibres surface the electrospun fibre formed was also straight with an average diameter in nanometre size the mean nanofibre diameters for nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 were also examined using digital imaging analysis of the sem images where the mean nanofibre diameters for nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 were 207 2 and 262 6 nm respectively in comparison to smooth straight shape of pan nanofibres nfbg c3n4 have numerous lumps on the smooth nanofibres shape these spherical lumps with a few micrometre size corresponded to the bulky shape of bg c3n4 embedded in the nanofibres in contrast due to the successful exfoliation of bulky bg c3n4 to form thin nanosheets of nsg c3n4 nfnsg c3n4 had less numbers of thin lumps compared to nfbg c3n4 indicating that nsg c3n4 were uniformly distributed along the pan nanofibres surface 28 29 these uniform smooth and straight in infinite length structure of nfnsg c3n4 produced a slightly higher mean nanofibre diameter of nfnsg c3n4 compared to nfbg c3n4 table 1 summarises the results of sbet total pore volume and mean pore diameter of bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 measured via nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms the sbet of bg c3n4 is 41 3 m2 g which is slightly higher than that of nsg c3n4 36 7 m2 g most likely the lower sbet after exfoliation might be due to the lower recovery of g c3n4 layer restacking during the drying process of nsg c3n4 however after exfoliation the total pore volume and mean pore diameter of g c3n4 increased thus enhancement in pore volume and size improved the characteristic for nsg c3n4 for better adsorption properties fig 5 presents the ftir spectra of bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 the typical peaks of the spectra obtained were consistent with those of g c3n4 reported elsewhere 30 31 generally the obtained spectra of nsg c3n4 matched the spectra of bg c3n4 indicating similar chemical structures and confirming that the exfoliation process did not involve any reaction the sharp band at 810 cm 1 corresponds to the condensed cn heterocycles which originated from breathing of the tri s triazine units ring the absorption bands at 1568 and 1630 cm 1 correspond to the cn stretching while the three bands around 1253 1326 and 1417 cm 1 are attributed to the cn stretching the peaks at 900 1800 cm 1 are mainly attributed to the aromatic cn heterocycles which contain either trigonal n c 3 as fully condensed or bridging cnhc units as partially condensed 30 32 meanwhile under broad shoulder of 3000 3500 cm 1 the two weak peaks at 3176 and 3329 cm 1 correspond to the stretching modes of uncondensed amine groups nh2 or nh overall these ftir results suggest that g c3n4 units mainly consist of various chemical bonds made from c and n atoms such as cn bond cn bond n c 3 and cnhc bridges the electronic structures of bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 are presented by uv vis absorption shown in fig 6 comparing the two g c3n4 fig 6a the diffuse reflectance spectra of nsg c3n4 exhibited a red shift of absorption wavelength the increase in red shift of 10 nm absorption under visible light region promoted the generation of more electron hole pairs under sunlight irradiation thus improving the photocatalytic activity of nsg c3n4 33 the kubelka munk function was used to estimate the band gap energy of the samples by plotting αhυ 2 versus hυ where α is the absorption coefficient and hυ is the photon energy 34 based on the intercept of the tangent plot it is estimated that the band gap energies were 2 72 and 2 68 ev for bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 respectively fig 6b therefore the resulted red shift in absorption spectra was attributed by the band gap energy narrowing of 0 04 ev which certainly suggests that the exfoliation of bg c3n4 affected the electronic properties of g c3n4 it is well acknowledged that photoluminescence pl emission originates from electron recombination 35 therefore pl intensity was used to reflect the photocatalyst separation efficiency to assess the catalytic function the pl spectra of g c3n4 comprise a broad peak at 400 650 nm with the peak maximum observed at 448 nm fig 6c the shape of pl spectra for bg c3n4 is almost same with that for nsg c3n4 however the peak intensity of nsg c3n4 is much smaller than that of bg c3n4 based on integral sphere assembly pl quantum efficiency of the g c3n4 samples was quantitatively determined and the efficiency of nsg c3n4 was 1 0 which is one third of that of bg c3n4 3 1 these promising results prove that nsg c3n4 has higher photocatalytic activity due to the disturbance of electron hole recombination from nitrogen adsorption measurement the sbet values of nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 were 15 4 and 13 3 m2 g respectively the sbet values of nanofibres were much smaller compared to that of g c3n4 most likely the sbet values of nanofibres were only contributed by the outer surface of pan nanofibres not by g c3n4 embedded into the pan matrix therefore to verify these hypotheses we calculated the geometric surface area of nanofibres using eq 2 where a is the area of the nanofibres v is the volume ρ is the density of pan d is the diameter of the nanofibres l is the length and s is the specific surface area 2 s a ρ v π d l ρ π d 2 4 l 4 ρ d by using the values of sbet 15 4 m2 g for bg c3n4 and 13 3 m2 g for nsg c3n4 and ρ of 1 18 g cm3 36 the calculated average diameter of nanofibre was 220 nm for bg c3n4 and 255 nm for nsg c3n4 these calculated diameters are similar with the mean diameter obtained from the digital image analysis of the sem images therefore this evidence suggests that the sbet value only represents the surface area of nanofibres surface but not the porous structure of g c3n4 this finding is possibly due to the porous g c3n4 encapsulated in the matrix of pan polymer meanwhile the total pore volumes of nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 were much lower than that of g c3n4 which is attributed to the less dense stacking of nanofibres to form nanopores which were accessible by a gas adsorption measurement pore size smaller than 200 nm the ftir spectra of nfbg c3n4 nfnsg c3n4 and pan nanofibres are shown in fig 7 the characteristic peaks of pan exist in both nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 spectra such as the stretching vibration of nitrile group cn at 2242 cm 1 and the stretching vibration and bending vibration of methylene ch2 at 2936 and 1453 cm 1 37 the weight ratio of pan to g c3n4 of 10 1 explains that the nanofibres were mostly made of the pan polymer matrix other than the peaks of pan the characteristic peaks of g c3n4 were found at 810 cm 1 aromatic cn heterocycles 1243 and 1320 cm 1 cn stretching 1563 cm 1 and 1621 cm 1 cn stretching and 3000 3380 cm 1 amine groups nh2 or nh which confirm that g c3n4 was successfully embedded into the pan polymer matrix these electrospun nanofibres nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 have the excellent features of large surface area and defined open pores which could facilitate mass diffusion and rapid adsorption of targeted pollutant molecules furthermore uniform dispersion of g c3n4 embedded into the pan polymer matrix would help to promote vast numbers of active sites for effective interactions between the reactant and photocatalyst and finally improves the photocatalytic activity 3 2 photodegradation of methylene blue mb the removal efficiency of mb was investigated using mb solution with the initial concentration of 10 ppm the removal efficiency of mb was measured based on adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of mb solution before irradiation the mixture of mb and photocatalyst was stirred for 60 min in the dark to achieve adsorption equilibrium and to make sure that adsorption reading does not interfere with the reading of photocatalytic degradation of mb therefore when the suspension of photocatalyst and mb solution was irradiated with light the removal of mb is specifically referred to the photocatalytic degradation the photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 on mb was observed under visible light irradiation λ 420 nm fig 8 a shows the photodegradation removal of mb with the presence of bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 powder under visible light for 300 min with samples collected at an interval of 30 min photolysis was conducted to evaluate the stability of mb solution under visible light irradiation without the presence of photocatalyst the direct decomposition of mb in the absence of photocatalyst was not detected about 23 9 of mb was decomposed under visible light illumination after 300 min without the presence of photocatalyst in general the rapid increase in degradation just after visible light was activated indicates the effective photodegradation by g c3n4 the incorporation of bg c3n4 decreased 10 of te mb concentration under dark condition which indicates that bg c3n4 can adsorb the mb due to porous structure the bg c3n4 illuminated with visible light effectively decomposed 77 6 of mb after 300 min the result reveals photocatalytic activity of bg c3n4 under visible light illumination the degradation of mb by nsg c3n4 was 85 1 which is higher than that by bg c3n4 that might be due to the narrowed band gap and improved photoresponse of nsg c3n4 implying better photocatalytic activity on mb the obtained nsg c3n4 changed in colour from light yellow bg c3n4 to brown yellow corresponding to the expanded adsorption in visible light region 38 thus narrowed the band gap and improved light absorbance that is useful for photocatalytic performance moreover the higher adsorption capacity and photocatalytic degradation efficiency of nsg c3n4 may originate from a well dispersed nsg c3n4 in mb aqueous solution by electrostatic repulsive interaction 30 the photocatalytic degradation of mb might be due to the absorption of photon energy by nsg c3n4 that caused electron excitation from valence band vb to conduction band cb leaving the positive holes at vb according to 39 nsg c3n4 was unable to generate hydroxyl radicals oh for mb degradation due to less positive vb position of nsg c3n4 compared to the standard redox potential oh oh 1 99 ev nevertheless the high oxidative potential of photogenerated holes at vb of nsg c3n4 enables simultaneous direct oxidation and degradation of mb 40 therefore the possible mechanism for photodegradation of mb could be proposed as follows 39 absorption of efficient photons hv eg 2 68 ev by nsg c3n4 eq 3 direct oxidation of mb is possible due to the high oxidation potential of the hole h v b on nsg c3n4 eq 4 3 n s g c 3 n 4 h v n s g c 3 n 4 e c b h v b 4 h v b m b d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t in contrast cb position of nsg c3n4 is more negative than the reduction potential o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe as reported by 39 therefore molecular oxygen o2 can be reduced to superoxide radicals o2 by photogenerated electron of nsg c3n4 ecb eq 5 5 e c b o 2 o 2 6 o 2 h h o 2 7 h o 2 m b d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t 8 o 2 2 h e c b h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 m b d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t the produce superoxide radicals o2 might also react with h to form ho2 and h2o2 eqs 6 8 that are capable to degrade mb eqs 7 9 besides the strong adsorption of mb on nsg c3n4 could be attributed to strong π π interaction between mb and nsg c3n4 that causes mb and solid photocatalyst to be strongly held together fundamentally mb is a cationic dye molecule in nature and evidence from ftir spectra fig 7 shows that nsg c3n4 has unique properties of delocalised π electrons in the s heptazine ring and it also consists of terminal n atom with lone pair of electrons therefore the strong interaction at solid dye interface is due to cationic columbic interaction of mb and nsg c3n4 41 langmuir hinshelwood model is widely applied for analysis of photocatalytic degradation kinetics of pollutant in aqueous phase 42 43 to describe the photodegradation kinetics of mb langmuir hinshelwood model as expressed in the following eq 10 was employed 10 r o d c d t k k c 1 k c where ro is the initial rate of reaction mg l min c is the concentration of pollutant mg l t is the reaction time min k is the langmuir hinshelwood reaction rate constant mg l min and k is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant l mg at a relatively weak adsorption or at a diluted concentration of pollutant eq 10 could be assumed and simplified to be pseudofirst order kinetics model as shown in eq 11 this equation was further integrated between the limits c co at t 0 c ce at t and c ct at t t to obtain a new expression in eq 12 11 r o d c d t k k c k a p p c 12 c t c o c e e x p k a p p t c e where kapp is the apparent rate constant min 1 co is the initial concentration of pollutant and ce and ct are the concentrations of pollutant at equilibrium and at respective contact time respectively the experimental data for photodegradation of mb in aqueous solution were fitted to the nonlinearised pseudo first order kinetic model as shown in fig 8a and b rearranging eq 11 and eq 12 yields the nonlinearised pseudo first order kinetic model eq 13 13 r r e 1 e x p k a p p t where r mb removal and r e c o c e c o 100 is the percentage of mb removal at equilibrium based on the fitted nonlinearised pseudo first order model the apparent rate constant kapp min 1 can be determined quantitively all the parameters for pseudo first order kinetic models obtained are shown in table 2 the nsg c3n4 exhibited the fastest reaction at with the apparent rate constant kapp of 0 0202 min 1 compared to photolysis and bg c3n4 at 0 0037 and 0 0166 min 1 respectively the re values obtained for bg c3n4 74 49 and nsg c3n4 82 04 are approximately close to the experimental data at 300 min indicating that mb photodegradation process reached the equilibrium the powder g c3n4 was separated using 10 min centrifugation at 3000 rpm before measuring the absorbance of the solution since both bg c3n4 and nsg c3n4 are fine powder that dispersed well in the mb solution knowing that it is inconvenient for the practical application of mb removal a liquid permeable self supporting nanofibre with embedded g c3n4 photocatalysts that can be handled manually was produced in this study this form of photocatalyst is effective to recover catalyst from a treated solution compared to a dispersed powder sample fig 8b compares the degradation of mb by nfbg c3n4 and nfnsg c3n4 as well as bare pan nanofibres the results demonstrate that nfnsg c3n4 performed the highest degradation of mb at 97 3 after 300 min this excellent degradation resulted from the synergetic effects of adsorption by pan nanofibres and degradation by nsg c3n4 embedded in pan nanofibres the lower band gap with less electron recombination than nfbg c3n4 allowed nfnsg c3n4 to effectively degrade mb with high removal owing to the high surface area both g c3n4 nanofibres provided more photocatalytic active sites and produced more hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radical anions to improve the degradation of mb compared to the powder g c3n4 this finding correlates with the statement that efficiency of dye degradation depends on the particle size and morphology of the photocatalyst 44 the result also confirms that g c3n4 embedded in pan nanofibres showed sufficient photocatalytic activity similar with the result showed by g c3n4 that directly dispersed in a suspension solution meanwhile 65 5 of mb was adsorbed using bare pan nanofibres after 300 min mainly attributed by the adsorption action by the pan nanofibres although in real photocatalysis process 300 min of photodegradation would take a longer time to complete and achieve 97 3 removal of mb the prepared nfnsg c3n4 showed a decent removal at 90 after 120 min of photodegradation process compared to previous studies in comparison the mb photodegradation using g c3n4 photocatalysts only obtained 62 6 of mb removal after 120 min 45 meanwhile in another study the mb removal with g c3n4 was found at 70 after 120 min of photodegradation under visible light irradiation 46 although without the embedment of g c3n4 in pan nanofibres the removal of mb gradually increased most probably not because of photodegradation but due to the adsorption of mb molecules into pan nanofibres however pan nanofibres can only assist in adsorption process of mb pan nanofibres without g c3n4 is not useful for mb removal because it can finally lose adsorption capacity due to saturation photodegradation by g c3n4 has a role in insitu removal of adsorbed mb by chemical decomposition which is useful for continuous mb removal operation moreover pan polymer does not have photodegradation ability because it has no optical absorption at visible wavelength range with respect to microstructures of nanofibre mats that have a network of highly well interconnected open pore with the size of several micrometres the mb molecules were likely to be small enough to permeate in the nanofibre mat moreover the mb molecules could sometimes collide with pan nanofibres and eventually adsorbed in the nanofibre due to favourable affinity of mb molecules to pan polymers during electrospinning process to produce pan nanofibres large free volume between polymer chains of pan was plausibly developed because of the rapid evaporation of solvent that caused polymer conformation to be frozen in nonequilibrium state 47 48 moreover freeman and yampollskii 49 also mentioned that diffusion rates of small molecules increase with excess free volume of a polymer matrix therefore the small diameter and excess volume in nanofibre potentially facilitate rapid molecular diffusion of mb molecules in the whole surface of nanofibres according to samitsu et al 50 the excess volume also enhanced the absorption due to langmuir type adsorption site of mb molecules alias et al 28 also reported that pan nanofibres revealed excellent oil adsorption capability of nanofibres by increasing the concentration of oil species more than 300 times based on the nonlinearised pseudo first order kinetic model fittings nfnsg c3n4 showed the fastest reaction with the apparent rate constant kapp of 0 0424 min 1 compared to bare pan nanofibre and nfbg c3n4 at 0 0145 and 0 0269 min 1 respectively meanwhile the re values obtained for bare pan nanofibre 61 99 nfbg c3n4 87 82 and nfnsg c3n4 94 40 only differ less than 5 from the experimental data at 300 min demonstrating that all the photodegradation reactions reached equilibrium before 300 min the overall findings prove that g c3n4 embedded pan nanofibres can be considered as a potential candidate for dye removal with significant removal efficiency the photocatalytic activity and removal efficiency of g c3n4 and nanofibres increased in the order of bg c3n4 nsg c3n4 nfbg c3n4 nfnsg c3n4 the summary for the degradation of mb under visible light irradiations and parameters for pseudo first order kinetic model of the as prepared samples is presented in table 2 also the comparison on the reported literature relating on the photodegradation of methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb under visible light irradiation using various g c3n4 and nanofibres photocatalysts is presented in table 3 4 conclusions a green facile synthesis of urea formed graphitic carbon nitride bg c3n4 photocatalyst and further liquid exfoliation done on g c3n4 successfully transformed bg c3n4 into nanosheet graphitic carbon nitride nsg c3n4 without any chemical reaction involved the g c3n4 photocatalysts were embedded into pan nanofibres using electrospinning technique and formed nonwoven nanofibre mats that have excellent features such as high specific surface area nodules nanofibres shape and self supported sheet which is easy to handle manually g c3n4 and nanofibres can photodegrade mb species under visible light irradiation the degradation of mb was found at 77 6 using bg c3n4 and the degradation improved to 85 1 using nsg c3n4 the pan nanofibre was found to effectively adsorb mb species inside the nanofibres most notably the nsg c3n4

14181,the availability of safe drinking water is an important issue in developing countries and remote areas where clean drinking water cannot be fully accessed in this study a low cost porous ceramic disk filter pcdf functionalized with fe tio2 nano composites was used to remove e coli from water the production of pcdfs coated with fe tio2 nano composites was optimized in terms of mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide in fe tio2 nano composites coated weight and rice husk ratio using response surface methodology the rice husk ratio had a great influence on the filtration rate pcdfs had micro pores that could trap most e coli fe tio2 nano composites could take advantage of the dual roles of nano tio2 and fe to play a synergistic bactericidal effect on the removal of e coli during the operation of modified pcdfs the concentration of e coli and the light conditions were very important this study provided a theoretical support for exploring the ceramic disk filter modification and bacteria reduction using pcdfs impregnated with fe tio2 nano composites the results can help find a cost effective and safe solution for solving drinking water problems in rural and remote areas keywords water safety porous ceramic disk filter e coli removal fe tio2 nano composites process optimization removal mechanism 1 introduction water is one of the substances on which human beings depend and water quality is critical to human health 1 3 as reported by who 844 million people lack the basic drinking water service 4 due to the inappropriate environmental management the drinking water is often contaminated by feces with intestinal pathogens such as escherichia coli e coli resulting in many diseases such as malaria cholera diarrhea and so on 5 8 the problem of safe drinking water is particularly serious in developing countries and remote areas where full access to clean drinking water can hardly be achieved 9 12 for remote and underdeveloped areas the establishment of centralized drinking water treatment facilities faces some challenges such as expensive construction difficult operation and maintenance high requirement for personnel capability 13 therefore more attention is paid to some low cost alternatives with can be easily applied the porous ceramic filter pcf is a solution featured with low price easy operation and good efficiency 14 15 pcf can be made from locally available clay and rice husks with the advantages of low cost the production method is also simple and affordable for remote and rural areas 16 17 at the same time there is no additional energy consumption in its operation pcfs can purify water by using gravity of water as the driving power in general most microorganism and pollutants can be trapped but the effect of physical interception alone is not always satisfactory 18 microorganisms trapped inside the filter can still grow and cause blockages that make the filter less effective the performance of pcf can be improved through certain surface functionalization the pcf with silver coating has been studied before 19 and it was found that the silver addition improved the sterilization effect of pcf 20 however the price of silver is expensive and there is the toxicity concern regarding the potential silver leaching 21 nano tio2 is a kind of semiconductor material with photocatalytic properties and has been observed to have certain bactericidal function 22 nano tio2 can absorb the energy when it gets irradiated by a certain wavelength of light the electrons will jump and generate electron holes to obtain photocatalytic activity so that the oh and h2o can react to produce hydroxyl radicals 23 some studies have shown that the addition of transition metal ions such as fe ag and cu to nano tio2 can increase its photocatalytic activity 24 25 and the photoelectrons generated after photoirradiation can quickly transfer from the nano tio2 to the metal so that the holes are not easy to recombine 26 fe tio2 nano composites also moves the absorption spectrum of nano tio2 to visible light 27 28 indicating photocatalytic reaction is not limited to the ultraviolet radiation condition with the increase of iron addition the antibacterial activity of the composite material shows an increasing trend it is worth noting that nano zero valent iron nano fe0 also contributes to the removal of e coli 29 30 and nano fe0 is used to treat drinking water 31 32 nano fe0 can exert oxidative stress on e coli during which reactive oxygen species can be released 29 meanwhile the iron ions generated by oxidation can also promote the inactivation of e coli 33 fe tio2 nano composites have combined characteristics of nano tio2 and nano fe0 and its integration with pcf for removing e coli is expected to the best of our knowledge no systematic attempt to explore the nano fe tio2 assisted pcf has been conducted and the corresponding antibacterial performance the mechanism is still not clear therefore in the present work the removal of e coli from water using porous ceramic disk filter pcdf coated with fe tio2 nano composites will be studied in detail 1 the fabrication of pcdfs functionalized with fe tio2 nano composites will be optimized in terms of mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide in fe tio2 nano composites coated weight and rice husk ratio using response surface methodology 2 the morphological and crystal structure features of pcdfs will be analyzed 3 the performance and mechanism of using pcdfs coated with fe tio2 nano composites in the removal of e coli will be revealed 4 the impact of e coli concentration in influent and light conditions in the operation of pcdf will be explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals nano tio2 p25 71 29 anatase rutile was obtained from evonik degussa hanau germany e coli has been widely used an effective indicator in antibacterial studies 29 33 the strain of e coli atcc 25922 for experiments was purchased from the luhui technology co shanghai china the rice husk was purchased from jiangsu yancheng grain processing plant yancheng china and clay was obtained from beijing zhida tenghui trading co beijing china and all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher 2 2 e coli cultivation and enumeration the luria bertani lb medium used in this study included 10 g nacl 10 g tryptone 5 g yeast extract per liter deionized water 34 it was sterilized at 121 c for 20 min before use the bacteria liquid was prepared by inoculating e coli in 200 ml of the lb medium and cultured at 37 c for 24 h the bacteria liquid was diluted to a certain concentration and used to prepare for influent the lb agar medium was prepared by adding 2 5 g agar to 100 ml lb culture medium the standard plate count method was used in this study to enumerate the e coli briefly 1 ml sample was dropped into a sterilized plate followed by mixing with 15 ml lb medium after incubating at 37 c for 48 h the quantity of colonies on sterilized plate was enumerated e coli removal efficiency and log10 reduction of e coli lrv were calculated as follows 1 e r c 0 c 1 c 0 100 2 l r v log 10 c 0 c 1 where er is e coli removal efficiency c0 is the influent e coli concentration c1 is the effluent e coli concentration 2 3 fabrication of ceramic disk filters functionalized by fe tio2 nano composites the fe tio2 composite was prepared by chemical reduction using nabh4 35 36 the nano tio2 suspension was prepared by adding 2 g nano tio2 to 40 ml deionized water then the ferrous sulfate solution different volume feso4 7h2o in 10 ml deionized water was added to the nano tio2 suspension and stirred for 30 min after 20 min ultrasonic oscillation the fresh nabh4 was slowly added to this mixture in n2 flow the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 4 min to obtain precipitates the precipitates were washed with ethanol and dried in vacuum oven at 65 c for 24 h to obtain fe tio2 nano composites a porous ceramic disk filter pcdf was made by water mixing clay and rice husk to maintain consistency the rice husk and clay were sieved between 80 200 mesh size 0 075 0 2 mm and 80 mesh size 0 2 mm respectively the mixture was made into a disk by the mould with diameter of 10 cm and the thickness of 1 cm after air dried for 5 days at room temperature the disk was further dried in drying oven at 65 c for 24 h the dry dish was sintered in the electric furnace at 1000 c 2 c min and hold 60 min at the highest temperature a certain amount of fe tio2 nano composites was added into 10 ml deionized water and stirred after 10 min ultrasonic oscillation the obtained suspension liquid was brushed on the surface of pcdf and then the pcdf was dried in vacuum oven response surface methodology rsm combined with box behnken design bbd was used for the optimization of pcdfs decorated by fe tio2 nano composites 37 38 the variables explored were mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide fe tio2 a coated weight b and rice husk ratio c with three levels the detailed design of the bbd was shown in table s1 the low middle and high levels of variables were coded as 1 0 and 1 respectively e coli removal efficiency and filtration rate were used as the responses in the end the highest e coli removal efficiency was taken as the primary optimization condition for formula optimization this was because the e coli removal efficiency could not be guaranteed to meet the standard of drinking water when the filtration rate was large therefore the optimal condition was that the maximum e coli removal efficiency was selected and the filtration rate was higher than 115 ml h by applying bbd the acquired experimental results were fit to the empirical quadratic polynomial model described below 3 y 1 o r y 2 β 0 β 1 a β 2 b β 3 c β 12 a b β 13 a c β 23 b c β 11 a 2 β 22 b 2 β 33 c 2 where y 1 and y 2 are the responses including e coli removal efficiency and filtration rate β 0 is model constant β 1 β 2 and β 3 are linear coefficients β 12 β 13 and β 23 are interactive coefficients β 11 β 22 and β 33 are quadratic coefficients 2 4 filtration system and operation as shown in fig s1 the filtration system is composed of polymethyl methacrylate pmma column porous ceramic disk filter flanges disinfected conical flask and lamp the pcdf was put between two flanges with two shims to prevent leaking the visible light lamp foshan jinhao optoelectronic co ltd foshan china and the full spectrum lamp jingmen guangyu science and technology co ltd jingmen china are used as light sources in this study respectively their emission spectrums are shown in fig s2 uv intensity and visible light intensity were measured by ultraviolet intensity meter shenzhen sanpo instrument co ltd shenzhen china and visible light meter tes electrical electronic co shenzhen china respectively the pcdfs and disinfected conical flasks were used in the filtration experiment after 20 min of high pressure steam sterilization at 121 c and pmma columns and flanges were rinsed with sterile water when filtering each column was covered with opaque black cloth to avoid other light interference 2 5 effect of operating conditions the effects of initial e coli concentration in influent and illumination were studied the e coli concentrations in influent ranged from 10 to 107 cfu ml as for the impact of illumination intensity three factors including darkness a visible light 400 800 nm b and vis uv light 300 800 nm c were investigated with initial e coli concentrations of 105 cfu ml in experiments 200 ml of inflow with e coli was used and effluent was tested after an hour of filtration each experiment was conducted in triple replicates 2 6 analytical methods the fe tio2 nano composites were identified by the scanning electron microscope of jsm 7900 f sem jeol japan and regulus 8100 sem hitachi japan the surface and cross section structures of pcdfs were characterized by the jsm 6510 scanning electron microscope sem jeol japan elemental analysis was performed using energy dispersive spectroscopy of jsm 7001 f with pegasus xm2 eds jeol japan the fe tio2 nano composites and t ceramic disk filter surace were coated by gold under vacuum before observation x ray diffraction xrd results for ceramic disk filters and fe tio2 nano composites were obtained using smart lab xrd rigaku japan and d max 2550 xrd rigaku japan respectively the rsm analysis was conducted using design expert 9 stat ease inc usa the synchrotron based x ray fluorescence xrf spectra and xrf mappings of fe tio2 nano composite distribution on pcdf cross sections were measured at the very sensitive elemental and structural probe employing radiation from a synchrotron vespers beamline canadian light source saskatoon canada the polychromatic x ray pink beam was applied to excite the samples and a four element vortex silicon drift detector was employed to record the emitted xrf spectrum the reported xrf spectrum was obtained from the average of xrf spectra on the selected area the reported xrf spectrum was obtained from the average of xrf spectra on the selected area and the xrf mapping was plotted using sigmaplot 14 0 hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide pi were used for double staining to detect apoptosis of e coli 39 40 meanwhile dcfh da probe was added for reactive oxygen species ros detection 41 and the results were shown after separation by flow cytometer the blank group undecorated pcdfs and the sample group pcdfs decorated by fe tio2 nano composites were compared the sample and blank groups were placed into the beakers with a certain concentration of bacteria solution and radiated by vis uv light the sampling time was set to 0 2 h and 24 h and 10 000 cells were collected each time for detection the values of all types of cells were the average of 3 parallel samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 rsm assisted optimization of the production of ceramic disk filters coated with fe tio2 nano composites bbd is an efficient experimental design method with some advantages such as small number of tests low cost and high efficiency 42 following the experimental design shown in table s1 the empirical quadratic polynomial models of e coli removal efficiency y 1 and filtration rate y 2 were obtained as shown in eqs 4 and 5 a b and c were actual values of variables 4 y 1 99 93 0 50 a 0 40 b 0 98 c 0 12 a b 0 56 a c 0 39

experimental data were consistent with the normal distribution the analysis of variance anova was conducted to get the coefficients of the polynomial equation and the corresponding results are shown in table s2 the f value of 141 94 and p value less than 0 0001 showed the model was significant the high adjust r2 0 988 and predicted r2 0 926 indicated the regression model was credible a b c ac bc a 2 b 2 c 2 were significant model terms which demonstrated these three factors had a great non linear influence on the e coli removal efficiency the effects of three factors on the e coli removal efficiency are displayed in fig s4 it can be saw the increase in mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide fe tio2 a and coated weight b promoted the e coli removal efficiency nevertheless the opposite effect was observed with the increase of rice husk ratio c the higher reliability of the experiment was obtained with low value of cv 0 11 43 the three dimensional surface plots in fig 1 a c illustrates the interactive effects of the significant factors factor c had the most significant influence on the e coli removal efficiency while factors a and b had slightly less influence than c as a pore forming agent the rice husk was heated to form many small holes and irregular channels in pcdfs the increase of rice husk ratio resulted in more channels which could reduce the retention of e coli the mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide could affect their synergy a high coated weight of fe tio2 nano composites induced a high contact probability between e coli cells and fe tio2 nano composites which is favorable for e coli removal of pcdfs for the filtration rate y 2 fig s5 shows the experimental data were consistent with the normal distribution and anova results are shown in table s3 the p value 0 0002 less than 0 05 indicated model terms were significant the high adjust r2 0 928 and predicted r2 0 821 manifested the regression model was credible b c and bc were significant model terms in this case the effects of three factors on the filtration rate are displayed in fig s6 the increase in a and b impeded the increase of filtration rate however the effect of c on filtration rate was not only stimulative but significant on the filtration rate the three dimensional surface plots displayed the interactive effects of the significant factors in fig 1 d f factor c had the most significant influence on the filtration rate and the effect of b was less than c while a had little effect on the filtration rate since the increase of the rice husk resulted in the increase of the channels the amount of rice husk could be the decisive factor in determining filtration rate a high weight of coated nano composites could block some small holes and thus brought some negative effects however the mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide of nano composites mainly influenced the antimicrobial function the optimal conditions for the fabrication of ceramic disk filters functionalized with fe tio2 nano composites were selected to achieve maximal e coli removal efficiency and a medium filtration rate then the optimization results were verified based on the model eqs 4 and 5 the e coli removal efficiency and the filtration rate under such optimal conditions were 100 and 124 ml h respectively in the ceramic disk filters coated with fe tio2 nano composites the mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide the coated weight and rice husk ratio were 3 25 wt 30 mg and 32 33 respectively the corresponding average e coli removal efficiency and filtration rate were 99 99 and 119 3 ml h respectively the data were very close to the modeling results and thus the reliability of model was confirmed 3 2 characterization of porous ceramic disk filters functionalized with fe tio2 nano composites the sem image fig 2 a of the fe tio2 nano composites showed that they were composed of spherical and irregular particles with an average particle size of 23 06 9 67 nm the fe tio2 nano composites were also tested using bse mode of sem regulus 8100 results showed the different contrasts between the particles indicating different compositions of particles among which the lighter ones were iron particles in fig s7 fig s8 and fig 2 d show the eds results of nano tio2 and fe tio2 nano composites respectively the content of iron in the obtained fe tio2 nano composites was 3 43 wt which proved the coexistence of iron and titanium xps was also implemented to further analyze the composition of synthetic fe tio2 nano composites and the results showed that various valence forms of iron and fe0 coexisted fig s9 a according to fig s9 a the peak of carbon impurities appeared at 284 8 ev indicating that carbon impurities existed in the background of xps analysis the peak binding energies at 529 1 530 5 and 531 3 ev were related to ti o in tio2 feooh and fe2o3 respectively 35 44 fig s9 b the peak values of 457 7 ev and 463 6 ev were close to the peak value of ti4 in anatase 28 45 fig 2 g which indicated that the iron in fe tio2 nano composites did not change the main lattice of tio2 due to its low content in fig 2 h 706 2 ev and 711 8 ev were the characteristic peaks of fe0 and feooh respectively 35 and the characteristic peaks of fe3o4 at 710 2 and 723 6 ev caused by oxidation of iron can also be seen indicating that oxidation was unavoidable in the preparation process of fe tio2 nano composites 44 45 the morphologies of pcdfs without and with fe tio2 nano composites are shown in fig 2 b and c the surface of pcdf was uneven with many pores before coating with fe tio2 nano composites fig 2 b and the pore size was about 1 6 μm after coating the surface of pcdf was relatively smooth and the nano composites were evenly distributed as showed in fig 2 c coating fe tio2 nano composites caused the decreasing of pores sizes and the blocking of some small pores this was consistent with the response surface result of filtration rate fig s10 a and b indicate that the characterization of pcdf cross section did not change before and after nano composites coating in other words the nano composites were only attached to the surface of the pcdfs and did not infiltrate into the interior fig s11 and fig 2 e were the eds results of specified areas of the pcdfs before and after modification the main elements of the pcdf were silicon and oxygen as well as a large amount of titanium after modification x ray diffraction tests were performed on the pcdfs before and after coating fe tio2 nano composites to study the crystal structure the results are presented in fig 2 f the pcdf without coating were mainly composed of silicon and oxygen and the crystal structure was mainly quartz after coating the crystal forms of anatase and rutile were added which were dominant in fe tio2 nano composites fig 2 f therefore it could be proved that the fe tio2 nano composites were successfully attached on the surface of pcdf the xrd results of fe tio2 nano composites were also provided in supporting information fig s12 due to the low iron content no sharp peak was detected which was consistent with the result of liu et al 36 and yadav et al 44 synchrotron based x ray analysis is capable to provide a high level of complementary elemental related information for the modified pcdf 46 in order to investigate the stability and durability of fe tio2 nano composite coating on pcdf surface the synchrotron based xrf spectra and xrf mappings of fe concentration distribution on pcdf cross section before and after filtration were measured and the results are shown in fig 3 the horizontal position from right to left represents the cross section from the surface of pcdf to the internal fig 3 a it can be seen that the signal was strongest on the surface while the xrf spectrum fig 3 c showed that the main components were ti and fe this provides another clear evidence for the successful attachment of fe tio2 nano composites on pcdf surface after modification fig 3 b shows the xrf spectrum from the inside part of pcdf and there are only characteristic peaks of fe but no characteristic peak of ti this indicated that the clay used to manufacture pcdf contained a certain amount of fe thus it could be concluded that the fe tio2 nano composites were coated mainly on pcdf surface and did not infiltrate into the cross section during the modification process after the pcdf was applied for filtration the signal area was narrowed to a certain extent fig 3 d which was due to a certain degree of compaction and scouring of the fe tio2 nano composites under the impact of filter water flow the internal iron signal of the used pcdf fig 3 a was slightly higher than that of the unused one fig 3 d which might be due to the fact that a small part of iron became iron ions and entered into the void of the ceramic plate with the water flow but this part of iron was too small to affect the treated water quality surface and internal xrf spectra fig 3 b c and fig 3 e f showed that the main components were iron and titanium indicating that there was no big difference in composition before and after usage 3 3 functions of ceramic disk filters coated with fe tio2 nano composites pcdf coated with fe tio2 nano composites w can retain bacteria and inhibit their growth simultaneously pcdfs could remove e coli through the filtration process when raw water passes through pcdfs irregular pores produced by burning rice husks could retain bacteria considering the removal efficiency our current study showed e coli removal efficiency by unmodified pcdfs can reach as high as 97 at an initial concentration of 105 cfu ml it is similar with the results of some previous studies in which the e coli removal by unmodified ceramic filter could also reach 90 47 48 our study demonstrated fe tio2 modified pcdfs can remove 99 99 of e coli at the same initial concentration indicating the coating effectively enhanced e coli removal efficiency for fe tio2 nano composites the interaction of iron and titanium dioxide made e coli removal better than individual nanomaterials on the one hand the coating of tio2 reduced the oxidation of fe0 to fe2 fe3 due to the high reducibility of fe0 eq 6 28 on the other hand nano tio2 induced photocatalysis when nano tio2 absorbed the energy of the photon under the irradiated state electrons in the valence band jumped to the conduction band and then electron hole pairs formed 49 some electrons from nano tio2 transferred to iron the electron transfer increased the possibility of fe3 and fe2 to fe2 and fe0 eq 7 and 8 respectively that would help prevent the electrons produced from nano tio2 return to the hole and slow down those electron hole recombination 26 36 thus photocatalysis resulted from electron transfer in fe tio2 nano composites could contribute to e coli removal 6 nano f e 0 o 2 h 2 o f e 2 f e 3 7 f e 3 e f e 2 e 0 0 77 1 ev 8 f e 2 2 e f e 0 e 0 0 44 ev to further reveal the mechanism of e coli removal cell variation was analyzed by numerating live and dead cells in water during contacting with pcdf as shown in fig 4 a the proportion of dead cells in the blank group was almost the same as that in the sample group p 0 05 at 0 h after 2 h the proportion of dead cells in the sample groups significantly increased and became higher than that in the blank p 0 05 after 24 h the proportion of dead cells in sample group was significantly higher than that in the blank group p 0 05 these results indicated that fe tio2 nano composites resulted in cell death after filtration using modified pcdfs ros can induce oxidative stress on e coli ros commonly includes hydroxyl radicals oh hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and superoxide o2 which can lead to lipid peroxidation disrupt cell membrane destroy intracellular structure as well as cause protein aggregation and dna damage 35 50 52 the current study presents fe tio2 nanocomposites have more powerful ability to produce amounts of ros than individual nanomaterials which results in cell death to help enhance e coli removal efficiency eqs 9 16 intercellular ros in e coli is shown in fig 4 b in the beginning there was no significant difference in ros between the sample group and the blank group p 0 05 after 2 h ros was increasing and ros value in the sample group was 3 23 higher than that in the blank group after 24 h ros in the blank group decreased while ros in the sample group continued increasing ros in the sample group was 8 37 higher than that in the blank group these results are in consistent with our findings about cell viability it could be attributed to the apoptosis of e coli caused by ros which would lead to an increase in cell death 9 ti o 2 h v h e 10 h o h oh 11 h h 2 o oh h 12 e o 2 o 2 13 o 2 h e hoo 14

may exist in the raw water therefore it was worth exploring the influence of different concentrations of e coli on the reduction efficiency of pcdfs with fe tio2 nano composites several gradients were selected from 1 to 7 l g cfu ml and each gradient value was obtained by using colony counting method to obtain 3 parallel averages as shown in fig 5 a the low concentrations of e coli in effluent 1 2 l g cfu ml were very low or even undetectable the bacteria concentration in effluent increased with the increase of that in influent but the overall e coli removal efficiency was over 97 such effluent with excessive concentration of e coli could be unsafe for drinking for example effluent concentration was still as high as 4 lg cuf ml when the influent concentration reaches above 7 lg cfu ml for lightly contaminated natural water in which the e coli content was between 0 2 l g cfu ml 53 54 pcdfs loaded with fe tio2 nano composites could treated water to a safe range 55 according to the previous experimental results when the e coli concentration of influent was 6 lg cfu ml the bacteria concentration of effluent was 3 5 lg cfu ml 56 57 indicating that the coating of fe tio2 nano composites significantly contributed to the enhanced bacteria removal considering the common e coli concentration in real water source the developed pcdfs can meet the treatment requirement in most field applications 3 5 effect of illumination conditions the effects of different light conditions on the bacterial removal by pcdfs coated with single nano tio2 and fe tio2 nano composites are shown in fig 5 b under dark conditions pcdfs with nano tio2 alone had a low antibacterial effect due to the lack of photocatalytic reaction however pcdfs with fe tio2 nano composites showed a slightly higher antibacterial effect due to the presence of iron but generally at a low level when visible light was involved there were some tio2 photocatalytic reactions but they were not sufficient because the irradiated wavelength was not in the ideal range 28 at this time the synergistic effect of the fe tio2 nano composites was reflected and the pcdfs with fe tio2 nano composites still showed better bacterial reduction than that with single nano tio2 when both visible light and ultraviolet light were irradiated at the same time the pcdfs coated with nano tio2 particles showed good e coli removal ability that was due to the fact that light was in the most favorable wavelength range of photocatalytic performance the e coli removal under simultaneously visible and ultraviolet light irradiation conditions were similar for pcdfs with single nano tio2 and fe tio2 composites but the removal efficiency for pcdf coated with fe tio2 nano composites was still higher than that coated with pure nano tio2 in addition for both pcdf coating types the e coli removal efficiency with visible and ultraviolet light was effect of were higher than that with visible light only it indicated that ultraviolet light can improve the e coli removal ability of pcdfs for the water with very high e coli concentration the smaller pore size of pcdfs and longer exposure under sunlight can be implemented to further improve the treatment efficiency in this study the effectiveness of pcdfs coated with fe tio2 nano composites in the reduction of e coli was proved the removal of e coli was enhanced with the use of pcdf decorated by fe tio2 nano composites and the superiority of fe tio2 nano composites over pure nano tio2 was verified the optimization of key condition parameters in the production of modified pcdf was obtained the rice husk ratio the mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide fe tio2 and coated weight are all important for the removal of e coli the rice husk ratio had a great influence on the filtration rate because the increase of the coated weight would cause a certain reduction of the hole so it had a certain influence on the filtration rate the reduction of e coli by pcdfs can be attributed to fe tio2 nano composites and pcdfs had micro pores that could trap most e coli fe tio2 nano composites could take advantage of the dual roles of nano tio2 and fe to play a synergistic bactericidal effect on the removal of e coli they interacted with each other in electron transport to achieve the state that both sides were most suitable for reduction and both of them could produce ros to sterilize during the operation of modified pcdfs the concentration of e coli and the light conditions were very important for the safe application it was desired to treat the water with lower concentration of e coli in sunlight this study provided a theoretical support for exploring the ceramic disk filter modification and bacteria reduction using pcdfs impregnated with fe tio2 nano composites the results can help find a cost effective and safe solution for solving drinking water problems in rural and remote areas acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key

centralized drinking water treatment facilities faces some challenges such as expensive construction difficult operation and maintenance high requirement for personnel capability 13 therefore more attention is paid to some low cost alternatives with can be easily applied the porous ceramic filter pcf is a solution featured with low price easy operation and good efficiency 14 15 pcf can be made from locally available clay and rice husks with the advantages of low cost the production method is also simple and affordable for remote and rural areas 16 17 at the same time there is no additional energy consumption in its operation pcfs can purify water by using gravity of water as the driving power in general most microorganism and pollutants can be trapped but the effect of physical interception alone is not always satisfactory 18 microorganisms trapped inside the filter can still grow and cause blockages that make the filter less effective the performance of pcf can be improved through certain surface functionalization the pcf with silver coating has been studied before 19 and it was found that the silver addition improved the sterilization effect of pcf 20 however the price of silver is expensive and there is the toxicity concern regarding the potential silver leaching 21 nano tio2 is a kind of semiconductor material with photocatalytic properties and has been observed to have certain bactericidal function 22 nano tio2 can absorb the energy when it gets irradiated by a certain wavelength of light the electrons will jump and generate electron holes to obtain photocatalytic activity so that the oh and h2o can react to produce hydroxyl radicals 23 some studies have shown that the addition of transition metal ions such as fe ag and cu to nano tio2 can increase its photocatalytic activity 24 25 and the photoelectrons generated after photoirradiation can quickly transfer from the nano tio2 to the metal so that the holes are not easy to recombine 26 fe tio2 nano composites also moves the absorption spectrum of nano tio2 to visible light 27 28 indicating photocatalytic reaction is not limited to the ultraviolet radiation condition with the increase of iron addition the antibacterial activity of the composite material shows an increasing trend it is worth noting that nano zero valent iron nano fe0 also contributes to the removal of e coli 29 30 and nano fe0 is used to treat drinking water 31 32 nano fe0 can exert oxidative stress on e coli during which reactive oxygen species can be released 29 meanwhile the iron ions generated by oxidation can also promote the inactivation of e coli 33 fe tio2 nano composites have combined characteristics of nano tio2 and nano fe0 and its integration with pcf for removing e coli is expected to the best of our knowledge no systematic attempt to explore the nano fe tio2 assisted pcf has been conducted and the corresponding antibacterial performance the mechanism is still not clear therefore in the present work the removal of e coli from water using porous ceramic disk filter pcdf coated with fe tio2 nano composites will be studied in detail 1 the fabrication of pcdfs functionalized with fe tio2 nano composites will be optimized in terms of mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide in fe tio2 nano composites coated weight and rice husk ratio using response surface methodology 2 the morphological and crystal structure features of pcdfs will be analyzed 3 the performance and mechanism of using pcdfs coated with fe tio2 nano composites in the removal of e coli will be revealed 4 the impact of e coli concentration in influent and light conditions in the operation of pcdf will be explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals nano tio2 p25 71 29 anatase rutile was obtained from evonik degussa hanau germany e coli has been widely used an effective indicator in antibacterial studies 29 33 the strain of e coli atcc 25922 for experiments was purchased from the luhui technology co shanghai china the rice husk was purchased from jiangsu yancheng grain processing plant yancheng china and clay was obtained from beijing zhida tenghui trading co beijing china and all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher 2 2 e coli cultivation and enumeration the luria bertani lb medium used in this study included 10 g nacl 10 g tryptone 5 g yeast extract per liter deionized water 34 it was sterilized at 121 c for 20 min before use the bacteria liquid was prepared by inoculating e coli in 200 ml of the lb medium and cultured at 37 c for 24 h the bacteria liquid was diluted to a certain concentration and used to prepare for influent the lb agar medium was prepared by adding 2 5 g agar to 100 ml lb culture medium the standard plate count method was used in this study to enumerate the e coli briefly 1 ml sample was dropped into a sterilized plate followed by mixing with 15 ml lb medium after incubating at 37 c for 48 h the quantity of colonies on sterilized plate was enumerated e coli removal efficiency and log10 reduction of e coli lrv were calculated as follows 1 e r c 0 c 1 c 0 100 2 l r v log 10 c 0 c 1 where er is e coli removal efficiency c0 is the influent e coli concentration c1 is the effluent e coli concentration 2 3 fabrication of ceramic disk filters functionalized by fe tio2 nano composites the fe tio2 composite was prepared by chemical reduction using nabh4 35 36 the nano tio2 suspension was prepared by adding 2 g nano tio2 to 40 ml deionized water then the ferrous sulfate solution different volume feso4 7h2o in 10 ml deionized water was added to the nano tio2 suspension and stirred for 30 min after 20 min ultrasonic oscillation the fresh nabh4 was slowly added to this mixture in n2 flow the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 4 min to obtain precipitates the precipitates were washed with ethanol and dried in vacuum oven at 65 c for 24 h to obtain fe tio2 nano composites a porous ceramic disk filter pcdf was made by water mixing clay and rice husk to maintain consistency the rice husk and clay were sieved between 80 200 mesh size 0 075 0 2 mm and 80 mesh size 0 2 mm respectively the mixture was made into a disk by the mould with diameter of 10 cm and the thickness of 1 cm after air dried for 5 days at room temperature the disk was further dried in drying oven at 65 c for 24 h the dry dish was sintered in the electric furnace at 1000 c 2 c min and hold 60 min at the highest temperature a certain amount of fe tio2 nano composites was added into 10 ml deionized water and stirred after 10 min ultrasonic oscillation the obtained suspension liquid was brushed on the surface of pcdf and then the pcdf was dried in vacuum oven response surface methodology rsm combined with box behnken design bbd was used for the optimization of pcdfs decorated by fe tio2 nano composites 37 38 the variables explored were mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide fe tio2 a coated weight b and rice husk ratio c with three levels the detailed design of the bbd was shown in table s1 the low middle and high levels of variables were coded as 1 0 and 1 respectively e coli removal efficiency and filtration rate were used as the responses in the end the highest e coli removal efficiency was taken as the primary optimization condition for formula optimization this was because the e coli removal efficiency could not be guaranteed to meet the standard of drinking water when the filtration rate was large therefore the optimal condition was that the maximum e coli removal efficiency was selected and the filtration rate was higher than 115 ml h by applying bbd the acquired experimental results were fit to the empirical quadratic polynomial model described below 3 y 1 o r y 2 β 0 β 1 a β 2 b β 3 c β 12 a b β 13 a c β 23 b c β 11 a 2 β 22 b 2 β 33 c 2 where y 1 and y 2 are the responses including e coli removal efficiency and filtration rate β 0 is model constant β 1 β 2 and β 3 are linear coefficients β 12 β 13 and β 23 are interactive coefficients β 11 β 22 and β 33 are quadratic coefficients 2 4 filtration system and operation as shown in fig s1 the filtration system is composed of polymethyl methacrylate pmma column porous ceramic disk filter flanges disinfected conical flask and lamp the pcdf was put between two flanges with two shims to prevent leaking the visible light lamp foshan jinhao optoelectronic co ltd foshan china and the full spectrum lamp jingmen guangyu science and technology co ltd jingmen china are used as light sources in this study respectively their emission spectrums are shown in fig s2 uv intensity and visible light intensity were measured by ultraviolet intensity meter shenzhen sanpo instrument co ltd shenzhen china and visible light meter tes electrical electronic co shenzhen china respectively the pcdfs and disinfected conical flasks were used in the filtration experiment after 20 min of high pressure steam sterilization at 121 c and pmma columns and flanges were rinsed with sterile water when filtering each column was covered with opaque black cloth to avoid other light interference 2 5 effect of operating conditions the effects of initial e coli concentration in influent and illumination were studied the e coli concentrations in influent ranged from 10 to 107 cfu ml as for the impact of illumination intensity three factors including darkness a visible light 400 800 nm b and vis uv light 300 800 nm c were investigated with initial e coli concentrations of 105 cfu ml in experiments 200 ml of inflow with e coli was used and effluent was tested after an hour of filtration each experiment was conducted in triple replicates 2 6 analytical methods the fe tio2 nano composites were identified by the scanning electron microscope of jsm 7900 f sem jeol japan and regulus 8100 sem hitachi japan the surface and cross section structures of pcdfs were characterized by the jsm 6510 scanning electron microscope sem jeol japan elemental analysis was performed using energy dispersive spectroscopy of jsm 7001 f with pegasus xm2 eds jeol japan the fe tio2 nano composites and t ceramic disk filter surace were coated by gold under vacuum before observation x ray diffraction xrd results for ceramic disk filters and fe tio2 nano composites were obtained using smart lab xrd rigaku japan and d max 2550 xrd rigaku japan respectively the rsm analysis was conducted using design expert 9 stat ease inc usa the synchrotron based x ray fluorescence xrf spectra and xrf mappings of fe tio2 nano composite distribution on pcdf cross sections were measured at the very sensitive elemental and structural probe employing radiation from a synchrotron vespers beamline canadian light source saskatoon canada the polychromatic x ray pink beam was applied to excite the samples and a four element vortex silicon drift detector was employed to record the emitted xrf spectrum the reported xrf spectrum was obtained from the average of xrf spectra on the selected area the reported xrf spectrum was obtained from the average of xrf spectra on the selected area and the xrf mapping was plotted using sigmaplot 14 0 hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide pi were used for double staining to detect apoptosis of e coli 39 40 meanwhile dcfh da probe was added for reactive oxygen species ros detection 41 and the results were shown after separation by flow cytometer the blank group undecorated pcdfs and the sample group pcdfs decorated by fe tio2 nano composites were compared the sample and blank groups were placed into the beakers with a certain concentration of bacteria solution and radiated by vis uv light the sampling time was set to 0 2 h and 24 h and 10 000 cells were collected each time for detection the values of all types of cells were the average of 3 parallel samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 rsm assisted optimization of the production of ceramic disk filters coated with fe tio2 nano composites bbd is an efficient experimental design method with some advantages such as small number of tests low cost and high efficiency 42 following the experimental design shown in table s1 the empirical quadratic polynomial models of e coli removal efficiency y 1 and filtration rate y 2 were obtained as shown in eqs 4 and 5 a b and c were actual values of variables 4 y 1 99 93 0 50 a 0 40 b 0 98 c 0 12 a b 0 56 a c 0 39

experimental data were consistent with the normal distribution the analysis of variance anova was conducted to get the coefficients of the polynomial equation and the corresponding results are shown in table s2 the f value of 141 94 and p value less than 0 0001 showed the model was significant the high adjust r2 0 988 and predicted r2 0 926 indicated the regression model was credible a b c ac bc a 2 b 2 c 2 were significant model terms which demonstrated these three factors had a great non linear influence on the e coli removal efficiency the effects of three factors on the e coli removal efficiency are displayed in fig s4 it can be saw the increase in mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide fe tio2 a and coated weight b promoted the e coli removal efficiency nevertheless the opposite effect was observed with the increase of rice husk ratio c the higher reliability of the experiment was obtained with low value of cv 0 11 43 the three dimensional surface plots in fig 1 a c illustrates the interactive effects of the significant factors factor c had the most significant influence on the e coli removal efficiency while factors a and b had slightly less influence than c as a pore forming agent the rice husk was heated to form many small holes and irregular channels in pcdfs the increase of rice husk ratio resulted in more channels which could reduce the retention of e coli the mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide could affect their synergy a high coated weight of fe tio2 nano composites induced a high contact probability between e coli cells and fe tio2 nano composites which is favorable for e coli removal of pcdfs for the filtration rate y 2 fig s5 shows the experimental data were consistent with the normal distribution and anova results are shown in table s3 the p value 0 0002 less than 0 05 indicated model terms were significant the high adjust r2 0 928 and predicted r2 0 821 manifested the regression model was credible b c and bc were significant model terms in this case the effects of three factors on the filtration rate are displayed in fig s6 the increase in a and b impeded the increase of filtration rate however the effect of c on filtration rate was not only stimulative but significant on the filtration rate the three dimensional surface plots displayed the interactive effects of the significant factors in fig 1 d f factor c had the most significant influence on the filtration rate and the effect of b was less than c while a had little effect on the filtration rate since the increase of the rice husk resulted in the increase of the channels the amount of rice husk could be the decisive factor in determining filtration rate a high weight of coated nano composites could block some small holes and thus brought some negative effects however the mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide of nano composites mainly influenced the antimicrobial function the optimal conditions for the fabrication of ceramic disk filters functionalized with fe tio2 nano composites were selected to achieve maximal e coli removal efficiency and a medium filtration rate then the optimization results were verified based on the model eqs 4 and 5 the e coli removal efficiency and the filtration rate under such optimal conditions were 100 and 124 ml h respectively in the ceramic disk filters coated with fe tio2 nano composites the mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide the coated weight and rice husk ratio were 3 25 wt 30 mg and 32 33 respectively the corresponding average e coli removal efficiency and filtration rate were 99 99 and 119 3 ml h respectively the data were very close to the modeling results and thus the reliability of model was confirmed 3 2 characterization of porous ceramic disk filters functionalized with fe tio2 nano composites the sem image fig 2 a of the fe tio2 nano composites showed that they were composed of spherical and irregular particles with an average particle size of 23 06 9 67 nm the fe tio2 nano composites were also tested using bse mode of sem regulus 8100 results showed the different contrasts between the particles indicating different compositions of particles among which the lighter ones were iron particles in fig s7 fig s8 and fig 2 d show the eds results of nano tio2 and fe tio2 nano composites respectively the content of iron in the obtained fe tio2 nano composites was 3 43 wt which proved the coexistence of iron and titanium xps was also implemented to further analyze the composition of synthetic fe tio2 nano composites and the results showed that various valence forms of iron and fe0 coexisted fig s9 a according to fig s9 a the peak of carbon impurities appeared at 284 8 ev indicating that carbon impurities existed in the background of xps analysis the peak binding energies at 529 1 530 5 and 531 3 ev were related to ti o in tio2 feooh and fe2o3 respectively 35 44 fig s9 b the peak values of 457 7 ev and 463 6 ev were close to the peak value of ti4 in anatase 28 45 fig 2 g which indicated that the iron in fe tio2 nano composites did not change the main lattice of tio2 due to its low content in fig 2 h 706 2 ev and 711 8 ev were the characteristic peaks of fe0 and feooh respectively 35 and the characteristic peaks of fe3o4 at 710 2 and 723 6 ev caused by oxidation of iron can also be seen indicating that oxidation was unavoidable in the preparation process of fe tio2 nano composites 44 45 the morphologies of pcdfs without and with fe tio2 nano composites are shown in fig 2 b and c the surface of pcdf was uneven with many pores before coating with fe tio2 nano composites fig 2 b and the pore size was about 1 6 μm after coating the surface of pcdf was relatively smooth and the nano composites were evenly distributed as showed in fig 2 c coating fe tio2 nano composites caused the decreasing of pores sizes and the blocking of some small pores this was consistent with the response surface result of filtration rate fig s10 a and b indicate that the characterization of pcdf cross section did not change before and after nano composites coating in other words the nano composites were only attached to the surface of the pcdfs and did not infiltrate into the interior fig s11 and fig 2 e were the eds results of specified areas of the pcdfs before and after modification the main elements of the pcdf were silicon and oxygen as well as a large amount of titanium after modification x ray diffraction tests were performed on the pcdfs before and after coating fe tio2 nano composites to study the crystal structure the results are presented in fig 2 f the pcdf without coating were mainly composed of silicon and oxygen and the crystal structure was mainly quartz after coating the crystal forms of anatase and rutile were added which were dominant in fe tio2 nano composites fig 2 f therefore it could be proved that the fe tio2 nano composites were successfully attached on the surface of pcdf the xrd results of fe tio2 nano composites were also provided in supporting information fig s12 due to the low iron content no sharp peak was detected which was consistent with the result of liu et al 36 and yadav et al 44 synchrotron based x ray analysis is capable to provide a high level of complementary elemental related information for the modified pcdf 46 in order to investigate the stability and durability of fe tio2 nano composite coating on pcdf surface the synchrotron based xrf spectra and xrf mappings of fe concentration distribution on pcdf cross section before and after filtration were measured and the results are shown in fig 3 the horizontal position from right to left represents the cross section from the surface of pcdf to the internal fig 3 a it can be seen that the signal was strongest on the surface while the xrf spectrum fig 3 c showed that the main components were ti and fe this provides another clear evidence for the successful attachment of fe tio2 nano composites on pcdf surface after modification fig 3 b shows the xrf spectrum from the inside part of pcdf and there are only characteristic peaks of fe but no characteristic peak of ti this indicated that the clay used to manufacture pcdf contained a certain amount of fe thus it could be concluded that the fe tio2 nano composites were coated mainly on pcdf surface and did not infiltrate into the cross section during the modification process after the pcdf was applied for filtration the signal area was narrowed to a certain extent fig 3 d which was due to a certain degree of compaction and scouring of the fe tio2 nano composites under the impact of filter water flow the internal iron signal of the used pcdf fig 3 a was slightly higher than that of the unused one fig 3 d which might be due to the fact that a small part of iron became iron ions and entered into the void of the ceramic plate with the water flow but this part of iron was too small to affect the treated water quality surface and internal xrf spectra fig 3 b c and fig 3 e f showed that the main components were iron and titanium indicating that there was no big difference in composition before and after usage 3 3 functions of ceramic disk filters coated with fe tio2 nano composites pcdf coated with fe tio2 nano composites w can retain bacteria and inhibit their growth simultaneously pcdfs could remove e coli through the filtration process when raw water passes through pcdfs irregular pores produced by burning rice husks could retain bacteria considering the removal efficiency our current study showed e coli removal efficiency by unmodified pcdfs can reach as high as 97 at an initial concentration of 105 cfu ml it is similar with the results of some previous studies in which the e coli removal by unmodified ceramic filter could also reach 90 47 48 our study demonstrated fe tio2 modified pcdfs can remove 99 99 of e coli at the same initial concentration indicating the coating effectively enhanced e coli removal efficiency for fe tio2 nano composites the interaction of iron and titanium dioxide made e coli removal better than individual nanomaterials on the one hand the coating of tio2 reduced the oxidation of fe0 to fe2 fe3 due to the high reducibility of fe0 eq 6 28 on the other hand nano tio2 induced photocatalysis when nano tio2 absorbed the energy of the photon under the irradiated state electrons in the valence band jumped to the conduction band and then electron hole pairs formed 49 some electrons from nano tio2 transferred to iron the electron transfer increased the possibility of fe3 and fe2 to fe2 and fe0 eq 7 and 8 respectively that would help prevent the electrons produced from nano tio2 return to the hole and slow down those electron hole recombination 26 36 thus photocatalysis resulted from electron transfer in fe tio2 nano composites could contribute to e coli removal 6 nano f e 0 o 2 h 2 o f e 2 f e 3 7 f e 3 e f e 2 e 0 0 77 1 ev 8 f e 2 2 e f e 0 e 0 0 44 ev to further reveal the mechanism of e coli removal cell variation was analyzed by numerating live and dead cells in water during contacting with pcdf as shown in fig 4 a the proportion of dead cells in the blank group was almost the same as that in the sample group p 0 05 at 0 h after 2 h the proportion of dead cells in the sample groups significantly increased and became higher than that in the blank p 0 05 after 24 h the proportion of dead cells in sample group was significantly higher than that in the blank group p 0 05 these results indicated that fe tio2 nano composites resulted in cell death after filtration using modified pcdfs ros can induce oxidative stress on e coli ros commonly includes hydroxyl radicals oh hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and superoxide o2 which can lead to lipid peroxidation disrupt cell membrane destroy intracellular structure as well as cause protein aggregation and dna damage 35 50 52 the current study presents fe tio2 nanocomposites have more powerful ability to produce amounts of ros than individual nanomaterials which results in cell death to help enhance e coli removal efficiency eqs 9 16 intercellular ros in e coli is shown in fig 4 b in the beginning there was no significant difference in ros between the sample group and the blank group p 0 05 after 2 h ros was increasing and ros value in the sample group was 3 23 higher than that in the blank group after 24 h ros in the blank group decreased while ros in the sample group continued increasing ros in the sample group was 8 37 higher than that in the blank group these results are in consistent with our findings about cell viability it could be attributed to the apoptosis of e coli caused by ros which would lead to an increase in cell death 9 ti o 2 h v h e 10 h o h oh 11 h h 2 o oh h 12 e o 2 o 2 13 o 2 h e hoo 14

may exist in the raw water therefore it was worth exploring the influence of different concentrations of e coli on the reduction efficiency of pcdfs with fe tio2 nano composites several gradients were selected from 1 to 7 l g cfu ml and each gradient value was obtained by using colony counting method to obtain 3 parallel averages as shown in fig 5 a the low concentrations of e coli in effluent 1 2 l g cfu ml were very low or even undetectable the bacteria concentration in effluent increased with the increase of that in influent but the overall e coli removal efficiency was over 97 such effluent with excessive concentration of e coli could be unsafe for drinking for example effluent concentration was still as high as 4 lg cuf ml when the influent concentration reaches above 7 lg cfu ml for lightly contaminated natural water in which the e coli content was between 0 2 l g cfu ml 53 54 pcdfs loaded with fe tio2 nano composites could treated water to a safe range 55 according to the previous experimental results when the e coli concentration of influent was 6 lg cfu ml the bacteria concentration of effluent was 3 5 lg cfu ml 56 57 indicating that the coating of fe tio2 nano composites significantly contributed to the enhanced bacteria removal considering the common e coli concentration in real water source the developed pcdfs can meet the treatment requirement in most field applications 3 5 effect of illumination conditions the effects of different light conditions on the bacterial removal by pcdfs coated with single nano tio2 and fe tio2 nano composites are shown in fig 5 b under dark conditions pcdfs with nano tio2 alone had a low antibacterial effect due to the lack of photocatalytic reaction however pcdfs with fe tio2 nano composites showed a slightly higher antibacterial effect due to the presence of iron but generally at a low level when visible light was involved there were some tio2 photocatalytic reactions but they were not sufficient because the irradiated wavelength was not in the ideal range 28 at this time the synergistic effect of the fe tio2 nano composites was reflected and the pcdfs with fe tio2 nano composites still showed better bacterial reduction than that with single nano tio2 when both visible light and ultraviolet light were irradiated at the same time the pcdfs coated with nano tio2 particles showed good e coli removal ability that was due to the fact that light was in the most favorable wavelength range of photocatalytic performance the e coli removal under simultaneously visible and ultraviolet light irradiation conditions were similar for pcdfs with single nano tio2 and fe tio2 composites but the removal efficiency for pcdf coated with fe tio2 nano composites was still higher than that coated with pure nano tio2 in addition for both pcdf coating types the e coli removal efficiency with visible and ultraviolet light was effect of were higher than that with visible light only it indicated that ultraviolet light can improve the e coli removal ability of pcdfs for the water with very high e coli concentration the smaller pore size of pcdfs and longer exposure under sunlight can be implemented to further improve the treatment efficiency in this study the effectiveness of pcdfs coated with fe tio2 nano composites in the reduction of e coli was proved the removal of e coli was enhanced with the use of pcdf decorated by fe tio2 nano composites and the superiority of fe tio2 nano composites over pure nano tio2 was verified the optimization of key condition parameters in the production of modified pcdf was obtained the rice husk ratio the mass ratio of iron to titanium dioxide fe tio2 and coated weight are all important for the removal of e coli the rice husk ratio had a great influence on the filtration rate because the increase of the coated weight would cause a certain reduction of the hole so it had a certain influence on the filtration rate the reduction of e coli by pcdfs can be attributed to fe tio2 nano composites and pcdfs had micro pores that could trap most e coli fe tio2 nano composites could take advantage of the dual roles of nano tio2 and fe to play a synergistic bactericidal effect on the removal of e coli they interacted with each other in electron transport to achieve the state that both sides were most suitable for reduction and both of them could produce ros to sterilize during the operation of modified pcdfs the concentration of e coli and the light conditions were very important for the safe application it was desired to treat the water with lower concentration of e coli in sunlight this study provided a theoretical support for exploring the ceramic disk filter modification and bacteria reduction using pcdfs impregnated with fe tio2 nano composites the results can help find a cost effective and safe solution for solving drinking water problems in rural and remote areas acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key

14182,meuf was applied efficiently to remove mercury hg from simulated wastewater by using polyacrylonitrile membrane and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds as surfactant in this process leakage of surfactant

resources with heavy metals has become a global concern particularly mercury hg is one of the most harmful pollutant due to its toxic persistence and bio accumulative characteristics 1 the discharge of hg into the environment is occurring through natural sources including natural deposits forest fires volcanoes and thermal springs that are contributing about one third of the present hg air emissions 2 additionally a significant amount of hg is released to the environment through anthropogenic sources such as coal combustion waste landfills industrial and manufacturing processes laboratory equipment applications medical products fungicides and electrical industries 3 4 the presence of hg in waterways have a potential risk to human health because of its accumulation in the sea food chain which ultimately reach to human body 5 6 strict regulations regarding hg concentration in drinking water and its limits in the wastewater are imposed therefore nowadays removal of hg from water and wastewater streams getting more attention worldwide various membrane techniques were used for hg removal from water and wastewater such as adsorptive ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 7 10 uf technique is a pressure driven membrane separation that mainly differs from ro and nf in terms of applied pressure and provides higher flux with less energy consumption enhancements to the conventional uf by applying polymer and surfactants are known as polymer and micellar enhanced ultrafiltration peuf and meuf respectively used for the removal of hg previously 11 in meuf process a surfactant is added into the solution above its critical micellar concentration cmc to form large micelles that capture the relatively small sized pollutants and therefore the contaminated micelles get rejected by the uf membrane 12 13 a study for hg removal through meuf presented that 94 rejection was achieved at optimum values of feed solution concentration flow rate and pressure 5 ppm 16 l min and 4 atm respectively 14 the previous studies for different heavy metals removal through meuf 15 21 provided a foundation for further research work previously this process was optimized by changing one parameter at a time while others were kept constant that is tedious lengthy and expensive work and use of chemicals is hazardous to the environment as well therefore process modeling that establishes a relation between operating parameters and removal efficiency of the system can be helpful in both designing and operational phase to optimize and control the process recently in environmental engineering artificial neural network ann modelling received more attention because of their superior characteristics in processing of non linear and complex datasets with reliable results 22 ann selection as a suitable validation technique might be supported by its flexibility and ease by route of which it might not only resolve non linearity related with action of operating parameters but also learn and predict relationship between inputs and outputs without any requirement of mathematical equations 23 as reported in the recent literature fuzzy wavelet neural network was successfully proposed to simulate and predict river water quality 24 and indoor air quality was monitored by using soft sensor modeling technique 25 in our previous work predictions of proposed ann models provided good results for cadmium and chromium removal from wastewater using polymeric inclusion membranes 26 27 a response surface methodology and ann approach was used for modeling of dye removal from water through adsorption 28 the characterization of physical and chemical parameters of drinking water was modeled by ann with reliable results 29 neural networks were used for modeling of fouling growth and flux drop in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis systems 30 moreover previously ann application for optimization of meuf process for zinc removal from wastewater provided reliable results 31 and response surface methodology improved the understanding of the process performance and its optimization for cadmium and zinc removal 32 the fuzzy modeling for lead removal from aqueous solution provided acceptable results for meuf optimization 33 this literature review indicated the importance of ann modeling in water treatment systems that could be an alternative approach to minimize experimental work load therefore this soft computing technique was selected for this study due to the widespread applications of meuf process as described in the literature it needs further studies for large scale implementations for this purpose major issues should be addressed first including secondary pollution caused by surfactant monomer laborious lengthy and expensive work for optimization of the process therefore process optimization is required to ensure good operational stability of uf membrane to make this process economically feasible the application of ann models to optimize meuf process and its numerous characteristics has not yet been completely discussed in the literature to address all the question raised we conducted meuf process optimization for hg removal from simulated wastewater by considering the effect of hg concentration ph molar ratio of sds to hg and retentate pressure previously few meuf studies for hg removal from simulated wastewater was conducted but no study was found with an application of meuf acf as per author s knowledge this technique can be helpful to address secondary pollution caused by leakage of surfactant monomer to the permeate water moreover there is no previous work done to predict and optimize meuf process for hg removal using ann modeling technique therefore novelty of this work is to optimize the hg removal efficiency of 30 kda molecular weight cut off mwco polyacrylonitrile pan membrane from concentrated hg contaminated wastewater by using sds investigation of meuf acf performance for hg and sds removal from simulated wastewater was also conducted moreover proposed ann model was used to optimize meuf process and then a comparison was drawn between experimental and model predicted results in order to justify the predictions made by the model this model might be helpful in future studies without doing laborious experimental work very fast to perform economical and environmentally friendly resultantly optimization of meuf process through experimental work and ann model may provide further insight to the researchers to investigate the removal of other heavy metals from the wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and experimental work mercury nitrate hg no3 2 h2o of 99 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich co usa molecular weight of 342 62 and

connected with a feed tank through pump to prolong the life of the activated carbon fiber acf units connected in series to maximize sds removal from the meuf effluent after each experiment the membrane was flushed and backwashed with distilled water and cleaned with 0 1 m naoh first followed by flushing with deionized water then cleaning was done with 0 5 hcl and flushed again the cf and acf were cleaned with distilled water before soaking in 0 1 m of naoh and 2 of hcl for a day details of the experimental operational conditions are summarized in table 2 2 2 analytical methods the glassware used in the experimentation was cleaned with regular laboratory detergent and rinsed with deionized water the solutions were prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of hg and sds surfactant in three liters of deionized water and kept shaking at 100 rpm for an hour for each run of experiments fresh solutions were prepared to avoid any interference the ph of solution without any adjustment was measured by using multifunction meter cx 505 elmetron poland and then ph of solution was adjusted as per required in this study meuf samples were pretreated as per standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 34 sds concentration in the simulated wastewater and permeate water samples was measured through extraction spectrophotometric method by using uv vis 3600plus shimadzu corporation spectrophotometer at wavelength of 625 nm freshly prepared standard solutions of sds and blank sample ddi water were used for spectrophotometer calibration mercury concentration in simulated wastewater permeate and retentate water samples was determined by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes technique 720 es varian at wavelength of 194 16 nm the standard calibration solutions containing mercury was prepared from stock solution at predefined concentrations before mercury analysis feed water samples were diluted as per required a maximum temperature of 400c was maintained in a chamber containing glass nebulizer with nebulizer gas flow of 0 75 l min the flow rate of water samples introduced to the apparatus was 0 5 l min and axial analysis was done at 15 mm view distance plasma and auxiliary gas ﬂows were maintained at 15 and 1 5 l min respectively using argon gas initially instrumental calibration was monitored using mercury standard calibration solutions concentration as mentioned above the test results were checked by observing the mercury concentration of standard quality control solutions and noted that results were within the limits triplicate samples were prepared and analyzed to confirm the results the rejection percentage of sds and mercury was calculated by using eq 1 1 r 1 c p c i 100 where r rejection cp permeate concentration ci influent concentration 2 3 artificial neural networks ann ann model is a computational technique similar in structure and function to biological neural networks and their working is like human nervous system including receiving processing and transmission of information through computer application 35 basically these models are digital form of human brain where computer programs are developed to process the available information and predict for future 36 the development of ann model mainly comprises of the subsequent steps such as collection of dataset pre processing and analysis of the dataset creation of model by configuration of model topology training validation of proposed model and lastly simulation and prediction was conducted by using validated network 26 35 after defining topology of a network training is the significant step where model is learns the weights of the network it is an iterative process proceed step by step with small update in weights at each iteration and ultimately model performance changes in each iteration finally it defines whether model is good or good enough to solve defined problem the validation is used to offer an unbiased assessment of ann model fit on the training dataset for the tuning of model hyperparameters model testing unseen dataset provides the predicted results of the final model learned on the basis training dataset 37 the architecture of ann included an input layer with inputs x1 to xn one or more hidden layers having number of neurons n1 to nn and an output layer as shown in fig 2 nodes neurons are the main character of each layer that perform mathematical operations on its received inputs these nodes are linked to the nodes in the following layer through synapses that carries weight to characterize the significance of node output for subsequent operation finally output layer collects all data available in the developed neural network into the anticipated output parameter where each output has their own node 38 39 in each neuron propagation and activation functions are performed as shown in fig 2 and described below propagation function and activation functions are expressed in eq 2 and 3 respectively node output is given in eq 4 below 38 2 v j 1 n w i j x i t b i 3 σ f 1 0 f 0 o t h e r w i s e 4 y i t 1 σ j 1 n w i j x i t b i in these equations w i j is the weight x i is the input b i is the bias and t represent time step feed forward neural networks with back propagation that are most commonly employed in previous studies as mentioned in encyclopedia of machine learning 40 the feed forward is a static neural network model that develop an input output relationship which can be defined through an algebraic nonlinear mapping function this static neural network is characterized by memory less nonlinear equations and their output is a function of the existing inputs 41 2 3 1 data preprocessing for ann modeling the removal efficiency re of mercury hg from simulated wastewater using meuf process was optimized by considering operational parameters such as time hg concentration and ph of feed solution molar ratio mr of sds to hg and retentate pressure the dataset was obtained from this experimental work and statistically analyzed to calculate maximum minimum mean and standard deviation as presented in table 3 it was noted that dataset is spread on a wide range and large value of standard deviation confirms the non normality of data distribution therefore normalization of both input and target datasets was required to speed up the learning process by systematic weight initialization that leads to faster convergence normalization changes the value of datasets to a common scale without misrepresenting the differences in ranges of the values as shown in table 3 there are number of techniques that can be applied for normalization of dataset including min max z score decimal scaling 42 43 in this study we used most common min max normalization technique for data preprocessing in min max normalization variables are normalized in the range of 0 1 by using eq 5 5 x x m i n a m a x a m i n a where m i n a and m a x a are the minimum and maximum values of variable a the x and x represents original and normalized value of an attribute 2 3 2 proposed ann model topology the training of ann model is the most significant step to ﬁnd the best combination of weights and bias through selection of appropriate training algorithm and by tuning hyperparameters a training algorithm conduct learning through introduction of input data to the input nodes and then randomly assumed weights are used to calculate output afterwards model continue to learn from input and output dataset and keeps changing the weights until the output error stops improving or when fixed number of iterations achieved 44 most commonly used levenberg marquardt trainlm learning algorithm is a training function that update the weights and bias values as per levenberg marquardt optimization it is a variation of newton s method that was designed to minimize functions which are sum of other nonlinear functions moreover it is capable to learn more quickly between the training techniques available in the matlab toolbox and mostly considered as a first choice supervised algorithm but more memory requirements in this technique as compared to other algorithms 45 the number of nodes in each layer is an important criterion to determine the topology of the ann model as shown in fig 3 there is no standard method for finding the ideal number of hidden nodes a trial and error method used to find best ann topology although it is a time consuming technique 46 to determine the optimum number of nodes in the hidden layer different topologies were examined in which the number of nodes was varied and mse was used as an error function 47 training of model was stopped either after attaining the minimum mse between the model prediction and experimental results or as reaches the maximum prescribed iterations the overfitting problem occur when error on training dataset is driven to a very small value however when new dataset fed to the model then results shows big error this problem can be avoided by improving generalization of a network by early stopping that is automatically provided for all supervised models in this technique when network starts overfitting then validation error begins to increase and as it reaches to a defined value of iterations or mse then training is stopped and the weights and biases for minimum validation error are restored 48 another issue happen during training of a model is the local minima that can be avoided probabilistically by randomizing starting weights of ann that can be done by training a model more than once the normalization of dataset is also helpful to avoid local minima in regression problems 49 ann model basically develops a relationship between independent and dependent variables and their learning capacity depends upon the size of training dataset but there is no ideal distribution of data for training validation and testing 50 in present study experimental dataset contained 147 rows was divided randomly into training 70 103 rows validation 15 22 rows and testing 15 22 rows unseen dataset for modeling the training facilitates to get optimum weights validation helps to stop the training at the point of best generalization while testing is required to measure the performance of the model with unseen dataset matlab r2017b was used for ann modeling 2 3 3 model performance evaluation the aim of model performance evaluation is to confirm accuracy of proposed model to check any error for its application with confidence 51 52 in this study two performance criteria were used to evaluate proposed model predicted results the mean square error mse eq 6 and coefficient of determination r2 eq 7 were used as performance measuring criteria in evaluation of the model that are described below 26 45 6 m s e 1 n i 1 n y e x p i x p r e i 2 7 r 2 n i 1 n y e x p i y p r e i i 1 n y e x p i i 1 n y p r e i n i 1 n y 2 e x p i i 1 n y e x p i 2 n

efficiency re of hg at various mercury concentrations in the feed solution as shown in fig 4 re of hg was studied with concentrations ranges from 10 to 50 ppm in feed solution at sds concentration of 0 915 mm below cmc value literature studies described that below cmc of surfactant micelles are absent firstly but they form micelles when retentate surfactant concentration reached beyond cmc a higher concentration of surfactant may be considered in the adjacent layer to the membrane surface moreover additional effect of membrane including charge on the membrane surface asymmetricity or hydrophobicity may be affecting parameters the monomers of surfactant may also be retained by the membranes to some extent that can accumulate at the surface of membrane resultantly surfactant concentration may surpass cmc value of the surfactant therefore micelles may be existing near membrane surface even no micelles were present in the bulk 53 55 as mentioned in literature a study for cadmium removal by using 0 3242 mm of sds indicated the average re of 58 7 so we decided to consider higher concentration 0 915 mm in this study the results showed that average re of hg was 97 80 95 75 83 86 64 04 47 95 and 30 99 at hg concentration of feed solution such as 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 ppm respectively as expected the re decreased with an increase in hg concentration of feed solution caused mainly due to less micelle surface area availability for electrostatic adsorption of higher concentrations 56 this resulted in lower re at higher concentration of hg in feed solution without any adjustment of ph the decrease in re with passage of time was occurred because metal concentration increased of the feed solution as retentate water was recirculated to feed water tank fouling of membrane and concentration polarization in literature similar results were presented for different heavy metals including cadmium chromium and nickel 18 57 58 this suggests that concentration of hg in permeate water increased proportionally to its initial concentration of feed solution due to availability of lesser micelle surface area to adsorb higher metal concentrations electrostatically i e the higher initial concentration the lower removal efficiency as a result of increase in metal concentration available surface for metal ions adsorption becomes insufficient so excess ions remained soluble in the solution and ultimately drop the removal efficiency 59 the 10 ppm initial hg concentration was found optimum as it provides higher re of 95 75 while other parameters were kept constant 3 1 2 effect of ph on mercury removal experiments were performed to investigate the effect of ph on the removal of hg for mercury concentration of 10 ppm while sds concentration was 0 915 mm as shown in fig 4 average re was noted 67 62 74 24 76 73 77 65 and 77 72 at ph value of 4 5 6 7 and 8 respectively a significant increase in re was observed by increasing ph of feed solution at first until a maximum removal was achieved and then started decreasing slowly at lower ph competition between mercury and h ions happen for adsorption onto micelles surface and because of competition with h ions mercury adsorption onto the micelle surface was dropped on the other hand h bounding with functional groups dissociate easily at higher ph value and then deprotonated functional groups enhance the binding of hg as similar results were reported for other heavy metals 56 the influence of ph is dependent on type of metals needs to be selected from the feed solution regardless of h ions competition with the metal ions during electrostatic adsorption on micelles surface 60 as decrease of re was noted with respect to time due to higher metal concentration in the feed solution and membrane fouling because of concentration polarization with the passage of operating time similar trend was noted for other heavy metals including cadmium chromium and nickel 18 57 58 the adsorption of hg can be controlled by using the same principles as for adsorption of the other heavy metals even polymer enhanced ultrafiltration showed similar results of hg removal from wastewater using ploy vinyl pyrrolidinone and provided reproducible quantitative results 61 the ph 7 0 of feed solution was noted as optimum value while other operating parameters were maintained constant 3 1 3 effect of molar ratio of sds to hg to find the effect of molar ratio of sds to hg laboratory experiments were conducted at 10 ppm of hg concentration and ph was maintained at 7 0 while sds concentration was kept constant as 0 915 mm as shown in fig 4 average hg removal was 95 for a molar ratio of 8 110 1 and 12 1 while re was decreased to 82 14 and 71 79 at molar ratios of 5 1 and 2 1 respectively the increase in re was noted with an increase in molar ratio of sds to hg the drop in re was observed with respect to time due to increased metal concentration in the feed solution and membrane fouling pores blocking and concentration polarization previous studies supported these results as it was the case with other heavy metals cadmium and chromate removal using meuf technique 56 62 it was found that re of hg was higher at higher sds concentration that means more micelle surface is available to adsorb hg through electrostatic attraction as critical micelle concentration cmc of sds concentration approaches then further addition of surfactant converted to micelles that adsorb metal ions which can be retained by ultrafiltration therefore higher molar ratio of sds to hg results in large micelle surface area available for electrostatic attraction of hg ion as noted in this study on the other hand very higher concentration of surfactant may result in causing severe secondary pollution in the permeate water the optimum molar ratio 8 1 presented better results in terms of hg removal and without causing severe secondary pollution of surfactant monomers 3 1 4 effect of retentate pressure on mercury removal the effect of retentate pressure on hg removal was investigated by varying values from 1 to 3 bar while hg and sds concentrations were 10 ppm and 0 915 mm respectively ph was 7 0 and molar ratio of sds to hg was 8 1 an results presented in fig 4 indicated that average hg removal was 89 76 94 58 95 38 96 82 and 97 67 at retentate pressure of 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 bar respectively it was noted that increase in retentate pressure resulted in higher removal of hg the removal efficiency decreased with respect to time due to increased metal concentration in the feed solution and membrane fouling pores blocking and concentration polarization it was noticed that rejected micelle metal complexes were accumulated at the surface of membrane during meuf process this phenomenon increases the micelles concentration at the surface that eventually improved the metal ions removal at higher pressure similar results were reported to remove cadmium chromate and copper 56 62 63 it is considered that higher pressure increases the gel layer thickness at surface of the membrane that ultimately increases rejection of metal micelle complex on the contrary fast drop in permeate was noted as retentate pressure was increased due to the higher concentration polarization at the membrane surface during this experiment permeate flux was dropped from 38 45 l m2 h to 9 76 l m2 h when retentate pressure was increased from 1 to 3 bar and optimum value of permeate flux 30 92 l m2 h was achieved at 1 5 bar with maximum re of hg of 95 19 while pure water flux was noted as 63 73 l m2 h therefore 1 5 bar was found as optimum retentate pressure because it presented better permeate flux and removal efficiency 3 1 5 comparative study of uf meuf and meuf acf simple ultrafiltration uf showed average removal of hg only 31 57 that may be attributed to the membrane characteristics including charge asymmetricity or hydrophobicity of the membrane meuf presented better results for hg removal from simulated wastewater up to 95 75 but surfactant removal was only 50 91 it is assumed that higher mwco of membrane and very low concentration of sds were the reasons to achieve only 50 91 surfactant removal during meuf process this result was supported by a recent study for cadmium removal at low surfactant concentration it was reported that uf membrane may accumulate 50 of the total missing quantity of the surfactant sds moreover it was noticed that accumulated amount of the surfactant on uf membrane increased with the increase of its concentration 64 a set of experiments was performed to explore the removal of excess hg ions and unbound surfactant monomer present in the meuf permeate by coupling with acf unit the highest removal of sds was observed in meuf acf while a slightly increase of hg removal was noted as shown in fig 5 it is clear that sds rejection was markedly increased in meuf acf as compared to meuf while a minor increment in hg removal was also noted hence experimental results proved that meuf acf may be a promising technique for hg and sds removal from simulated wastewater similar results were presented in previous studies for other heavy metals removal from wastewater 15 56 62 because of adsorptive capacity of acf removal efficiencies were improved in this technique a drawback of meuf secondary pollution caused by leakage of surfactant monomers to the permeate technique was addressed in conclusion at optimum operating parameters hg removal was 95 75 and sds rejection was only 50 91 in meuf while 97 25 and 98 87 removal of hg and sds respectively was accomplished in meuf acf therefore with higher removal efficiencies meuf acf can be a promising technique for heavy metals removal from wastewater 3 2 ann modeling results in this study for meuf optimization we used static feed forward neural networks with backpropagation due to their widespread applications in modeling of nonlinear processes 41 the fastest levenberg marquardt trainlm backpropagation algorithm was selected for training of model to update the weight and bias values the experimental dataset contained 147 rows was divided randomly into training 70 103 rows validation 15 22 rows and testing 15 22 rows as unseen dataset for modeling to evade overfitting problem early stopping technique was used while local minima was avoided by randomizing starting weights of network and by normalization of dataset to find best topology of network trial and error method was used initially model was run at 1000 epoch and validation performance was evaluated on the basis of mse while number of neurons were varied from 2 to 30 and results are shown in fig 6 this trial and error method indicated that best training was accomplished at 10 neurons in the hidden layer the number of epochs were also defined as training was stopped at 29 epochs because minimum set value of mse was achieved at 23 epochs afterwards further increment in number of neurons caused an increase in mse therefore the best topology of proposed ann was found 5 10 1 on the basis of reproducible mse value of 8 28 10 4 at 23 epochs as shown in fig 7 the proposed topology of ann model 5 10 1 represents one input layer consists of 5 nodes a hidden layer contains 10 nodes and an output layer has only one node the operating parameters including time t hg concentration hg ph molar ratio of sds to hg mr and retentate pressure p were considered as input layer nodes while hg removal efficiency re was used as output layer node as shown in fig 8 the results of proposed ann model training validation and testing are presented in fig 9 training confirm best learning of the model while validation approved fine tuning of hyperparameters resultantly testing dataset showed a good match between experimental and predicted results by ann model therefore proposed model can be useful to find the optimum operating parameters of meuf process to remove hg from simulated wastewater and then can be confirmed through experimental analysis and its application can be extended to other heavy metals removal processes then predicted results of proposed ann model were evaluated on the basis of performance criteria such as mse and r2 values the mse values for training validation and testing were noted as 0 00083 0 00096 and 0 0025 respectively while r2 values were found as 0 98 0 97 and 0 96 for training validation and testing this criteria provided information on general error range between model predictions and experimental results to assess the performance of proposed model 65 results of the proposed ann model on the basis of r2 values are shown in fig 10 including training validation and testing that demonstrates the relationship between prediction by ann model and experimental results the learning of proposed ann model during training offered best learning validation to avoid overfitting or underfitting the predicted results of model on unseen dataset named as testing has shown outstanding results because of superlative training of model as presented in fig 9 moreover comparison of the experimental results and predictions by ann model for training validation and testing datasets as presented graphically in fig 10 cleared that training results are well distributed around x y line in a narrow area that indicates best learning of model as confirmed by prediction results by ann model in testing phase for unseen dataset therefore proposed model proved the robustness of ann application in optimization of meuf process that can be applied confidently to similar processes for optimization of process parameters 4 conclusion the hg removal efficiency of meuf process from simulated wastewater using polyacrylonitrile 30 kda membrane and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds surfactant was optimized to address the secondary pollution caused by leakage of surfactant monomer to permeate water meuf in combination with activated carbon fiber meuf acf was investigated the effect of operating parameters including concentration of hg and ph of feed solution molar ratio of sds to hg and retentate pressure was explored to optimize meuf process ann model was developed using available experimental dataset for the prediction and optimization of hg removal efficiency from simulated wastewater through meuf process the experimental results indicated that average re of hg was 97 80 95 75 83 86 64 04 47 95 and 30 99 for hg concentrations of feed solution 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 ppm respectively and 67 62 74 24 76 73 77 65 and 77 72 at ph value of 4 5 6 7 and 8 respectively moreover average hg removal was 95 for a molar ratio of 8 1 10 1 and 12 1 while it was dropped to 82 14 and 71 79 at molar ratios of 5 1 and 2 1 respectively and 89 76 94 58 95 38 96 82 and 97 67 removal was observed at retentate pressure of 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 bar respectively the optimum operating parameters were found experimentally as 10 ppm of hg concentration ph 7 0 8 1 molar ratio of sds to hg and retentate pressure of 1 5 bar meuf results showed 95 75 and 50 91 removal of hg and sds respectively while 96 83 hg and 97 15 of sds rejection was achieved using meuf acf the statistical values of proposed ann model presented high degree of agreement between experimental and predicted values the mse values for training validation and testing were noted as 0 00083 0 00096 and 0 0025 respectively while r2 values were found as 0 98 0 97 and 0 96 for training validation and testing the proposed ann model proved a reliable data driven approach to optimize meuf process therefore meuf acf combined process can eliminate the issue of secondary pollution by removing 97 of surfactant monomers from permeate water and the proposed ann model can be a competitive powerful and fast alternate to laborious experimental work in meuf process optimization acknowledgments this study was conducted by the support from kumoh national institute of

14182,meuf was applied efficiently to remove mercury hg from simulated wastewater by using polyacrylonitrile membrane and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds as surfactant in this process leakage of surfactant monomer to permeate water causing a secondary pollution that was addressed by using meuf followed by activated carbon fiber meuf acf the effect of operating parameters including concentration of hg and ph of feed solution molar ratio of sds to hg and retentate pressure was investigated to optimize meuf process moreover artificial neural network ann model was proposed to predict hg removal efficiency to optimize meuf process without doing laborious and time consuming experimental work ann model performance was evaluated on the basis of statistical values such as mean square error mse

resources with heavy metals has become a global concern particularly mercury hg is one of the most harmful pollutant due to its toxic persistence and bio accumulative characteristics 1 the discharge of hg into the environment is occurring through natural sources including natural deposits forest fires volcanoes and thermal springs that are contributing about one third of the present hg air emissions 2 additionally a significant amount of hg is released to the environment through anthropogenic sources such as coal combustion waste landfills industrial and manufacturing processes laboratory equipment applications medical products fungicides and electrical industries 3 4 the presence of hg in waterways have a potential risk to human health because of its accumulation in the sea food chain which ultimately reach to human body 5 6 strict regulations regarding hg concentration in drinking water and its limits in the wastewater are imposed therefore nowadays removal of hg from water and wastewater streams getting more attention worldwide various membrane techniques were used for hg removal from water and wastewater such as adsorptive ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 7 10 uf technique is a pressure driven membrane separation that mainly differs from ro and nf in terms of applied pressure and provides higher flux with less energy consumption enhancements to the conventional uf by applying polymer and surfactants are known as polymer and micellar enhanced ultrafiltration peuf and meuf respectively used for the removal of hg previously 11 in meuf process a surfactant is added into the solution above its critical micellar concentration cmc to form large micelles that capture the relatively small sized pollutants and therefore the contaminated micelles get rejected by the uf membrane 12 13 a study for hg removal through meuf presented that 94 rejection was achieved at optimum values of feed solution concentration flow rate and pressure 5 ppm 16 l min and 4 atm respectively 14 the previous studies for different heavy metals removal through meuf 15 21 provided a foundation for further research work previously this process was optimized by changing one parameter at a time while others were kept constant that is tedious lengthy and expensive work and use of chemicals is hazardous to the environment as well therefore process modeling that establishes a relation between operating parameters and removal efficiency of the system can be helpful in both designing and operational phase to optimize and control the process recently in environmental engineering artificial neural network ann modelling received more attention because of their superior characteristics in processing of non linear and complex datasets with reliable results 22 ann selection as a suitable validation technique might be supported by its flexibility and ease by route of which it might not only resolve non linearity related with action of operating parameters but also learn and predict relationship between inputs and outputs without any requirement of mathematical equations 23 as reported in the recent literature fuzzy wavelet neural network was successfully proposed to simulate and predict river water quality 24 and indoor air quality was monitored by using soft sensor modeling technique 25 in our previous work predictions of proposed ann models provided good results for cadmium and chromium removal from wastewater using polymeric inclusion membranes 26 27 a response surface methodology and ann approach was used for modeling of dye removal from water through adsorption 28 the characterization of physical and chemical parameters of drinking water was modeled by ann with reliable results 29 neural networks were used for modeling of fouling growth and flux drop in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis systems 30 moreover previously ann application for optimization of meuf process for zinc removal from wastewater provided reliable results 31 and response surface methodology improved the understanding of the process performance and its optimization for cadmium and zinc removal 32 the fuzzy modeling for lead removal from aqueous solution provided acceptable results for meuf optimization 33 this literature review indicated the importance of ann modeling in water treatment systems that could be an alternative approach to minimize experimental work load therefore this soft computing technique was selected for this study due to the widespread applications of meuf process as described in the literature it needs further studies for large scale implementations for this purpose major issues should be addressed first including secondary pollution caused by surfactant monomer laborious lengthy and expensive work for optimization of the process therefore process optimization is required to ensure good operational stability of uf membrane to make this process economically feasible the application of ann models to optimize meuf process and its numerous characteristics has not yet been completely discussed in the literature to address all the question raised we conducted meuf process optimization for hg removal from simulated wastewater by considering the effect of hg concentration ph molar ratio of sds to hg and retentate pressure previously few meuf studies for hg removal from simulated wastewater was conducted but no study was found with an application of meuf acf as per author s knowledge this technique can be helpful to address secondary pollution caused by leakage of surfactant monomer to the permeate water moreover there is no previous work done to predict and optimize meuf process for hg removal using ann modeling technique therefore novelty of this work is to optimize the hg removal efficiency of 30 kda molecular weight cut off mwco polyacrylonitrile pan membrane from concentrated hg contaminated wastewater by using sds investigation of meuf acf performance for hg and sds removal from simulated wastewater was also conducted moreover proposed ann model was used to optimize meuf process and then a comparison was drawn between experimental and model predicted results in order to justify the predictions made by the model this model might be helpful in future studies without doing laborious experimental work very fast to perform economical and environmentally friendly resultantly optimization of meuf process through experimental work and ann model may provide further insight to the researchers to investigate the removal of other heavy metals from the wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and experimental work mercury nitrate hg no3 2 h2o of 99 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich co usa molecular weight of 342 62 and

surfactant in three liters of deionized water and kept shaking at 100 rpm for an hour for each run of experiments fresh solutions were prepared to avoid any interference the ph of solution without any adjustment was measured by using multifunction meter cx 505 elmetron poland and then ph of solution was adjusted as per required in this study meuf samples were pretreated as per standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 34 sds concentration in the simulated wastewater and permeate water samples was measured through extraction spectrophotometric method by using uv vis 3600plus shimadzu corporation spectrophotometer at wavelength of 625 nm freshly prepared standard solutions of sds and blank sample ddi water were used for spectrophotometer calibration mercury concentration

permeate concentration ci influent concentration 2 3 artificial neural networks ann ann model is a computational technique similar in structure and function to biological neural networks and their working is like human nervous system including receiving processing and transmission of information through computer application 35 basically these models are digital form of human brain where computer programs are developed to process the available information and predict for future 36 the development of ann model mainly comprises of the subsequent steps such as collection of dataset pre processing and analysis of the dataset creation of model by configuration of model topology training validation of proposed model and lastly simulation and prediction was conducted by using validated network 26 35 after defining topology of a network training is the significant step where model is learns the weights of the network it is an iterative process proceed step by step with small update in weights at each iteration and ultimately model performance changes in each iteration finally it defines whether model is good or good enough to solve defined problem the validation is used to offer an unbiased assessment of ann model fit on the training dataset for the tuning of model hyperparameters model testing unseen dataset provides the predicted results of the final model learned on the basis training dataset 37 the architecture of ann included an input layer with inputs x1 to xn one or more hidden layers having number of neurons n1 to nn and an output layer as shown in fig 2 nodes neurons are the main character of each layer that perform mathematical operations on its received inputs these nodes are linked to the nodes in the following layer through synapses that carries weight to characterize the significance of node output for subsequent operation finally output layer collects all data available in the developed neural network into the anticipated output parameter where each output has their own node 38 39 in each neuron propagation and activation functions are performed as shown in fig 2 and described below propagation function and activation functions are expressed in eq 2 and 3 respectively node output is given in eq 4 below 38 2 v j 1 n w i j x i t b i 3 σ f 1 0 f 0 o t h e r w i s e 4 y i t 1 σ j 1 n w i j x i t b i in these equations w i j is the weight x i is the input b i is the bias and t represent time step feed forward neural networks with back propagation that are most commonly employed in previous studies as mentioned in encyclopedia of machine learning 40 the feed forward is a static neural network model that develop an input output relationship which can be defined through an algebraic nonlinear mapping function this static neural network is characterized by memory less nonlinear equations and their output is a function of the existing inputs 41 2 3 1 data preprocessing for ann modeling the removal efficiency re of mercury hg from simulated wastewater using meuf process was optimized by considering operational parameters such as time hg concentration and ph of feed solution molar ratio mr of sds to hg and retentate pressure the dataset was obtained from this experimental work and statistically analyzed to calculate maximum minimum mean and standard deviation as presented in table 3 it was noted that dataset is spread on a wide range and large value of standard deviation confirms the non normality of data distribution therefore normalization of both input and target datasets was required to speed up the learning process by systematic weight initialization that leads to faster convergence normalization changes the value of datasets to a common scale without misrepresenting the differences in ranges of the values as shown in table 3 there are number of techniques that can be applied for normalization of dataset including min max z score decimal scaling 42 43 in this study we used most common min max normalization technique for data preprocessing in min max normalization variables are normalized in the range of 0 1 by using eq 5 5 x x m i n a m a x a m i n a where m i n a and m a x a are the minimum and maximum values of variable a the x and x represents original and normalized value of an attribute 2 3 2 proposed ann model topology the training of ann model is the most significant step to ﬁnd the best combination of weights and bias through selection of appropriate training algorithm and by tuning hyperparameters a training algorithm conduct learning through introduction of input data to the input nodes and then randomly assumed weights are used to calculate output afterwards model continue to learn from input and output dataset and keeps changing the weights until the output error stops improving or when fixed number of iterations achieved 44 most commonly used levenberg marquardt trainlm learning algorithm is a training function that update the weights and bias values as per levenberg marquardt optimization it is a variation of newton s method that was designed to minimize functions which are sum of other nonlinear functions moreover it is capable to learn more quickly between the training techniques available in the matlab toolbox and mostly considered as a first choice supervised algorithm but more memory requirements in this technique as compared to other algorithms 45 the number of nodes in each layer is an important criterion to determine the topology of the ann model as shown in fig 3 there is no standard method for finding the ideal number of hidden nodes a trial and error method used to find best ann topology although it is a time consuming technique 46 to determine the optimum number of nodes in the hidden layer different topologies were examined in which the number of nodes was varied and mse was used as an error function 47 training of model was stopped either after attaining the minimum mse between the model prediction and experimental results or as reaches the maximum prescribed iterations the overfitting problem occur when error on training dataset is driven to a very small value however when new dataset fed to the model then results shows big error this problem can be avoided by improving generalization of a network by early stopping that is automatically provided for all supervised models in this technique when network starts overfitting then validation error begins to increase and as it reaches to a defined value of iterations or mse then training is stopped and the weights and biases for minimum validation error are restored 48 another issue happen during training of a model is the local minima that can be avoided probabilistically by randomizing starting weights of ann that can be done by training a model more than once the normalization of dataset is also helpful to avoid local minima in regression problems 49 ann model basically develops a relationship between independent and dependent variables and their learning capacity depends upon the size of training dataset but there is no ideal distribution of data for training validation and testing 50 in present study experimental dataset contained 147 rows was divided randomly into training 70 103 rows validation 15 22 rows and testing 15 22 rows unseen dataset for modeling the training facilitates to get optimum weights validation helps to stop the training at the point of best generalization while testing is required to measure the performance of the model with unseen dataset matlab r2017b was used for ann modeling 2 3 3 model performance evaluation the aim of model performance evaluation is to confirm accuracy of proposed model to check any error for its application with confidence 51 52 in this study two performance criteria were used to evaluate proposed model predicted results the mean square error mse eq 6 and coefficient of determination r2 eq 7 were used as performance measuring criteria in evaluation of the model that are described below 26 45 6 m s e 1 n i 1 n y e x p i x p r e i 2 7 r 2 n i 1 n y e x p i y p r e i i 1 n y e x p i i 1 n y p r e i n i 1 n y 2 e x p i i 1 n y e x p i 2 n

efficiency re of hg at various mercury concentrations in the feed solution as shown in fig 4 re of hg was studied with concentrations ranges from 10 to 50 ppm in feed solution at sds concentration of 0 915 mm below cmc value literature studies described that below cmc of surfactant micelles are absent firstly but they form micelles when retentate surfactant concentration reached beyond cmc a higher concentration of surfactant may be considered in the adjacent layer to the membrane surface moreover additional effect of membrane including charge on the membrane surface asymmetricity or hydrophobicity may be affecting parameters the monomers of surfactant may also be retained by the membranes to some extent that can accumulate at the surface of membrane resultantly surfactant concentration may surpass cmc value of the surfactant therefore micelles may be existing near membrane surface even no micelles were present in the bulk 53 55 as mentioned in literature a study for cadmium removal by using 0 3242 mm of sds indicated the average re of 58 7 so we decided to consider higher concentration 0 915 mm in this study the results showed that average re of hg was 97 80 95 75 83 86 64 04 47 95 and 30 99 at hg concentration of feed solution such as 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 ppm respectively as expected the re decreased with an increase in hg concentration of feed solution caused mainly due to less micelle surface area availability for electrostatic adsorption of higher concentrations 56 this resulted in lower re at higher concentration of hg in feed solution without any adjustment of ph the decrease in re with passage of time was occurred because metal concentration increased of the feed solution as retentate water was recirculated to feed water tank fouling of membrane and concentration polarization in literature similar results were presented for different heavy metals including cadmium chromium and nickel 18 57 58 this suggests that concentration of hg in permeate water increased proportionally to its initial concentration of feed solution due to availability of lesser micelle surface area to adsorb higher metal concentrations electrostatically i e the higher initial concentration the lower removal efficiency as a result of increase in metal concentration available surface for metal ions adsorption becomes insufficient so excess ions remained soluble in the solution and ultimately drop the removal efficiency 59 the 10 ppm initial hg concentration was found optimum as it provides higher re of 95 75 while other parameters were kept constant 3 1 2 effect of ph on mercury removal experiments were performed to investigate the effect of ph on the removal of hg for mercury concentration of 10 ppm while sds concentration was 0 915 mm as shown in fig 4 average re was noted 67 62 74 24 76 73 77 65 and 77 72 at ph value of 4 5 6 7 and 8 respectively a significant increase in re was observed by increasing ph of feed solution at first until a maximum removal was achieved and then started decreasing slowly at lower ph competition between mercury and h ions happen for adsorption onto micelles surface and because of competition with h ions mercury adsorption onto the micelle surface was dropped on the other hand h bounding with functional groups dissociate easily at higher ph value and then deprotonated functional groups enhance the binding of hg as similar results were reported for other heavy metals 56 the influence of ph is dependent on type of metals needs to be selected from the feed solution regardless of h ions competition with the metal ions during electrostatic adsorption on micelles surface 60 as decrease of re was noted with respect to time due to higher metal concentration in the feed solution and membrane fouling because of concentration polarization with the passage of operating time similar trend was noted for other heavy metals including cadmium chromium and nickel 18 57 58 the adsorption of hg can be controlled by using the same principles as for adsorption of the other heavy metals even polymer enhanced ultrafiltration showed similar results of hg removal from wastewater using ploy vinyl pyrrolidinone and provided reproducible quantitative results 61 the ph 7 0 of feed solution was noted as optimum value while other operating parameters were maintained constant 3 1 3 effect of molar ratio of sds to hg to find the effect of molar ratio of sds to hg laboratory experiments were conducted at 10 ppm of hg concentration and ph was maintained at 7 0 while sds concentration was kept constant as 0 915 mm as shown in fig 4 average hg removal was 95 for a molar ratio of 8 110 1 and 12 1 while re was decreased to 82 14 and 71 79 at molar ratios of 5 1 and 2 1 respectively the increase in re was noted with an increase in molar ratio of sds to hg the drop in re was observed with respect to time due to increased metal concentration in the feed solution and membrane fouling pores blocking and concentration polarization previous studies supported these results as it was the case with other heavy metals cadmium and chromate removal using meuf technique 56 62 it was found that re of hg was higher at higher sds concentration that means more micelle surface is available to adsorb hg through electrostatic attraction as critical micelle concentration cmc of sds concentration approaches then further addition of surfactant converted to micelles that adsorb metal ions which can be retained by ultrafiltration therefore higher molar ratio of sds to hg results in large micelle surface area available for electrostatic attraction of hg ion as noted in this study on the other hand very higher concentration of surfactant may result in causing severe secondary pollution in the permeate water the optimum molar ratio 8 1 presented better results in terms of hg removal and without causing severe secondary pollution of surfactant monomers 3 1 4 effect of retentate pressure on mercury removal the effect of retentate pressure on hg removal was investigated by varying values from 1 to 3 bar while hg and sds concentrations were 10 ppm and 0 915 mm respectively ph was 7 0 and molar ratio of sds to hg was 8 1 an results presented in fig 4 indicated that average hg removal was 89 76 94 58 95 38 96 82 and 97 67 at retentate pressure of 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 bar respectively it was noted that increase in retentate pressure resulted in higher removal of hg the removal efficiency decreased with respect to time due to increased metal concentration in the feed solution and membrane fouling pores blocking and concentration polarization it was noticed that rejected micelle metal complexes were accumulated at the surface of membrane during meuf process this phenomenon increases the micelles concentration at the surface that eventually improved the metal ions removal at higher pressure similar results were reported to remove cadmium chromate and copper 56 62 63 it is considered that higher pressure increases the gel layer thickness at surface of the membrane that ultimately increases rejection of metal micelle complex on the contrary fast drop in permeate was noted as retentate pressure was increased due to the higher concentration polarization at the membrane surface during this experiment permeate flux was dropped from 38 45 l m2 h to 9 76 l m2 h when retentate pressure was increased from 1 to 3 bar and optimum value of permeate flux 30 92 l m2 h was achieved at 1 5 bar with maximum re of hg of 95 19 while pure water flux was noted as 63 73 l m2 h therefore 1 5 bar was found as optimum retentate pressure because it presented better permeate flux and removal efficiency 3 1 5 comparative study of uf meuf and meuf acf simple ultrafiltration uf showed average removal of hg only 31 57 that may be attributed to the membrane characteristics including charge asymmetricity or hydrophobicity of the membrane meuf presented better results for hg removal from simulated wastewater up to 95 75 but surfactant removal was only 50 91 it is assumed that higher mwco of membrane and very low concentration of sds were the reasons to achieve only 50 91 surfactant removal during meuf process this result was supported by a recent study for cadmium removal at low surfactant concentration it was reported that uf membrane may accumulate 50 of the total missing quantity of the surfactant sds moreover it was noticed that accumulated amount of the surfactant on uf membrane increased with the increase of its concentration 64 a set of experiments was performed to explore the removal of excess hg ions and unbound surfactant monomer present in the meuf permeate by coupling with acf unit the highest removal of sds was observed in meuf acf while a slightly increase of hg removal was noted as shown in fig 5 it is clear that sds rejection was markedly increased in meuf acf as compared to meuf while a minor increment in hg removal was also noted hence experimental results proved that meuf acf may be a promising technique for hg and sds removal from simulated wastewater similar results were presented in previous studies for other heavy metals removal from wastewater 15 56 62 because of adsorptive capacity of acf removal efficiencies were improved in this technique a drawback of meuf secondary pollution caused by leakage of surfactant monomers to the permeate technique was addressed in conclusion at optimum operating parameters hg removal was 95 75 and sds rejection was only 50 91 in meuf while 97 25 and 98 87 removal of hg and sds respectively was accomplished in meuf acf therefore with higher removal efficiencies meuf acf can be a promising technique for heavy metals removal from wastewater 3 2 ann modeling results in this study for meuf optimization we used static feed forward neural networks with backpropagation due to their widespread applications in modeling of nonlinear processes 41 the fastest levenberg marquardt trainlm backpropagation algorithm was selected for training of model to update the weight and bias values the experimental dataset contained 147 rows was divided randomly into training 70 103 rows validation 15 22 rows and testing 15 22 rows as unseen dataset for modeling to evade overfitting problem early stopping technique was used while local minima was avoided by randomizing starting weights of network and by normalization of dataset to find best topology of network trial and error method was used initially model was run at 1000 epoch and validation performance was evaluated on the basis of mse while number of neurons were varied from 2 to 30 and results are shown in fig 6 this trial and error method indicated that best training was accomplished at 10 neurons in the hidden layer the number of epochs were also defined as training was stopped at 29 epochs because minimum set value of mse was achieved at 23 epochs afterwards further increment in number of neurons caused an increase in mse therefore the best topology of proposed ann was found 5 10 1 on the basis of reproducible mse value of 8 28 10 4 at 23 epochs as shown in fig 7 the proposed topology of ann model 5 10 1 represents one input layer consists of 5 nodes a hidden layer contains 10 nodes and an output layer has only one node the operating parameters including time t hg concentration hg ph molar ratio of sds to hg mr and retentate pressure p were considered as input layer nodes while hg removal efficiency re was used as output layer node as shown in fig 8 the results of proposed ann model training validation and testing are presented in fig 9 training confirm best learning of the model while validation approved fine tuning of hyperparameters resultantly testing dataset showed a good match between experimental and predicted results by ann model therefore proposed model can be useful to find the optimum operating parameters of meuf process to remove hg from simulated wastewater and then can be confirmed through experimental analysis and its application can be extended to other heavy metals removal processes then predicted results of proposed ann model were evaluated on the basis of performance criteria such as mse and r2 values the mse values for training validation and testing were noted as 0 00083 0 00096 and 0 0025 respectively while r2 values were found as 0 98 0 97 and 0 96 for training validation and testing this criteria provided information on general error range between model predictions and experimental results to assess the performance of proposed model 65 results of the proposed ann model on the basis of r2 values are shown in fig 10 including training validation and testing that demonstrates the relationship between prediction by ann model and experimental results the learning of proposed ann model during training offered best learning validation to avoid overfitting or underfitting the predicted results of model on unseen dataset named as testing has shown outstanding results because of superlative training of model as presented in fig 9 moreover comparison of the experimental results and predictions by ann model for training validation and testing datasets as presented graphically in fig 10 cleared that training results are well distributed around x y line in a narrow area that indicates best learning of model as confirmed by prediction results by ann model in testing phase for unseen dataset therefore proposed model proved the robustness of ann application in optimization of meuf process that can be applied confidently to similar processes for optimization of process parameters 4 conclusion the hg removal efficiency of meuf process from simulated wastewater using polyacrylonitrile 30 kda membrane and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds surfactant was optimized to address the secondary pollution caused by leakage of surfactant monomer to permeate water meuf in combination with activated carbon fiber meuf acf was investigated the effect of operating parameters including concentration of hg and ph of feed solution molar ratio of sds to hg and retentate pressure was explored to optimize meuf process ann model was developed using available experimental dataset for the prediction and optimization of hg removal efficiency from simulated wastewater through meuf process the experimental results indicated that average re of hg was 97 80 95 75 83 86 64 04 47 95 and 30 99 for hg concentrations of feed solution 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 ppm respectively and 67 62 74 24 76 73 77 65 and 77 72 at ph value of 4 5 6 7 and 8 respectively moreover average hg removal was 95 for a molar ratio of 8 1 10 1 and 12 1 while it was dropped to 82 14 and 71 79 at molar ratios of 5 1 and 2 1 respectively and 89 76 94 58 95 38 96 82 and 97 67 removal was observed at retentate pressure of 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 bar respectively the optimum operating parameters were found experimentally as 10 ppm of hg concentration ph 7 0 8 1 molar ratio of sds to hg and retentate pressure of 1 5 bar meuf results showed 95 75 and 50 91 removal of hg and sds respectively while 96 83 hg and 97 15 of sds rejection was achieved using meuf acf the statistical values of proposed ann model presented high degree of agreement between experimental and predicted values the mse values for training validation and testing were noted as 0 00083 0 00096 and 0 0025 respectively while r2 values were found as 0 98 0 97 and 0 96 for training validation and testing the proposed ann model proved a reliable data driven approach to optimize meuf process therefore meuf acf combined process can eliminate the issue of secondary pollution by removing 97 of surfactant monomers from permeate water and the proposed ann model can be a competitive powerful and fast alternate to laborious experimental work in meuf process optimization acknowledgments this study was conducted by the support from kumoh national institute of

14183,this study evaluated the effectiveness of treating a ciprofloxacin cip containing waste stream by activated sludge dosed with apple tree derived biochar ab ab was dosed to activated sludge inoculated bioreactors with varied ab volume ratios 10 20 and 40 of ab to the total volume the ab dosed bioreactors were operated by feeding by 1 mg l 1 of cip at steady state the ab dosed bioreactors achieved significantly enhanced cip removal up to 94 and the removal efficiency was positively correlated with the ab volume ratio suggesting the key role of ab on controlling the removal efficiency of ab the cip removals occurring in the bioreactors at steady state were largely through adsorption to ab this work further carried out systematic assessment on the adsorption kinetics isotherm and characteristics of cip on ab in variable environmental conditions cip adsorption onto ab was controlled by diffusion in macropores π π electron donor acceptor interactions and electrostatic attraction our results suggested that hardwood derived biochar may be a promising bio waste additive for improving micropollutant removals in activated sludge processes which has implications on further devising a simple and cost effective treatment option for antibiotics bearing waste streams keywords biochar ciprofloxacin activated sludge adsorption wastewater treatment 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip is a second generation antibiotic fluoroquinolone that has been widely used for several decades cip interferes with bacterial dna replication and transcription by inhibiting dna gyrase and topoisomerase 1 it is one of the most commonly prescribed fluoroquinolone antibiotics for various infections e g skin urinary respiratory and gastrointestinal tract due to broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram negative and positive bacteria 2 extensive use in clinical and domestic settings has led to the widespread occurrence of cip in both natural and engineered water environments cip occurs at substantially high concentrations in waste streams associated with hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturers in particular up to 31 mg l 1 of cip was detected in pharmaceutical wastewater and 2 5 6 5 mg l 1 was measured in surface water samples of lakes and rivers associated with impacts of drug manufacturers 3 cip can cause mortality and genotoxicity even at a few micrograms per liter for various organisms including primary producers e g freshwater cyanobacteria and plants essential for the function and resilience of aquatic ecosystems 4 5 a substantial body of literature suggests that cip carries toxicological consequences at concentrations detectable in a variety of environments the majority of cip is likely released in urban waste streams through sewage disposal due to use in clinical and household environments e g toilet wastewater can exhibit high levels of cip excreted in urine and feces 6 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are tasked with controlling the transport of cip to reduce ecological risks but removal rates in conventional activated sludge processes casp and anaerobic sludge processes vary greatly 20 95 across different wwtps suggesting unpredictable if not unsatisfactory cip control 6 7 full scale membrane bioreactors exhibit higher removal rates 73 on average compared with those of casp 8 several organisms e g bacteria fungi and microalgae are capable of metabolizing cip 9 11 a bradyrhizobium isolate originating from activated sludge as achieved 70 removal via co metabolic pathways at environmentally relevant levels of cip 11 implying a potential use as an auxiliary source for bioaugmentation on cip bearing waste streams however biological degradation alone using pure or mixed cultures usually takes several days making such means less feasible in full scale wwtps with relatively brief hydraulic retention times requiring other treatment alternatives to casp for effective control wastewater treatment processes capable of reliably eliminating micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals and personal care products including cip as well as conventional contaminant targets have yet to be developed micropollutant removal alternatives to casp include but are not limited to coagulation flocculation activated carbon adsorption ozonation and advanced oxidation membrane and attached growth treatment 12 among others micropollutant adsorption treatment using activated carbon ac has become one of the commonly used and effective treatment options for full scale tertiary treatment plants 13 a granular activated carbon process was found to remove more than 60 of cip from wastewaters 14 the adsorption process can be located after the secondary effluent as a post polishing treatment or ac can be directly dosed into activated sludge processes 15 although ac exhibits demonstrated adsorption capacities for diverse classes of micropollutants its massive use may cause environmental consequences since it requires highly demanding thermal energy for activation and emits greenhouse gas while typically produced from nonrenewable coal 13 biochar is a carbonaceous material that can be produced from pyrolysis thermal degradation without oxygen of a wide range of biomass e g wood rice straw and bamboo 16 while ac production is expensive and highly energy demanding the use of biochar may be cost effective and environment friendly e g sequestering carbon and valorizing organic waste 13 various types of biochar have been tested for pollutants adsorption including antibiotics metals and industrial chemicals 17 19 in addition to the adsorption capacity recent research has explored the capabilities of biochar as a microbial carrier due to its large porosity and surface area 16 hence this study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility of mitigating cip by direct dosage of biochar to as to test the effects of biochar as inoculated reactors were dosed with biochar at different amounts the cip removal and other essential functions e g organic matter removal and biomass yield of biochar dosed reactors were monitored from reactor start up to quasi steady state and compared with a control as reactor without biochar this present study also attempted to identify the removal routes e g physicochemical and biological of cip in biochar dosed as reactors and critically evaluated physicochemical mechanisms controlling the fate of cip the results of this work have implications on expanding current wastewater treatment options for micropollutant removal 2 materials and methods 2

described previously by oh and choi 22 at the end of each cycle half of the mixed culture suspension was discarded and replaced with an equal volume of fresh synthetic wastewater the reactors were maintained with an organic loading rate of 0 2 kg of cod m 3 day 1 seven days of solid retention time and 3 4 mg l 1 of dissolved oxygen comparable to those of conventional activated sludge processes 2 2 analysis of cip adsorption kinetics kinetic experiments for cip adsorption to ab were performed in separate bottles with the same condition of the bioreactor operation excluding biomass glass bottles were filled with 200 ml synthetic feed containing 1 mg l 1 cip 1 6 3 7 and 9 8 g l 1 of pre treated ab was put into the bottles which were equivalent to the volumetric ab ration of 10 20 and

phs the adsorption capacity of cip to ab and as was measured at a ph range of 2 2 10 5 the ph was adjusted using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh the initial cip concentrations were 100 and 33 mg l 1 for ab and as respectively the adsorbent doses were 0 04 and 0 22 g dry weight for ab and as respectively 50 ml vials were used and shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h at rt during these adsorption experiments 2 5 cip biodegradation test removal routes of cip in the bioreactors at steady state were determined using glass separate flasks where the same bioreactor operational conditions were established the mixed liquor suspension including ab was taken from ab40 at day 42 biofilms attached on ab were detached using vortexing 30 s followed by sonication 1 min as described previously 25 both the suspended and detached biofilm biomasses were mixed washed using pbs and resuspended into glass flasks with 1 mg l 1 cip containing synthetic feed the glass flasks were maintained with operational conditions identical to the bioreactors and cip concentrations were followed for 96 h 2 6 characterizing surface properties of ab and as surfaces e g microstructure and attached biofilm of ab were visualized using a scanning electron microscopy sem ab specimens were taken from ab40 at day 42 biofilms on ab surfaces were fixed using 2 5 glutaraldehyde in pbs for 2 h the fixed specimens were dehydrated with ethanol following the procedures previously described 26 the ethanol treated specimens were dried at 105 c for 12 h and sputtered with platinum pt to a thickness of 5 nm the pre treated ab specimens were subjected to the merlin field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem carl zeiss germany fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were obtained using powders of ab and as ground to less than 50 μm in diameter the ground samples were dried in a freeze dryer fdb 5503 operon korea for 3 days the potassium bromide kbr pellets were prepared containing 0 25 of ab or as and kbr ir spectra were

belsorp max bel japan 2 7 analytical methods cip cas number 85721 33 1 was purchased from sigma aldrich korea a cip stock solution 100 mg l 1 was prepared in diw and stored in amber bottles at 4 c until use the concentration of cip was determined using a yl9100 high performance liquid chromatography system young lin instrument co ltd south korea with an ultraviolet detector 278 nm 19 chromatographic separation was conducted at 30 c on a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm id 5 μm agilent usa at 1 0 ml min 1 of a flow rate with 100 μl of the injection volume the mobile phase was prepared in 25 mm nah2po4 adjusted to ph 2 5 using phosphoric acid and mixed with acetonitrile 82 18 v v cod nh4 n and vss were measured according to standard methods 27 the mann whitney u test was performed to assess statistical significance on differential characteristics 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of ab dosed as on antibiotic control fig 1 a shows the concentration of cip in each reactor effluent for the entire period of reactor operation from reactor start up to quasi steady state all effluent cip concentrations were less than 0 2 mg l 1 at day 3 5 the end of the first feeding cycle after which cip removal performance differed significantly among the reactors the control reactor rapidly increased the cip effluent concentration and showed non detectable removals at days 24 42 while the cip levels of the ab10 and ab20 effluents gradually increased and leveled off at days 24 42 ab40 could limit the effluent cip level below 0 025 mg l 1 throughout the entire cycles fig 1a the average cip removal rate during steady state 24 42 days was 35 5 0 5 54 1 0 7 and 94 3 0 7 for ab10 ab20 and ab40 respectively whereas the control system showed negligible removals 0 5 although a single reactor was run with each condition the cip removal performance was quite stable at steady state suggesting little stochastic variation in the reactor performance the cip removal rate of ab10 ab20 and ab40 respectively at steady state was significantly higher than p 0 05 by mann whitney u test that of the control reactor the ols regression analysis fig s1 of the cip removal rates at steady state in relation to the ab volumetric ratio further revealed a significantly positive relationship r 0 99 with p 0 05 strongly suggesting the critical role of ab on controlling the fate of cip cip removal in a laboratory scale membrane bioreactor with 15 g l 1 mixed liquor suspended solids was 53 28 and an up flow biological aerated filter reached approximately 78 29 while the removal rate of an anaerobic reactor was found to be relatively low 15 40 30 a sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed reactor displayed 90 removal from 1 mg l 1 cip containing influent which decreased to 65 with an increase of cip influent concentration to 5 mg l 1 31 considering the removal rates previously reported direct dosage of ab to as with its 40 ab filling ratio was found to provide outstanding performance on cip removal relative to other biological systems as well as the control i e as alone used in this study the potential effects of ab dosage on the essential performances organic matter and ammonia nitrogen removals of as were examined fig 1b shows soluble organic matter represented by soluble cod scod removal in the effluents from the control and three ab dosed reactors while the bioreactors were fed by the influent with 2 000 mg l 1 of scod for the entire feeding cycles effluent scod concentrations were 198 12 mg l 1 in the first feeding cycle and remained stable 45 65 mg l 1 at days 14 42 all reactors achieved high levels of steady state scod removal rates 97 in addition all reactors showed similar vss levels 1 0 1 3 g l 1 and nh4 n removal rates 46 50 at steady state these results collectively suggested that organic matter ammonia removal and biomass yield of as dosed with 10 40 ab volumetric ratios addition were comparable to those of the control reactor suggesting that direct addition of ab into activated sludge may not affect disrupt the key original performances i e removals of conventional organic contaminants while significantly improving controlling antibiotic waste streams 3 2 role of ab as a microbial carrier on antibiotic removal the surfaces of the virgin as purchased nitric acid treated and biofilm attached ab are visualized in fig 2 the biofilm attached ab was sampled from ab40 at steady state compared with fig 2a virgin fig 2b shows holes and macropores with less impurities suggesting that nitric acid pre treatment effectively eliminated debris and impurities fig 2c clearly illustrates a non homogenous irregularly aggregated biofilm distribution on the surface including cocci like bacteria a feedstock material used for pyrolysis affects the microstructure of the biochar surface and its physicochemical properties 32 the surface structure of ab resembled that of biochar derived from a typical hardwood with fiber cells vessels and large pore spaces as observed by gibson 33 cocci like bacteria observed in the ab fig 2c are often found in as flocs and designated g bacteria by morphology which include phylogenetically diverse organisms that play a role in aerobic degradation of organic matter in as 34 the biofilm attached to ab visualized in fig 2c and the outstanding cip removal that occurred in ab40 fig 1 both at steady state led us to examine the potential contribution of biomass on the cip removal both suspended and biofilm biomasses were taken from ab40 and inoculated into separate glass flasks with other experimental conditions identical to those of ab40 fed with 1 mg l 1 of cip the abiotic condition was established without biomass inoculation and the biotic condition with both suspended and biofilm biomasses time course cip concentrations in the two conditions were followed over four days fig s1 slightly longer than a feeding cycle duration the cip levels did not change 0 01 mg l 1 of change in the abiotic condition whereas slightly decreasing cip 0 98 mg l 1 and 0 94 mg l 1 at day 1 and 4 respectively was detectable in the biotic condition suggesting a minor contribution of biosorption biodegradation to the overall cip removal since the tempo of the biotic removal was comparable to the previous kinetics estimate about 0 01 0 08 d 1 10 our and previous study collectively suggested that cip in the biotic conditions is relatively stable and persistent 3 3 adsorption kinetics of cip on ab and as micropollutants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products and industrial chemicals in casp are removed with various routes through biodegradation sorption hydrolysis photolysis and volatilization 22 ab indeed acted as a microbial carrier fig 2c since the biological removal extent observed in a separate flask was much less significant than the overall cip removals 94 that occurred in the ab dosed bioreactors at steady state which prompted further investigation on the contribution of other removal routes e g cip adsorption to ab pretreated ab using nitric acid and as directly taken from an aeration tank of a full scale wwtp neither of which had been exposed to cip were used for characterizing adsorption kinetics fig 3 a shows time course adsorption of cip in glass vials with 10 20 and 40 of ab and 3 g vss l 1 of as respectively simulating the same settings established in the three ab dosed and control reactor in contrast to the minor cip removal contributed by biomass over the four days fig s1 cip was rapidly and substantially removed within three hours fig 3a the pseudo second order kinetic model was the best fit r 2 0 99 for the experimental results with the hardwood based biochar as previously reported for adsorption of a range of trace organic pollutants including cip to other types of biochars 17 19 35 the adsorption rate constant per unit volume lr varied with ab volumetric ratios similarly simulated as in the ab dosed reactors was assessed ab40 48 1 lr mg 1 min 1 ab20 7 4 ab10 1 1 as 0 4 the qe value was in the order of ab40 0 776 mg lr 1 ab20 0 772 ab10 0 513 as 0 432 the much faster and greater adsorption to ab than as highlighted the significant contribution of the ab mediated cip adsorption removal rather than the as mediated biosorption in the ab dosed reactors at steady state while adsorption to ab and as could be described well with the pseudo second order kinetic model only ab mediated adsorption not as mediated was fitted well to the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model multilinear plots with r 2 0 96 in fig 3b suggesting intraparticle diffusion could be more significant in ab mediated adsorption relative to as adsorption processes consist of three steps 1 boundary layer diffusion within the layer on the adsorbent surface 2 intra particle diffusion of adsorbates into the pores and 3 adsorption on the adsorption sites either on the surface or in the pores of adsorbents which is fast and not rate limiting 36 the kinetics results suggested that cip was adsorbed onto the adsorption sites on the outer surface of ab which is easily accessible in the first linear stage while cip was transported into the sites in inner pores with higher resistance in the second linear stage we also observed that the period of the first stage increased as the amount of ab increased providing more outer surfaces the intercept of the plots i e c in eq 3 was significantly smaller than qe indicating that the boundary layer played a minor role in adsorption 3 4 adsorption isotherm of cip on ab and as fig 4 illustrates the increasing adsorption capacity of cip with the increase of cip liquid concentration the maximum adsorption capacity obtained using the langmuir isotherm a better fit to the experimental results than other models was 20 7 and 5 0 mg g 1 table 2 while rl was in a range of 0 30 0 81 and 0 28 0 94 for ab and as respectively given the adsorption behaviors classified based on rl values irreversible 0 favorable 0 1 and unfavorable 1 24 cip adsorption to both ab and as was found to be favorable the maximum cip adsorption capacity values measured in this study were in an agreement with previous estimates 10 96 3 mg g 1 by various types of biochar table s1 and 3 4 by as 37 these results supported the greater cip adsorption capacity by the ab dosed reactors for the longer period fig 1a the good fit of the langmuir isotherm model and the unity 1 00 of β sips isotherm suggested that cip adsorption onto both bc and as could be accomplished through monolayer and homogeneous adsorption and that adsorption enthalpy was not affected by surface coverage 24 experimental data were fitted to the dubinin kaganer radushkevich isotherm model to infer apparent adsorption energy since it is often used to describe the adsorption mechanism with a gaussian energy distribution onto a heterogeneous surface 24 the adsorption mechanism can be predicted depending on the apparent free energy of adsorption e physical e 8 ion exchange 8 e 16 and strongly chemical e 16 24 the e value was 9 4 and 11 8 kj mol 1 for ab and as respectively implying that adsorption occurred primarily by ionic exchange between ionizable protons on the acidic surface cπ h3o 38 and or the exchange of electrons between adsorbates and adsorbents 39 3 5 cip mediated shifts in surface properties fig 5 a presents the ftir spectra of the pre treated and cip adsorbed ab which identified the presence of the oh bond in hydroxyl functional groups the band observed at 3200 3500 cm 1 aliphatic ch2 asymmetric stretch 2917 cm 1 aliphatic ch2 symmetric stretch 2850 cm 1 the stretching of symmetric and asymmetric vibration of co in co2 2360 cm 1 ketonic and carboxylic co 1703 cm 1 cc of the aromatic ring or highly conjugated cc bond generated during pyrolysis of raw material 1595 cm 1 and bending vibration of methyl 1384 cm 1 the presence of co2 2360 cm 1 was probably attributed to the low temperature during manufacture of the ab often detected in those of other types of biochars under slow pyrolysis at relatively low temperatures 400 c 40 the peak at 1270 cm 1 assigned to a phenolic coh bond was probably attributable to adsorbed cip molecules in addition the peak of aromatic cc bonds shifted from 1595 to 1583 cm 1 indicating that π π electron donor acceptor eda interactions contributed to the adsorption 41 the carbon atom bonded to fluorine cc f in cip molecules is a π electron acceptor due to the strong electron withdrawing ability of fluorine 42 the π π eda interactions in the organic compounds adsorption by carbon based materials contribute significantly to the adsorption of aromatics to biochar and graphitic materials 19 43 the spectrum fig 5b of as and cip adsorbed as included peaks associated with the oh of a hydroxyl group compound polyalcohol and saccharides 3200 3500 cm 1 the vibration h bonds between oh groups of cellulose and nh in the amide groups 3280 cm 1 the stretching vibration of ch stretch 2924 cm 1 c h2 asymmetric and symmetric stretch 2852 cm 1 stretching asymmetrical vibrations of coo in peptides and proteins 1652 cm 1 stretching vibration of cn and nh of amide ii of the protein polymer 1548 cm 1 nh3 in peptide 1402 cm 1 and coc of amide iii or aromatic ethers 1242 cm 1 44 the intensities of all peaks at 3280 1652 cm 1 decreased after cip adsorption indicating that a variety of functional groups on as surfaces were involved in cip adsorption zhang et al 45 found that most of the functional groups of extracellular polymeric substances of aerobic sludge including carboxyl hydroxyl and amine bind with cip they also reported that eps contributed to approximately 50 of cip removal by aerobic sludge meanwhile a peak at 1032 cm 1 appearing after cip adsorption represented the cf stretching of cip supporting the cip adsorption onto as 3 6 effects of ph on zeta potential and cip adsorption fig 6 a shows the zeta potential and the cip adsorption amount of ab under different phs the zeta potential of ab was 21 7 mv at ph 3 1 decreased to 49 3 mv at ph 6 and then further decreased 51 7 mv at ph 10 0 biochars show a range of zeta potential from 20 to 0 mv at ph 3 5 which decreases as ph increases 46 the point of zero charge is 3 05 for a tea leaf biochar 19 the surface charge of ab was significantly more negative than those previously reported suggesting that the ab used in this study could have a high adsorption potential to cationic metals via higher electrostatic attraction the highest cip adsorption potential was recorded at ph 6 3 and decreased whether the ph rose or fell the optimum cip adsorption of ab was at the ph range relevant to those in municipal wastewaters consistent with other studies 19 35 the highest adsorption achieved at a nearly neutral ph was attributable to strong hydrophobic effects and π π eda interactions cip exists dominantly as a cation ciph2 zwitterion ciph and anion cip when the ph is 5 9 6 1 8 7 and 8 9 respectively because of the two dissociation constants pka of cip one of the pkas is 5 9 for the carboxylic acid group and the other is 8 8 for the amine group on the piperazine moiety ciph has the highest hydrophobicity among three cip species 43 and is an effective π electron acceptor taking part in strong π π eda interactions with the graphite structures of the ab the ph dependent adsorption observed in fig 6a could be attributable to several mechanisms as ph decreases the π electron accepting ability of cip increases i e favorable to adsorption while the electrostatic attraction and hydrophobicity decrease i e unfavorable to the adsorption 47 therefore hydrophobicity and the electrostatic repulsion likely dominantly affected cip adsorption under acidic ph in contrast as ph increases the electrostatic attraction the π electron accepting ability and hydrophobicity decrease due to deprotonation and ionization 48 which are all unfavorable to the adsorption which led to a significant decrease of cip adsorption the zeta potential and the cip adsorption of as at a range of ph values are presented in fig 6b the surface of as is negative due to the ionization of the anionic functional groups such as carboxylic acid and phosphate 49 the zeta potential of as taken from oxic tanks of three municipal wwtps was in a range of 0 1 to 5 at ph 3 and of 20 to 30 at ph 12 50 the zeta potential of as was 0 to 5 mv at ph 3 and decreased to 20 mv at ph 7 51 the cip adsorption potential onto as was the highest at ph 6 3 and fell as ph either increased or decreased as observed with ab the adsorption of ciph at nearly neutral conditions could be due to a combination of electrostatic attraction cation exchange of the protonated amine cation bridging of divalent cations and the anionic carboxyl group of cip 52 these results suggested that cip adsorption to as may be suppressed by protonation of anionic carboxyl groups under acidic conditions and or by the increase of electrostatic repulsion under alkaline condition 3 7 cip removals in ab dosed as systems mechanism and practical implication while several studies have documented cip adsorption to biochars with other biomass sources 19 35 little is known about the characteristics and mechanism of cip adsorption to hardwood based biochar this work provided insights into mechanisms facilitating cip adsorption to ab a hardwood derived biochar first the cip adsorption kinetics could be primarily governed by the diffusion within macropores rather than meso micropores it was supported by the kinetics model webber morris fig 3a and table 1 and significantly larger macropores relative to mesopores and micropores the latter was experimentally validated with the sem images fig 2b and the smaller volume 0 00887 and 0 00265 cm3 g 1 and specific surface area 2 02 and 2 33 m2 g 1 of mesopores and micropores respectively measured using the bet analysis second the cip adsorption to ab also involved hydrophobic effects of cip π π eda interactions and electrostatic attraction between cip and ab inferred from the surface characterization results figs 5 and 6 the proposed mechanism was also supported by the apparent adsorption energy e of the dubinin kaganer radushkevich isotherm fig 4 and table 2 direct dosage of ab into as could greatly enhance cip removal fig 1a largely via adsorption to ab rather than biodegradation biosorption because the biomass tested in this study was taken from the ab dosed reactor at steady state cip likely had been already adsorbed to the biomass therefore severely limiting further biosorption mediated cip removal that could possibly occur in contrast the as samples freshly taken from full scale wwtps showed rapid and significant biosorption potential highlighting considerable sorption potential to as figs 3 and 4 and tables 1 and 2 accordingly cip removals observed in the control reactor until day 21 could occur via biosorption to suspended biomass compared with the limited adsorption capacity by suspended biomass in the control system at steady state addition of ab could significantly improve the removal capacity 94 cip removals in ab40 our adsorption kinetics and isotherm parameters demonstrated the high adsorption rate maximum adsorption capacity and affinity of cip to ab figs 3 and 4 and tables 1 and 2 the cip concentration tested in this study greatly exceeds the typical levels of cip e g less than dozens of μg l 1 in municipal wastewater influents suggesting that ab dosage might be effective for treating cip bearing waste streams at a wide range of environmentally relevant levels despite the effectiveness given that municipal waste streams carry a lot of organic and inorganic compounds that may compete interfere with the antibiotic adsorption to biochar we should therefore suggest further experimental investigations e g antibiotic removal performance breakthrough time and regeneration strategy of biochar of the removal performance using both the bench and pilot scale as systems dosed with biochar receiving real wastewaters cip removals in full scale wwtps are often attributed to biosorption onto as biomass 12 52 while cip represents a poorly biodegradable micropollutant 52 the disappearance of cip resulting from adsorption to wasted as was not biodegradation may give rise to another critical issue as the cip released with was may perturb ecosystems of post treatment processes e g anaerobic digestion and biosolid amended sites for example our previous study revealed that 0 5 mg l 1 of cip could cause significant inhibition on aerobic activated sludge e g potential heterotrophic and nutrient removal activities and anaerobic methanogenic sludge e g fermentation and methane production activities with alteration on the microbial community structure and diversity 7 given the faster and higher adsorption capacity of ab than as dosing biochar into as would help effectively remove cip from the was as well as the wastewater effluents the performances of biochar dosed bioreactors can be further improved through modifying surface properties of biochar there are many factors e g biomass feedstock pyrolysis condition such as temperature and pretreatment affecting the surface properties e g surface to volume ratio of biochar and thus potentially enhancing the treatment performance adsorption kinetics isotherm hence the ab dosage 10 40 tested in this study fig 1 may be further reduced through surface modification of biochar as both an adsorbent and a microbial carrier despite its great adsorption capacity of biochar as observed in this study figs 3 and 4 biochar has a finite adsorption capacity once biochar reaches its maximum adsorption capacity the used biochar as activated carbon materials would be disposed to landfills incinerators or regenerated recycled a variety of regeneration methods for biochar using thermal energy solvent microwave and supercritical fluid have been developed 53 which may significantly extend the life of biochar and thus reduce the operational cost the technical feasibility of biochar addition into as for micropollutant removal observed in this study strongly suggests future investigations on the surface modification and regeneration methods of biochar 4 conclusions as reactors with varied ab volume ratios were established for treating antibiotic wastewaters removal efficiency of cip was correlated with the added amount of ab achieving up to 94 of cip removals by ab dosed as reactors while a control as reactor without ab showed a non detectable removal adsorption kinetics and isotherm results suggested the majority of cip was removed by adsorption onto ab primarily via intraparticle diffusion π π eda interaction and hydrophobic and electrostatic attraction the outstanding cip removal rates observed in this work proposed that direct dosage of biochar into as system may be a cost effective and simple alternative treatment option for antibiotic bearing waste streams declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

14183,this study evaluated the effectiveness of treating a ciprofloxacin cip containing waste stream by activated sludge dosed with apple tree derived biochar ab ab was dosed to activated sludge inoculated bioreactors with varied ab volume ratios 10 20 and 40 of ab to the total volume the ab dosed bioreactors were operated by feeding by 1 mg l 1 of cip at steady state the ab dosed bioreactors achieved significantly enhanced cip removal up to 94 and the removal efficiency was positively correlated with the ab volume ratio suggesting the key role of ab on controlling the removal efficiency of ab the cip removals occurring in the bioreactors at steady state were largely through adsorption to ab this work further carried out systematic assessment on the adsorption kinetics isotherm and characteristics of cip on ab in variable environmental conditions cip adsorption onto ab was controlled by diffusion in macropores π π electron donor acceptor interactions and electrostatic attraction our results suggested that hardwood derived biochar may be a promising bio waste additive for improving micropollutant removals in activated sludge processes which has implications on further devising a simple and cost effective treatment option for antibiotics bearing waste streams keywords biochar ciprofloxacin activated sludge adsorption wastewater treatment 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip is a second generation antibiotic fluoroquinolone that has been widely used for several decades cip interferes with bacterial dna replication and transcription by inhibiting dna gyrase and topoisomerase 1 it is one of the most commonly prescribed fluoroquinolone antibiotics for various infections e g skin urinary respiratory and gastrointestinal tract due to broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram negative and positive bacteria 2 extensive use in clinical and domestic settings has led to the widespread occurrence of cip in both natural and engineered water environments cip occurs at substantially high concentrations in waste streams associated with hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturers in particular up to 31 mg l 1 of cip was detected in pharmaceutical wastewater and 2 5 6 5 mg l 1 was measured in surface water samples of lakes and rivers associated with impacts of drug manufacturers 3 cip can cause mortality and genotoxicity even at a few micrograms per liter for various organisms including primary producers e g freshwater cyanobacteria and plants essential for the function and resilience of aquatic ecosystems 4 5 a substantial body of literature suggests that cip carries toxicological consequences at concentrations detectable in a variety of environments the majority of cip is likely released in urban waste streams through sewage disposal due to use in clinical and household environments e g toilet wastewater can exhibit high levels of cip excreted in urine and feces 6 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are tasked with controlling the transport of cip to reduce ecological risks but removal rates in conventional activated sludge processes casp and anaerobic sludge processes vary greatly 20 95 across different wwtps suggesting unpredictable if not unsatisfactory cip control 6 7 full scale membrane bioreactors exhibit higher removal rates 73 on average compared with those of casp 8 several organisms e g bacteria fungi and microalgae are capable of metabolizing cip 9 11 a bradyrhizobium isolate originating from activated sludge as achieved 70 removal via co metabolic pathways at environmentally relevant levels of cip 11 implying a potential use as an auxiliary source for bioaugmentation on cip bearing waste streams however biological degradation alone using pure or mixed cultures usually takes several days making such means less feasible in full scale wwtps with relatively brief hydraulic retention times requiring other treatment alternatives to casp for effective control wastewater treatment processes capable of reliably eliminating micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals and personal care products including cip as well as conventional contaminant targets have yet to be developed micropollutant removal alternatives to casp include but are not limited to coagulation flocculation activated carbon adsorption ozonation and advanced oxidation membrane and attached growth treatment 12 among others micropollutant adsorption treatment using activated carbon ac has become one of the commonly used and effective treatment options for full scale tertiary treatment plants 13 a granular activated carbon process was found to remove more than 60 of cip from wastewaters 14 the adsorption process can be located after the secondary effluent as a post polishing treatment or ac can be directly dosed into activated sludge processes 15 although ac exhibits demonstrated adsorption capacities for diverse classes of micropollutants its massive use may cause environmental consequences since it requires highly demanding thermal energy for activation and emits greenhouse gas while typically produced from nonrenewable coal 13 biochar is a carbonaceous material that can be produced from pyrolysis thermal degradation without oxygen of a wide range of biomass e g wood rice straw and bamboo 16 while ac production is expensive and highly energy demanding the use of biochar may be cost effective and environment friendly e g sequestering carbon and valorizing organic waste 13 various types of biochar have been tested for pollutants adsorption including antibiotics metals and industrial chemicals 17 19 in addition to the adsorption capacity recent research has explored the capabilities of biochar as a microbial carrier due to its large porosity and surface area 16 hence this study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility of mitigating cip by direct dosage of biochar to as to test the effects of biochar as inoculated reactors were dosed with biochar at different amounts the cip removal and other essential functions e g organic matter removal and biomass yield of biochar dosed reactors were monitored from reactor start up to quasi steady state and compared with a control as reactor without biochar this present study also attempted to identify the removal routes e g physicochemical and biological of cip in biochar dosed as reactors and critically evaluated physicochemical mechanisms controlling the fate of cip the results of this work have implications on expanding current wastewater treatment options for micropollutant removal 2 materials and methods 2

demand cod value of the feed was 2 g l 1 the feed also consisted of 1 mg l 1 of cip all reactors were developed by feeding the synthetic wastewater feed twice a week 3 5 days of one cycle duration as described previously by oh and choi 22 at the end of each cycle half of the mixed culture suspension was discarded and replaced with an equal volume of fresh synthetic wastewater the reactors were maintained with an organic loading rate of 0 2 kg of cod m 3 day 1 seven days of solid retention time and 3 4 mg l 1 of dissolved oxygen comparable to those of conventional activated sludge processes 2 2 analysis of cip adsorption kinetics kinetic experiments for cip adsorption to ab were performed in separate bottles with the same condition of the bioreactor operation excluding biomass glass bottles were filled with 200 ml synthetic feed containing 1 mg l 1 cip 1 6 3 7 and 9 8 g l 1 of pre treated ab was put into the bottles which were equivalent to the volumetric ab ration of 10 20 and 40 as in the bioreactors respectively the adsorption of cip to as was investigated in the same manner where only ab was replaced with as at a dose of 3 g vss l 1 as initially inoculated for the bioreactor set up time course cip adsorption data were fitted to pseudo first order pseudo second order and weber and morris intra particle diffusion models 23 as shown in eqs 1 3 respectively 1 d q d

phs the adsorption capacity of cip to ab and as was measured at a ph range of 2 2 10 5 the ph was adjusted using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh the initial cip concentrations were 100 and 33 mg l 1 for ab and as respectively the adsorbent doses were 0 04 and 0 22 g dry weight for ab and as respectively 50 ml vials were used and shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h at rt during these adsorption experiments 2 5 cip biodegradation test removal routes of cip in the bioreactors at steady state were determined using glass separate flasks where the same bioreactor operational conditions were established the mixed liquor suspension including ab was taken from ab40 at day 42 biofilms attached on ab were detached using vortexing 30 s followed by sonication 1 min as described previously 25 both the suspended and detached biofilm biomasses were mixed washed using pbs and resuspended into glass flasks with 1 mg l 1 cip containing synthetic feed the glass flasks were maintained with operational conditions identical to the bioreactors and cip concentrations were followed for 96 h 2 6 characterizing surface properties of ab and as surfaces e g microstructure and attached biofilm of ab were visualized using a scanning electron microscopy sem ab specimens were taken from ab40 at day 42 biofilms on ab surfaces were fixed using 2 5 glutaraldehyde in pbs for 2 h the fixed specimens were dehydrated with ethanol following the procedures previously described 26 the ethanol treated specimens were dried at 105 c for 12 h and sputtered with platinum pt to a thickness of 5 nm the pre treated ab specimens were subjected to the merlin field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem carl zeiss germany fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were obtained using powders of ab and as ground to less than 50 μm in diameter the ground samples were dried in a freeze dryer fdb 5503 operon korea for 3 days the potassium bromide kbr pellets were prepared containing 0 25 of ab or as and kbr ir spectra were

belsorp max bel japan 2 7 analytical methods cip cas number 85721 33 1 was purchased from sigma aldrich korea a cip stock solution 100 mg l 1 was prepared in diw and stored in amber bottles at 4 c until use the concentration of cip was determined using a yl9100 high performance liquid chromatography system young lin instrument co ltd south korea with an ultraviolet detector 278 nm 19 chromatographic separation was conducted at 30 c on a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm id 5 μm agilent usa at 1 0 ml min 1 of a flow rate with 100 μl of the injection volume the mobile phase was prepared in 25 mm nah2po4 adjusted to ph 2 5 using phosphoric acid and mixed with acetonitrile 82 18 v v cod nh4 n and vss were measured according to standard methods 27 the mann whitney u test was performed to assess statistical significance on differential characteristics 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of ab dosed as on antibiotic control fig 1 a shows the concentration of cip in each reactor effluent for the entire period of reactor operation from reactor start up to quasi steady state all effluent cip concentrations were less than 0 2 mg l 1 at day 3 5 the end of the first feeding cycle after which cip removal performance differed significantly among the reactors the control reactor rapidly increased the cip effluent concentration and showed non detectable removals at days 24 42 while the cip levels of the ab10 and ab20 effluents gradually increased and leveled off at days 24 42 ab40 could limit the effluent cip level below 0 025 mg l 1 throughout the entire cycles fig 1a the average cip removal rate during steady state 24 42 days was 35 5 0 5 54 1 0 7 and 94 3 0 7 for ab10 ab20 and ab40 respectively whereas the control system showed negligible removals 0 5 although a single reactor was run with each condition the cip removal performance was quite stable at steady state suggesting little stochastic variation in the reactor performance the cip removal rate of ab10 ab20 and ab40 respectively at steady state was significantly higher than p 0 05 by mann whitney u test that of the control reactor the ols regression analysis fig s1 of the cip removal rates at steady state in relation to the ab volumetric ratio further revealed a significantly positive relationship r 0 99 with p 0 05 strongly suggesting the critical role of ab on controlling the fate of cip cip removal in a laboratory scale membrane bioreactor with 15 g l 1 mixed liquor suspended solids was 53 28 and an up flow biological aerated filter reached approximately 78 29 while the removal rate of an anaerobic reactor was found to be relatively low 15 40 30 a sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed reactor displayed 90 removal from 1 mg l 1 cip containing influent which decreased to 65 with an increase of cip influent concentration to 5 mg l 1 31 considering the removal rates previously reported direct dosage of ab to as with its 40 ab filling ratio was found to provide outstanding performance on cip removal relative to other biological systems as well as the control i e as alone used in this study the potential effects of ab dosage on the essential performances organic matter and ammonia nitrogen removals of as were examined fig 1b shows soluble organic matter represented by soluble cod scod removal in the effluents from the control and three ab dosed reactors while the bioreactors were fed by the influent with 2 000 mg l 1 of scod for the entire feeding cycles effluent scod concentrations were 198 12 mg l 1 in the first feeding cycle and remained stable 45 65 mg l 1 at days 14 42 all reactors achieved high levels of steady state scod removal rates 97 in addition all reactors showed similar vss levels 1 0 1 3 g l 1 and nh4 n removal rates 46 50 at steady state these results collectively suggested that organic matter ammonia removal and biomass yield of as dosed with 10 40 ab volumetric ratios addition were comparable to those of the control reactor suggesting that direct addition of ab into activated sludge may not affect disrupt the key original performances i e removals of conventional organic contaminants while significantly improving controlling antibiotic waste streams 3 2 role of ab as a microbial carrier on antibiotic removal the surfaces of the virgin as purchased nitric acid treated and biofilm attached ab are visualized in fig 2 the biofilm attached ab was sampled from ab40 at steady state compared with fig 2a virgin fig 2b shows holes and macropores with less impurities suggesting that nitric acid pre treatment effectively eliminated debris and impurities fig 2c clearly illustrates a non homogenous irregularly aggregated biofilm distribution on the surface including cocci like bacteria a feedstock material used for pyrolysis affects the microstructure of the biochar surface and its physicochemical properties 32 the surface structure of ab resembled that of biochar derived from a typical hardwood with fiber cells vessels and large pore spaces as observed by gibson 33 cocci like bacteria observed in the ab fig 2c are often found in as flocs and designated g bacteria by morphology which include phylogenetically diverse organisms that play a role in aerobic degradation of organic matter in as 34 the biofilm attached to ab visualized in fig 2c and the outstanding cip removal that occurred in ab40 fig 1 both at steady state led us to examine the potential contribution of biomass on the cip removal both suspended and biofilm biomasses were taken from ab40 and inoculated into separate glass flasks with other experimental conditions identical to those of ab40 fed with 1 mg l 1 of cip the abiotic condition was established without biomass inoculation and the biotic condition with both suspended and biofilm biomasses time course cip concentrations in the two conditions were followed over four days fig s1 slightly longer than a feeding cycle duration the cip levels did not change 0 01 mg l 1 of change in the abiotic condition whereas slightly decreasing cip 0 98 mg l 1 and 0 94 mg l 1 at day 1 and 4 respectively was detectable in the biotic condition suggesting a minor contribution of biosorption biodegradation to the overall cip removal since the tempo of the biotic removal was comparable to the previous kinetics estimate about 0 01 0 08 d 1 10 our and previous study collectively suggested that cip in the biotic conditions is relatively stable and persistent 3 3 adsorption kinetics of cip on ab and as micropollutants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products and industrial chemicals in casp are removed with various routes through biodegradation sorption hydrolysis photolysis and volatilization 22 ab indeed acted as a microbial carrier fig 2c since the biological removal extent observed in a separate flask was much less significant than the overall cip removals 94 that occurred in the ab dosed bioreactors at steady state which prompted further investigation on the contribution of other removal routes e g cip adsorption to ab pretreated ab using nitric acid and as directly taken from an aeration tank of a full scale wwtp neither of which had been exposed to cip were used for characterizing adsorption kinetics fig 3 a shows time course adsorption of cip in glass vials with 10 20 and 40 of ab and 3 g vss l 1 of as respectively simulating the same settings established in the three ab dosed and control reactor in contrast to the minor cip removal contributed by biomass over the four days fig s1 cip was rapidly and substantially removed within three hours fig 3a the pseudo second order kinetic model was the best fit r 2 0 99 for the experimental results with the hardwood based biochar as previously reported for adsorption of a range of trace organic pollutants including cip to other types of biochars 17 19 35 the adsorption rate constant per unit volume lr varied with ab volumetric ratios similarly simulated as in the ab dosed reactors was assessed ab40 48 1 lr mg 1 min 1 ab20 7 4 ab10 1 1 as 0 4 the qe value was in the order of ab40 0 776 mg lr 1 ab20 0 772 ab10 0 513 as 0 432 the much faster and greater adsorption to ab than as highlighted the significant contribution of the ab mediated cip adsorption removal rather than the as mediated biosorption in the ab dosed reactors at steady state while adsorption to ab and as could be described well with the pseudo second order kinetic model only ab mediated adsorption not as mediated was fitted well to the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model multilinear plots with r 2 0 96 in fig 3b suggesting intraparticle diffusion could be more significant in ab mediated adsorption relative to as adsorption processes consist of three steps 1 boundary layer diffusion within the layer on the adsorbent surface 2 intra particle diffusion of adsorbates into the pores and 3 adsorption on the adsorption sites either on the surface or in the pores of adsorbents which is fast and not rate limiting 36 the kinetics results suggested that cip was adsorbed onto the adsorption sites on the outer surface of ab which is easily accessible in the first linear stage while cip was transported into the sites in inner pores with higher resistance in the second linear stage we also observed that the period of the first stage increased as the amount of ab increased providing more outer surfaces the intercept of the plots i e c in eq 3 was significantly smaller than qe indicating that the boundary layer played a minor role in adsorption 3 4 adsorption isotherm of cip on ab and as fig 4 illustrates the increasing adsorption capacity of cip with the increase of cip liquid concentration the maximum adsorption capacity obtained using the langmuir isotherm a better fit to the experimental results than other models was 20 7 and 5 0 mg g 1 table 2 while rl was in a range of 0 30 0 81 and 0 28 0 94 for ab and as respectively given the adsorption behaviors classified based on rl values irreversible 0 favorable 0 1 and unfavorable 1 24 cip adsorption to both ab and as was found to be favorable the maximum cip adsorption capacity values measured in this study were in an agreement with previous estimates 10 96 3 mg g 1 by various types of biochar table s1 and 3 4 by as 37 these results supported the greater cip adsorption capacity by the ab dosed reactors for the longer period fig 1a the good fit of the langmuir isotherm model and the unity 1 00 of β sips isotherm suggested that cip adsorption onto both bc and as could be accomplished through monolayer and homogeneous adsorption and that adsorption enthalpy was not affected by surface coverage 24 experimental data were fitted to the dubinin kaganer radushkevich isotherm model to infer apparent adsorption energy since it is often used to describe the adsorption mechanism with a gaussian energy distribution onto a heterogeneous surface 24 the adsorption mechanism can be predicted depending on the apparent free energy of adsorption e physical e 8 ion exchange 8 e 16 and strongly chemical e 16 24 the e value was 9 4 and 11 8 kj mol 1 for ab and as respectively implying that adsorption occurred primarily by ionic exchange between ionizable protons on the acidic surface cπ h3o 38 and or the exchange of electrons between adsorbates and adsorbents 39 3 5 cip mediated shifts in surface properties fig 5 a presents the ftir spectra of the pre treated and cip adsorbed ab which identified the presence of the oh bond in hydroxyl functional groups the band observed at 3200 3500 cm 1 aliphatic ch2 asymmetric stretch 2917 cm 1 aliphatic ch2 symmetric stretch 2850 cm 1 the stretching of symmetric and asymmetric vibration of co in co2 2360 cm 1 ketonic and carboxylic co 1703 cm 1 cc of the aromatic ring or highly conjugated cc bond generated during pyrolysis of raw material 1595 cm 1 and bending vibration of methyl 1384 cm 1 the presence of co2 2360 cm 1 was probably attributed to the low temperature during manufacture of the ab often detected in those of other types of biochars under slow pyrolysis at relatively low temperatures 400 c 40 the peak at 1270 cm 1 assigned to a phenolic coh bond was probably attributable to adsorbed cip molecules in addition the peak of aromatic cc bonds shifted from 1595 to 1583 cm 1 indicating that π π electron donor acceptor eda interactions contributed to the adsorption 41 the carbon atom bonded to fluorine cc f in cip molecules is a π electron acceptor due to the strong electron withdrawing ability of fluorine 42 the π π eda interactions in the organic compounds adsorption by carbon based materials contribute significantly to the adsorption of aromatics to biochar and graphitic materials 19 43 the spectrum fig 5b of as and cip adsorbed as included peaks associated with the oh of a hydroxyl group compound polyalcohol and saccharides 3200 3500 cm 1 the vibration h bonds between oh groups of cellulose and nh in the amide groups 3280 cm 1 the stretching vibration of ch stretch 2924 cm 1 c h2 asymmetric and symmetric stretch 2852 cm 1 stretching asymmetrical vibrations of coo in peptides and proteins 1652 cm 1 stretching vibration of cn and nh of amide ii of the protein polymer 1548 cm 1 nh3 in peptide 1402 cm 1 and coc of amide iii or aromatic ethers 1242 cm 1 44 the intensities of all peaks at 3280 1652 cm 1 decreased after cip adsorption indicating that a variety of functional groups on as surfaces were involved in cip adsorption zhang et al 45 found that most of the functional groups of extracellular polymeric substances of aerobic sludge including carboxyl hydroxyl and amine bind with cip they also reported that eps contributed to approximately 50 of cip removal by aerobic sludge meanwhile a peak at 1032 cm 1 appearing after cip adsorption represented the cf stretching of cip supporting the cip adsorption onto as 3 6 effects of ph on zeta potential and cip adsorption fig 6 a shows the zeta potential and the cip adsorption amount of ab under different phs the zeta potential of ab was 21 7 mv at ph 3 1 decreased to 49 3 mv at ph 6 and then further decreased 51 7 mv at ph 10 0 biochars show a range of zeta potential from 20 to 0 mv at ph 3 5 which decreases as ph increases 46 the point of zero charge is 3 05 for a tea leaf biochar 19 the surface charge of ab was significantly more negative than those previously reported suggesting that the ab used in this study could have a high adsorption potential to cationic metals via higher electrostatic attraction the highest cip adsorption potential was recorded at ph 6 3 and decreased whether the ph rose or fell the optimum cip adsorption of ab was at the ph range relevant to those in municipal wastewaters consistent with other studies 19 35 the highest adsorption achieved at a nearly neutral ph was attributable to strong hydrophobic effects and π π eda interactions cip exists dominantly as a cation ciph2 zwitterion ciph and anion cip when the ph is 5 9 6 1 8 7 and 8 9 respectively because of the two dissociation constants pka of cip one of the pkas is 5 9 for the carboxylic acid group and the other is 8 8 for the amine group on the piperazine moiety ciph has the highest hydrophobicity among three cip species 43 and is an effective π electron acceptor taking part in strong π π eda interactions with the graphite structures of the ab the ph dependent adsorption observed in fig 6a could be attributable to several mechanisms as ph decreases the π electron accepting ability of cip increases i e favorable to adsorption while the electrostatic attraction and hydrophobicity decrease i e unfavorable to the adsorption 47 therefore hydrophobicity and the electrostatic repulsion likely dominantly affected cip adsorption under acidic ph in contrast as ph increases the electrostatic attraction the π electron accepting ability and hydrophobicity decrease due to deprotonation and ionization 48 which are all unfavorable to the adsorption which led to a significant decrease of cip adsorption the zeta potential and the cip adsorption of as at a range of ph values are presented in fig 6b the surface of as is negative due to the ionization of the anionic functional groups such as carboxylic acid and phosphate 49 the zeta potential of as taken from oxic tanks of three municipal wwtps was in a range of 0 1 to 5 at ph 3 and of 20 to 30 at ph 12 50 the zeta potential of as was 0 to 5 mv at ph 3 and decreased to 20 mv at ph 7 51 the cip adsorption potential onto as was the highest at ph 6 3 and fell as ph either increased or decreased as observed with ab the adsorption of ciph at nearly neutral conditions could be due to a combination of electrostatic attraction cation exchange of the protonated amine cation bridging of divalent cations and the anionic carboxyl group of cip 52 these results suggested that cip adsorption to as may be suppressed by protonation of anionic carboxyl groups under acidic conditions and or by the increase of electrostatic repulsion under alkaline condition 3 7 cip removals in ab dosed as systems mechanism and practical implication while several studies have documented cip adsorption to biochars with other biomass sources 19 35 little is known about the characteristics and mechanism of cip adsorption to hardwood based biochar this work provided insights into mechanisms facilitating cip adsorption to ab a hardwood derived biochar first the cip adsorption kinetics could be primarily governed by the diffusion within macropores rather than meso micropores it was supported by the kinetics model webber morris fig 3a and table 1 and significantly larger macropores relative to mesopores and micropores the latter was experimentally validated with the sem images fig 2b and the smaller volume 0 00887 and 0 00265 cm3 g 1 and specific surface area 2 02 and 2 33 m2 g 1 of mesopores and micropores respectively measured using the bet analysis second the cip adsorption to ab also involved hydrophobic effects of cip π π eda interactions and electrostatic attraction between cip and ab inferred from the surface characterization results figs 5 and 6 the proposed mechanism was also supported by the apparent adsorption energy e of the dubinin kaganer radushkevich isotherm fig 4 and table 2 direct dosage of ab into as could greatly enhance cip removal fig 1a largely via adsorption to ab rather than biodegradation biosorption because the biomass tested in this study was taken from the ab dosed reactor at steady state cip likely had been already adsorbed to the biomass therefore severely limiting further biosorption mediated cip removal that could possibly occur in contrast the as samples freshly taken from full scale wwtps showed rapid and significant biosorption potential highlighting considerable sorption potential to as figs 3 and 4 and tables 1 and 2 accordingly cip removals observed in the control reactor until day 21 could occur via biosorption to suspended biomass compared with the limited adsorption capacity by suspended biomass in the control system at steady state addition of ab could significantly improve the removal capacity 94 cip removals in ab40 our adsorption kinetics and isotherm parameters demonstrated the high adsorption rate maximum adsorption capacity and affinity of cip to ab figs 3 and 4 and tables 1 and 2 the cip concentration tested in this study greatly exceeds the typical levels of cip e g less than dozens of μg l 1 in municipal wastewater influents suggesting that ab dosage might be effective for treating cip bearing waste streams at a wide range of environmentally relevant levels despite the effectiveness given that municipal waste streams carry a lot of organic and inorganic compounds that may compete interfere with the antibiotic adsorption to biochar we should therefore suggest further experimental investigations e g antibiotic removal performance breakthrough time and regeneration strategy of biochar of the removal performance using both the bench and pilot scale as systems dosed with biochar receiving real wastewaters cip removals in full scale wwtps are often attributed to biosorption onto as biomass 12 52 while cip represents a poorly biodegradable micropollutant 52 the disappearance of cip resulting from adsorption to wasted as was not biodegradation may give rise to another critical issue as the cip released with was may perturb ecosystems of post treatment processes e g anaerobic digestion and biosolid amended sites for example our previous study revealed that 0 5 mg l 1 of cip could cause significant inhibition on aerobic activated sludge e g potential heterotrophic and nutrient removal activities and anaerobic methanogenic sludge e g fermentation and methane production activities with alteration on the microbial community structure and diversity 7 given the faster and higher adsorption capacity of ab than as dosing biochar into as would help effectively remove cip from the was as well as the wastewater effluents the performances of biochar dosed bioreactors can be further improved through modifying surface properties of biochar there are many factors e g biomass feedstock pyrolysis condition such as temperature and pretreatment affecting the surface properties e g surface to volume ratio of biochar and thus potentially enhancing the treatment performance adsorption kinetics isotherm hence the ab dosage 10 40 tested in this study fig 1 may be further reduced through surface modification of biochar as both an adsorbent and a microbial carrier despite its great adsorption capacity of biochar as observed in this study figs 3 and 4 biochar has a finite adsorption capacity once biochar reaches its maximum adsorption capacity the used biochar as activated carbon materials would be disposed to landfills incinerators or regenerated recycled a variety of regeneration methods for biochar using thermal energy solvent microwave and supercritical fluid have been developed 53 which may significantly extend the life of biochar and thus reduce the operational cost the technical feasibility of biochar addition into as for micropollutant removal observed in this study strongly suggests future investigations on the surface modification and regeneration methods of biochar 4 conclusions as reactors with varied ab volume ratios were established for treating antibiotic wastewaters removal efficiency of cip was correlated with the added amount of ab achieving up to 94 of cip removals by ab dosed as reactors while a control as reactor without ab showed a non detectable removal adsorption kinetics and isotherm results suggested the majority of cip was removed by adsorption onto ab primarily via intraparticle diffusion π π eda interaction and hydrophobic and electrostatic attraction the outstanding cip removal rates observed in this work proposed that direct dosage of biochar into as system may be a cost effective and simple alternative treatment option for antibiotic bearing waste streams declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

14184,selenium has been emerging as a serious health hazard due to presence in groundwater used as source of potable water in several regions of the world concentration of selenium in such contaminated water is sometimes as high as 400 700 μg l removal of selenium from such water to the safe level of40 μg l is a big challenge to the scientific community selenium was efficiently removed from live contaminated groundwater in this study by flat sheet cross flow nanofiltration membrane modules under response surface optimized conditions the governing parameters such as ph feed dilution cross flow rate and trans membrane pressure were optimized through judicious selection of membrane module and operating conditions a low cost yet efficient nanofiltration based process for selenium removal has been developed the novel process uses commercial polyamide nanofiltration membrane in flat sheet and cross flow module that yields a sustainable pure water flux of around 140 l m2h at only 14 bar pressure while removing above 98 of selenium from contaminated water under response surface optimized conditions thus potential of a novel nanofiltration membrane based process and system is established which is scalable and can be quickly adopted in offering relief to the suffering milieu keywords selenium removal nanocomposite membrane cross flow module optimized filtration 1 introduction treatment of selenium contaminated ground water for potable purpose is a big challenge due to high solubility of selenium in water coupled with wide toxic concentration range in which

widespread across the world 1 3 groundwater contamination has posed a major threat worldwide where many developing countries use groundwater as the major source of potable water particularly in the rural areas selenium contamination problem is of relatively recent detection among the major water contaminants selenium se has been reported 4 as an emerging one due to toxicological effects though it has been known as an essential micronutrient in small doses the recommended dietary intake allowance of selenium ranges from 40 to 400 μg day and permissible maximum concentration in drinking water is 40 μg l this indicates the double edge sword effects of selenium where both deficiency and excessive intake can cause mortal health hazards 5 6 many countries such as china japan jordan usa ireland and india are affected by excessive selenium in groundwater 7 in india cases of selenium toxicity has been reported from north west areas adjoining shivalik ranges spread over the provinces of haryana punjab and low lying areas of himachal pradesh the crisis emanating from selenium contamination is further aggravated in the aquifers around the industrial belts of punjab and himachal pradesh where the degree of contamination has been reported to be as high as 700 μg l and 4475 μg l respectively 8 9 far above the maximum contamination limit of 40 μg l the major sources of selenium comprise of both natural and anthropogenic activities such as volcanic eruption erosion from selenium rich sedimentary rocks mining agriculture and combustion of selenium rich coal use of insecticide metal and oil refining 10 11 besides being an emerging contaminant in the environment selenium has drawn much attention recently as it has wide application in the fields of molecular genetic biochemical medicine and material science 12 selenium has physical properties in line with arsenic and chemical characteristics close to those of sulphur selenium can occur in inorganic organic and amino acid compounds in the environment as well as in the biological systems inorganic selenium compounds such as selenate seo4 2 selenite seo3 2 selenide se2 and elemental selenium se0 are mainly found in surface and groundwater organic species are generally prevalent in terrain and plants as methylselenol methylselenides trimethylselenoniumcation dimethyldiselenide dimethylseleniumsulfide and selenoamino acids 13 selenide is the most toxic among all the organic species but fortunately it briskly oxidizes to selenite se iv in presence of air when selenium contaminated water is used for irrigation it results in seleniferous soil and selenium gets accumulated in the crops grown on such soil and directly enters the food chain exposure to excessive selenium may result in gastrointestinal disorders hair brittleness and discoloration of nails neurological disorders and birth deformities high level of selenium poisoning can lead to pulmonary congestion extensive fibrosis or liver cirrhosis and death 14 therefore new technologies need to be developed for selenium removal specifically from aqueous systems recent studies show that adsorbents such as layered double hydroxide intercalated with zwitterionic glycine 15 cellulose acetate functionalized zno nanocomposite 16 have high selenium sorption capacities but frequent replacement and disposal of spent saturated adsorbent remains a major problem many studies on ion exchange have been reported but much of its effectiveness is lost in presence of the competing ions and cost is always another major concern 17 reverse osmosis ro delivers high degree of selenium separation without any addition of third component and thermal energy but involves high operational costs 18 19 the current ecosystem sustainability scenarios demand urgent development of a simple clean and cost effective selenium removal technology for purifying contaminated drinking water very few studies on nf ro hollow fiber spiral wound membrane modules have been reported on selenium removal 20 23 despite reasonably good rejection in some of these studies flux still remains low in some cases with synthetic membranes flux decline is so rapid that within an hour the system turns inoperable this is despite conducting experiments with synthetic solution and under ideal conditions moreover where a purification level ensured by nanofiltration nf is quite acceptable by drinking water standard 24 there is hardly any justification in deploying ro membrane based system at much higher cost therefore a sustainable technology needs to be developed based on nf membrane that permits operation at much lower operating pressure than what is required in ro based separation this study is conducted with real contaminated water from punjab province of india where the problem is very acute a membrane module is selected that is largely fouling free from a lot an appropriate polyamide composite membrane is screened for selenium filtration which excludes selenium by donnan principle as sustained flux and rejection is largely a function of operating conditions and membrane characteristics the system is

tabulated in table 1sm in the supplementary material experimental investigations on selenium removal were conducted in flat sheet cross flow module fscf in continuous mode using three varieties of nanofiltration membranes the experimental set up comprises a continuously stirred feed tank a diaphragm pump for pumping water at high pressure through two parallel cross flow modules pressure gauges and rotameter were used in monitoring pressure and cross flow velocity respectively during filtration as shown in fig 1 before carrying out selenium removal studies each membrane was operated at a pressure of 15 kgf cm2 for half an hour by using only deionised water thereafter flux and rejection were determined for three different membranes over a pressure range of 6 15 kgf cm2 2 3 analytics

comprehensive study of three different nanofiltration membranes was conducted under different operating conditions in flat sheet membrane module so as to select the best membrane out of a given lot 4 1 1permeate flux behaviour under varying trans membrane pressure different operating pressures were selected in the range of 6 15 kgf cm2 and corresponding permeate fluxes as obtained for nf20 nf2 and nf1 membranes have been presented in fig 2 though such linear dependency of the effluent flux with increase in trans membrane pressure regardless of membrane nature have been observed in many cases 25 26 this illustration gives an indication of the relative fluxes of the investigated membranes at a given pressure nf2 membrane in this study exhibits the maximum flux followed by nf20 and nf1 this directly specifies that nf1is the tightest among these membranes whereas nf2 is the loosest type 4 1 1 rejection trend under varying trans membrane pressure removal performance of selenium from groundwater has been studied on three different polyamide nanofiltration membranes with a constant initial concentration of 1600 ppb and a cross flow velocity of 700 lmh litres per square meter per hour rejection of selenium increases linearly with trans membrane pressure regardless of the type of membrane used and is well illustrated in fig 3 removal of selenium increases sharply with increase in operating pressure up to a level of 15 kg cm2 however further increase in pressure beyond this does not show any significant impact on rejection of selenium highest rejection is achieved by nf1 followed by nf20 and nf2 respectively at any applied pressure in this investigation removal of selenium by nanofiltration membranes can be explained using donnan separation as well as the solution diffusion principle the rejection behaviour is explained by solution diffusion mechanism in which solute and solvent fluxes are uncoupled and as solvent flux increases with trans membrane pressure the solute flux decreases implying greater rejection 4 1 2 effect of ph on flux and rejection of selenium fig 4 shows that increase in ph from 2 to 12 results insignificant increase both in selenium rejection as well as insolvent flux it is observed that selenium rejection increases from 40 to 97 2 for nf1 26 to 66 for nf2 and 32 to 78 5 for nf20 membrane pure water flux increases with increasing ph in similar fashion and reaches a maximum of 130 4 166 and 281 for nf1 nf20 and nf2 respectively at a constant trans membrane pressure fluid flow rate and feed concentration such positive effect of ph on rejection of other anions such as arsenic and fluoride by nanofiltration membrane has been reported in earlier studies 27 28 in aqueous system selenite and selenate undergoes protonation and deprotonation depending on the ph of the system with increase in ph selenite deprotonates as h2seo3 h hseo3 hseo3 h seo3 2 this imparts more negative charge to the corresponding anion and enhances overall selenium rejection by negatively charged nanofiltration membrane superficial pore radii of polyamide nanofiltration membranes alter with ph of the solution 29 whereas a considerable increase in membrane charge concentration is being observed with increase in ph in earlier studies 30 4 1 4effect of fluid flow on overall flux and selenium removal fig 5 shows a positive effect of fluid flow rate on permeate flux this figure exhibits that as fluid flow rate increases from 300lph to 750lph at a fixed trans membrane pressure of 12 kgf cm2 the flux increases regardless of the type of membrane used on comparing membranes performance nf2 membrane flux increases up to 292lmh for a maximum rate of fluid flow of 750lph followed by nf20 in which flux increases upto 182 lmh whereas nf1 shows a slight gain in flux from 102 lmh to 128 lmh these trends are associated with the pore radius high flux is obtained in nf2 the loosest membrane among these and lowest flux in nf1 membrane indicating its dense character increase in hourly fluid rate for a particular membrane reduces concentration polarization significantly by the tangential action on membrane surface and results in increased permeate flux experimental data shows that rejection by all the nanofiltration membranes used has linear relationship with rate of fluid flow and increases a fluid rate increases from 300lph to 750lph at a fixed pressure of 12 kgf cm2 high rate of fluid flow reduces fouling as the tangential flow over the membrane surface sweeps away the deposited layers of materials from membrane surface this maximizes overall effective membrane surface area and both high permeate flux and high degree of separation can be achieved fig 5 shows that enhancement in separation efficiency for nf2 nf20 and nf1 are by 9 6 and 4 respectively this also indicates that the highest enhancement in separation efficiency following increase in rate of fluid flows is exhibited by the most loosely packed nanofiltration membrane 4 1 3 effects of initial concentration of selenium in feed on permeate flux and removal the comparative flux and rejection of nf membranes as depicted in fig 6 suggest that higher feed concentration leaves an adverse effect on selenium removal and permeate flux the data on nf1 membrane shows that rejection decreases from 91 6 to 88 8 when initial selenium concentration is reduced from 400 ppb to 5000 ppb it can be noticed that initially this effect was not so substantial but beyond a concentration of 1600 ppb the rejection drops considerably since the effective charge on membrane surface is limited increase in feed concentration results in partial neutralization of anionic surface of the membrane by counter ions and diminishes the electrostatic contacts among the ions and membrane the experimental data also shows a negative effect on permeate flux for all the three membranes concentration polarization is the most accountable factor for this adverse effect high selenium concentration results in forming a fouling film above the membrane surface and offers further resistance to the effective mass transfer with increasing salt concentration osmotic pressure also increases and accordingly the effective trans membrane pressure decreases from the comparative study of three membranes it is elucidated that nf1 membranes give high rejection efficiency and permeate flux under a given set of operating conditions as compared to others two membranes therefore nf1 membrane has been selected for further optimization of module for developing linear and combined correlation between independent individual variables and dependent parameters 4 2 module performance the response function coefficients for rejection efficiency y1 and permeate flux y2 were computed by experimental data tabulated in table 3sm where the ranges of input parameters are trans membrane pressure 6 18 bar fluid flow rate 100 900lph ph of feed 2 10 and initial feed concentration 400 2000 ppb of selenium it has been observed that the model summary for this particular case of selenium removal agrees considerably with the experimental observations the results show that low standard deviation values 2 64 and 5 17 and high correlation coefficient values r2 of 0 9773 and 0 9781 for selenium rejection and pure water flux respectively the model implication is reflected by high f value 46 19 for selenium removal the feed ph trans membrane pressure and fluid rate of fluid flow have a great impingement on both rejection efficiency and permeate flux and the same is strongly supported by values of p 1 moreover an adequate precision value i e 28 679 indicates that good capability of model for predicting system performance the module experimental data is in line with the final regression model suggested by anova and is represented in terms of coded variables eq 4 5 4 s e l e n i u m r e j e c t i o n e f f i c i e n c y 94 80 11 92 a 0 33 b 0 021 c 0 062 d 0

experimental percentage selenium rejection 98 6 is found to be quite close to the model predicted value 98 2 similar results are obtained in case of permeate flux of treated water where experimental permeate flux 139 lmh is almost equivalent to model predicted flux 138 5 lmh it can be noticed that the desirability function is very much close to 1 i e 0 966 for selenium removal which reflects the validation of model predicted data with experimental results fig 7sm in the supplementary material illustrates the desirability factor of the model at varied working pressure and hourly fluid rate with a highest value of 0 966 for selenium removal and the process parameters pressure of 13 bar and cross flow rate of 700 lph ph value 8 0 are found to be optimized condition of this module selenium removal efficiency and permeate treated water flux are dependent on independent controlling parameters and is well demonstrated by response surface 3d plots fig 8a b represents the influence of operating pressure and rate of the fluid flow on selenium rejection and permeate flux respectively at a constant ph and initial selenium concentration of 6 0 1200 ppb respectively confirming a strong influence of operating pressure on flux and rejection rather than rate of fluid flow the highest percentage selenium removal is found to be 98 6 with 138 lmh flux value at 15 bar working pressure and an hourly fluid rate of 700 l fig 8c and d explain selenium rejection trend and water flux under varying ph and operating pressure while hourly fluid rate and feed concentration are fixed at a value of 500lph and 1200 ppb respectively both the operational parameters were found to have profound effect on rejection efficiency the membrane negative charge gets enhanced with increase in ph and rejects anions more efficiently at higher ph due to donnan exclusion principle high ph can also results in transforming selenium speciation in towards higher anionic forms further enhances rejection of selenium anions which is reflected in such high selenium rejection 98 6 under 15 bar operating pressure and at a ph 8 00 in the rsm plot however from the plot 8d it can be concluded that water flux has a linear and quite strong dependency on pressure change rather than ph of the system initial concentration of selenium has also substantial influence on selenium rejection while maintaining ph at 6 and fluid flow rate at 500lph as interpreted in fig 8e the rejection percentage reaches a maximum of 98 9 under 15 bar operating pressure with an initial selenium concentration of 1600 ppb again flux value does not vary much with the change in initial concentration value the permeate flux reaches maximum of 138 lmh under aforesaid operating pressure and initial selenium concentration it can be noticed that up to the aforesaid concentration negative effect of concentration polarization are not visible however increasing concentration above a certain value may lead to concentration polarization since the interfacial membrane surface area for effective mass transfer is constant and this pile up the anions on the membrane surface causes increase in mass transfer resistance thus an optimized set of operating parameters obtained through response surface methodology comprises of operating pressure around 13 14 bar initial selenium concentration of 1600 ppb with an hourly fluid rate of 700 l and at a ph of 8 using these set of optimized operating conditions selenium contaminated water can be successfully treated with an elevated flux of about 140 lmh and a rejection efficacy of 98 the flux obtained during this investigation seems to be quite higher when compared with the earlier reported selenium removal studies the major problem associated with separation by using membrane technology is concentration polarization and decline in flux therefore for determining the fouling propensity of nf1 membrane the module was run continuously for around 240 h and it was observed that a total declination of only 6 06 flux has occurred as shown in fig 7 a comparison with literature as presented in table 2 shows the membrane used in this work is one of the best performers in consideration of overall performance in terms of flux and rejection further the membrane effectiveness can be revived by merely extensive washing with mild solutions of naoh and hno3acid 200 ppm naocl solution can also be used to sterilize the membranes to reduce minor external fouling impact 5 conclusion for selenium removal from drinking water an efficient yet low cost system comprising flat sheet cross flow module of composite polyamide nanofiltration membrane under response surface optimized operating conditions has been developed the investigated module under response surface optimized operating conditions ensured a high degree of separation of selenium 98 while maintaining a sustained high flux of 140 lmh at 14 bar operating pressure the membrane module is largely fouling free as evident in very limited flux decline 5 6 despite prolonged operation of 250 h possibility of treating contaminated groundwater in a very simple design that involves little monitoring and operational cost leads to the conclusion that the proposed process can be scaled up easily and holds the potential of treatment of selenium contaminated water for potable purpose at a quite low cost acknowledgement the authors are thankful to the department of science and technology for infrastructure and the ministry of human resource development govt of india for fellowship support

rate on permeate flux this figure exhibits that as fluid flow rate increases from 300lph to 750lph at a fixed trans membrane pressure of 12 kgf cm2 the flux increases regardless of the type of membrane used on comparing membranes performance nf2 membrane flux increases up to 292lmh for a maximum rate of fluid flow of 750lph followed by nf20 in which flux increases upto 182 lmh whereas nf1 shows a slight gain in flux from 102 lmh to 128 lmh these trends are associated with the pore radius high flux is obtained in nf2 the loosest membrane among these and lowest flux in nf1 membrane indicating its dense character increase in hourly fluid rate for a particular membrane reduces concentration polarization significantly by the tangential action on membrane surface and results in increased permeate flux experimental data shows that rejection by all the nanofiltration membranes used has linear relationship with rate of fluid flow and increases a fluid rate increases from 300lph to 750lph at a fixed pressure of 12 kgf cm2 high rate of fluid flow reduces fouling as the tangential flow over the membrane surface sweeps away the deposited layers of materials from membrane surface this maximizes overall effective membrane surface area and both high permeate flux and high degree of separation can be achieved fig 5 shows that enhancement in separation efficiency for nf2 nf20 and nf1 are by 9 6 and 4 respectively this also indicates that the highest enhancement in separation efficiency following increase in rate of fluid flows is exhibited by the most loosely packed nanofiltration membrane 4 1 3 effects of initial concentration of selenium in feed on permeate flux and removal the comparative flux and rejection of nf membranes as depicted in fig 6 suggest that higher feed concentration leaves an adverse effect on selenium removal and permeate flux the data on nf1 membrane shows that rejection decreases from 91 6 to 88 8 when initial selenium concentration is reduced from 400 ppb to 5000 ppb it can be noticed that initially this effect was not so substantial but beyond a concentration of 1600 ppb the rejection drops considerably since the effective charge on membrane surface is limited increase in feed concentration results in partial neutralization of anionic surface of the membrane by counter ions and diminishes the electrostatic contacts among the ions and membrane the experimental data also shows a negative effect on permeate flux for all the three membranes concentration polarization is the most accountable factor for this adverse effect high selenium concentration results in forming a fouling film above the membrane surface and offers further resistance to the effective mass transfer with increasing salt concentration osmotic pressure also increases and accordingly the effective trans membrane pressure decreases from the comparative study of three membranes it is elucidated that nf1 membranes give high rejection efficiency and permeate flux under a given set of operating conditions as compared to others two membranes therefore nf1 membrane has been selected for further optimization of module for developing linear and combined correlation between independent individual variables and dependent parameters 4 2 module performance the response function coefficients for rejection efficiency y1 and permeate flux y2 were computed by experimental data tabulated in table 3sm where the ranges of input parameters are trans membrane pressure 6 18 bar fluid flow rate 100 900lph ph of feed 2 10 and initial feed concentration 400 2000 ppb of selenium it has been observed that the model summary for this particular case of selenium removal agrees considerably with the experimental observations the results show that low standard deviation values 2 64 and 5 17 and high correlation coefficient values r2 of 0 9773 and 0 9781 for selenium rejection and pure water flux respectively the model implication is reflected by high f value 46 19 for selenium removal the feed ph trans membrane pressure and fluid rate of fluid flow have a great impingement on both rejection efficiency and permeate flux and the same is strongly supported by values of p 1 moreover an adequate precision value i e 28 679 indicates that good capability of model for predicting system performance the module experimental data is in line with the final regression model suggested by anova and is represented in terms of coded variables eq 4 5 4 s e l e n i u m r e j e c t i o n e f f i c i e n c y 94 80 11 92 a 0 33 b 0 021 c 0 062 d 0

experimental percentage selenium rejection 98 6 is found to be quite close to the model predicted value 98 2 similar results are obtained in case of permeate flux of treated water where experimental permeate flux 139 lmh is almost equivalent to model predicted flux 138 5 lmh it can be noticed that the desirability function is very much close to 1 i e 0 966 for selenium removal which reflects the validation of model predicted data with experimental results fig 7sm in the supplementary material illustrates the desirability factor of the model at varied working pressure and hourly fluid rate with a highest value of 0 966 for selenium removal and the process parameters pressure of 13 bar and cross flow rate of 700 lph ph value 8 0 are found to be optimized condition of this module selenium removal efficiency and permeate treated water flux are dependent on independent controlling parameters and is well demonstrated by response surface 3d plots fig 8a b represents the influence of operating pressure and rate of the fluid flow on selenium rejection and permeate flux respectively at a constant ph and initial selenium concentration of 6 0 1200 ppb respectively confirming a strong influence of operating pressure on flux and rejection rather than rate of fluid flow the highest percentage selenium removal is found to be 98 6 with 138 lmh flux value at 15 bar working pressure and an hourly fluid rate of 700 l fig 8c and d explain selenium rejection trend and water flux under varying ph and operating pressure while hourly fluid rate and feed concentration are fixed at a value of 500lph and 1200 ppb respectively both the operational parameters were found to have profound effect on rejection efficiency the membrane negative charge gets enhanced with increase in ph and rejects anions more efficiently at higher ph due to donnan exclusion principle high ph can also results in transforming selenium speciation in towards higher anionic forms further enhances rejection of selenium anions which is reflected in such high selenium rejection 98 6 under 15 bar operating pressure and at a ph 8 00 in the rsm plot however from the plot 8d it can be concluded that water flux has a linear and quite strong dependency on pressure change rather than ph of the system initial concentration of selenium has also substantial influence on selenium rejection while maintaining ph at 6 and fluid flow rate at 500lph as interpreted in fig 8e the rejection percentage reaches a maximum of 98 9 under 15 bar operating pressure with an initial selenium concentration of 1600 ppb again flux value does not vary much with the change in initial concentration value the permeate flux reaches maximum of 138 lmh under aforesaid operating pressure and initial selenium concentration it can be noticed that up to the aforesaid concentration negative effect of concentration polarization are not visible however increasing concentration above a certain value may lead to concentration polarization since the interfacial membrane surface area for effective mass transfer is constant and this pile up the anions on the membrane surface causes increase in mass transfer resistance thus an optimized set of operating parameters obtained through response surface methodology comprises of operating pressure around 13 14 bar initial selenium concentration of 1600 ppb with an hourly fluid rate of 700 l and at a ph of 8 using these set of optimized operating conditions selenium contaminated water can be successfully treated with an elevated flux of about 140 lmh and a rejection efficacy of 98 the flux obtained during this investigation seems to be quite higher when compared with the earlier reported selenium removal studies the major problem associated with separation by using membrane technology is concentration polarization and decline in flux therefore for determining the fouling propensity of nf1 membrane the module was run continuously for around 240 h and it was observed that a total declination of only 6 06 flux has occurred as shown in fig 7 a comparison with literature as presented in table 2 shows the membrane used in this work is one of the best performers in consideration of overall performance in terms of flux and rejection further the membrane effectiveness can be revived by merely extensive washing with mild solutions of naoh and hno3acid 200 ppm naocl solution can also be used to sterilize the membranes to reduce minor external fouling impact 5 conclusion for selenium removal from drinking water an efficient yet low cost system comprising flat sheet cross flow module of composite polyamide nanofiltration membrane under response surface optimized operating conditions has been developed the investigated module under response surface optimized operating conditions ensured a high degree of separation of selenium 98 while maintaining a sustained high flux of 140 lmh at 14 bar operating pressure the membrane module is largely fouling free as evident in very limited flux decline 5 6 despite prolonged operation of 250 h possibility of treating contaminated groundwater in a very simple design that involves little monitoring and operational cost leads to the conclusion that the proposed process can be scaled up easily and holds the potential of treatment of selenium contaminated water for potable purpose at a quite low
