6880,water diplomacy needs institutional anchoring international river basin organizations rbos being the result of diplomatic efforts by riparian states intending to create a framework for cooperation between themselves over shared water bodies can provide such institutional anchors rbos ensure that agreements to cooperate are turned into a long term commitment by riparian states to jointly manage shared water resources and in turn foster mutually beneficial cooperation over time rbos have been the subject of detailed examinations of their conceptual core of their manifold functions of their effectiveness in achieving their goals and so forth however the legal nature of these entities has so far received limited attention notwithstanding its significance in empowering rbos to act as institutional anchors for water diplomacy legitimate questions arise for instance in relation to their legal personality or lack thereof or to matters such as immunities and privileges this paper will review key legal aspects of rbos and illustrate them with examples a sound understanding of such issues is crucial to supporting fruitful discussions between state members about the legal design of an rbo in order to fulfill their particular needs in the context of water diplomacy keywords river basin organization transboundary water management water diplomacy law of international institutions water law 1 introduction water diplomacy needs institutional anchoring international river basin organizations rbos may provide such institutional anchors they are the institutional outcome of diplomatic efforts by riparian states intending to create a framework for cooperation over shared water bodies and to implement treaty provisions that have been entered into on a long term institutional basis at the same time they house water diplomacy efforts themselves aiming at ensuring the cooperative and sustainable management of their respective basin yet the institutional anchoring of water diplomacy in rbos is challenging among the many challenges rbos and their member states might be facing the internal legal and institutional nature of rbos determines whether and to what extent they can provide effective and functioning institutional anchors for water diplomacy at the heart of diplomacy is in broad terms the concept of the conduct of relationships using peaceful means by and among international actors cooper et al 2013 2 while both academia and policy makers are increasingly focusing on water diplomacy there is no consistent definition of it and concepts and definitions vary considerably across different research and policy institutions molnar et al 2017 water diplomacy is understood for the purpose of this article to include the conduct of relationships between riparian states of shared water resources to enhance cooperation between them in relation to the joint management of those resources but with regard to goals beyond the water sector namely regional stability and peace schmeier 2016 international actors in water diplomacy as in diplomacy more generally include states and the institutions they create to deal with common matters rbos rbos may be classified as international organizations which is why the law of international organizations and related legal and institutional matters are of great relevance to ascertain whether and to what extent rbos may be effective anchors for water diplomacy rbos are such anchors in that they provide a platform for member states that have established them to engage regularly and on the basis of clearly defined legal and institutional structures in water cooperation and diplomacy matters they do so pursuant to the rules of procedure agreed in their constituting instruments which set out the manner in which they are to operate in this context rbos also play a key role in addressing and assisting with the mitigation of disagreements or conflicts that can occur in a shared basin through actions permitted by the rules of the organization e g by engaging in data gathering analysis and exchange activities or by managing pre defined processes such as prior notifications this makes rbos and their individual staff essential actors in water diplomacy it is therefore vital that the practical aspects of such organizations and the processes of interaction they manage are carefully considered and crafted so that they may function as smoothly as possible to achieve their intended purpose indeed both theoretical findings and empirical evidence reveal that rbos have not always been able to fulfill their role of facilitating effective water diplomacy and of promoting cooperation effectively among the many reasons for this legal characteristics have been of importance in numerous cases for instance in the nile river basin a lack of clarity over the legal status of the nile basin initiative nbi has sometimes prevented it from taking a more active role in ongoing conflicts between some of the riparians similarly water resources shared between the us and mexico where the mandate of an rbo has not been sufficiently clearly defined have suffered from a lack of pro active engagement of the rbo in water diplomacy and in the mekong river basin disagreements over whether tributaries fall under the scope of the 1995 mekong agreement continue to hamper the mekong river commission mrc s effectiveness thus far limited academic attention has been devoted to this topic a more thorough review is therefore warranted to enhance the understanding of the impact of the legal nature of rbos on their ability to play a role in water diplomacy this article offers a starting point for this review by providing an overview of key issues from the perspective of the law of international organizations after linking the law of international organizations to research on rbos it focuses on specific dimensions of rbos that have been identified as rbo internal legal and institutional factors that influence an rbo s ability to be an effective anchor for water diplomacy the legal status of an rbo and its mandate and the privileges and immunities it has been granted by its member states and most notably the host state in doing so the article ultimately argues that the legal nature of rbos needs to be better understood not only by international lawyers but by all those engaged in international river basins whether water managers or diplomats because of its potential impact on effective institutional anchoring for water diplomacy by rbos 2 the institutional anchoring of rbos the international law perspective the concept of institutional anchoring of cooperation between riparian states to shared watercourses began to develop in europe in the early 19th century with the treaty of vienna of 1815 1 see article cviii to cxvi relating to navigation issues of shared rivers and the appointment of commissioners meeting on a regular basis fao legislative study 65 1 and the establishment of the rhine and danube commissions which centered on navigation over time the focus shifted to other uses with potential impact on riparians and thus to non navigational uses of shared watercourses the notion of joint institutions remained already in 1911 the institut de droit international in its madrid declaration 2 declaration of madrid 20 april 1911 2 considered their relevance and recommended to riparians to appoint permanent joint commissions with decision making powers or advisory competences on matters relating to transboundary water resources art 7 3 international regulation regarding the use of international watercourses for purposes other than navigation it has previously proposed riparian commissions in relation to navigation only in 1867 international regulation on river navigation resolution of heidelberg 9 september 1887 in fao legislative study 65 3 thus joint institutions and their objectives of cooperation between riparians have been in the minds of water managers and lawyers for over two centuries scholars from both legal and water management backgrounds have acknowledged that institutionalized cooperation between states is a natural and logical outgrowth of heavy reliance upon shared water resources mccaffrey 2007 156 and that institutions are a mitigating factor in conflict since they promote basin wide interstate co operation and thereby increase water security j√§gerskog 2002 78 most recently in the emerging water diplomacy debate scholars as well as practitioners have assigned rbos a key role in water diplomacy processes mrc 2016 schmeier 2016 molnar et al 2017 while there is no customary rule in international water law requiring the establishment of joins institutions over shared watercourses 4 the details of such institutions is also not set out in customary law boisson de chazournes 2002 commentary to the berlin rules 2004 4 both the united nations 1997 convention on the non navigational uses of international watercourses 1997 convention 5 the 1997 convention is in fact based on existing state practice including the many rbos established before the adoption of the convention such as those already of the danube rhine and oder and more 5 and the 1992 united nations economic commission for europe unece convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes 1992 convention call for their establishment 6 notably in the case of the former it is an encouragement note art 8 2 which refers to joint mechanisms or commissions and art 24 2 whereas in the latter it is a mandatory requirement art 9 2 contains a non exhaustive list of functions of a joint body though no indications of the expected structure of the institution and of more technical aspects of its operations this is clarified in the united nations economic commission for europe unece implementation guide of 2009 which lists four common characteristics of such commissions including 1 a permanent body meeting reasonably regularly 2 composed of representatives from the riparian states from water related agencies 3 with decision making executive and subsidiary bodies e g working or expert groups etc and 4 a secretariat note art 1 5 which defines what is a joint body namely any bilateral or multilateral commission or other appropriate arrangements for the cooperation between the riparian parties 6 some regional legal instruments require the same whether the 2000 eu water framework directive art 3 or the 2000 southern african development community sadc s revised sadc protocol on shared water resources art 5 3 as regards academic examinations of the legal dimensions of rbos and their impacts on rbos role to be effective anchors for water diplomacy while the various dimensions of rbos and their underlying agreements have been studied extensively ranging from their emergence and why states in some basins chose to establish rbos yet not in others bernauer 1997 song and whittington 2004 tir and ackermann 2009 to questions relating specific design features of rbos chenoweth and feitelson 2001 boisson de chazournes 2002 mostert 2005 dombrowsky 2007 zawahri 2009 gerlak et al 2011 giz 2014 blumstein and schmier 2017 examinations of legal aspects from the perspective of international institutional law has been so far limited if addressed at all legal dimensions of rbos have featured in more general studies of rbos generally when analyzing different legal and institutional features of rbos and their influence on for instance the functionality or the effectiveness of an rbo schmeier 2013 alternatively they have been part of broader publications rather than being the focus of standalone papers as with caponera s 1992 work on principles of water law and administration they have also been addressed through more general discussions of international water law where concerns over effectiveness of the management of shared watercourses have drawn authors to discuss the role of institutions boisson de chazournes laurence 2013 brown 2013 7 both present the history and evolution of basin organizations and commissions as does caponera 1992 with brown weiss noting the transition from navigation to the broader range of activities that rbos now cover she also considers their functions and effectiveness whereas boisson de chazournes examines their role as a forum for dialogue cooperation and dispute resolution 2002 as well as their contribution to developing and implementing international law 7 more general international law and institutional scholarship have not shown extensive interest in rbo unless when considering them as technical and thus sometimes partial institutions pennetta 2015 71 overall analyses of the legal dimensions of institutionalized cooperation over shared water resources are rare and most often only related to other research questions accordingly an examination of the legal features of rbos or the lack thereof and the implications they can have on an rbo s role as the institutional home for water diplomacy has often been neglected this gap is what the remainder of this paper aims to fill 3 key features of rbos under the law of international organisations this section applies insights from the law of international organizations to rbos as specific types of international organizations it focuses on those features of international law that are of particular relevance to those engaged in water diplomacy whether from the water management or the foreign policy perspective these are the nature of rbos as international organizations their legal personality and their organizational design their mandate and their ability to create norms as well as their privileges and immunities 3 1 defining rbos as international organizations before examining the different legal aspects relevant to the role of rbos in water diplomacy it is important to establish their legal nature as an international organization this should be based on the examination of the key elements of the law of international institutions determining what constitutes an international organization although there is no agreed definition klabbers 2015a the following guiding elements have been identified 1 a treaty between states creating the organization 2 the organization possesses at least one organ 3 and the organization has a volont√© distincte in other words it has a will distinct from that of its member states klabbers 2015a 8 notably the vienna convention on the law of treaties of 1969 defines an international organization as an intergovernmental organization art 2 1 i 8 based on the above and on concepts from international relations theory rbos can be defined as institutionalized forms of cooperation that are based on binding international agreements covering the geographically defined area of international river or lake basins characterized by principles norms rules and governance mechanisms schmeier et al 2016 among the different elements identified by schmeier et al 2016 three relate directly to legal dimensions and mirror the elements of an international organization mentioned above the binding international agreement infrastructure 9 infrastructure based on concepts of international regime theory refers to the institutional and organizational dimensions of rbos and thus mainly the organizational bodies that ensure their functioning over time by implementing the agreements member states have come to when establishing rbos secretariats are of particular importance for such infrastructure 9 namely the organizational bodies of an rbo and actor quality in other words the ability of the organization to act independently of other stakeholders schmeier et al 2016 3 1 1 legal personality a central element of an international organization is its legal personality which distinguishes it from its members thus enabling it to function independently from them sands and klein 2009 482 and from other types of international entities sands and klein 2009 473 and makes it a subject of international law with rights and duties brownlie 2008 677 though often mentioned in the treaty establishing the organization legal personality is not always explicitly granted klabbers 2015a 18 yet it may be presumed unless otherwise demonstrated klabbers 2015a 22 once it has been established consequences derive from that status within international and national legal orders with regards to rbos as specific types of international organizations legal personality has been explicitly stated in many of the underlying agreements that established them a detailed provision outlining the scope of the legal personality of an rbo is for instance article 1 of the 1972 convention portant creation de l organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve senegal omvs which enables the omvs in order to fulfil its purpose to a enter into contracts b purchase and sell movable and immovable assets necessary for its normal operation c receive donations subsidies inheritance and other gifts d obtain loans e request technical assistance f initiate legal proceedings other types of clauses include for instance art 11 of the 1995 mekong agreement which states that the mrc shall for the purpose of the exercise of its functions enjoy the status of an international body likewise the 2000 orasecom agreement states that orange senqu river commission orasecom shall be an international organization and shall possess international legal personality art 1 2 in the case of the international sava river basin commission isrbc it has been granted international legal capacity art 15 2 of the 2002 framework agreement on the sava river basin however legal personality does not have a uniform content in international law sands and klein 2009 477 consequently the provisions of its constituent instrument determine the extent of rights and duties of an organization bearing in mind that powers may be explicit or may be reasonably deduced from its functions and purpose so as to enable it to effectively discharge its tasks sands and klein 2009 483 this has been an area in which the international court of justice icj has played a key role in establishing the theoretical backdrop for assessing the extent and basis of the powers of an organization 10 see the advisory opinion on the reparation for injuries suffered in the service of the united nations 1949 icj reps 179 10 from the initial theory of conferred powers those explicitly granted to it by state members the court dealt with the limitation this theory presented in the case of unforeseen circumstances by developing the idea of implied powers enabling an organization to use powers not explicitly granted but necessary to achieve its objectives klabbers 2015a 23 this of course creates tension with states members who have felt their control over organizations erode as the latter expand the scope of their activities the paradox of sovereign reluctance illustrates this tension states may be reluctant to grant powers to an organization despite the practical necessity for them to cooperate blokkers 2015 3 this also raises the issue of an organization engaging in ultra vires activities beyond its powers with the possibility of those actions being deemed invalid klabbers 2015a 83 and thus impacting on the operations and functioning of the entity one fundamental expression of legal personality is its treaty making powers namely the ability to enter into agreements with other subjects of international law such as states or other international organizations the organ entitled to exercise this competence should be specified by the rules regulating the organization sands and klein 2009 485 and it is the organization rather than its state members that will be bound by the treaty because it has a separate legal personality sands and klein 2009 486 at a minimum organizations will enter into a headquarters or seat agreement with their host state klabbers 2015a 101 while many agreements establishing rbos grant these organizations legal personality capacities implied by the legal personality of rbos may also be explicitly outlined and limited if parties to the agreement so decide for instance the capacity to conclude agreements with other actors can be restricted to certain specific actors art 11 of the 1995 mekong agreement limits the capacity of the mrc to entering into agreements and obligations with the donor or international community thus other organizations are de iure completely excluded as are third party states including non member riparians in this case it seems that state members have clearly indicated that they intend to retain a degree of control over the de facto however the has entered into a number of agreements or non binding memoranda of understanding with different types of organizations as well as third party countries likewise the isrbc is expressly authorized to conclude a seat agreement with the host country art 19 2 however it also has the capacity necessary for the exercise of its functions a basis for the commission to exercise certain powers not explicitly outlined where legal personality and related capacities such as the ability to enter into agreements has not been granted this presents real challenges for rbos the most famous example is the nbi which de iure remains a transitional body to coordinate water resources management efforts at the technical level between the countries until an international organization is established for the basin through an agreement a scenario yet to materialize as the comprehensive framework agreement designed for the nile basin is far from entering into force this has significant impacts on its ability to interact with the international community states and international organizations especially with international finance institutions and donors as they may not enter into binding agreements with the nbi overall the legal personality of rbos is thus of great importance to them as water diplomacy actors only if they are equipped with adequate legal personality may they engage actively in diplomatic processes this is of particular relevance given the role of non riparian and or non state actors in water diplomacy in many basins including third party countries as well as other types of international organizations with which rbos often have to engage when addressing conflicts or promoting negotiations 3 1 2 institutionalization the role of rbos organizational design a requirement to qualify as an international organization is that it possesses a distinct will a concept challenging to ascertain klabbers 2015a the distinct will of an international organization is also often associated with a degree of institutionalization and in particular the role of the secretariat international organizations generally comprise three bodies the first is typically the plenary body in which all state members are represented with a mandate on larger political issues this is often referred to as a meeting or a conference of parties the second is an executive organ which implements decisions by the plenary body and is tasked with preparing the organization s overall course of action klabbers 2015a 71 72 the third is an administrative organ in the form of a secretariat blokkers 2015 7 there may be other types of bodies such as a court and the organization may sometimes decide to create additional organs or sub organs klabbers 2015a 73 11 for instance a new body was created under the 1992 convention in 2012 state members agreed to create the implementation committee which is not a body that was created in the original agreement decision vi 1 in ece mp wat 37 add 2 11 the independence of a secretariat which is impartial because it does not serve the interests of a particular member state but that of all sands and klein 2009 308 is a key characteristic of international organizations blokkers 2015 7 that impartiality is a clear indication that one of the organs of an organization has a will distinct of its members and hence organizations that have such a body are likely to fulfil this requirement as in the case of international organizations generally an important element of the legal status of rbo relates to the level of legalization and institutionalization of an organization caponera used the broad term international water resources administration to refer to any form of institutional arrangement 1992 229 two dimensions of institutionalization reflecting the level of an rbo s distinct will may be identified firstly an rbo can be examined according to the extent of institutionalization with scholars generally distinguishing between committees commissions and authorities committees tend to have a limited organizational set up with meetings of member states representatives at a more or less regular basis only but no joint body such as a secretariat and often no legal personality the franco swiss consultative commission on fishing in lake geneva 12 established between france and switzerland under the agreement regarding fishing in lake geneva of 20 november 1980 12 or the german czech boundary waters commission 13 established under the 1995 treaty between the federal republic of germany and the czech republic on cooperation in the area of water management of boundary waters of 12 december 1995 13 both focusing on very specific technical matters requiring regular technical exchanges fall into that category commissions the most common form of institutionalized cooperation over shared water resources present a greater degree of independence and most often possess legal personality in international law though they are focused on coordination with no supranational mandate authorities on the other hand are considered to be autonomous international organizations of a supranational nature generally with high levels of independence and power vis √† vis their member states this type of rbos is most common in western and central africa mainly in basins where rbos focus on the development of water resources in the context of more general socio economic development and integration efforts in which rbos play a key role such as the autorit√© du bassin du niger abn or the omvs authors that have addressed the institutionalization level of rbos tend to argue that higher levels of institutionalization and centralization offer higher coordination levels and facilitated communication marty 2001 47 48 schmeier 2013 46 concurrently empirical evidence suggests there are limits to such benefits ever increasing levels of institutionalization do not necessarily increase the effectiveness of rbos in dealing with transboundary issues faced by their riparian members as shortcomings in the coordinated management of some watercourses governed as observed in the case of highly institutionalized bodies such as the niger or the senegal rivers secondly the organizational design or set up of an rbo as of international organizations more generally as described above provides important indications about its institutionalization it largely reflects more general international practice with a plenary organ representing member states and determining the overall direction of the rbo and its work often called a council or commission a more technical body a committee and a secretariat typically these bodies and their respective roles and responsibilities are defined in the constitutive agreement some rbos have less bodies some more reflecting their specific mandate and related level of institutionalization some scholars have argued that the level of institutionalization ultimately reflects the degree and intensity of cooperation between riparians hearns et al 2014 103 however a clear link between the level of institutionalization and in particular the number and the functions of an rbo s bodies and an rbo s effectiveness in water diplomacy activities cannot be established schmeier 2013 what research has established nonetheless is the fundamental role of an rbo secretariat which fulfils a number of functions that ensure the institutional independence of rbos in governing shared water resources typically this body not only provides administrative and financial services relating to the management of the rbo s work and its programs and projects but also plays an important role in data gathering and sharing water resources planning or communication with stakeholders schmeier 2013 94 96 some rbo secretariats have successfully initiated or steered water diplomacy processes in a basin this has proven particularly important in times of conflict in the mekong river basin for instance the mrc secretariat has played an important role in guiding the prior notification and consultation processes for three mainstream dams so far and contributed to varying degrees of effectiveness to mitigating conflicts around these dams between its member states blumstein and schmier 2017 ultimately the level of institutionalization of an rbo will be a key factor shaping its ability to conduct water diplomacy activities 3 2 rbo powers mandate and decision making powers as key features for shaping water diplomacy processes whether or not an rbo is mandated to address certain issue areas may be crucial for its overall effectiveness particularly in water diplomacy therefore most treaties establishing rbos define the areas parties to the agreement agree to cooperate on and or the rbo is mandated to work on more or less clearly for instance the 1995 convention on the international commission for the protection of the oder icpo refers to the prevention of pollution of the river oder and related areas of the baltic sea clearly determining the functional mandate of the icpo art 1 likewise the 1994 permanent okavango river basin commission okacom agreement refers to matters relating to the conservation development and utilization of water resources of common interest as outlining the functional mandate of okacom art 1 3 other rbos mainly in western and central africa tend to have broader functional scopes with a focus on water resources development the abn for instance is mandated to promote the co operation among member states and to ensure an integrated development of the niger basin in all fields by developing its resources particularly in the fields of energy water resources agriculture animal husbandry fishing and fisheries forestry and forestry exploitation transport communications and industry art 3 a lack of clarity in an rbo s mandate may hamper its role as an institutional anchor for water diplomacy especially in the issue area that is contested the international boundary and water commission ibwc between the us and mexico has for some years been debating whether the management of groundwater falls under its mandate neither the 1889 convention establishing the international boundary commission ibc nor the 1944 treaty relating to the waters under its jurisdiction that extended its responsibilities and mandate to include water explicitly mention groundwater 14 the 1944 treaty only refers to the rio grande colorado and tijuana rivers 14 however given the pressing issues around groundwater use the ibwc has increasingly addressed groundwater as well in 1973 already minute 242 of the ibwc 15 ibwc 1973 minute 242 permanent and definite solution to the international problem of the salinity of the colorado river 30 august 1973 https www ibwc gov files minutes min242 pdf 15 referred to groundwater and issued recommendations limiting withdrawals in a certain local aquifer and calling for consultations between the parties in case of developments of groundwater resources eckstein 2012 whether the ibwc was overstepping its mandate was questioned interpretations of whether groundwater is covered or not vary across governments and stakeholders consequently the ibwc was reluctant to address groundwater issues in greater detail and in particular in the form of specific policy actions it is only recently and because of pressing drought conditions and other signs of aquifer depletion that the ibwc has taken up the topic again a binational study of the transboundary san pedro aquifer was completed in 2016 ibwc 2016 and the ibwc is increasingly investigating what it is permitted legally and politically to do regarding this ever more urgent issue eckstein 2012 a clearer mandate would have certainly allowed the ibwc to address earlier the now contested issue of groundwater management potentially making an important water diplomacy contribution in the region a similar discussion has emerged over the mandate of the lake chad basin commission lcbc in the past years while mandated to manage the water resources of the lake chad basin for socioeconomic development and regional cooperation member states have under the threat of armed and terrorist groups such as boko haram extended this mandate to regional security cooperation without formalizing it legally through re establishing a multinational joint task force mjtf charged with coordinating military efforts of some of the basin s riparian states donor organizations in particular have been pondering lately whether such change in mandate will affect the lcbc s capacity to fulfill its original mandate to manage water and natural resources potentially leading to its funding being reconsidered or whether the lcbc might not in fact serve as a broader regional platform by default because of the lack of any other suitable regional cooperation platform in the region galeazzi et al 2017 the latter perspective might however affect its role in water diplomacy because technical water issues are increasingly becoming politicized and securitized and may no longer receive appropriate attention from riparians closely related to the nature of the organization is its ability to adopt norms and their nature this considered to be one of the most important functions of an organization di stasi 2015 57 is determined by its establishing instrument a norm created by an organization may or may not be binding on state members where it is not binding it is considered to be soft law and does not carry any legal weight di stasi 2015 62 the ability to adopt norms is important because of the need for flexibility as a necessary characteristic for effective institutional management to deal with unanticipated change hearns et al 2014 107 one way this may be achieved is through the ability to make binding decisions which may amend existing normative frameworks this is the case for example with the ibwc which can create minutes that are binding on its signatories the us and mexico these are examples of such instruments amending water allocations and addressing issues unforeseen at the time of signing of the underlying treaty in 1944 16 utilization of waters of the colorado and tijuana rivers and of the rio grande treaty between the united states of america and mexico 14 november 1944 16 hearns et al 2014 107 another dimension of the power of rbos relates to decision making within the organization while the underlying agreements usually define how decisions are taken generally on the basis of the consensus or unanimity issues have arisen when a signatory state to the underlying agreement has suspended or paused its membership this has been particularly troubling for water diplomacy processes where the underlying agreement does not clearly define whether and how membership in the organization can be suspended or when the respective state did not follow the related processes a blatant example is kyrgyzstan s suspension of its membership in the international fund for saving the aral sea ifas kyrgyzstan has not formally withdrawn from it or suspended its membership but has simply stopped participating in any of the organization s governance or technical activities and meetings accompanied with verbal statements by high government officials indicating an exit consequently kyrgyzstan s status in the organization currently remains entirely open with uncertainty as to the implications for ifas notably its decision making ability and the legal and political value of any such decisions if an rbo s powers for making decisions especially with regards to implementing what member states have agreed to and advancing water cooperation are challenged in the manner described above this rbo s role in water diplomacy will clearly be limited since the main purpose of rbos is to foster and coordinate better water cooperation between riparians their potential inability to adapt to new circumstances such as in the case of groundwater and the ibwc may actively prevents them from providing a platform for water diplomacy activities 3 3 privileges and immunities rbo internal housekeeping for most international organizations whatever issues they have been set up to deal with headquarters agreements contain clauses regarding the privileges and immunities the organization and its staff may benefit from 17 this is often also often incorporated into the law of the country where the organization is based to ensure that the relating rights and obligations are enforceable domestically sands and klein 2009 492 17 as the agreement will carve out a special position for it on the territory of the host state klabbers 2015a 30 blokkers 2015 8 overall these clauses are intended to support the impartial efficient and economical discharge of the functions of the organization concerned and in particular what contributes to the effective independence of the organization from the individual control of its separate members exercised by means of their national law and executive authority as distinguished from their collective control exercised in a regular manner through the appropriate international organs jenks 1962 cited in sands and klein 2009 516 however there are no particular rules in international law about their content every institution will have to negotiate with its host state the rules that will relate to it its staff representatives of member states and experts on mission for the organization such agreements usually provide immunity from suit implying that legal proceedings cannot be brought against it before domestic courts inviolable premises and archives fiscal and currency privileges and freedom of communication sands 2011 466 it allows representatives of state members to attend meetings of the organization in a country other than theirs 18 one may recall in this regard heads of states and other state representatives travelling to new york to attend meetings of the general assembly in spite of the bilateral political climate between their country and the united states which is permitted under the headquarters agreement between the un and the us though often with geographical restrictions imposed 18 experts on mission on behalf of an organization may also benefit from certain immunities 19 this the case for un peacekeepers that are not un staff but perform tasks on its behalf 19 one very important aspect deriving from the immunity from suit of an organization relates to its staff and the rules that apply to them klabbers 2015a brownlie 2008 particularly in the case of employment disputes as staff members may be unable to instigate proceedings in national courts klabbers 2015b 79 this has led some of the larger organizations such as the un to establish their own internal procedures and dispute resolution fora to avoid facing a situation where justice might be denied to their employees there has been a reported increase in the number of claims against international organizations before national and international courts in cases in employment matters such as the dismissal of officials or secretariat members and in some cases immunity for the organization has been rejected for want of another remedy for the applicant blokkers 2015 11 klabbers 2015b 153 many though not all rbos have also entered into host seat agreements with states which include privileges and immunities 20 see for instance the statute of the river uruguay between uruguay and argentina of 26 february 1975 in other cases they may be in a separate agreements as is the case with the omvs and the accord relatif aux privil√®ges et aux immunit√©s de l omvs du 18 avril 1977 20 however in most if not all cases the relation between the host state s domestic legal system and the rbo s internal rules and procedures may be ambiguous in many aspects including employment law as mentioned above immunity from jurisdiction is intended to protect an organization from a situation deemed undesirable where local courts could determine the legality of its acts including vis √† vis its employees sands and klein 2009 467 though of course an organization may also chose to waive its immunity sands and klein 2009 470 however this may hamper the functioning of an organization in the event of a dispute with an employee where resolution seems complicated in the absence of an obvious legal forum to resolve it due to the ambiguities previously mentioned the seat agreement of the international commission for the protection of the danube river icpdr is generally understood to supersede austrian national law however there is no austrian official statement on this matter except for its consent to the danube convention and its signature of the seat agreement the icpdr adopted internal regulations for staffing matters at the level of the heads of delegation giving considerable flexibility to the executive secretary to address specific employment matters under his authority when an employment dispute occurred and the respective staff considered taking the issue to court the question arose of whether austrian labor law or icpdr internal rules would apply to the dispute ultimately the matter was never taken to court it was solved by a mediation panel within the rbo leaving open whether austrian courts had jurisdiction the case nonetheless illustrates the importance of the relationship between the rbo s internal procedures and the host state s domestic law in the case of the mrc an employment matter related to its secretariat s recent down sizing also raised the issue of the prevalence of domestic law over its internal rules the 1995 mekong agreement is silent compared to other rbo agreements on the privileges and immunities that come with mrc s status as an international body laid down in art 11 1995 mekong agreement while more details are provided in other instruments e g the 2003 host agreement between lao pdr and the mrc some questions remain open including which legal framework would apply in cases of employment related issues as neither the 1995 mekong agreement nor the seat agreement nor any other instrument clarify the hierarchy of norms for such cases the fact that lao domestic employment law appears applicable may create a challenge for the mrc as an independent international organization although seemingly dealing with internal housekeeping matters privileges and immunities and the challenges they present when insufficiently defined can significantly impact an rbo s role in water diplomacy this can be due to difficult relations with the host state if aspects of the seat agreement are contested or to other reasons given the many challenges around water diplomacy these more administrative matters should be addressed from the beginning in order to avoid increasing tension between states or states and the rbo around matters not related to the joint water resources they are concerned with coherence and clarity about the applicable rules contribute to preventing potential conflict that may distract parties from dealing with the actual subject matter of their concern namely shared water resources 4 conclusion the international law commission which drafted the 1997 convention highlighted the indispensable nature of joint institutions for the management of international watercourses ilc yearbook 1990 44 rbos have been created to fulfill these expectations and ensure the cooperative management of shared water resources in different basins around the world making them key anchors for water diplomacy however for rbos to fulfill these roles effectively the rules that apply to their functioning as international organizations need to be comprehensible to those who must comply with them as well as to those who depend on rbos as institutional anchors for water diplomacy this article has reviewed some key elements of the law of international organizations relevant to rbos as a specific type of international organizations and its relevance to the role of rbos as institutional anchors for water diplomacy an examination of key features of this area of public international law clearly complements the investigations undertaken to ascertain the effectiveness of rbos given the potentially significant impacts on their operations and consequently on their ability to achieve the objectives intended by their riparian members the analysis of the different elements of the legal nature of rbos demonstrates that legal aspects play a more important role in the effectiveness of rbos especially in water diplomacy processes than has generally been acknowledged by both academic scholars and policy makers while a lack of clarity regarding the legal personality of an rbo can hinder its ability to act in the international system insufficient clarity on its mandate and powers can lead to disagreements on what areas the rbo should work on or not possibly heightening conflict between riparian states moreover inadequately outlined privileges and immunities may lead to administrative matters affecting the relationship between an rbo and its host state and unsuitable institutional set ups may hamper an rbo s ability to actively and effectively engage in water diplomacy processes the legal dimensions of rbos as international organizations therefore need to be taken into consideration when establishing new rbos and when assigning rbos a new role as is currently happening in the context of the water diplomacy discourse failure to do so may result not only in challenges regarding legal matters but also affect overall cooperation in international basins 
6880,water diplomacy needs institutional anchoring international river basin organizations rbos being the result of diplomatic efforts by riparian states intending to create a framework for cooperation between themselves over shared water bodies can provide such institutional anchors rbos ensure that agreements to cooperate are turned into a long term commitment by riparian states to jointly manage shared water resources and in turn foster mutually beneficial cooperation over time rbos have been the subject of detailed examinations of their conceptual core of their manifold functions of their effectiveness in achieving their goals and so forth however the legal nature of these entities has so far received limited attention notwithstanding its significance in empowering rbos to act as institutional anchors for water diplomacy legitimate questions arise for instance in relation to their legal personality or lack thereof or to matters such as immunities and privileges this paper will review key legal aspects of rbos and illustrate them with examples a sound understanding of such issues is crucial to supporting fruitful discussions between state members about the legal design of an rbo in order to fulfill their particular needs in the context of water diplomacy keywords river basin organization transboundary water management water diplomacy law of international institutions water law 1 introduction water diplomacy needs institutional anchoring international river basin organizations rbos may provide such institutional anchors they are the institutional outcome of diplomatic efforts by riparian states intending to create a framework for cooperation over shared water bodies and to implement treaty provisions that have been entered into on a long term institutional basis at the same time they house water diplomacy efforts themselves aiming at ensuring the cooperative and sustainable management of their respective basin yet the institutional anchoring of water diplomacy in rbos is challenging among the many challenges rbos and their member states might be facing the internal legal and institutional nature of rbos determines whether and to what extent they can provide effective and functioning institutional anchors for water diplomacy at the heart of diplomacy is in broad terms the concept of the conduct of relationships using peaceful means by and among international actors cooper et al 2013 2 while both academia and policy makers are increasingly focusing on water diplomacy there is no consistent definition of it and concepts and definitions vary considerably across different research and policy institutions molnar et al 2017 water diplomacy is understood for the purpose of this article to include the conduct of relationships between riparian states of shared water resources to enhance cooperation between them in relation to the joint management of those resources but with regard to goals beyond the water sector namely regional stability and peace schmeier 2016 international actors in water diplomacy as in diplomacy more generally include states and the institutions they create to deal with common matters rbos rbos may be classified as international organizations which is why the law of international organizations and related legal and institutional matters are of great relevance to ascertain whether and to what extent rbos may be effective anchors for water diplomacy rbos are such anchors in that they provide a platform for member states that have established them to engage regularly and on the basis of clearly defined legal and institutional structures in water cooperation and diplomacy matters they do so pursuant to the rules of procedure agreed in their constituting instruments which set out the manner in which they are to operate in this context rbos also play a key role in addressing and assisting with the mitigation of disagreements or conflicts that can occur in a shared basin through actions permitted by the rules of the organization e g by engaging in data gathering analysis and exchange activities or by managing pre defined processes such as prior notifications this makes rbos and their individual staff essential actors in water diplomacy it is therefore vital that the practical aspects of such organizations and the processes of interaction they manage are carefully considered and crafted so that they may function as smoothly as possible to achieve their intended purpose indeed both theoretical findings and empirical evidence reveal that rbos have not always been able to fulfill their role of facilitating effective water diplomacy and of promoting cooperation effectively among the many reasons for this legal characteristics have been of importance in numerous cases for instance in the nile river basin a lack of clarity over the legal status of the nile basin initiative nbi has sometimes prevented it from taking a more active role in ongoing conflicts between some of the riparians similarly water resources shared between the us and mexico where the mandate of an rbo has not been sufficiently clearly defined have suffered from a lack of pro active engagement of the rbo in water diplomacy and in the mekong river basin disagreements over whether tributaries fall under the scope of the 1995 mekong agreement continue to hamper the mekong river commission mrc s effectiveness thus far limited academic attention has been devoted to this topic a more thorough review is therefore warranted to enhance the understanding of the impact of the legal nature of rbos on their ability to play a role in water diplomacy this article offers a starting point for this review by providing an overview of key issues from the perspective of the law of international organizations after linking the law of international organizations to research on rbos it focuses on specific dimensions of rbos that have been identified as rbo internal legal and institutional factors that influence an rbo s ability to be an effective anchor for water diplomacy the legal status of an rbo and its mandate and the privileges and immunities it has been granted by its member states and most notably the host state in doing so the article ultimately argues that the legal nature of rbos needs to be better understood not only by international lawyers but by all those engaged in international river basins whether water managers or diplomats because of its potential impact on effective institutional anchoring for water diplomacy by rbos 2 the institutional anchoring of rbos the international law perspective the concept of institutional anchoring of cooperation between riparian states to shared watercourses began to develop in europe in the early 19th century with the treaty of vienna of 1815 1 see article cviii to cxvi relating to navigation issues of shared rivers and the appointment of commissioners meeting on a regular basis fao legislative study 65 1 and the establishment of the rhine and danube commissions which centered on navigation over time the focus shifted to other uses with potential impact on riparians and thus to non navigational uses of shared watercourses the notion of joint institutions remained already in 1911 the institut de droit international in its madrid declaration 2 declaration of madrid 20 april 1911 2 considered their relevance and recommended to riparians to appoint permanent joint commissions with decision making powers or advisory competences on matters relating to transboundary water resources art 7 3 international regulation regarding the use of international watercourses for purposes other than navigation it has previously proposed riparian commissions in relation to navigation only in 1867 international regulation on river navigation resolution of heidelberg 9 september 1887 in fao legislative study 65 3 thus joint institutions and their objectives of cooperation between riparians have been in the minds of water managers and lawyers for over two centuries scholars from both legal and water management backgrounds have acknowledged that institutionalized cooperation between states is a natural and logical outgrowth of heavy reliance upon shared water resources mccaffrey 2007 156 and that institutions are a mitigating factor in conflict since they promote basin wide interstate co operation and thereby increase water security j√§gerskog 2002 78 most recently in the emerging water diplomacy debate scholars as well as practitioners have assigned rbos a key role in water diplomacy processes mrc 2016 schmeier 2016 molnar et al 2017 while there is no customary rule in international water law requiring the establishment of joins institutions over shared watercourses 4 the details of such institutions is also not set out in customary law boisson de chazournes 2002 commentary to the berlin rules 2004 4 both the united nations 1997 convention on the non navigational uses of international watercourses 1997 convention 5 the 1997 convention is in fact based on existing state practice including the many rbos established before the adoption of the convention such as those already of the danube rhine and oder and more 5 and the 1992 united nations economic commission for europe unece convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes 1992 convention call for their establishment 6 notably in the case of the former it is an encouragement note art 8 2 which refers to joint mechanisms or commissions and art 24 2 whereas in the latter it is a mandatory requirement art 9 2 contains a non exhaustive list of functions of a joint body though no indications of the expected structure of the institution and of more technical aspects of its operations this is clarified in the united nations economic commission for europe unece implementation guide of 2009 which lists four common characteristics of such commissions including 1 a permanent body meeting reasonably regularly 2 composed of representatives from the riparian states from water related agencies 3 with decision making executive and subsidiary bodies e g working or expert groups etc and 4 a secretariat note art 1 5 which defines what is a joint body namely any bilateral or multilateral commission or other appropriate arrangements for the cooperation between the riparian parties 6 some regional legal instruments require the same whether the 2000 eu water framework directive art 3 or the 2000 southern african development community sadc s revised sadc protocol on shared water resources art 5 3 as regards academic examinations of the legal dimensions of rbos and their impacts on rbos role to be effective anchors for water diplomacy while the various dimensions of rbos and their underlying agreements have been studied extensively ranging from their emergence and why states in some basins chose to establish rbos yet not in others bernauer 1997 song and whittington 2004 tir and ackermann 2009 to questions relating specific design features of rbos chenoweth and feitelson 2001 boisson de chazournes 2002 mostert 2005 dombrowsky 2007 zawahri 2009 gerlak et al 2011 giz 2014 blumstein and schmier 2017 examinations of legal aspects from the perspective of international institutional law has been so far limited if addressed at all legal dimensions of rbos have featured in more general studies of rbos generally when analyzing different legal and institutional features of rbos and their influence on for instance the functionality or the effectiveness of an rbo schmeier 2013 alternatively they have been part of broader publications rather than being the focus of standalone papers as with caponera s 1992 work on principles of water law and administration they have also been addressed through more general discussions of international water law where concerns over effectiveness of the management of shared watercourses have drawn authors to discuss the role of institutions boisson de chazournes laurence 2013 brown 2013 7 both present the history and evolution of basin organizations and commissions as does caponera 1992 with brown weiss noting the transition from navigation to the broader range of activities that rbos now cover she also considers their functions and effectiveness whereas boisson de chazournes examines their role as a forum for dialogue cooperation and dispute resolution 2002 as well as their contribution to developing and implementing international law 7 more general international law and institutional scholarship have not shown extensive interest in rbo unless when considering them as technical and thus sometimes partial institutions pennetta 2015 71 overall analyses of the legal dimensions of institutionalized cooperation over shared water resources are rare and most often only related to other research questions accordingly an examination of the legal features of rbos or the lack thereof and the implications they can have on an rbo s role as the institutional home for water diplomacy has often been neglected this gap is what the remainder of this paper aims to fill 3 key features of rbos under the law of international organisations this section applies insights from the law of international organizations to rbos as specific types of international organizations it focuses on those features of international law that are of particular relevance to those engaged in water diplomacy whether from the water management or the foreign policy perspective these are the nature of rbos as international organizations their legal personality and their organizational design their mandate and their ability to create norms as well as their privileges and immunities 3 1 defining rbos as international organizations before examining the different legal aspects relevant to the role of rbos in water diplomacy it is important to establish their legal nature as an international organization this should be based on the examination of the key elements of the law of international institutions determining what constitutes an international organization although there is no agreed definition klabbers 2015a the following guiding elements have been identified 1 a treaty between states creating the organization 2 the organization possesses at least one organ 3 and the organization has a volont√© distincte in other words it has a will distinct from that of its member states klabbers 2015a 8 notably the vienna convention on the law of treaties of 1969 defines an international organization as an intergovernmental organization art 2 1 i 8 based on the above and on concepts from international relations theory rbos can be defined as institutionalized forms of cooperation that are based on binding international agreements covering the geographically defined area of international river or lake basins characterized by principles norms rules and governance mechanisms schmeier et al 2016 among the different elements identified by schmeier et al 2016 three relate directly to legal dimensions and mirror the elements of an international organization mentioned above the binding international agreement infrastructure 9 infrastructure based on concepts of international regime theory refers to the institutional and organizational dimensions of rbos and thus mainly the organizational bodies that ensure their functioning over time by implementing the agreements member states have come to when establishing rbos secretariats are of particular importance for such infrastructure 9 namely the organizational bodies of an rbo and actor quality in other words the ability of the organization to act independently of other stakeholders schmeier et al 2016 3 1 1 legal personality a central element of an international organization is its legal personality which distinguishes it from its members thus enabling it to function independently from them sands and klein 2009 482 and from other types of international entities sands and klein 2009 473 and makes it a subject of international law with rights and duties brownlie 2008 677 though often mentioned in the treaty establishing the organization legal personality is not always explicitly granted klabbers 2015a 18 yet it may be presumed unless otherwise demonstrated klabbers 2015a 22 once it has been established consequences derive from that status within international and national legal orders with regards to rbos as specific types of international organizations legal personality has been explicitly stated in many of the underlying agreements that established them a detailed provision outlining the scope of the legal personality of an rbo is for instance article 1 of the 1972 convention portant creation de l organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve senegal omvs which enables the omvs in order to fulfil its purpose to a enter into contracts b purchase and sell movable and immovable assets necessary for its normal operation c receive donations subsidies inheritance and other gifts d obtain loans e request technical assistance f initiate legal proceedings other types of clauses include for instance art 11 of the 1995 mekong agreement which states that the mrc shall for the purpose of the exercise of its functions enjoy the status of an international body likewise the 2000 orasecom agreement states that orange senqu river commission orasecom shall be an international organization and shall possess international legal personality art 1 2 in the case of the international sava river basin commission isrbc it has been granted international legal capacity art 15 2 of the 2002 framework agreement on the sava river basin however legal personality does not have a uniform content in international law sands and klein 2009 477 consequently the provisions of its constituent instrument determine the extent of rights and duties of an organization bearing in mind that powers may be explicit or may be reasonably deduced from its functions and purpose so as to enable it to effectively discharge its tasks sands and klein 2009 483 this has been an area in which the international court of justice icj has played a key role in establishing the theoretical backdrop for assessing the extent and basis of the powers of an organization 10 see the advisory opinion on the reparation for injuries suffered in the service of the united nations 1949 icj reps 179 10 from the initial theory of conferred powers those explicitly granted to it by state members the court dealt with the limitation this theory presented in the case of unforeseen circumstances by developing the idea of implied powers enabling an organization to use powers not explicitly granted but necessary to achieve its objectives klabbers 2015a 23 this of course creates tension with states members who have felt their control over organizations erode as the latter expand the scope of their activities the paradox of sovereign reluctance illustrates this tension states may be reluctant to grant powers to an organization despite the practical necessity for them to cooperate blokkers 2015 3 this also raises the issue of an organization engaging in ultra vires activities beyond its powers with the possibility of those actions being deemed invalid klabbers 2015a 83 and thus impacting on the operations and functioning of the entity one fundamental expression of legal personality is its treaty making powers namely the ability to enter into agreements with other subjects of international law such as states or other international organizations the organ entitled to exercise this competence should be specified by the rules regulating the organization sands and klein 2009 485 and it is the organization rather than its state members that will be bound by the treaty because it has a separate legal personality sands and klein 2009 486 at a minimum organizations will enter into a headquarters or seat agreement with their host state klabbers 2015a 101 while many agreements establishing rbos grant these organizations legal personality capacities implied by the legal personality of rbos may also be explicitly outlined and limited if parties to the agreement so decide for instance the capacity to conclude agreements with other actors can be restricted to certain specific actors art 11 of the 1995 mekong agreement limits the capacity of the mrc to entering into agreements and obligations with the donor or international community thus other organizations are de iure completely excluded as are third party states including non member riparians in this case it seems that state members have clearly indicated that they intend to retain a degree of control over the de facto however the has entered into a number of agreements or non binding memoranda of understanding with different types of organizations as well as third party countries likewise the isrbc is expressly authorized to conclude a seat agreement with the host country art 19 2 however it also has the capacity necessary for the exercise of its functions a basis for the commission to exercise certain powers not explicitly outlined where legal personality and related capacities such as the ability to enter into agreements has not been granted this presents real challenges for rbos the most famous example is the nbi which de iure remains a transitional body to coordinate water resources management efforts at the technical level between the countries until an international organization is established for the basin through an agreement a scenario yet to materialize as the comprehensive framework agreement designed for the nile basin is far from entering into force this has significant impacts on its ability to interact with the international community states and international organizations especially with international finance institutions and donors as they may not enter into binding agreements with the nbi overall the legal personality of rbos is thus of great importance to them as water diplomacy actors only if they are equipped with adequate legal personality may they engage actively in diplomatic processes this is of particular relevance given the role of non riparian and or non state actors in water diplomacy in many basins including third party countries as well as other types of international organizations with which rbos often have to engage when addressing conflicts or promoting negotiations 3 1 2 institutionalization the role of rbos organizational design a requirement to qualify as an international organization is that it possesses a distinct will a concept challenging to ascertain klabbers 2015a the distinct will of an international organization is also often associated with a degree of institutionalization and in particular the role of the secretariat international organizations generally comprise three bodies the first is typically the plenary body in which all state members are represented with a mandate on larger political issues this is often referred to as a meeting or a conference of parties the second is an executive organ which implements decisions by the plenary body and is tasked with preparing the organization s overall course of action klabbers 2015a 71 72 the third is an administrative organ in the form of a secretariat blokkers 2015 7 there may be other types of bodies such as a court and the organization may sometimes decide to create additional organs or sub organs klabbers 2015a 73 11 for instance a new body was created under the 1992 convention in 2012 state members agreed to create the implementation committee which is not a body that was created in the original agreement decision vi 1 in ece mp wat 37 add 2 11 the independence of a secretariat which is impartial because it does not serve the interests of a particular member state but that of all sands and klein 2009 308 is a key characteristic of international organizations blokkers 2015 7 that impartiality is a clear indication that one of the organs of an organization has a will distinct of its members and hence organizations that have such a body are likely to fulfil this requirement as in the case of international organizations generally an important element of the legal status of rbo relates to the level of legalization and institutionalization of an organization caponera used the broad term international water resources administration to refer to any form of institutional arrangement 1992 229 two dimensions of institutionalization reflecting the level of an rbo s distinct will may be identified firstly an rbo can be examined according to the extent of institutionalization with scholars generally distinguishing between committees commissions and authorities committees tend to have a limited organizational set up with meetings of member states representatives at a more or less regular basis only but no joint body such as a secretariat and often no legal personality the franco swiss consultative commission on fishing in lake geneva 12 established between france and switzerland under the agreement regarding fishing in lake geneva of 20 november 1980 12 or the german czech boundary waters commission 13 established under the 1995 treaty between the federal republic of germany and the czech republic on cooperation in the area of water management of boundary waters of 12 december 1995 13 both focusing on very specific technical matters requiring regular technical exchanges fall into that category commissions the most common form of institutionalized cooperation over shared water resources present a greater degree of independence and most often possess legal personality in international law though they are focused on coordination with no supranational mandate authorities on the other hand are considered to be autonomous international organizations of a supranational nature generally with high levels of independence and power vis √† vis their member states this type of rbos is most common in western and central africa mainly in basins where rbos focus on the development of water resources in the context of more general socio economic development and integration efforts in which rbos play a key role such as the autorit√© du bassin du niger abn or the omvs authors that have addressed the institutionalization level of rbos tend to argue that higher levels of institutionalization and centralization offer higher coordination levels and facilitated communication marty 2001 47 48 schmeier 2013 46 concurrently empirical evidence suggests there are limits to such benefits ever increasing levels of institutionalization do not necessarily increase the effectiveness of rbos in dealing with transboundary issues faced by their riparian members as shortcomings in the coordinated management of some watercourses governed as observed in the case of highly institutionalized bodies such as the niger or the senegal rivers secondly the organizational design or set up of an rbo as of international organizations more generally as described above provides important indications about its institutionalization it largely reflects more general international practice with a plenary organ representing member states and determining the overall direction of the rbo and its work often called a council or commission a more technical body a committee and a secretariat typically these bodies and their respective roles and responsibilities are defined in the constitutive agreement some rbos have less bodies some more reflecting their specific mandate and related level of institutionalization some scholars have argued that the level of institutionalization ultimately reflects the degree and intensity of cooperation between riparians hearns et al 2014 103 however a clear link between the level of institutionalization and in particular the number and the functions of an rbo s bodies and an rbo s effectiveness in water diplomacy activities cannot be established schmeier 2013 what research has established nonetheless is the fundamental role of an rbo secretariat which fulfils a number of functions that ensure the institutional independence of rbos in governing shared water resources typically this body not only provides administrative and financial services relating to the management of the rbo s work and its programs and projects but also plays an important role in data gathering and sharing water resources planning or communication with stakeholders schmeier 2013 94 96 some rbo secretariats have successfully initiated or steered water diplomacy processes in a basin this has proven particularly important in times of conflict in the mekong river basin for instance the mrc secretariat has played an important role in guiding the prior notification and consultation processes for three mainstream dams so far and contributed to varying degrees of effectiveness to mitigating conflicts around these dams between its member states blumstein and schmier 2017 ultimately the level of institutionalization of an rbo will be a key factor shaping its ability to conduct water diplomacy activities 3 2 rbo powers mandate and decision making powers as key features for shaping water diplomacy processes whether or not an rbo is mandated to address certain issue areas may be crucial for its overall effectiveness particularly in water diplomacy therefore most treaties establishing rbos define the areas parties to the agreement agree to cooperate on and or the rbo is mandated to work on more or less clearly for instance the 1995 convention on the international commission for the protection of the oder icpo refers to the prevention of pollution of the river oder and related areas of the baltic sea clearly determining the functional mandate of the icpo art 1 likewise the 1994 permanent okavango river basin commission okacom agreement refers to matters relating to the conservation development and utilization of water resources of common interest as outlining the functional mandate of okacom art 1 3 other rbos mainly in western and central africa tend to have broader functional scopes with a focus on water resources development the abn for instance is mandated to promote the co operation among member states and to ensure an integrated development of the niger basin in all fields by developing its resources particularly in the fields of energy water resources agriculture animal husbandry fishing and fisheries forestry and forestry exploitation transport communications and industry art 3 a lack of clarity in an rbo s mandate may hamper its role as an institutional anchor for water diplomacy especially in the issue area that is contested the international boundary and water commission ibwc between the us and mexico has for some years been debating whether the management of groundwater falls under its mandate neither the 1889 convention establishing the international boundary commission ibc nor the 1944 treaty relating to the waters under its jurisdiction that extended its responsibilities and mandate to include water explicitly mention groundwater 14 the 1944 treaty only refers to the rio grande colorado and tijuana rivers 14 however given the pressing issues around groundwater use the ibwc has increasingly addressed groundwater as well in 1973 already minute 242 of the ibwc 15 ibwc 1973 minute 242 permanent and definite solution to the international problem of the salinity of the colorado river 30 august 1973 https www ibwc gov files minutes min242 pdf 15 referred to groundwater and issued recommendations limiting withdrawals in a certain local aquifer and calling for consultations between the parties in case of developments of groundwater resources eckstein 2012 whether the ibwc was overstepping its mandate was questioned interpretations of whether groundwater is covered or not vary across governments and stakeholders consequently the ibwc was reluctant to address groundwater issues in greater detail and in particular in the form of specific policy actions it is only recently and because of pressing drought conditions and other signs of aquifer depletion that the ibwc has taken up the topic again a binational study of the transboundary san pedro aquifer was completed in 2016 ibwc 2016 and the ibwc is increasingly investigating what it is permitted legally and politically to do regarding this ever more urgent issue eckstein 2012 a clearer mandate would have certainly allowed the ibwc to address earlier the now contested issue of groundwater management potentially making an important water diplomacy contribution in the region a similar discussion has emerged over the mandate of the lake chad basin commission lcbc in the past years while mandated to manage the water resources of the lake chad basin for socioeconomic development and regional cooperation member states have under the threat of armed and terrorist groups such as boko haram extended this mandate to regional security cooperation without formalizing it legally through re establishing a multinational joint task force mjtf charged with coordinating military efforts of some of the basin s riparian states donor organizations in particular have been pondering lately whether such change in mandate will affect the lcbc s capacity to fulfill its original mandate to manage water and natural resources potentially leading to its funding being reconsidered or whether the lcbc might not in fact serve as a broader regional platform by default because of the lack of any other suitable regional cooperation platform in the region galeazzi et al 2017 the latter perspective might however affect its role in water diplomacy because technical water issues are increasingly becoming politicized and securitized and may no longer receive appropriate attention from riparians closely related to the nature of the organization is its ability to adopt norms and their nature this considered to be one of the most important functions of an organization di stasi 2015 57 is determined by its establishing instrument a norm created by an organization may or may not be binding on state members where it is not binding it is considered to be soft law and does not carry any legal weight di stasi 2015 62 the ability to adopt norms is important because of the need for flexibility as a necessary characteristic for effective institutional management to deal with unanticipated change hearns et al 2014 107 one way this may be achieved is through the ability to make binding decisions which may amend existing normative frameworks this is the case for example with the ibwc which can create minutes that are binding on its signatories the us and mexico these are examples of such instruments amending water allocations and addressing issues unforeseen at the time of signing of the underlying treaty in 1944 16 utilization of waters of the colorado and tijuana rivers and of the rio grande treaty between the united states of america and mexico 14 november 1944 16 hearns et al 2014 107 another dimension of the power of rbos relates to decision making within the organization while the underlying agreements usually define how decisions are taken generally on the basis of the consensus or unanimity issues have arisen when a signatory state to the underlying agreement has suspended or paused its membership this has been particularly troubling for water diplomacy processes where the underlying agreement does not clearly define whether and how membership in the organization can be suspended or when the respective state did not follow the related processes a blatant example is kyrgyzstan s suspension of its membership in the international fund for saving the aral sea ifas kyrgyzstan has not formally withdrawn from it or suspended its membership but has simply stopped participating in any of the organization s governance or technical activities and meetings accompanied with verbal statements by high government officials indicating an exit consequently kyrgyzstan s status in the organization currently remains entirely open with uncertainty as to the implications for ifas notably its decision making ability and the legal and political value of any such decisions if an rbo s powers for making decisions especially with regards to implementing what member states have agreed to and advancing water cooperation are challenged in the manner described above this rbo s role in water diplomacy will clearly be limited since the main purpose of rbos is to foster and coordinate better water cooperation between riparians their potential inability to adapt to new circumstances such as in the case of groundwater and the ibwc may actively prevents them from providing a platform for water diplomacy activities 3 3 privileges and immunities rbo internal housekeeping for most international organizations whatever issues they have been set up to deal with headquarters agreements contain clauses regarding the privileges and immunities the organization and its staff may benefit from 17 this is often also often incorporated into the law of the country where the organization is based to ensure that the relating rights and obligations are enforceable domestically sands and klein 2009 492 17 as the agreement will carve out a special position for it on the territory of the host state klabbers 2015a 30 blokkers 2015 8 overall these clauses are intended to support the impartial efficient and economical discharge of the functions of the organization concerned and in particular what contributes to the effective independence of the organization from the individual control of its separate members exercised by means of their national law and executive authority as distinguished from their collective control exercised in a regular manner through the appropriate international organs jenks 1962 cited in sands and klein 2009 516 however there are no particular rules in international law about their content every institution will have to negotiate with its host state the rules that will relate to it its staff representatives of member states and experts on mission for the organization such agreements usually provide immunity from suit implying that legal proceedings cannot be brought against it before domestic courts inviolable premises and archives fiscal and currency privileges and freedom of communication sands 2011 466 it allows representatives of state members to attend meetings of the organization in a country other than theirs 18 one may recall in this regard heads of states and other state representatives travelling to new york to attend meetings of the general assembly in spite of the bilateral political climate between their country and the united states which is permitted under the headquarters agreement between the un and the us though often with geographical restrictions imposed 18 experts on mission on behalf of an organization may also benefit from certain immunities 19 this the case for un peacekeepers that are not un staff but perform tasks on its behalf 19 one very important aspect deriving from the immunity from suit of an organization relates to its staff and the rules that apply to them klabbers 2015a brownlie 2008 particularly in the case of employment disputes as staff members may be unable to instigate proceedings in national courts klabbers 2015b 79 this has led some of the larger organizations such as the un to establish their own internal procedures and dispute resolution fora to avoid facing a situation where justice might be denied to their employees there has been a reported increase in the number of claims against international organizations before national and international courts in cases in employment matters such as the dismissal of officials or secretariat members and in some cases immunity for the organization has been rejected for want of another remedy for the applicant blokkers 2015 11 klabbers 2015b 153 many though not all rbos have also entered into host seat agreements with states which include privileges and immunities 20 see for instance the statute of the river uruguay between uruguay and argentina of 26 february 1975 in other cases they may be in a separate agreements as is the case with the omvs and the accord relatif aux privil√®ges et aux immunit√©s de l omvs du 18 avril 1977 20 however in most if not all cases the relation between the host state s domestic legal system and the rbo s internal rules and procedures may be ambiguous in many aspects including employment law as mentioned above immunity from jurisdiction is intended to protect an organization from a situation deemed undesirable where local courts could determine the legality of its acts including vis √† vis its employees sands and klein 2009 467 though of course an organization may also chose to waive its immunity sands and klein 2009 470 however this may hamper the functioning of an organization in the event of a dispute with an employee where resolution seems complicated in the absence of an obvious legal forum to resolve it due to the ambiguities previously mentioned the seat agreement of the international commission for the protection of the danube river icpdr is generally understood to supersede austrian national law however there is no austrian official statement on this matter except for its consent to the danube convention and its signature of the seat agreement the icpdr adopted internal regulations for staffing matters at the level of the heads of delegation giving considerable flexibility to the executive secretary to address specific employment matters under his authority when an employment dispute occurred and the respective staff considered taking the issue to court the question arose of whether austrian labor law or icpdr internal rules would apply to the dispute ultimately the matter was never taken to court it was solved by a mediation panel within the rbo leaving open whether austrian courts had jurisdiction the case nonetheless illustrates the importance of the relationship between the rbo s internal procedures and the host state s domestic law in the case of the mrc an employment matter related to its secretariat s recent down sizing also raised the issue of the prevalence of domestic law over its internal rules the 1995 mekong agreement is silent compared to other rbo agreements on the privileges and immunities that come with mrc s status as an international body laid down in art 11 1995 mekong agreement while more details are provided in other instruments e g the 2003 host agreement between lao pdr and the mrc some questions remain open including which legal framework would apply in cases of employment related issues as neither the 1995 mekong agreement nor the seat agreement nor any other instrument clarify the hierarchy of norms for such cases the fact that lao domestic employment law appears applicable may create a challenge for the mrc as an independent international organization although seemingly dealing with internal housekeeping matters privileges and immunities and the challenges they present when insufficiently defined can significantly impact an rbo s role in water diplomacy this can be due to difficult relations with the host state if aspects of the seat agreement are contested or to other reasons given the many challenges around water diplomacy these more administrative matters should be addressed from the beginning in order to avoid increasing tension between states or states and the rbo around matters not related to the joint water resources they are concerned with coherence and clarity about the applicable rules contribute to preventing potential conflict that may distract parties from dealing with the actual subject matter of their concern namely shared water resources 4 conclusion the international law commission which drafted the 1997 convention highlighted the indispensable nature of joint institutions for the management of international watercourses ilc yearbook 1990 44 rbos have been created to fulfill these expectations and ensure the cooperative management of shared water resources in different basins around the world making them key anchors for water diplomacy however for rbos to fulfill these roles effectively the rules that apply to their functioning as international organizations need to be comprehensible to those who must comply with them as well as to those who depend on rbos as institutional anchors for water diplomacy this article has reviewed some key elements of the law of international organizations relevant to rbos as a specific type of international organizations and its relevance to the role of rbos as institutional anchors for water diplomacy an examination of key features of this area of public international law clearly complements the investigations undertaken to ascertain the effectiveness of rbos given the potentially significant impacts on their operations and consequently on their ability to achieve the objectives intended by their riparian members the analysis of the different elements of the legal nature of rbos demonstrates that legal aspects play a more important role in the effectiveness of rbos especially in water diplomacy processes than has generally been acknowledged by both academic scholars and policy makers while a lack of clarity regarding the legal personality of an rbo can hinder its ability to act in the international system insufficient clarity on its mandate and powers can lead to disagreements on what areas the rbo should work on or not possibly heightening conflict between riparian states moreover inadequately outlined privileges and immunities may lead to administrative matters affecting the relationship between an rbo and its host state and unsuitable institutional set ups may hamper an rbo s ability to actively and effectively engage in water diplomacy processes the legal dimensions of rbos as international organizations therefore need to be taken into consideration when establishing new rbos and when assigning rbos a new role as is currently happening in the context of the water diplomacy discourse failure to do so may result not only in challenges regarding legal matters but also affect overall cooperation in international basins 
6881,this study evaluates the utility of ambient temperature profiles collected in sealed bedrock boreholes to assess variability in groundwater flow in discretely fractured shallow bedrock environments a conceptual model for groundwater flow and groundwater surface water temperature conditions and their interaction in a temperate climate is developed through a statistical interpretation of time lapse thermal deviation logs temperature profiles were collected in three angled and three vertical boreholes drilled to 24 32 mbgs meters below ground surface and temporarily sealed with an impermeable fabric liner in a fractured dolostone bedrock aquifer adjacent to and extending beneath a bedrock river to monitor seasonal hydrodynamics ambient borehole temperature profiles collected every 1 8 weeks over a 12 month period identified zones of hydraulic activity during periods of intra seasonal stability without the interference of open borehole cross connection signal cross correlation and fourier spectra analysis of thermal deviation logs provided a novel way to observe the shallow bedrock flow system s temperature evolution due to advection along discrete fractures in response to seasonal transience and to identify and isolate noise caused by free convection cells within the sealed borehole this approach represents a diagnostic tool that improves confidence in identifying depth discrete hydraulically active fracture zones from thermal deviation data sets in a shallow fractured sedimentary bedrock environment variably scaled free convection cells were observed within the borehole water columns during the colder winter periods although these periods were accompanied by higher signal noise near the river atmospheric interface these cells led to a temporary thermal disequilibrium between the borehole water column and formation water deeper in the bedrock these conditions increased the maximum depth of thermal detections associated with discrete groundwater flow features from 14 mbgs in the summer to 26 mbgs in the winter thereby enhancing the understanding of shallow groundwater flow systems under the direct influence of surface water keywords fractured rock groundwater temperature logging thermal deviation free convection bedrock rivers sealed boreholes 1 introduction bedrock aquifers represent an important source of fresh water readily available for many communities around the world as attention paid to water availability issues grows both locally and globally so too does the importance of understanding the hydrogeologic conditions sustaining this valuable resource less studied than their alluvial counterparts bedrock groundwater systems are more complex with flow and transport governed by the occurrence of many connected fractures fracture networks in sedimentary rocks are heterogeneous and anisotropic by nature due to variability in fracture aperture and connectivity resulting in a more complex network of flow paths than that typical of granular media due to the relatively discrete nature of these small aperture fractures it is their connectivity that influences the bulk conductivity anisotropic flow paths and the positioning of hydrologic boundaries hence understanding the distribution of discrete flow features through complementary high resolution data sets has become an essential element in the development of conceptual hydrologic models of fractured rock environments parker et al 2012 and references therein temperature has been shown to be an effective groundwater tracer particularly for the identification of preferential flow pathways in heterogeneous and anisotropic rock anderson 2005 the flow of heat in groundwater is controlled by convection advection and conduction diffusion processes density driven transfer of heat is referred to as free convection whereas forced convection describes heat transfer by other mechanisms e g hydraulic gradients in fractured sedimentary rock temperature distributions will depend on the movement of water along fractures and thermal exchange between the fractures and matrix this can lead to uneven temperature distributions in fractured sedimentary rock diagnostic of the variability in advective fluxes along variably connected fractures the low permeability rock matrix fosters strong temperature gradients as conduction is limited by the diffusive properties of the rock water mixture as groundwater with differing temperatures preferentially moves with bulk fluid flow through the variably active fractures it is slowed by transverse conduction into the adjacent porous rock dynamic systems will be characterized by more rapid movement of water with varying temperatures enhancing thermal disequilibrium nearest the fractures ge 1998

1968 was the first to use temperature as an analog for groundwater flow in fractured bedrock by collecting temperature profiles with a thermistor at various depths along open boreholes and then correlating inflections within the profile with the depths of bedding plane fractures that had previously been identified trainer was able to infer the location of hydraulically active fractures this method was further refined by analytically estimating flow rates based on the difference in temperature of water flowing into a borehole at one fracture set and exiting at another drury 1984 drury et al 1984 although cross connection has long been recognized price and williams 1993 and relied on for identifying transmissive fractures recent studies using fabric liners have shown that this cross

been explored pehme et al 2007 2010 2013 2014 2015 these works have involved passive and active line source als methods the latter involves heating the water column using a heating cable and monitoring the thermal decay recovery over time using a separate wire line tool als methods have been combined with fiber optic distributed temperature sensing dts systems introduced by coleman et al 2015 and summarized by bense et al 2016 in the work presented here the heating cable and fiber optic sensor can be combined into a single cable and placed between the fabric liner and formation rather than within the stagnant water column klepikova et al 2018 describes an alternative method to avoid or remove the effects of cross connection by infilling the open borehole with a relatively low permeable polyacrylamide gel this material can reduce vertical flow permitting measurement of hydraulic conditions at discrete depths although this material can be combined with fiber optic temperature sensors to investigate natural groundwater flow dynamics in the formation it is not a suitable material for wireline probing techniques ambient or passive temperature logging within sealed bedrock boreholes offers the benefit of capturing seasonal effects and atmospheric induced temperature dynamics here the magnitude and shape of the thermal deviation will depend on the flux aperture and orientations of the flow feature intersected by the borehole pehme et al 2015 fig 2 shows how a thermal deviation log can change in response to variable fracture flow properties and borehole conditions unlike als methods ambient temperature logs preserve the relative magnitude of spatiotemporal temperature variations associated with active flow zones intersecting the borehole minimizing

frameworks that improve interpretation of ambient temperature logs in shallow dynamic environments as ambient temperature profiles of a groundwater flow system are often subject to seasonal variations taniguchi 1993 there is currently no quantitative method to assess whether ambient subsurface temperature deviations along a presumed stagnant water column reflect groundwater flow along discrete factures intersected by the borehole fig 2a or simply represent coherent noise related to hydrodynamic mixing of the water column i e temperature density induced vertical convective flows fig 2b we aim to address this gap in distinguishing influences on the temperature profiles by applying statistical methods to quantitatively compare ambient temperature profiles collected within lined boreholes over a range of seasonal conditions our study specifically evaluates the utility of ambient temperature profiles collected in small diameter sealed bedrock boreholes completed in vertical and angled orientations with respect to the regional fracture network to better understand variability in groundwater flow based on measured thermal deviations along flute lined boreholes over time in discretely fractured shallow bedrock environments proximal to surface waters here temperature variations with depth are associated with fracture flow heterogeneity and thermal disequilibrium between ambient air temperatures surface water and the shallow groundwater flow system approximately 2 30 m bgs time lapse borehole temperature profiles were collected over a 1 year period in paired boreholes one angled and one vertical at three locations along a bedrock river this study builds upon the discrete fracture network matrix dfn m approach developed by parker 2007 and parker et al 2011 2012 which aims to characterize the individual or collective flow features dominated by discrete fractures or dissolution enhanced fractures and matrix porosity in a dolomitic sedimentary rock through the collection of multiple high resolution data sets therefore multiple data types and lines of evidence are used in this study to assess the utility of the time lapse ambient temperature profiles throughout an annual cycle for the conceptualization of groundwater flow in an environment under the direct influence of seasonal thermodynamics and surface water influences signal cross correlation and fourier spectra analysis were used to evaluate seasonal temperature trends this statistical diagnostic data analysis approach improves confidence in the interpretation of temperature logs indicative of hydraulically active flow zones under ambient conditions recognizing its transient nature due to seasonal conditions that is transferable to other shallow bedrock groundwater environments the utility of this approach is demonstrated through the development of a conceptual model for groundwater flow and groundwater surface water temperature conditions and their interaction in a temperate climate within a well monitored fractured bedrock river environment our novel approach will improve confidence in the interpretation of ambient thermal deviation logs collected in dynamic groundwater flow systems through better characterization of measurement noise associated with seasonal temperature fluctuations 2 site characterization and methods 2 1 regional setting the study site is located along the eramosa river in guelph ontario which is a major tributary of the speed river within the grand river watershed the region is located in a humid continental climate zone with air temperatures commonly ranging from 20 c to 30 c throughout the year and a mean annual temperature of 9 c the silurian bedrock underlying the region has been eroded through pre glacial glacial and glaciofluvial processes during the pleistocene creating complex networks of bedrock valleys karrow et al 1979 eyles et al 1997 gao 2011 while many of these bedrock valleys have been infilled with quaternary aged glacial and interglacial sediment some have remained exposed and become part of the modern surface water drainage network the eramosa river within the city of guelph flows along sections of an exposed paleo bedrock valley cole et al 2009 steelman et al 2018 the eramosa river cuts through the eramosa formation with minimal alluvium along its reach leaving extensive sections of exposed fractured bedrock directly connected to surface water steelman et al 2015a 2015b kennedy 2016 a detailed description of the regional lithostratigraphy can be found within brunton et al 2009 2013 while regional fracture network characterizations can be found in eyles et al 1997 and kunert et al 1998 the shaley dolostone eramosa formation locally referred to as the vinemount member is considered to be a regionally discontinuous aquitard cole et al 2009 however it can be heavily weathered and possess abundant horizontal and vertical fractures resulting in variable vertical connectivity at a local scale the eramosa overlies the cherty nodule rich ancaster member of the goat island formation whose contact is identified by a distinct colour change from dark grey to pale brown the lower goat island formation consists of the niagara falls member which is relatively thin at the site 2 4 m thick but resembles the deeper gasport formation in colour the gasport formation has many dissolution enhanced features and large vugs that make it more transmissive and an ideal water supply aquifer across the region kunert et al 1998 however municipal supply wells are not exclusively completed in this unit its characteristic reef mounds also cause the depth of the contact between goat island and gasport formations to be highly variable even at the local scale 10 s of meters brunton et al 2009 the study site known as the bedrock river research station brrs encompasses a 200 m reach of the eramosa river that includes an exposed bedrock floodplain to the south fig 3 during the winter months the eramosa river is likely to freeze and can exhibit substantial anchor ice along the exposed bedrock riverbed steelman et al 2017 the brrs is instrumented with an extensive network of bedrock riverbed seepage meters shallow piezometers and still wells located within the eramosa river kennedy 2017 steelman et al 2017 locally the water table resides between 1 5 and 2 0 m bgs the eramosa river experiences high flow rates during spring melt events 12 m3 s when air temperature first rises above 0 c and low flow during the hot dry summer months 0 70 m3 s river stage within the immediate study area ranges seasonally with maximum water levels 1 m during high flow and 0 1 m during low flow a summary of river flow rate and precipitation data during the study period is provided in fig 4 2 2 experimental design six continuously cored boreholes were drilled along the south shoreline between apr 2015 and may 2015 to the top of the gasport formation reaching vertical depths of 24 32 m bgs these boreholes were completed at three stations each consisting of a vertical and angled borehole pair fig 3 each borehole was drilled using a hydracore prospector hydracore drills delta b c equipped with an nq core tube and diamond drill bit that results in a 75 7 mm borehole diameter and 47 6 mm core diameter a continuous core was obtained from each borehole using a double barrel core sampler system vertical boreholes include scv1 scv2 and scv3 while the angled boreholes are denoted as sca1 sca2 and sca3 boreholes were positioned within a distance of 40 m of one another each angled borehole plunges at 60 from horizontal orientated at 50 185 and 340 from true north to optimally intersect the regional joint fracture orientations fig 3 sca1 and sca2 plunge beneath the eramosa river while sca3 extends south southeast under the floodplain thermal profiles were collected within each of the paired vertical scv1 scv2 scv3 and angled sca1 sca2 sca3 boreholes fig 3 a vertical and angled borehole pair was used to assess both horizontal and vertical components of the flow regime fig 5 with variable orientations to capture the complete fracture network here angled boreholes are more likely to intersect vertical and sub vertical fractures compared to their vertical counterpart temperature measurements were collected on 1 8 week intervals with more frequent sampling during seasonal transitional periods to capture a full range of seasonal thermal profile characteristics this resulted in a variable distribution of sampling events throughout the annual cycle with respect to seasonal variability in ambient air temperatures fig 4 2 3 borehole thermal profiling and signal analysis 2 3 1 wireline temperature trolling ambient temperature depth profiles were recorded using a wireline temperature trolling technique fig 6 a profile was collected in each borehole scv1 scv2 scv3 sca1 sca2 and sca3 every 1 8 weeks over a 12 month period between june 2014 and may 2015 however vertical boreholes scv1 scv2 and scv3 were not profiled during the winter months january through april due to freezing and ice formation at the top of the water column temperature profiles were collected using a probe constructed of an rbrsolo pressure transducer sn77917 50 m depth range and an rbrsolo temperature transducer sn75730 positioning the sensors in series leading with the temperature probe in this configuration the temperature and pressure sensors were vertically offset by 25 cm fig 6 this particular temperature sensor is factory calibrated with an accuracy of 0 002 c and resolution 0 00005 c and has the capacity to resolve 63 of a temperature change in 1 0 s 95 in 1 5 s and 99 in 2 s the manufacturer s reported response time for this instrument is 1 s rbr ltd ottawa canada in this study all temperature deviation measurements are reported to the nearest 0 01 c the transducers were synced to record at 0 5 s intervals 2 hz and the assembly was manually lowered down the lined borehole at an approximate rate of 0 5 m min each discretely sampled temperature time series was subsequently re sampled and converted to a uniformly sampled temperature depth series i e 0 01 m vertical sampling interval using the coincident pressure transducer data collected to confirm the depth of the temperature probe in the water column it should be noted that the rate of descent resulted in an average of 2 5 readings per centimetre length of borehole this resulted in an approximate equilibration time 1 25 s i e 1 5 s is required to achieve 95 full scale resolution for each centimeter sampled potential effects associated with displacement or mixing of the water column due to the probe assembly on thermal deviation signatures was assumed to be negligible e g pehme et al 2010 2015 2 3 2 critical thermal gradients cermak et al 2008a and 2008b showed how large thermal gradients can cause significant mixing of a standing water column within a borehole the critical thermal gradient i e the point at which density driven mixing within a water column will occur was calculated for both the vertical and angled holes using the following equation hales 1937 1 a cr g Œ≤ t c p c va g Œ≤ r o 4 where acr is the critical thermal gradient g is acceleration due to gravity Œ≤ is the coefficient of thermal volumetric expansion 2 14 10 4 1 k t is the water temperature in degrees kelvin cp is the specific heat capacity of water at constant pressure 4 09 103 j kg k c is a constant equal to 216 v is kinematic viscosity 1 34 10 6 m2 s and ro is the inside radius of the borehole here the critical thermal gradient is defined over a 1 m interval and will occur when dense cold water overlies less dense warm water this condition will result in density driven mixing along the water column the critical thermal gradient is dependent on the effective diameter of the borehole perpendicular to the gravitational vector since the effective diameter of an inclined borehole along the horizontal plane is larger than that of a vertical hole i e ellipse ro 0 0439 m major axis vs circle ro 0 0381 m it will also have a lower critical thermal gradient based on eq 1 the critical gradient in the vertical borehole would be 0 0074 c m while the angled borehole would have a lower value of 0 0042 c m it should be noted the critical thermal gradient calculated using eq 1 assumes a uniform circular radius therefore the calculated value for the dipping boreholes are considered a conservative estimate 2 3 3 thermal deviations a temperature deviation log which is sometimes referred to as a variability log pehme et al 2010 was calculated for each temperature depth profile using the following equation 2 t deviation t raw t smoothed where tdeviation is the instantaneous temperature deviation traw is the measured temperature while tsmoothed is the temperature after applying a low pass filter here a 1 m running average was applied to each temperature depth profile to reduce small scale variations yielding a smoothed base temperature log tsmoothed the window size was optimized by visually comparing 0 5 1 2 and 4 m length running averages in an attempt to remove the seasonal geothermal gradient while minimizing the frequency and amplitude of short period thermal deviations however the optimum selected window size will depend on site conditions and signal attributes of the thermal deviation log the resulting smoothed log captures the effects of longer term seasonal temperature variations and the geothermal gradient high frequency thermal deviations along the borehole can be accentuated by subtracting the smoothed log from the raw base log these so called deviation logs provide a measure of the position and magnitude of discrete temperature perturbations at the centimetre scale allowing identification of individual or a collection of hydraulically active fractures an example of the raw temperature profile and resulting thermal deviation log taken in sca1 for a date in september 2014 is provided in fig 7 2 3 4 signal cross correlation correlation is the statistical measure of dependence between two random variables regardless of causality samuels and witmer 1999 a correlation coefficient ranging from 1 to 1 is the most common measure of this dependence and represents the linearity of the relationship between two points as described by the following equation 3 r xy n x i y i x i y i n x i 2 x i 2 n y i 2 x i 2 where rxy is the correlation coefficient between two data sets x and y containing n values here a coefficient of 1 indicates that both variables increase at the same time and 1 indicates that one variable increases while the other decreases whereas a value of 0 indicates that there is no statistical relationship the correlation coefficient also accounts for noise as noisier data will move the coefficient towards 0 correlation coefficients were calculated between deviation logs within each of the six boreholes over the full 12 month period correlations were calculated across each lithologic unit i e vinemount member ancaster member niagara falls member and gasport formation to assess signal stationarity over the annual period the statistical procedure was coded and applied in r r core team 2013 2 3 5 frequency analysis fourier analysis was used to evaluate the spatial distribution i e frequency of thermal deviations along a borehole enabling a comparison of the frequency spectra from different boreholes and between different geologic units over an annual cycle ideally peak frequencies associated with discrete fractures in a dynamic system should exhibit a unique frequency spectrum independent of those associated with thermal noise due to convection cells i e extreme transients or limited thermal contrasts i e sensor resolution the spatial distribution of hydraulically active fractures will depend on the static fracture network fourier transforms corresponding to time lapse temperature deviation logs should exhibit similar diagnostic peaks assuming the active fractures and flow rate remain stationary over time i e the peaks occur at the same frequencies and are not influenced by a dynamic thermal gradient if the position of the hydraulically active fractures change or there is a major alteration in the magnitude of flow within a particular fracture set over time the frequency distribution associated with that borehole should vary therefore assessment of the thermal deviation frequency spectra at a given borehole over time will enable the identification of coherent signal attributes i e peaks in thermal deviation indicative of active fractures or features deviation logs from each sampling event for all six boreholes underwent a fourier transform in r r core team 2013 based on the discrete fourier transform 4 x k n 0 n 1 x n e i 2 œÄ n k n where x k is the discrete fourier transform of the time series x n n is the period of the signal k and n are integers and i 1 for the case of a thermal deviation log x n represents the change in temperature at depth position n a fourier transform was performed on each log in its entirety full borehole and across segments of each borehole aligned with lithologic units the highest frequency represented in a spectrum is determined by the maximum vertical sampling rate 5 f max 1 2 Œ¥ d where fmax represents the nyquest frequency or the highest resolvable frequency in the spectrum and Œ¥d is the spatial sampling interval here each thermal profile was resampled using a uniform sampling rate of 0 01 m therefore the highest frequency sampled is 50 m 1 for comparison amplitudes of the resultant fourier spectra were normalized based on the maximum amplitude within each spectrum 3 results and discussion 3 1 delineating flow in fractured rock regional lithologic contacts were identified in vertical and angled boreholes and included the vinemount ancaster ancaster niagara falls and niagara falls gasport fig 8 si 2 and si 3 both pyrite and calcite deposits which are indicators of groundwater flow were observed throughout each core with pyrite deposits occurring predominantly within the vinemount member 302 312 masl and calcite deposits occurring predominantly within the niagara falls member and gasport formation 281 300 masl all depths herein refer to true vertical depth tvd the niagara falls and gasport also contained vugs of varying sizes 3 60 mm some of which were filled with calcite crystals the vertical extent and relative weathering of these dissolution features are denoted in fig 8 the contact between the vinemount and ancaster members occurred at approximately 303 masl in all six wells while the ancaster niagara falls 296 301 masl and niagara falls gasport 294 298 masl contacts were more variable in elevation refer to si 1 detailed hydraulic head profiles provided estimates of the vertical component of the hydraulic gradient at several increments along the length of the boreholes while discrete interval packer tests and flute liner transmissivity profiles revealed variations in horizontal hydraulic conductivity under forced gradient conditions si 4 lithology and fracture characteristics were assessed using continuous core logs and several geophysical logs with details of fracture distributions and characteristics provided in fig 8 si 2 and si 3 and tabulated in si 5 the transmissivity of the upper 7 m of the vinemount member ranged from 10 7 to 10 6 m2 s and was accompanied by limited head loss along the vertical profile see si 1 a higher degree of fracturing especially along bedding plane factures i e horizontal 10 4 9 8 3 fractures m sub vertical 10 1 2 5 1 fractures m was observed in this section of the vinemount indicating greater hydraulic connectivity the lowermost 2 m of the vinemount and vinemount ancaster member contact fig 8 si 2 and si 3 exhibited relatively high horizontal transmissivity values in each borehole i e 10 5 10 4 m2 s meanwhile the head loss observed across this interval see si 4 indicates the presence of a lower permeability zone or feature impeding vertical groundwater flow although the exact position of this feature is not well resolved in the vertical head profiles the ancaster member 9 14 mbgs and the ancaster niagara falls member contact fig 8 si 2 and si 3 exhibited similarly high horizontal transmissivity values i e 10 5 10 4 m2 s and was accompanied by more fractures i e 4 6 7 5 fractures m and a further reduction in hydraulic head see si 4 these attributes support the dominance of horizontal groundwater flow above and below a low permeable feature or boundary conversely the underlying niagara falls member 14 17 mbgs and the niagara falls gasport contact fig 8 si 2 and si 3 are

4 m2 s again this indicates that the niagara falls member possesses a relatively lower vertical component of flow and thus is likely acting as a local hydraulic barrier between more transmissive zones

zones were accompanied by dissolution enhanced conduits observed between 27 30 mbgs which also dominated the flute transmissivity profiles e g scv3 and sca3 in fig 8 cumulative fracture plots show variability in fracture distribution with depth across the site fig 8 inflections i e changes in fracture frequency occur within the vinemount and ancaster members while none were observed within the

detailed summary of the fracture data is provided in si 5 3 2 intra seasonal temperature fluctuations signal stationarity vertical thermal gradients were calculated along 1 m segments of the raw borehole temperature profiles over an annual cycle fig 9 here a positive gradient indicates a warming water column with depth downward warming while a negative gradient indicates a cooling water column with depth downward cooling water column temperatures ranged from 5 c to 25 c within the heterothermic zone over the monitored annual cycle thermal gradients in september and october show a strong downward cooling trend extending 10 12 mbgs although profiles from may and june show similar downward cooling trends the vertical extent of the transients i e sca3 fig 9 are restricted to the upper few meters of the borehole reversals in the thermal gradient were observed through the seasons the transition to frozen conditions was accompanied by a water column freeze up in each of the vertical boreholes while the angled holes remained unfrozen temperature profiles along the angled boreholes during the winter period revealed multiple thermal inflections where gradients oscillated between downward warming and downward cooling over relatively short intervals 1 2 m thermal inflections are denoted by the triangles in fig 9 thermal deviation logs calculated from the temperature profiles fig 9 si 6 si 10 reveal small scale perturbations with depth the majority of these occurred within the uppermost 10 mbgs however smaller scaled deviations were detected up to 14 mbgs during the september to october period 16 mbgs during november and december 20 m from may to june up to a maximum depth of 26 mbgs from january to april the maximum vertical extent of detectable thermal deviations along sca3 are denoted by a horizontal line along each of the deviation logs thermal deviation logs exhibit a systematic seasonal evolution in their signal attributes i e frequency and amplitude for instance logs collected during the warmer summer period were mutually consistent and were characterized by strongly negative thermal gradients with amplitude deviations near surface that progressively weakened with depth the transition to the cooler fall period was accompanied by a reduction in signal amplitudes near surface and more uniform thermal gradients a marked increase in signal amplitudes and overall frequency content i e noise was observed during the frozen winter period cross correlation was used to assess the temporal consistency of thermal deviation logs collected over an annual cycle in each borehole fig 10 positive cross correlations blue were observed amongst datasets collected during consistent seasonal temperatures but did not persist for many consecutive events and varied by lithostratigraphic unit and or depth strong positive cross correlation was observed in each borehole between sep 4 and oct 3 within the uppermost vinemount and ancaster members similar intra seasonal positive correlations were observed during the february to april period in the deeper niagara falls member and gasport formation in the angled boreholes however the winter period was marked by a more variable distribution of weakly positive blue or negative orange correlations within the vinemount and ancaster members these largely warming downward profiles demarcated by numerous inflections in the thermal gradient fig 9 exhibited variable degrees of correlation between adjacent datasets separated by relatively short periods of time i e 1 2 weeks indicating non stationary signal attributes frequency spectra of thermal deviation logs from intra seasonal groups exhibiting a strong positive cross correlation coefficient i e blue regions in fig 10 are characterized by similar peak frequencies and bandwidths for instance strong positive correlations were observed in the vinemount member between sep 4 and oct 3 fig 11 coherent signals were detected below 10 m 1 similar peak frequency characteristics were observed in each borehole with primary peaks and those with the highest amplitude always occurring below 3 m 1 frequency spectra from the vertical boreholes fig 11a were unimodal i e a singular peak exhibiting one major peak with minimal higher frequency content i e less noise the angled boreholes fig 11b also exhibited similar peak frequencies however were accompanied by additional higher order modes above the peak frequency e g multiple high amplitude peaks this consistency in signal stationarity between sampling events indicates that thermal deviations between logs are associated with laterally continuous flow features signal stationarity was also noted during downward warming conditions along the deeper niagara falls member and gasport formation within the angled wells between feb 27 mar 11 and mar 24 fig 12 here the fourier spectra for the gasport formation show three shared peaks below 7 m 1 with no discernible peaks at higher frequencies however a comparison of the peak signal frequencies observed within the shallower vinemount and ancaster members during the same time period show all logs exhibiting multiple mutually inconsistent low frequency peaks 7 m 1 and the presence of multiple high frequency peaks this inconsistency in frequency content suggests that portions of these signals are attributed to measurement noise and implies that while the depth of thermal detection may increase during the downward warming periods winter these periods will also be accompanied by higher amplitude noise within shallower portions of the borehole due to free convection of the stagnant water column 3 3 implications of free convection to thermal deviation logs the temporal characteristics of a borehole thermal profile were strongly dependent on seasonal temperature conditions raw temperature profiles revealed a 20 c temperature swing in the uppermost formation as the borehole water column transitioned from downward cooling in the summer to downward warming in the winter fig 9 si 6 10 the magnitude of vertical temperature gradients along the lined water column during downward warming periods exceeded the threshold required to induce free convection in a water column and was especially strong in the upper 15 m of the borehole e g observed along angled boreholes during winter periods here density driven convection during the cooler winter period induced a thermal disequilibrium between the borehole stagnant water column and adjacent formation water rock mixture within the homothermic zone although thermal deviations were more readily detected in the deeper portion of the boreholes during the winter period signals became less stable and were accompanied by an increase in signal amplitude and frequency content in the upper 10 15 m of the boreholes november april fig 9 than those that were observed during the contrasting warmer periods may october fig 9 elevated thermal deviations near surface are most likely attributed to varyingly scaled convection cells sammel 1968 borner and berthold 2009 that formed as the borehole water column temperatures approached 4 c therefore the shallow responses observed in the frequency spectra represent the cumulative effects of convection cells and water with different temperatures flowing along discrete fractures in the formation inter seasonal datasets can be distinguished in terms of their non stationary signal attributes fig 13 the correlation of thermal deviation logs together with an analysis of peak frequency distribution over time showed that the formation of free convection cells will ultimately limit the utility of a thermal deviation log in the near surface colder winter months were accompanied by an enhancement in the formation of free convection cells although this dampens thermal deviation signals in the heterothermic zone it also induced a thermal disequilibrium within the homothermic zone and thus the detection of thermal deviations associated with active groundwater flow that would otherwise remain undefined in the absence of free convection free convection cells ultimately increased the depth of detectable thermal deviations while obscuring the signals in shallower sections where thermal gradients exceed the critical value e g vertical borehole acr 0 0074 c m angled borehole acr 0 0042 c m the disequilibrium induced by free convection cells deeper in the profile yielded a relatively stationary thermal deviation signal the presence of mutually consistent frequency spectra within the lowermost gasport relative to the overlying ancaster in fig 12 indicates that thermal gradients in deeper sections likely did not exceed the critical gradients instead the induced disequilibrium deeper in the water column was predominantly influenced by the temperature contrast between borehole water column and the formation this response suggests varying hydraulic conditions deeper in the borehole that were undetectable during the warmer summer months this interpretation is consistent with field observations by cermak et al 2008a who noted that temperature time series collected in shallow monitoring wells have a propensity to exhibit intermittent non periodic oscillations that will diminish with increasing depth subsequent numerical simulations by cermak et al 2008b revealed that free convection cells could result in a thermally unstable water column and would be accompanied by complex thermal oscillations confirming that the water column in a borehole can become unstable when the geothermal gradient exceeds the critical value ultimately this instability will result in the formation of cascading convection cells and a predominantly stochastic temperature signal however these effects will diminish with increasing depth as the thermal gradient progressively decreases cermak et al 2008b noted the lack of strong horizontal thermal boundaries between convection cells as a cause for the cells mixing and the resultant non periodic oscillating temperature signature this means that mixing through free convection cells will likely be higher in the more vertically fractured vinemount and ancaster members where thermal disturbances caused by flow are associated with a more transmissive and highly fractured vertical and horizontal formation compared to the more limited horizontal fracturing of the gasport formation the lower frequency of dipping fractures i e 10 observed in the gasport together with the smaller thermal gradients likely reduces the probability that hydraulic activity through these features will result in thermal boundaries across a non horizontal plane within the water column this is evidence that thermal deviation logs of geologic units with predominantly horizontal hydraulic activity during downward warming periods may exhibit more consistent detectable thermal deviations in the presence of free convection cells 3 4 delineation of hydraulically active zones using thermal deviation logs given the relationship between intra seasonal stability and the depth of detection section 3 2 fig 9 multiple thermal deviation logs from different seasons can be used to identify hydraulically active zones along the length of a borehole to illustrate this process thermal deviation logs from sep 4 sep 18 and oct 3 from sca3 were selected to characterize the vinemount and ancaster members while logs from feb 27 mar 11 and mar 31 were used for the niagara falls member and gasport formation refer to figs 8 and 9 the fall thermal deviation logs were chosen for having multiple closely spaced sampling events showing repeatability or reproducibility of measurements which improved our confidence in the interpretation of thermal deviations hydraulically active zones were identified along sca3 based on an integrated interpretation of borehole geologic geophysical and hydrogeologic measurements together with a representative suite of thermal deviation logs fig 14 the upper 7 m of the vinemount member is differentiated into 3 contiguous hydraulically active zones zones a c here thermal measurements reveal a single high amplitude deviation between 3 and 4 mbgs zone a this deviation coincides with a zone of intensive fracturing identified in both the core and acoustic televiewer atv logs from 4 to 5 5 m bgs lower amplitude thermal deviations were detected and are interpreted as multiple active zones that align with atv horizontal fracture picks zones b due to the superposition of thermal deviation signals associated with the large number of fractures within this contiguous interval it is difficult to associate individual thermal deviations with specific fractures however it is reasonable to assume that there are multiple hydraulically active fractures with similar and lower magnitudes of flow and that this activity is contributing to transience in the thermal deviation logs pehme et al 2013 lastly there are two distinct peaks between 5 5 and 6 5 mbgs that correspond with the depths of two broken zones zone c within the lowermost 3 m of the vinemount there is one identifiable peak in the thermal deviation log between 7 5 and 8 5 mbgs there is a wide peak of larger amplitude than those of the zone above it suggesting a more hydraulically active interval zone d given the width of the peak and the number of fractures in the atv and core logs at that depth the hydraulic activity can most likely be attributed to a fracture set along this 1 m interval there are three thermal deviations within the ancaster member zones e g with the first zone e occurring at approximately 10 5 mbgs just below the vinemount ancaster contact this depth range corresponds with a zone of higher transmissivity identified by packer testing and flute profiling the other two deviations located at 12 5 and 13 5 m bgs zones f and g respectively both correspond with individual fractures detected within the atv and core logs and likely represent locations of groundwater flow however their amplitudes are much smaller than those observed higher in the profile the winter thermal deviation logs were used to characterize hydraulic conditions within the deeper niagara falls member and the gasport formation these data show a single yet repeatable deviation located at the ancaster niagara falls contact at approximately 14 mbgs zone h which corresponds to a fracture identified in the atv and core logs however other than that single deviation there is minimal repeatability between logs within the niagara falls member potentially a result of free convection this lack of intra seasonal repeatability means that while there is thermal activity these thermal deviations cannot provide conclusive evidence of hydraulic activity along any particular discrete flow feature within this geologic unit the gasport contains five distinct zones of hydraulic activity zones i m the uppermost section is defined by three contiguous intervals a highly fractured and vuggy zone between 16 and 18 mbgs exhibiting multiple low amplitude thermal deviations indicative of multiple hydraulically active features along its reach that are too closely spaced to be individually identified zone i a less vuggy interval with no fractures from 18 to 19 5 mbgs demarcated by a broader thermal deviation zone j and an interval defined by limited vugginess with a few fractures from 19 5 to 20 5 mbgs defined by multiple moderate amplitude deviations zone k finally two distinct peaks in thermal deviation were observed along fractures at 22 and 22 5 mbgs zones l and m respectively indicating that each is likely hydraulically active although additional information may be gleaned from thermal deviation logs i e lower amplitude events limited coherency or non stationary signals the zones identified in this study would be considered the dominant flow zones within these formations thermal deviations from logs shown to be statistically similar within an intra seasonal period can be used to identify zones of formation hydraulic activity and their characteristics with numerous depth discrete features based on core and geophysical logs however the limited spatial resolution inherent with temperature methods 10 cm and close spacing of fractures resulted in the inability to identify the position of individual discrete features fractures in certain cases in which case only a zone of hydraulic activity could be determined 3 5 bedrock groundwater flow system conceptualization groundwater flow in fractured sedimentary rock can be highly heterogeneous depending on fracture orientation frequency and aperture and how the borehole intersects the fracture network however this paper shows that interpretation of multiple thermal deviation logs collected in shallow environments over a range of seasons with varying hydraulic and thermal conditions can provide valuable insights into the dynamic and transient behaviour of groundwater flow systems e g fig 5 quantitative evaluation of the attributes of a thermal profile of a lined borehole can aid in the conceptualization of the depth distribution of ambient flow paths particularly in shallow environments where groundwater temperatures are more susceptible to atmospheric transients in temperature and enhanced by seasonal recharge and discharge patterns the information gained from any single borehole will be dependent on its positioning and orientation with respect to the local fracture network the fourier spectra for each borehole during stable intra seasonal periods i e summer fall show distinct peak frequencies for each lithostratigraphically defined geologic unit i e no two boreholes displayed the same peak frequency values for a given geologic unit this suggests that the position of a flow zone within a geologic unit can vary significantly between adjacent boreholes spaced 10 s of metres apart the more transient behaviour of thermal deviations within the angled boreholes suggests a stronger vertical component of flow across the system compared to the nearby or adjacent vertical borehole profiles likely due to better connectivity of the borehole with the near vertical fracture features refer to si 5 however a portion of this transience could be associated with more readily forming free convection cells nonetheless the absence of an ice layer within the water columns of the angled boreholes due to their lower critical thermal gradient and intersection with higher numbers of vertical fractures compared to the vertical holes enabled the collection of thermal profiles during periods that would otherwise be missed using a standard vertical borehole of a similar core diameter the deeper information gained from angled holes improved hydrologic interpretation of thermal deviation responses across the study site of course an artificial heat source could be used to raise the temperature of the water column in the sealed borehole creating a temporary thermal disequilibrium between the fluids of the sealed water column and the formation although these active line source methods provide an instantaneous representation of thermal deviations along a borehole longer term spatiotemporal variations in thermal signatures associated with hydrologic processes i e seasonal dynamics are not easily assessed one surprising observation is the seemingly limited correlation between thermal deviation activity or intervals of activity and the positioning of relatively permeable intervals based on high resolution packer testing and flute transmissivity profiling hydraulic tests provide a measure of the physical flow property of the rock i e potential transmissivity based on physical attributes however these properties may not necessary align with ambient or natural gradient hydraulic activity which can occur along a different network or number of fractures due to removal of borehole conduit effects although the apparent disconnect between formation transmissivity and thermal deviation activity at the bulk scale might seem disconcerting other workers have repeatedly shown that high resolution packer testing measurements 1 5 m interval simply cannot resolve active flow features that occur at a centimeter scale e g pehme et al 2013 2015 4 conclusions use of ambient groundwater temperature profiles collected across a network of vertical and angled boreholes sealed with flute liners for characterization of shallow groundwater flow systems in a seasonally dynamic environment was evaluated through an analysis of time lapse thermal deviation logs a combination of time series and frequency spectra analyses was used to evaluate changes in thermal deviation signals over a 12 month period although portions of the thermal deviation logs were variably impacted by the formation of free convection cells within the borehole water column depending on the magnitude of the seasonal thermal gradient periods of intra seasonal thermal stability were observed typically spanning 2 3 sampling events over a 1 2 month period the position of discrete flow features based on the occurrence and attributes of thermal deviations together with lithological geophysical and hydraulic information was determined along the length of each borehole seasonal transience in thermal deviation logs was largely attributed to density driven mixing of the borehole water column which led to short period thermal disequilibrium between the fluids in the water column and the ambient groundwater temperatures although this led to a more complicated hydrologic interpretation of thermal deviations close to surface it enabled detection of flow features within the deeper homothermic zone as a result a combination of thermal deviation logs taken within a two week period following the hottest and coldest weeks of the year were found to be most representative of hydraulic activity along the full length of the borehole a statistical analysis of time lapse thermal deviation logs proved useful for discrimination of fracture and atmospherically induced thermal deviations providing a more diagnostic measure for the analysis of time lapse data and description of the inter and intra seasonal impacts of shallow flow system dynamics on temperature measurements ambient temperature profiles proved effective at identifying ambient groundwater flow locations in fractured sedimentary rock during periods of intra seasonal stability combined with geophysical and core logs thermal deviation logs aided in the identification of pertinent flow features and assessment of relative changes in hydraulic activity including areas of medium to high vugginess without the added contribution of borehole cross connection or introduction of artificially induced thermal gradients i e via active heating methods there was also strong evidence of a significant vertical groundwater flow component within the upper 8 m of the angled boreholes that is consistent with the presence of a dynamic groundwater surface water system adjacent to the borehole network free convection within the lined water column was commonly associated with periods of non stationarity and at times posed limitations on this ambient temperature methodology however the statistical framework employed here helped define the lateral extent of free convection effects and enabled a lithologic classification of thermal transients associated with groundwater flow features when applied across a network of boreholes of varying depths and orientations with respect to the regional fracture network cross correlation and frequency analysis of time lapse thermal profiles proved to be an effective diagnostic tool that increased confidence in the hydrologic interpretation of thermal deviation logs under both periods of stability and transience though the utility of ambient temperature profiling in sealed boreholes is promising several improvements to the methodological and analytical techniques presented herein would improve hydrologic interpretation and ultimately the utility of a temperature log in any hydraulically and thermally dynamic environment identification of high frequency noise arising from free convection within the water column and subsequent removal of this signal based on a comparison with more stationary periods might improve interpretation of gradient driven thermal signals associated with discrete fracture networks this could further increase the utility of ambient temperature profiling methods in lined boreholes using wireline methods temporary depth discrete instruments or fibre optic distributed temperature sensors regardless of the method used to characterize the groundwater flow system a statistical analysis of high resolution time lapse temperature data sets enables detection and quantification of flow system transients deeper in the system and improves detection of free convention along the water column more frequent sampling over the course of a calendar year would also improve the method s ability to differentiate between single isolated events i e major recharge events and seasonal trends within the shallow subsurface such data would aid in the conceptualization of groundwater surface

6881,this study evaluates the utility of ambient temperature profiles collected in sealed bedrock boreholes to assess variability in groundwater flow in discretely fractured shallow bedrock environments a conceptual model for groundwater flow and groundwater surface water temperature conditions and their interaction in a temperate climate is developed through a statistical interpretation of time lapse thermal deviation logs temperature profiles were collected in three angled and three vertical boreholes drilled to 24 32 mbgs meters below ground surface and temporarily sealed with an impermeable fabric liner in a fractured dolostone bedrock aquifer adjacent to and extending beneath a bedrock river to monitor seasonal hydrodynamics ambient borehole temperature profiles collected every 1 8 weeks over a 12 month period identified zones of hydraulic activity during periods of intra seasonal stability without the interference of open borehole cross connection signal cross correlation and fourier spectra analysis of thermal deviation logs provided a novel way to observe the shallow bedrock flow system s temperature evolution due to advection along discrete fractures in response to seasonal transience and to identify and isolate noise caused by free convection cells within the sealed borehole this approach represents a diagnostic tool that improves confidence in identifying depth discrete hydraulically active fracture zones from thermal deviation data sets in a shallow fractured sedimentary bedrock environment variably scaled free convection cells were observed within the borehole water columns during the colder winter periods although these periods were accompanied by higher signal noise near the river atmospheric interface these cells led to a temporary thermal disequilibrium between the borehole water column and formation water deeper in the bedrock these conditions increased the maximum depth of thermal detections associated with discrete groundwater flow features from 14 mbgs in the summer to 26 mbgs in the winter thereby enhancing the understanding of shallow groundwater flow systems under the direct influence of surface water keywords fractured rock groundwater temperature logging thermal deviation free convection bedrock rivers sealed boreholes 1 introduction bedrock aquifers represent an important source of fresh water readily available for many communities around the world as attention paid to water availability issues grows both locally and globally so too does the importance of understanding the hydrogeologic conditions sustaining this valuable resource less studied than their alluvial counterparts bedrock groundwater systems are more complex with flow and transport governed by the occurrence of many connected fractures fracture networks in sedimentary rocks are heterogeneous and anisotropic by nature due to variability in fracture aperture and connectivity resulting in a more complex network of flow paths than that typical of granular media due to the relatively discrete nature of these small aperture fractures it is their connectivity that influences the bulk conductivity anisotropic flow paths and the positioning of hydrologic boundaries hence understanding the distribution of discrete flow features through complementary high resolution data sets has become an essential element in the development of conceptual hydrologic models of fractured rock environments parker et al 2012 and references therein temperature has been shown to be an effective groundwater tracer particularly for the identification of preferential flow pathways in heterogeneous and anisotropic rock anderson 2005 the flow of heat in groundwater is controlled by convection advection and conduction diffusion processes density driven transfer of heat is referred to as free convection whereas forced convection describes heat transfer by other mechanisms e g hydraulic gradients in fractured sedimentary rock temperature distributions will depend on the movement of water along fractures and thermal exchange between the fractures and matrix this can lead to uneven temperature distributions in fractured sedimentary rock diagnostic of the variability in advective fluxes along variably connected fractures the low permeability rock matrix fosters strong temperature gradients as conduction is limited by the diffusive properties of the rock water mixture as groundwater with differing temperatures preferentially moves with bulk fluid flow through the variably active fractures it is slowed by transverse conduction into the adjacent porous rock dynamic systems will be characterized by more rapid movement of water with varying temperatures enhancing thermal disequilibrium nearest the fractures ge 1998

temperatures as well as recharge and discharge patterns i e transient hydraulic processes while groundwater temperatures within the homothermic zone will follow the ambient geothermal gradient drogue

1968 was the first to use temperature as an analog for groundwater flow in fractured bedrock by collecting temperature profiles with a thermistor at various depths along open boreholes and then correlating inflections within the profile with the depths of bedding plane fractures that had previously been identified trainer was able to infer the location of hydraulically active fractures this method was further refined by analytically estimating flow rates based on the difference in temperature of water flowing into a borehole at one fracture set and exiting at another drury 1984 drury et

than within the stagnant water column klepikova et al 2018 describes an alternative method to avoid or remove the effects of cross connection by infilling the open borehole with a relatively low permeable polyacrylamide gel this material can reduce vertical flow permitting measurement of hydraulic conditions at discrete depths although this material can be combined with fiber optic temperature sensors to investigate natural groundwater flow dynamics in the formation it is not a suitable material for wireline probing techniques ambient or passive temperature logging within sealed bedrock boreholes offers the benefit of capturing seasonal effects and atmospheric induced temperature dynamics here the magnitude and shape of the thermal deviation will depend on the flux aperture

taniguchi 1993 there is currently no quantitative method to assess whether ambient subsurface temperature deviations along a presumed stagnant water column reflect groundwater flow along discrete factures intersected by the borehole fig 2a or simply represent coherent noise related to hydrodynamic mixing of the water column i e temperature density induced vertical convective flows fig 2b we aim to address this gap in distinguishing influences on the temperature profiles by applying statistical methods to quantitatively compare ambient temperature profiles collected within lined boreholes over a range of seasonal conditions our study specifically evaluates the utility of ambient temperature profiles collected in small diameter sealed bedrock boreholes completed in vertical and angled orientations with respect to the regional fracture network to better understand variability in groundwater flow based on measured thermal deviations along flute lined boreholes over time in discretely fractured shallow bedrock environments proximal to surface waters here temperature variations with depth are associated with fracture flow heterogeneity and thermal disequilibrium between ambient air temperatures surface water and the shallow groundwater flow system approximately 2 30 m bgs time lapse borehole temperature profiles were collected over a 1 year period in paired boreholes one angled and one vertical at three locations along a bedrock river this study builds upon the discrete fracture network matrix dfn m approach developed by parker 2007 and parker et al 2011 2012 which aims to characterize the individual or collective flow features dominated by discrete fractures or dissolution enhanced fractures and matrix porosity in a dolomitic sedimentary rock through the collection of multiple high resolution data sets therefore multiple data types and lines of evidence are used in this study to assess the utility of the time lapse ambient temperature profiles throughout an annual cycle for the conceptualization of groundwater flow in an environment under the direct influence of seasonal thermodynamics and surface water influences signal cross correlation and fourier spectra analysis were used to evaluate seasonal temperature trends this statistical diagnostic data analysis approach improves confidence in the interpretation of temperature logs indicative of hydraulically active flow zones under ambient conditions recognizing its transient nature due to seasonal conditions that is transferable to other shallow bedrock groundwater environments the utility of this approach is demonstrated through the development of a conceptual model for groundwater flow and groundwater surface water temperature conditions and their interaction in a temperate climate within a well monitored fractured bedrock river environment our novel approach will improve confidence in the interpretation of ambient thermal deviation logs collected in dynamic groundwater flow systems through better characterization of measurement noise associated with seasonal temperature fluctuations 2 site characterization and methods 2 1 regional setting the study site is located along the eramosa river in guelph ontario which is a major tributary of the speed river within the grand river watershed the region is located in a humid continental climate zone with air temperatures commonly ranging from 20 c to 30 c throughout the year and a mean annual temperature of 9 c the silurian bedrock underlying the region has been eroded through pre glacial glacial and glaciofluvial processes during the pleistocene creating complex networks of bedrock valleys karrow et al 1979 eyles et al 1997 gao 2011 while many of these bedrock valleys have been infilled with quaternary aged glacial and interglacial sediment some have remained exposed and become part of the modern surface water drainage network the eramosa river within the city of guelph flows along sections of an exposed paleo bedrock valley cole et al 2009 steelman et al 2018 the eramosa river cuts through the eramosa formation with minimal alluvium along its reach leaving extensive sections of exposed fractured bedrock

network characterizations can be found in eyles et al 1997 and kunert et al 1998 the shaley dolostone eramosa formation locally referred to as the vinemount member is considered to be a regionally discontinuous aquitard cole et al 2009 however it can be heavily weathered and possess abundant horizontal and vertical fractures resulting in variable vertical connectivity at a local scale the eramosa overlies the cherty nodule rich ancaster member of the goat island formation whose contact is identified by a distinct colour change from dark grey to pale brown the lower goat island formation consists of the niagara falls member which is relatively thin at the site 2 4 m thick but resembles the deeper gasport formation in colour the gasport formation has many dissolution enhanced features and large vugs that make it more transmissive and an ideal water supply aquifer across the region kunert et al 1998 however municipal supply wells are not exclusively completed in this unit its characteristic reef mounds also cause the depth of the contact between goat island and gasport formations to be highly variable even at the local scale 10 s of meters brunton et al 2009 the study site known as the bedrock river research station brrs encompasses a 200 m reach of the eramosa river that includes an exposed bedrock floodplain to the south fig 3 during the winter months the eramosa river is likely to freeze and can exhibit substantial anchor ice along the exposed bedrock riverbed steelman et al 2017 the brrs is instrumented with an extensive network of bedrock riverbed seepage

high flow rates during spring melt events 12 m3 s when air temperature first rises above 0 c and low flow during the hot dry summer months 0 70 m3 s river stage within the immediate study area ranges seasonally with maximum water levels 1 m during high flow and 0 1 m during low flow a summary of river flow rate and precipitation data during the study period is provided in fig 4 2 2 experimental design six continuously cored boreholes were drilled along the south shoreline between apr 2015 and may 2015 to the top of the gasport formation reaching vertical depths of 24 32 m bgs these boreholes were completed at three stations each consisting of a vertical and angled borehole pair fig 3 each borehole was drilled using a hydracore prospector hydracore drills delta b c equipped with an nq core tube and diamond drill bit that results in a 75 7 mm borehole diameter and 47 6 mm core diameter a continuous core was obtained from each borehole using a double barrel core sampler system vertical boreholes include scv1 scv2 and scv3 while the angled boreholes are denoted as sca1 sca2 and sca3 boreholes were positioned within a distance of 40 m of one another each angled borehole plunges at 60 from horizontal orientated at 50 185 and 340 from true north to optimally intersect the regional joint fracture orientations fig 3 sca1 and sca2 plunge beneath the eramosa river while sca3 extends south southeast under the floodplain thermal profiles were collected within each of the paired vertical scv1 scv2 scv3 and angled sca1 sca2 sca3 boreholes fig 3 a vertical and angled borehole pair was used to assess both horizontal and vertical components of the flow regime fig 5 with variable orientations to capture the complete fracture network here angled boreholes are more likely to intersect vertical and sub vertical fractures compared to their vertical counterpart temperature measurements were collected on 1 8 week intervals with more frequent sampling during seasonal transitional periods to capture a full range of seasonal thermal profile characteristics this resulted in a variable distribution of sampling events throughout the annual cycle with respect to seasonal variability in ambient air temperatures fig 4 2 3 borehole thermal profiling and signal analysis 2 3 1 wireline temperature trolling ambient temperature depth profiles were recorded using a wireline temperature trolling technique fig 6 a profile was collected in each borehole scv1 scv2 scv3 sca1 sca2 and sca3 every 1 8 weeks over a 12 month period between june 2014 and may 2015 however vertical boreholes scv1 scv2 and scv3 were not profiled during the winter months january through april due to freezing and ice formation at the top of the water column temperature profiles were collected using a probe constructed of an rbrsolo pressure transducer sn77917 50 m depth range and an rbrsolo temperature transducer sn75730 positioning the sensors in series leading with the temperature probe in this configuration the temperature and pressure sensors were vertically offset by 25 cm fig 6 this particular temperature sensor is factory calibrated with an accuracy of 0 002 c and resolution 0 00005 c and has the capacity to resolve 63 of a temperature change in 1 0 s 95 in 1 5 s and 99 in 2 s the manufacturer s reported response time for this instrument is 1 s rbr ltd ottawa canada in this study all temperature deviation measurements are reported to the nearest 0 01 c the transducers were synced to record at 0 5 s intervals 2 hz and the assembly was manually lowered down the lined borehole at an approximate rate of 0 5 m min each discretely sampled temperature time series was subsequently re sampled and converted to a uniformly sampled temperature depth series i e 0 01 m vertical sampling interval using the coincident pressure transducer data collected to confirm the depth of the temperature probe in the water column it should be noted that the rate of descent resulted in an average of 2 5 readings per centimetre length of borehole this resulted in an approximate equilibration time 1 25 s i e 1 5 s is required to achieve 95 full scale resolution for each centimeter sampled potential effects associated with displacement or mixing of the water column due to the probe assembly on thermal deviation signatures was assumed to be negligible e g pehme et al 2010 2015 2 3 2 critical thermal gradients cermak et al 2008a and 2008b showed how large thermal gradients can cause significant mixing of a standing water column within a borehole the critical thermal gradient i e the point at which density driven mixing within a water column will occur was calculated for both the vertical and angled holes using the following equation hales 1937 1 a cr g Œ≤ t c p c va g Œ≤ r o 4 where acr is the critical thermal gradient g is acceleration due to gravity Œ≤ is the coefficient of thermal volumetric expansion 2 14 10 4 1 k t is the water temperature in degrees kelvin cp is the specific heat capacity of water at constant pressure 4 09 103 j kg k c is a constant equal to 216 v is kinematic viscosity 1 34 10 6 m2 s and ro is the inside radius of the borehole here the critical thermal gradient is defined over a 1 m interval and will occur when dense cold water overlies less dense warm water this condition will result in density driven mixing along the water column the critical thermal gradient is dependent on the effective diameter of the borehole perpendicular to the gravitational vector since the effective diameter of an inclined borehole along the horizontal plane is larger than that of a vertical hole i e ellipse ro 0 0439 m major axis vs circle ro 0 0381 m it will also have a lower critical thermal gradient based on eq 1 the critical gradient in the vertical borehole would be 0 0074 c m while the angled borehole would have a lower value of 0 0042 c m it should be noted the critical thermal gradient calculated using eq 1 assumes a uniform circular radius therefore the calculated value for the dipping boreholes are considered a conservative estimate 2 3 3 thermal deviations a temperature deviation log which is sometimes referred to as a variability log pehme et al 2010 was calculated for each temperature depth profile using the following equation 2 t deviation t raw t smoothed where tdeviation is the instantaneous temperature deviation traw is the measured temperature while tsmoothed is the temperature after applying a low pass filter here a 1 m running average was applied to each temperature depth profile to reduce small scale variations yielding a smoothed base temperature log tsmoothed the window size was optimized by visually comparing 0 5 1 2 and 4 m length running averages in an attempt to remove the seasonal geothermal gradient while minimizing the frequency and amplitude of short period thermal deviations however the optimum selected window size will depend on site conditions and signal attributes of the thermal deviation log the resulting smoothed log captures the effects of longer term seasonal temperature variations and the geothermal gradient high frequency thermal deviations along the borehole can be accentuated by subtracting the smoothed log from the raw base log these so called deviation logs provide a measure of the position and magnitude of discrete temperature perturbations at the centimetre scale allowing identification of individual or a collection of hydraulically active fractures an example of the raw temperature profile and resulting thermal deviation log taken in sca1 for a date in september 2014 is provided in fig 7 2 3 4 signal cross correlation correlation is the statistical measure of dependence between two random variables regardless of causality samuels and witmer 1999 a correlation coefficient ranging from 1 to 1 is the most common measure of this dependence and represents the linearity of the relationship between two points as described by the following equation 3 r xy n x i y i x i y i n x i 2 x i 2 n y i 2 x i 2 where rxy is the correlation coefficient between two data sets x and y containing n values here a coefficient of 1 indicates that both variables increase at the same time and 1 indicates that one variable increases while the other decreases whereas a value of 0 indicates that there is no statistical relationship the correlation coefficient also accounts for noise as noisier data will move the coefficient towards 0 correlation coefficients were calculated between deviation logs within each of the six boreholes over the full 12 month period correlations were calculated across each lithologic unit i e vinemount member ancaster member niagara falls member and gasport formation to assess signal stationarity over the annual period the statistical procedure was coded and applied in r r core team 2013 2 3 5 frequency analysis fourier analysis was used to evaluate the spatial distribution i e frequency of thermal deviations along a borehole enabling a comparison of the frequency spectra from different boreholes and between different geologic units over an annual cycle ideally peak frequencies associated with discrete fractures in a dynamic system should exhibit a unique frequency spectrum independent of those associated with thermal noise due to convection cells i e extreme transients or limited thermal contrasts i e sensor resolution the spatial distribution of hydraulically active fractures will depend on the static fracture network fourier transforms corresponding to time lapse temperature deviation logs should exhibit similar diagnostic peaks assuming the active fractures and flow rate remain stationary over time i e the peaks occur at the same frequencies and are not influenced by a dynamic thermal gradient if the position of the hydraulically active fractures change or there is a major alteration in the magnitude of flow within a particular fracture set over time the frequency distribution associated with that borehole should vary therefore assessment of the thermal deviation frequency spectra at a given borehole over time will enable the identification of coherent signal attributes i e peaks in thermal deviation indicative of active fractures or features deviation logs from each sampling event for all six boreholes underwent a fourier transform in r r core team 2013 based on the discrete fourier transform 4 x k n 0 n 1 x n e i 2 œÄ n k n where x k is the discrete fourier transform of the time series x n n is the period of the signal k and n are integers and i 1 for the case of a thermal deviation log x n represents the change in temperature at depth position n a fourier transform was performed on each log in its entirety full borehole and across segments of each borehole aligned with lithologic units the highest frequency represented in a spectrum is determined by the maximum vertical sampling rate 5 f max 1 2 Œ¥ d where fmax represents the nyquest frequency or the highest resolvable frequency in the spectrum and Œ¥d is the spatial sampling interval here each thermal profile was resampled using a uniform sampling rate of 0 01 m therefore the highest frequency sampled is 50 m 1 for comparison amplitudes of the resultant fourier spectra were normalized based on the maximum amplitude within each spectrum 3 results and discussion 3 1 delineating flow in fractured rock regional lithologic contacts were identified in vertical and angled boreholes and included the vinemount ancaster ancaster niagara falls and niagara falls gasport fig 8 si 2 and si 3 both pyrite and calcite deposits which are indicators of groundwater flow were observed throughout each core with pyrite deposits occurring predominantly within the vinemount member 302 312 masl and calcite deposits occurring predominantly within the niagara falls member and gasport formation 281 300 masl all depths herein refer to true vertical depth tvd the niagara falls and gasport also contained vugs of varying sizes 3 60 mm some of which were filled with calcite crystals the vertical extent and relative weathering of these dissolution features are denoted in fig 8 the contact between the vinemount and ancaster members occurred at approximately 303 masl in all six wells while the ancaster niagara falls 296 301 masl and niagara falls gasport 294 298 masl contacts were more variable in elevation refer to si 1 detailed hydraulic head profiles provided estimates of the vertical component of the hydraulic gradient at several increments along the length of the boreholes while discrete interval packer tests and flute liner transmissivity profiles revealed variations in horizontal hydraulic conductivity under forced gradient conditions si 4 lithology and fracture characteristics were assessed using continuous core logs and several geophysical logs with details of fracture distributions and characteristics provided in fig 8 si 2 and si 3 and tabulated in si 5 the transmissivity of the upper 7 m of the vinemount member ranged from 10 7 to 10 6 m2 s and was accompanied by limited head loss along the vertical profile see si 1 a higher degree of fracturing especially along bedding plane factures i e horizontal 10 4 9 8 3 fractures m sub vertical 10 1 2 5 1 fractures m was observed in this section of the vinemount indicating greater hydraulic connectivity the lowermost 2 m of the vinemount and vinemount ancaster member contact fig 8 si 2 and si 3 exhibited relatively high horizontal transmissivity values in each borehole i e 10 5 10 4 m2 s meanwhile the head loss observed across this interval see si 4 indicates the presence of a lower permeability zone or feature impeding vertical groundwater flow although the exact position of this feature is not well resolved in the vertical head profiles the ancaster member 9 14 mbgs and the ancaster niagara falls member contact fig 8 si 2 and si 3 exhibited similarly high horizontal transmissivity values i e 10 5 10 4 m2 s and was accompanied by more fractures i e 4 6 7 5 fractures m and a further reduction in hydraulic head see si 4 these attributes support the dominance of horizontal groundwater flow above and below a low permeable feature or boundary conversely the underlying niagara falls member 14 17 mbgs and the niagara falls gasport contact fig 8 si 2 and si 3 are characterized by much lower fracture frequency i e 0 5 2 6 fractures m and lower horizontal transmissivity i e 10 6 m2 s with the exception of the interval spanning the lithologic contact i e 10 5 10 4 m2 s again this indicates that the niagara falls member possesses a relatively lower vertical component of flow and thus is likely acting as a local hydraulic barrier between more transmissive zones above and below the lowermost gasport formation 17 mbgs is characterized by low fracture frequency i e 10o 0 6 1 9 fractures m 10 0 3 0 9 fractures m with continued head loss packer testing predominantly showed low horizontal transmissivity 10 8 10 7 m2 s with the exception of a few more permeable intervals i e 10 5 10 4 m2 s associated with discrete fracture intervals more transmissive zones were accompanied by dissolution enhanced conduits observed between 27 30 mbgs which also dominated the flute transmissivity profiles e g scv3 and sca3 in fig 8 cumulative fracture plots show variability in fracture distribution with depth across the site fig 8 inflections i e changes in fracture frequency occur within the vinemount and ancaster members while none were observed within the niagara falls member and gasport formation the vinemount member and goat island formation were characterized by the highest fracture frequency vertical boreholes 7 5 fractures m angled boreholes 8 3 factures m and were dominated by horizontal bedding parallel fractures with dips 10 vertical and sub vertical fractures within these formations were less frequent vertical boreholes 2 4 fractures m angled boreholes 4 0 fractures m fracturing within the lowermost gasport formation was much less frequent 1 fracture m and were almost always associated with horizontal bedding planes dipping 10 a detailed summary of the fracture data is provided in si 5 3 2 intra seasonal temperature fluctuations signal stationarity vertical thermal gradients were calculated along 1 m segments of the raw borehole temperature profiles over an annual cycle fig 9 here a positive gradient indicates a warming water column with depth downward warming while a negative gradient indicates a cooling water column with depth downward cooling water column temperatures ranged from 5 c to 25 c within the heterothermic zone over the monitored annual cycle thermal gradients in september and october show a strong downward cooling trend extending 10 12 mbgs although profiles from may and june show similar downward cooling trends the vertical extent of the transients i e sca3 fig 9 are restricted to the upper few meters of the borehole reversals in the thermal gradient were observed through the seasons the transition to frozen conditions was accompanied by a water column freeze up in each of the vertical boreholes while the angled holes remained unfrozen temperature profiles along the angled boreholes during the winter period revealed multiple thermal inflections where gradients oscillated between downward warming and downward cooling over relatively short intervals 1 2 m thermal inflections are denoted by the triangles in fig 9 thermal deviation logs calculated from the temperature profiles fig 9 si 6 si 10 reveal small scale perturbations with depth the majority of these occurred within the uppermost 10 mbgs however smaller scaled deviations were detected up to 14 mbgs during the september to october period 16 mbgs during november and december 20 m from may to june up to a maximum depth of 26 mbgs from january to april the maximum vertical extent of detectable thermal deviations along sca3 are denoted by a horizontal line along each of the deviation logs thermal deviation logs exhibit a systematic seasonal evolution in their signal attributes i e frequency and amplitude for instance logs collected during the warmer summer period were mutually consistent and were characterized by strongly negative thermal gradients with amplitude deviations near surface that progressively weakened with depth the transition to the cooler fall period was accompanied by a reduction in signal amplitudes near surface and more uniform thermal gradients a marked increase in signal amplitudes and overall frequency content i e noise was observed during the frozen winter period cross correlation was used to assess the temporal consistency of thermal deviation logs collected over an annual cycle in each borehole fig 10 positive cross correlations blue were observed amongst datasets collected during consistent seasonal temperatures but did not persist for many consecutive events and varied by lithostratigraphic unit and or depth strong positive cross correlation was observed in each borehole between sep 4 and oct 3 within the uppermost vinemount and ancaster members similar intra seasonal positive correlations were observed during the february to april period in the deeper niagara falls member and gasport formation in the angled boreholes however the winter period was marked by a more variable distribution of weakly positive blue or negative orange correlations within the vinemount and ancaster members these largely warming downward profiles demarcated by numerous inflections in the thermal gradient fig 9 exhibited variable degrees of correlation between adjacent datasets separated by relatively short periods of time i e 1 2 weeks indicating non stationary signal attributes frequency spectra of thermal deviation logs from intra seasonal groups exhibiting a strong positive cross correlation coefficient i e blue regions in fig 10 are characterized by similar peak frequencies and bandwidths for instance strong positive correlations were observed in the vinemount member between sep 4 and oct 3 fig 11 coherent signals were detected below 10 m 1 similar peak frequency characteristics were observed in each borehole with primary peaks and those with the highest amplitude always occurring below 3 m 1 frequency spectra from the vertical boreholes fig 11a were unimodal i e a singular peak exhibiting one major peak with minimal higher frequency content i e less noise the angled boreholes fig 11b also exhibited similar peak frequencies however were accompanied by additional higher order modes above the peak frequency e g multiple high amplitude peaks this consistency in signal stationarity between sampling events indicates that thermal deviations between logs are associated with laterally continuous flow features signal stationarity was also noted during downward warming conditions along the deeper niagara falls member and gasport formation within the angled wells between feb 27 mar 11 and mar 24 fig 12 here the fourier spectra for the gasport formation show three shared peaks below 7 m 1 with no discernible peaks at higher frequencies however a comparison of the peak signal frequencies observed within the shallower vinemount and ancaster members during the same time period show all logs exhibiting multiple mutually inconsistent low frequency peaks 7 m 1 and the presence of multiple high frequency peaks this inconsistency in frequency content suggests that portions of these signals are attributed to measurement noise and implies that while the depth of thermal detection may increase during the downward warming periods winter these periods will also be accompanied by higher amplitude noise within shallower portions of the borehole due to free convection of the stagnant water column 3 3 implications of free convection to thermal deviation logs the temporal characteristics of a borehole thermal profile were strongly dependent on seasonal temperature conditions raw temperature profiles revealed a 20 c temperature swing in the uppermost formation as the borehole water column transitioned from downward cooling in the summer to downward warming in the winter fig 9 si 6 10 the magnitude of vertical temperature gradients along the lined water column during downward warming periods exceeded the threshold required to induce free convection in a water column and was especially strong in the upper 15 m of the borehole e g observed along angled boreholes during winter periods here density driven convection during the cooler winter period induced a thermal disequilibrium between the borehole stagnant water column and adjacent formation water rock mixture within the homothermic zone although thermal deviations were more readily detected in the deeper portion of the boreholes during the winter period signals became less stable and were accompanied by an increase in signal amplitude and frequency content in the upper 10 15 m of the boreholes november april fig 9 than those that were observed during the contrasting warmer periods may october fig 9 elevated thermal deviations near surface are most likely attributed to varyingly scaled convection cells sammel 1968 borner and berthold 2009 that formed as the borehole water column temperatures approached 4 c therefore the shallow responses observed in the frequency spectra represent the cumulative effects of convection cells and water with different temperatures flowing along discrete fractures in the formation inter seasonal datasets can be distinguished in terms of their non stationary signal attributes fig 13 the correlation of thermal deviation logs together with an analysis of peak frequency distribution over time showed that the formation of free convection cells will ultimately limit the utility of a thermal deviation log in the near surface colder winter months were accompanied by an enhancement in the formation of free convection cells although this dampens thermal deviation signals in the heterothermic zone it also induced a thermal disequilibrium within the homothermic zone and thus the detection of thermal deviations associated with active groundwater flow that would otherwise remain undefined in the absence of free convection free convection cells ultimately increased the depth of detectable thermal deviations while obscuring the signals in shallower sections where thermal gradients exceed the critical value e g vertical borehole acr 0 0074 c m angled borehole acr 0 0042 c m the disequilibrium induced by free convection cells deeper in the profile yielded a relatively stationary thermal deviation signal the presence of mutually consistent frequency spectra within the lowermost gasport relative to the overlying ancaster in fig 12 indicates that thermal gradients in deeper sections likely did not exceed the critical gradients instead the induced disequilibrium deeper in the water column was predominantly influenced by the temperature contrast between borehole water column and the formation this response suggests varying hydraulic conditions deeper in the borehole that were undetectable during the warmer summer months this interpretation is consistent with field observations by cermak et al 2008a who noted that temperature time series collected in shallow monitoring wells have a propensity to exhibit intermittent non periodic oscillations that will diminish with increasing depth subsequent numerical simulations by cermak et al 2008b revealed that free convection cells could result in a thermally unstable water column and would be accompanied by complex thermal oscillations confirming that the water column in a borehole can become unstable when the geothermal gradient exceeds the critical value ultimately this instability will result in the formation of cascading convection cells and a predominantly stochastic temperature signal however these effects will diminish with increasing depth as the thermal gradient progressively decreases cermak et al 2008b noted the lack of strong horizontal thermal boundaries between convection cells as a cause for the cells mixing and the resultant non periodic oscillating temperature signature this means that mixing through free convection cells will likely be higher in the more vertically fractured vinemount and ancaster members where thermal disturbances caused by flow are associated with a more transmissive and highly fractured vertical and horizontal formation compared to the more limited horizontal fracturing of the gasport formation the lower frequency of dipping fractures i e 10 observed in the gasport together with the smaller thermal gradients likely reduces the probability that hydraulic activity through these features will result in thermal boundaries across a non horizontal plane within the water column this is evidence that thermal deviation logs of geologic units with predominantly horizontal hydraulic activity during downward warming periods may exhibit more consistent detectable thermal deviations in the presence of free convection cells 3 4 delineation of hydraulically active zones using thermal deviation logs given the relationship between intra seasonal stability and the depth of detection section 3 2 fig 9 multiple thermal deviation logs from different seasons can be used to identify hydraulically active zones along the length of a borehole to illustrate this process thermal deviation logs from sep 4 sep 18 and oct 3 from sca3 were selected to characterize the vinemount and ancaster members while logs from feb 27 mar 11 and mar 31 were used for the niagara falls member and gasport formation refer to figs 8 and 9 the fall thermal deviation logs were chosen for having multiple closely spaced sampling events showing repeatability or reproducibility of measurements which improved our confidence in the interpretation of thermal deviations hydraulically active zones were identified along sca3 based on an integrated interpretation of borehole geologic geophysical and hydrogeologic measurements together with a representative suite of thermal deviation logs fig 14 the upper 7 m of the vinemount member is differentiated into 3 contiguous hydraulically active zones zones a c here thermal measurements reveal a single high amplitude deviation between 3 and 4 mbgs zone a this deviation coincides with a zone of intensive fracturing identified in both the core and acoustic televiewer atv logs from 4 to 5 5 m bgs lower amplitude thermal deviations were detected and are interpreted as multiple active zones that align with atv horizontal fracture picks zones b due to the superposition of thermal deviation signals associated with the large number of fractures within this contiguous interval it is difficult to associate individual thermal deviations with specific fractures however it is reasonable to assume that there are multiple hydraulically active fractures with similar and lower magnitudes of flow and that this activity is contributing to transience in the thermal deviation logs pehme et al 2013 lastly there are two distinct peaks between 5 5 and 6 5 mbgs that correspond with the depths of two broken zones zone c within the lowermost 3 m of the vinemount there is one identifiable peak in the thermal deviation log between 7 5 and 8 5 mbgs there is a wide peak of larger amplitude than those of the zone above it suggesting a more hydraulically active interval zone d given the width of the peak and the number of fractures in the atv and core logs at that depth the hydraulic activity can most likely be attributed to a fracture set along this 1 m interval there are three thermal deviations within the ancaster member zones e g with the first zone e occurring at approximately 10 5 mbgs just below the vinemount ancaster contact this depth range corresponds with a zone of higher transmissivity identified by packer testing and flute profiling the other two deviations located at 12 5 and 13 5 m bgs zones f and g respectively both correspond with individual fractures detected within the atv and core logs and likely represent locations of groundwater flow however their amplitudes are much smaller than those observed higher in the profile the winter thermal deviation logs were used to characterize hydraulic conditions within the deeper niagara falls member and the gasport formation these data show a single yet repeatable deviation located at the ancaster niagara falls contact at approximately 14 mbgs zone h which corresponds to a fracture identified in the atv and core logs however other than that single deviation there is minimal repeatability between logs within the niagara falls member potentially a result of free convection this lack of intra seasonal repeatability means that while there is thermal activity these thermal deviations cannot provide conclusive evidence of hydraulic activity along any particular discrete flow feature within this geologic unit the gasport contains five distinct zones of hydraulic activity zones i m the uppermost section is defined by three contiguous intervals a highly fractured and vuggy zone between 16 and 18 mbgs exhibiting multiple low amplitude thermal deviations indicative of multiple hydraulically active features along its reach that are too closely spaced to be individually identified zone i a less vuggy interval with no fractures from 18 to 19 5 mbgs demarcated by a broader thermal deviation zone j and an interval defined by limited vugginess with a few fractures from 19 5 to 20 5 mbgs defined by multiple moderate amplitude deviations zone k finally two distinct peaks in thermal deviation were observed along fractures at 22 and 22 5 mbgs zones l and m respectively indicating that each is likely hydraulically active although additional information may be gleaned from thermal deviation logs i e lower amplitude events limited coherency or non stationary signals the zones identified in this study would be considered the dominant flow zones within these formations thermal deviations from logs shown to be statistically similar within an intra seasonal period can be used to identify zones of formation hydraulic activity and their characteristics with numerous depth discrete features based on core and geophysical logs however the limited spatial resolution inherent with temperature methods 10 cm and close spacing of fractures resulted in the inability to identify the position of individual discrete features fractures in certain cases in which case only a zone of hydraulic activity could be determined 3 5 bedrock groundwater flow system conceptualization groundwater flow in fractured sedimentary rock can be highly heterogeneous depending on fracture orientation frequency and aperture and how the borehole intersects the fracture network however this paper shows that interpretation of multiple thermal deviation logs collected in shallow environments over a range of seasons with varying hydraulic and thermal conditions can provide valuable insights into the dynamic and transient behaviour of groundwater flow systems e g fig 5 quantitative evaluation of the attributes of a thermal profile of a lined borehole can aid in the conceptualization of the depth distribution of ambient flow paths particularly in shallow environments where groundwater temperatures are more susceptible to atmospheric transients in temperature and enhanced by seasonal recharge and discharge patterns the information gained from any single borehole will be dependent on its positioning and orientation with respect to the local fracture network the fourier spectra for each borehole during stable intra seasonal periods i e summer fall show distinct peak frequencies for each lithostratigraphically defined geologic unit i e no two boreholes displayed the same peak frequency values for a given geologic unit this suggests that the position of a flow zone within a geologic unit can vary significantly between adjacent boreholes spaced 10 s of metres apart the more transient behaviour of thermal deviations within the angled boreholes suggests a stronger vertical component of flow across the system compared to the nearby or adjacent vertical borehole profiles likely due to better connectivity of the borehole with the near vertical fracture features refer to si 5 however a portion of this transience could be associated with more readily forming free convection cells nonetheless the absence of an ice layer within the water columns of the angled boreholes due to their lower critical thermal gradient and intersection with higher numbers of vertical fractures compared to the vertical holes enabled the collection of thermal profiles during periods that would otherwise be missed using a standard vertical borehole of a similar core diameter the deeper information gained from angled holes improved hydrologic interpretation of thermal deviation responses across the study site of course an artificial heat source could be used to raise the temperature of the water column in the sealed borehole creating a temporary thermal disequilibrium between the fluids of the sealed water column and the formation although these active line source methods provide an instantaneous representation of thermal deviations along a borehole longer term spatiotemporal variations in thermal signatures associated with hydrologic processes i e seasonal dynamics are not easily assessed one surprising observation is the seemingly limited correlation between thermal deviation activity or intervals of activity and the positioning of relatively permeable intervals based on high resolution packer testing and flute transmissivity profiling hydraulic tests provide a measure of the physical flow property of the rock i e potential transmissivity based on physical attributes however these properties may not necessary align with ambient or natural gradient hydraulic activity which can occur along a different network or number of fractures due to removal of borehole conduit effects although the apparent disconnect between formation transmissivity and thermal deviation activity at the bulk scale might seem disconcerting other workers have repeatedly shown that high resolution packer testing measurements 1 5 m interval simply cannot resolve active flow features that occur at a centimeter scale e g pehme et al 2013 2015 4 conclusions use of ambient groundwater temperature profiles collected across a network of vertical and angled boreholes sealed with flute liners for characterization of shallow groundwater flow systems in a seasonally dynamic environment was evaluated through an analysis of time lapse thermal deviation logs a combination of time series and frequency spectra analyses was used to evaluate changes in thermal deviation signals over a 12 month period although portions of the thermal deviation logs were variably impacted by the formation of free convection cells within the borehole water column depending on the magnitude of the seasonal thermal gradient periods of intra seasonal thermal stability were observed typically spanning 2 3 sampling events over a 1 2 month period the position of discrete flow features based on the occurrence and attributes of thermal deviations together with lithological geophysical and hydraulic information was determined along the length of each borehole seasonal transience in thermal deviation logs was largely attributed to density driven mixing of the borehole water column which led to short period thermal disequilibrium between the fluids in the water column and the ambient groundwater temperatures although this led to a more complicated hydrologic interpretation of thermal deviations close to surface it enabled detection of flow features within the deeper homothermic zone as a result a combination of thermal deviation logs taken within a two week period following the hottest and coldest weeks of the year were found to be most representative of hydraulic activity along the full length of the borehole a statistical analysis of time lapse thermal deviation logs proved useful for discrimination of fracture and atmospherically induced thermal deviations providing a more diagnostic measure for the analysis of time lapse data and description of the inter and intra seasonal impacts of shallow flow system dynamics on temperature measurements ambient temperature profiles proved effective at identifying ambient groundwater flow locations in fractured sedimentary rock during periods of intra seasonal stability combined with geophysical and core logs thermal deviation logs aided in the identification of pertinent flow features and assessment of relative changes in hydraulic activity including areas of medium to high vugginess without the added contribution of borehole cross connection or introduction of artificially induced thermal gradients i e via active heating methods there was also strong evidence of a significant vertical groundwater flow component within the upper 8 m of the angled boreholes that is consistent with the presence of a dynamic groundwater surface water system adjacent to the borehole network free convection within the lined water column was commonly associated with periods of non stationarity and at times posed limitations on this ambient temperature methodology however the statistical framework employed here helped define the lateral extent of free convection effects and enabled a lithologic classification of thermal transients associated with groundwater flow features when applied across a network of boreholes of varying depths and orientations with respect to the regional fracture network cross correlation and frequency analysis of time lapse thermal profiles proved to be an effective diagnostic tool that increased confidence in the hydrologic interpretation of thermal deviation logs under both periods of stability and transience though the utility of ambient temperature profiling in sealed boreholes is promising several improvements to the methodological and analytical techniques presented herein would improve hydrologic interpretation and ultimately the utility of a temperature log in any hydraulically and thermally dynamic environment identification of high frequency noise arising from free convection within the water column and subsequent removal of this signal based on a comparison with more stationary periods might improve interpretation of gradient driven thermal signals associated with discrete fracture networks this could further increase the utility of ambient temperature profiling methods in lined boreholes using wireline methods temporary depth discrete instruments or fibre optic distributed temperature sensors regardless of the method used to characterize the groundwater flow system a statistical analysis of high resolution time lapse temperature data sets enables detection and quantification of flow system transients deeper in the system and improves detection of free convention along the water column more frequent sampling over the course of a calendar year would also improve the method s ability to differentiate between single isolated events i e major recharge events and seasonal trends within the shallow subsurface such data would aid in the conceptualization of groundwater surface water interactions as they vary throughout the seasons and the assessment of shallow groundwater thermal transients associated with abrupt changes in atmospheric conditions acknowledgements this

6882,despite of diverse progressions in hydrological modeling techniques the necessity of a robust accurate reliable and trusted expert system for real time stream flow prediction still exists the intention of the present study is to establish a new complementary data intelligence di model called wavelet extreme learning machine wa elm for forecasting river flow in a semi arid environment the monthly river flow data for the period 1991 2010 is used to calibrate and validate the applied predictive model developed using antecedent flow data as predictor the prediction efficiency of the

required information for modeling the non stationary and high stochastic river flow pattern overall the study reveals that wa elm can be a reliable methodology for modeling river flow in semi arid environment and for different regimes i e low medium and high flow keywords river flow forecasting pre processing data complementary model extreme learning machine semi arid environment 1 introduction a proper knowledge on possible changes in future river flow is very important for water resources planning and management especially for the assessment of water availability early warning of floods and droughts planning agricultural activities and hydropower generation ashrafi et al 2017 ghorbani et al 2016 however reliable prediction of river flow is extremely challenging due to its complex pattern characterized by dynamic non linear and chaotic disturbances as well as the inherent randomness in behavior ahani et al 2018 yaseen et al 2017 development of hydrological model for effective prediction of river flow in any catchment and hydro climatic environment is a major field of research in hydrology the efficiency of hydrological model depends on the attributes of the modeled catchment river flow in tropical climatic environment for instance are affected by the occasional intermittent and often unpredictable monsoon rainfall which can cause a severe variation in the pattern of river flow and make the rainfall runoff relationship highly non linear on the other hand arid and semi arid environment experience a scarce and erratic rainfall behavior which makes the river flow extremely complex to be predicted using hydrological models hence exploration of more versatile and responsive soft computing techniques for better forecasting of river flow particularly the highly non linear and erratic behavior of river flow in arid environment is vital the river flow models can be classified broadly into two groups the physically based models which are developed on the basis of physical properties of catchment and the conceptual models which are mostly based on data driven techniques the physically based models require numerous details information of the catchment characteristics and several hydrological parameters sharafati and zahabiyoun 2014 the conceptual models on the contrary focuses on the use of historical input data to establish the non linear relationships that exist between the predictor s variables and the simulated values without necessarily having a detail knowledge of the flow kinetics another value of these models is that they need a smaller number of hydrological inputs data intelligence di techniques are often used for the development of conceptual models and therefore they are referred as di models yaseen et al 2016 the di models have been developed and implemented massively in last two decades for river flow forecasting the performance of number of di techniques have been explored for this purpose which include artificial neural network ann genetic programming adaptive neuro fuzzy system support vector machine and others maier et al 2014 nourani et al 2014a raghavendra and deka 2014 yaseen et al 2015 in recent years a new version of ann called extreme learning machine elm has been introduced for the development of univariate river flow data with different time lags are used as predictors and multivariate multiple hydrological variables are used as predictors forecasting models a brief review of the application of elm in river flow modeling is given in table 1 the table clearly shows a substantial progress in river flow forecasting using elm atiquzzaman and kandasamy 2015 li and cheng 2014 lima et al 2017 2016 nourani et al 2017 rezaie balf and kisi 2017 roushangar et al 2017 siqueira et al 2014 taormina et al 2015 yadav et al 2016 yaseen et al 2016b 2016a with other hydrological applications elm model evidenced its capability to simulate the nonlinear pattern alizamir et al 2017 aybar ruiz et al 2016 ebtehaj and bonakdari 2016 sanikhani et al 2018 yaseen et al 2018 a major drawback of elm has been pointed out in previous studies is random initialization of the internal hidden layer weights that essentially influence the performance of elm model incorporation of more reliable features as attributes can be used to overcome the drawback and improve the performance of elm model wavelet decomposition of time series data is an excellent approach for analysis of data in time and frequency domains it provides a suitable temporal pre processing method that can abstract the long and short term variations through the decomposition of time series data into several components in other words wavelet analysis splits the time series data into sequence of linear self governing frequencies of signals and approximation signal details of the wavelet decomposition can be found in mallat 1989 a complementary model is a di model integrated with data pre processing approaches e g wavelet transform the complementary models have been found to have superior ability to simulate complex hydrological processes nourani et al 2014b yaseen et al 2015 the wavelet approach can be used to decompose a non stationary signal into stationary sub signals hence integration of di models with wavelet based data preprocessing can overcome the drawback of random initialization of the internal hidden layer weights of stand alone elm model and enhance the prediction capability in term of the accuracy and reliability the rationale behind this study is based on the fact that river flow data are inherited with significant non stationary features presented in the form of periodic events trends phenomenon or other stochastic features the wavelet approach can be used to abstract the cycle behavior of hydrological information which can be used as inputs in di model for better prediction of river flow the current study is an extension of the methodology proposed by yaseen et al 2016c to forecast river flow using elm model in the present study wavelet decomposition method is hybridized with elm model to initiate a complementary predictive model the performance of wavelet elm wa elm is investigated through the modeling river flow of tigris river at a location in iraq having semi arid climate the article is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology used followed by the description of the case study area section 3 obtained results through application of complementary model in the study area are discussed in section 4 finally the conclusion and remarks are drawn in the last section 2 methodological overview the theoretical overview of the proposed complementary di model wa elm is presented in this section the performance accuracy of the developed model is compared with the results obtained by yaseen et al 2016c using a stand alone elm model 2 1 extreme learning data intelligence the elm developed by huang et al 2004 is a machine learning model structured with single layer feedforward neural network slfn the main merit of this model is that the weight of the input parameters is randomly computed whereas the weights of the output parameters are analytically calculated yadav et al 2017 the slfn function integrates additives and radial basis function rbf hidden nodes as follows 1 f x i 1 l Œ≤ i g a i b i x where f x is the output function of the elm model a i and b i are the hidden nodes learning parameters l is the number of hidden nodes and x is the input variable in eq 1 the Œ≤ i controls the connecting weight between the output node and the i th hidden node the g a i b i x signifies the hidden node output corresponding to input variables the additive hidden node is solved with sigmoid activation function as follow 2 g a i b i x g a i x b i according to eq 2 the weight vector that links the input layer to the i th hidden node defined by a i and b i acts as the bias of the i th node the activation function g computes the value of g a i b i x using rbf 3 g a i b i x g b i x a i where a i and b i represent the center and impact factor respectively for rbf i th node the rbf network formed by a given slfn contains the associated rbf node in its hidden layer the arbitrary distinct samples n are represented as x i y i for the input and output variables eq 1 can be converted to neat formula as follow 4 h Œ≤ t where the hussain matrix h of the slfn s hidden layer output is 5 h g a 1 b 1 x 1 g l a l b l x 1 g a n b n x n g l a l b l x n nxl 6 Œ≤ Œ≤ 1 t Œ≤ l t l xm and t y 1 t y l t nxm as stated by huang et al 2006 the elm model can be trained in the form of slfn with l distinct samples that can result zero learning error in addition the elm can assign random parameters to the hidden nodes even when there is less number of hidden neurons l compared to the number of distinct samples n furthermore it can determine the weights of the output through a pseudo inverse of h thereby giving room to a small margin of error Œµ 0 during the training period the parameters of the hidden nodes usually assigned with random values 2 2 pre processing of time series through wavelet decomposition time series decomposition is one of the solution for highly stochastic data that comprises of redundancy the wavelet transform is the foundation of mathematical expression of time series frequency and signal decomposition to several components nourani et al 2014b the approach is similar to fourier transform however the advantage of wavelet transformation is that it allows the components of a non stationary signal to be analyzed which is not possible using fourier transformation labat 2005 sifuzzaman et al 2009 therefore wavelet decomposition can be used to find the necessary information required for modeling complex time series wei et al 2013 worth to mention that it is suitable for data analysis techniques with a frequency and time domain because it can decode both non periodic and transit signals to extract information sifuzzaman et al 2009 therefore the time series decomposition approaches have received a vast interest and successful implementation over the past decade for engineering applications and hydrology in particular adamowski and chan 2011 nourani et al 2017 √∂zger 2010 partal and ki≈üi 2007 time scale signals pre processing can be defined as f t for the continuous wavelet transform cwt and expressed as follows 6 w f a b œà 1 a f t œà t b a d t note that w f presents the mother wavelet function and the complex conjugate phase is defined as œà the notation t denotes the time variable whereas b is the time shifting parameter the discrete wavelet transforms dwt can be determined by discretizing equation 6 w f a o m 2 1 a f t œà a o m 2 t n b o d t where a o is a fixed dilation step and b o is the translation factor where a and b can be determined as a a 0 m b n a 0 m b 0 in the condition of a 0 greater than one n and m are the integer unites that control the translation process 2 3 model development the wavelet transformation is used to decompose the time series data of river flow into individual components which are then used as input matrix attribute for elm model fig 1 illustrates the structure of the proposed wa elm predictive model where the input independent variables and output dependent variable are clearly indicated the correlated five antecedent month flow data are used to simulate river flow one month ahead see fig 2 the functionality of the targeted one month ahead prediction in accordance to various input combinations starting from one to five months lag times are presented in the following formulas 9 model 1 q t f q t 1 10 model 2 q t f q t 1 q t 2 11 model 3 q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 12 model 4 q

flow from one to five months the performance of all the models eqs 9 13 are tested to select the most suitable set of antecedent river flow values as predictors to forecast the targeted flow q t using the proposed complementary and classical data intelligence models table 2 shows the statistical summary of river flow data used in this study for training and testing of the models eighty percent of river flow data 16 years are used to train the model and the rest four years data are used for testing based on the finding of previous studies used classical elm model yaseen et al 2016c the performance of the models is examined using a number skill assessment metrices such as root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe coefficient nse willmott s index wi legate and

river in the western asia with a length of 1718 km the river is originated in the armenian highlands of eastern turkey and flows through syria and iraq into the persian gulf in iran the tigris river in the map of iraq is shown in fig 3 a the catchment area of tigris river covers an area of approximately 235 000 km2 of which over 85 is located in iraq and hence majority of the water resources of the river is used by iraq the tigris river along with the euphrates river is the major source of fresh water for domestic agriculture and industrial activities of iraq the climate of tigris river basin ranges from semi humid in the north to semi arid in the south where it meets with euphrates river however arid and semi arid climate dominates the most parts of the basin in iraq the average annual precipitation in the basin is approximately 300 mm which is found vary between 150 and 800 mm in extreme wet and dry years respectively the precipitation mostly occurs in winter november april while the rest of the year is mostly dry the daily mean temperature in the basin within iraq goes down below 10 c during winter and exceeds 45 c during summer the semi arid to arid climatic conditions in the lowlands of iraq and syria cause a large loss of water through evapotranspiration in the mesopotamian region the mean flow of tigris river is roughly 235 m3 s 1 the monthly river flow data of tigris river recorded at baghdad station is used in this study to develop the complementary intelligence predictive model baghdad city is located in the middle part of mesopotamian alluvial plain in general the soil at the studied site are driven from the nearby areas of the mesopotamian plain and the desert in the form of residuals sedimentation turki and noori 2013 in addition the soils of the site strata are affected by the changes in river course which converts the soil as coarse silt deposits over time hence the site strata are erratic and non homogenous along which the groundwater table varies with season mohammad salah et al 2012 the seasonal variations in monthly total precipitation and monthly mean of daily temperature at baghdad meteorological station is shown in fig 3b 4 results and discussion in this study the wa elm model is developed to forecast river flow in 1 month ahead prediction of monthly river flow is more useful in water resources management operations such as estimation of water availability for different uses determination of the optimum water allocation for crops operation of dam maintaining minimum river flow for environmental sustainability etc yaseen et al 2016 for instance water permit can be provided based on the availability of water in monthly time scale and the farmer can be advised to decide suitable crops based on the allocated water or the proper decision can be made in industry on the amount of productions relying on the amount of water availability the quality of hydrological data can significantly influence the performance of hydrological model therefore the quality of river flow data is thoroughly assessed before development of model a number of criteria is used in this study for the assessment of the quality of river flow data such as missing data zero or negative data sudden change in flow followed by prolonged increase or decrease gradual increase in flow followed by sudden decrease etc besides time series of monthly river flow data is plotted and compared with monthly rainfall time series to reveal any abnormality in seasonal pattern or large mismatch with seasonal variation of rainfall the river flow data used in this study is found fine in term of all the above quality control criteria the statistical performance metrices of the proposed complementary and classical predictive models are given in table 3 the model performance during testing phase defines the predictive capability of the model and therefore the results obtained during model testing are discussed in following sections the river flow of five antecedent months are found to correlate well with forecasted month however the best performance of the wa elm model is found for up to third input combination eq 11 on the contrary the classical elm is found to perform best using river flow of five antecedent months eq 13 this is due to the fact that machine learning based predictive models behave differently for same set of data solution of complex non linear regression problem inherited with the natural pattern of the phenomena the complementary model was able to abstract maximum information using three antecedent values through the wavelet decomposition process the minimum values of rmse and mae are found 30 13 and 23 42 m3 s 1 for wa elm and 87 90 and 71 54 m3 s 1 for elm the nse wi lmi and cc values for best fit wa elm model are found 0 95 0 99 0 77 and 0 97 0 57 0 99 0 00 and 0 63 respectively it is worth to report how much augmentation in the accuracy is achieved using the proposed complementary model over the classical one the absolute errors rmse and mae are found to reduce remarkably 65 and 67 using the complementary model in general the results show a satisfactory percentage of improvement of model accuracy which can be considered significant for river flow forecasting in addition the attained performance accuracy proves the potential of using wavelet decomposition as input data pre processing approach for di models for river flow forecasting the observed and forecasted river flow obtained using the stand alone elm model with five inputs and wa elm model with three inputs are compared using scatter plots and presented in fig 4 the relationship between the modeled and the observed records are depicted in the form of least squares regression formula y a x b where a is a constant y and b are used to outline the model accuracy the r square value represents the coefficient of determination between the observed and forecasted flow the wa elm model output was found closer to the ideal line 45 compared to stand alone elm model output which indicates its better forecasting ability the highest r2 0 95 was obtained for the wa elm model the scatter plot for validation period shows that the proposed wa elm model can capture all the three categories of river flow namely the low medium and high flows which vary between 331 400 and 936 400 m3 s 1 the relative error re distribution percentages during the testing phase give more robust and reliable measure of the predictability of the forecasting models fig 5 shows the re percentage during the testing period of both the wa elm and elm models the figure shows that the complementary model yields the lower magnitude of error between 10 for more that 90 of the tested data compared to elm model between 20 with some data exceeded the limit the importance of reliable forecasting of river flow with less percentage of error is highly significant for multiple water resources engineering applications this is particularly important for the study area as water of tigris river is the major source of water for domestic consumption and economic activities the model performance using taylor diagram taylor 2001 is presented in fig 6 the main concept this diagram is to present the closest predictive model with the observation in two dimensional scale standard deviation on the polar axis and correlation coefficient on the radial axis taylor diagram shows that output of wa elm model with three antecedent day river flow is much closer to observation compared to elm or wa elm models with other input combinations the result again ascertains the better applicability of the wa elm model compared to classical elm model in forecasting flow in tigris river the distribution of the observed and simulated river flows obtained using both the models are presented using violin plots hintze and nelson 1998 and point density plots figs 7 and 8 the figures show significant differences among the pair of the observed and wa elm elm model forecasts however distribution of wa elm simulated river flow is found much closer to observed distribution river flow forecasting is an essential knowledge for optimal water resources management it is a significant step to comprehend the future events of river flow which is very important for hydropower production irrigation management agricultural engineering and most imperatively for flood forecasting and mitigation di models have been explored to achieve this goal for more than two decades gradual progress has been achieved in development of reliable and robust di models to support decision maker with accurate information the current study is inspired by the finding of the recent review of nourani et al 2014a where the authors remarked that hybridizing di model with decomposing time series data can enhance model accuracy remarkably compared to stand alone di models elm model considered as a very robust modern di model that has been introduced for river flow modeling very recently the review of recent literature revealed that highly optimistic results can be achieved using elm model as clearly indicated in table 1 although the elm has demonstrated an optimistic performance in previous studies it suffers from a limitation due to the randomization of the initial weights of the internal tuning in this study wavelet transform approach is integrated with elm to provide a complementary model called wa elm the developed model is used for forecasting river flow of tigris river at baghdad station located in a semi arid environment obtained results presented above undoubtedly establish the superiority of wa elm model over classical stand alone elm model the prediction accuracy is found to increase by 65 and 67 in term of rmse and mae respectively which indicates that a remarkable improvement can be achieved using complementary model 5 conclusion and remarks the motivation for the current research was to investigate new complementary di model called wa elm through integrating a time series pre processing method known as wavelet transform and a di model namely extreme learning machine for forecasting monthly flow in tigris river at baghdad in iraq which have a predominantly semi arid climate and therefore have a very complex river flow characteristic the architecture of the proposed model is decided based on several antecedent values identified through correlation analysis of the river flow data for different time lags the performance of the wa elm model is validated against the classical elm model developed for the same location by yaseen et al 2016c the performance of the models is evaluated using several numerical and graphical prediction skill indicators in general the results demonstrate enhanced forecasting ability of wa elm in addition the proposed model is found capable in forecasting monthly river flow with significant reliability in a semi arid environment it is found that di model behaves differently in term of optimal input attributes the wa elm showed the best results with consecutive three months antecedent river flow data as predictors whereas the stand alone elm is found to perform best with continuous five months antecedent data as predictors the possibility of further improvement of wa elm model can be explored in future through incorporation of more casual hydrological variables such as rainfall humidity and temperature the current study validated the performance of the proposed model in forecasting monthly river flow in future the performance of the model in prediction of river flow for shorter time scale such as daily or hourly river flow can be explored acknowledgments the authors greatly acknowledge the support by the professional development

nxm as stated by huang et al 2006 the elm model can be trained in the form of slfn with l distinct samples that can result zero learning error in addition the elm can assign random parameters to the hidden nodes even when there is less number of hidden neurons l compared to the number of distinct samples n furthermore it can determine the weights of the output through a pseudo inverse of h thereby giving room to a small margin of error Œµ 0 during the training period the parameters of the hidden nodes usually assigned with random values 2 2 pre processing of time series through wavelet decomposition time series decomposition is one of the solution for highly stochastic data that comprises of redundancy the wavelet transform is the foundation of mathematical expression of time series frequency and signal decomposition to several components nourani et al 2014b the approach is similar to fourier transform however the advantage of wavelet transformation is that it allows the components of a non stationary signal to be analyzed which is not possible using fourier transformation labat 2005 sifuzzaman et al 2009 therefore wavelet decomposition can be used to find the necessary information required for modeling complex time series wei et al 2013 worth to mention that it is suitable for data analysis techniques with a frequency and time domain because it can decode both non periodic and transit signals to extract information sifuzzaman et al 2009 therefore the time series decomposition approaches have received a vast interest and successful implementation over the past decade for engineering applications and hydrology in particular adamowski and chan 2011 nourani et al 2017 √∂zger 2010 partal and ki≈üi 2007 time scale signals pre processing can be defined as f t for the continuous wavelet transform cwt and expressed as follows 6 w f a b œà 1 a f t œà t b a d t note that w f presents the mother wavelet function and the complex conjugate phase is defined as œà the notation t denotes the time variable whereas b is the time shifting parameter the discrete wavelet transforms dwt can be determined by discretizing equation 6 w f a o m 2 1 a f t œà a o m 2 t n b o d t where a o is a fixed dilation step and b o is the translation factor where a and b can be determined as a a 0 m b n a 0 m b 0 in the condition of a 0 greater than one n and m are the integer unites that control the translation process 2 3 model development the wavelet transformation is used to decompose the time series data of river flow into individual components which are then used as input matrix attribute for elm model fig 1 illustrates the structure of the proposed wa elm predictive model where the input independent variables and output dependent variable are clearly indicated the correlated five antecedent month flow data are used to simulate river flow one month ahead see fig 2 the functionality of the targeted one month ahead prediction in accordance to various input combinations starting from one to five months lag times are presented in the following formulas 9 model 1 q t f q t 1 10 model 2 q t f q t 1 q t 2 11 model 3 q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 12 model 4 q

flow from one to five months the performance of all the models eqs 9 13 are tested to select the most suitable set of antecedent river flow values as predictors to forecast the targeted flow q t using the proposed complementary and classical data intelligence models table 2 shows the statistical summary of river flow data used in this study for training and testing of the models eighty percent of river flow data 16 years are used to train the model and the rest four years data are used for testing based on the finding of previous studies used classical elm model yaseen et al 2016c the performance of the models is examined using a number skill assessment metrices such as root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe coefficient nse willmott s index wi legate and

river in the western asia with a length of 1718 km the river is originated in the armenian highlands of eastern turkey and flows through syria and iraq into the persian gulf in iran the tigris river in the map of iraq is shown in fig 3 a the catchment area of tigris river covers an area of approximately 235 000 km2 of which over 85 is located in iraq and hence majority of the water resources of the river is used by iraq the tigris river along with the euphrates river is the major source of fresh water for domestic agriculture and industrial activities of iraq the climate of tigris river basin ranges from semi humid in the north to semi arid in the south where it meets with euphrates river however arid and semi arid climate dominates the most parts of the basin in iraq the average annual precipitation in the basin is approximately 300 mm which is found vary between 150 and 800 mm in extreme wet and dry years respectively the precipitation mostly occurs in winter november april while the rest of the year is mostly dry the daily mean temperature in the basin within iraq goes down below 10 c during winter and exceeds 45 c during summer the semi arid to arid climatic conditions in the lowlands of iraq and syria cause a large loss of water through evapotranspiration in the mesopotamian region the mean flow of tigris river is roughly 235 m3 s 1 the monthly river flow data of tigris river recorded at baghdad station is used in this study to develop the complementary intelligence predictive model baghdad city is located in the middle part of mesopotamian alluvial plain in general the soil at the studied site are driven from the nearby areas of the mesopotamian plain and the desert in the form of residuals sedimentation turki and noori 2013 in addition the soils of the site strata are affected by the changes in river course which converts the soil as coarse silt deposits over time hence the site strata are erratic and non homogenous along which the groundwater table varies with season mohammad salah et al 2012 the seasonal variations in monthly total precipitation and monthly mean of daily temperature at baghdad meteorological station is shown in fig 3b 4 results and discussion in this study the wa elm model is developed to forecast river flow in 1 month ahead prediction of monthly river flow is more useful in water resources management operations such as estimation of water availability for different uses determination of the optimum water allocation for crops operation of dam maintaining minimum river flow for environmental sustainability etc yaseen et al 2016 for instance water permit can be provided based on the availability of water in monthly time scale and the farmer can be advised to decide suitable crops based on the allocated water or the proper decision can be made in industry on the amount of productions relying on the amount of water availability the quality of hydrological data can significantly influence the performance of hydrological model therefore the quality of river flow data is thoroughly assessed before development of model a number of criteria is used in this study for the assessment of the quality of river flow data such as missing data zero or negative data sudden change in flow followed by prolonged increase or decrease gradual increase in flow followed by sudden decrease etc besides time series of monthly river flow data is plotted and compared with monthly rainfall time series to reveal any abnormality in seasonal pattern or large mismatch with seasonal variation of rainfall the river flow data used in this study is found fine in term of all the above quality control criteria the statistical performance metrices of the proposed complementary and classical predictive models are given in table 3 the model performance during testing phase defines the predictive capability of the model and therefore the results obtained during model testing are discussed in following sections the river flow of five antecedent months are found to correlate well with forecasted month however the best performance of the wa elm model is found for up to third input combination eq 11 on the contrary the classical elm is found to perform best using river flow of five antecedent months eq 13 this is due to the fact that machine learning based predictive models behave differently for same set of data solution of complex non linear regression problem inherited with the natural pattern of the phenomena the complementary model was able to abstract maximum information using three antecedent values through the wavelet decomposition process the minimum values of rmse and mae are found 30 13 and 23 42 m3 s 1 for wa elm and 87 90 and 71 54 m3 s 1 for elm the nse wi lmi and cc values for best fit wa elm model are found 0 95 0 99 0 77 and 0 97 0 57 0 99 0 00 and 0 63 respectively it is worth to report how much augmentation in the accuracy is achieved using the proposed complementary model over the classical one the absolute errors rmse and mae are found to reduce remarkably 65 and 67 using the complementary model in general the results show a satisfactory percentage of improvement of model accuracy which can be considered significant for river flow forecasting in addition the attained performance accuracy proves the potential of using wavelet decomposition as input data pre processing approach for di models for river flow forecasting the observed and forecasted river flow obtained using the stand alone elm model with five inputs and wa elm model with three inputs are compared using scatter plots and presented in fig 4 the relationship between the modeled and the observed records are depicted in the form of least squares regression formula y a x b where a is a constant y and b are used to outline the model accuracy the r square value represents the coefficient of determination between the observed and forecasted flow the wa elm model output was found closer to the ideal line 45 compared to stand alone elm model output which indicates its better forecasting ability the highest r2 0 95 was obtained for the wa elm model the scatter plot for validation period shows that the proposed wa elm model can capture all the three categories of river flow namely the low medium and high flows which vary between 331 400 and 936 400 m3 s 1 the relative error re distribution percentages during the testing phase give more robust and reliable measure of the predictability of the forecasting models fig 5 shows the re percentage during the testing period of both the wa elm and elm models the figure shows that the complementary model yields the lower magnitude of error between 10 for more that 90 of the tested data compared to elm model between 20 with some data exceeded the limit the importance of reliable forecasting of river flow with less percentage of error is highly significant for multiple water resources engineering applications this is particularly important for the study area as water of tigris river is the major source of water for domestic consumption and economic activities the model performance using taylor diagram taylor 2001 is presented in fig 6 the main concept this diagram is to present the closest predictive model with the observation in two dimensional scale standard deviation on the polar axis and correlation coefficient on the radial axis taylor diagram shows that output of wa elm model with three antecedent day river flow is much closer to observation compared to elm or wa elm models with other input combinations the result again ascertains the better applicability of the wa elm model compared to classical elm model in forecasting flow in tigris river the distribution of the observed and simulated river flows obtained using both the models are presented using violin plots hintze and nelson 1998 and point density plots figs 7 and 8 the figures show significant differences among the pair of the observed and wa elm elm model forecasts however distribution of wa elm simulated river flow is found much closer to observed distribution river flow forecasting is an essential knowledge for optimal water resources management it is a significant step to comprehend the future events of river flow which is very important for hydropower production irrigation management agricultural engineering and most imperatively for flood forecasting and mitigation di models have been explored to achieve this goal for more than two decades gradual progress has been achieved in development of reliable and robust di models to support decision maker with accurate information the current study is inspired by the finding of the recent review of nourani et al 2014a where the authors remarked that hybridizing di model with decomposing time series data can enhance model accuracy remarkably compared to stand alone di models elm model considered as a very robust modern di model that has been introduced for river flow modeling very recently the review of recent literature revealed that highly optimistic results can be achieved using elm model as clearly indicated in table 1 although the elm has demonstrated an optimistic performance in previous studies it suffers from a limitation due to the randomization of the initial weights of the internal tuning in this study wavelet transform approach is integrated with elm to provide a complementary model called wa elm the developed model is used for forecasting river flow of tigris river at baghdad station located in a semi arid environment obtained results presented above undoubtedly establish the superiority of wa elm model over classical stand alone elm model the prediction accuracy is found to increase by 65 and 67 in term of rmse and mae respectively which indicates that a remarkable improvement can be achieved using complementary model 5 conclusion and remarks the motivation for the current research was to investigate new complementary di model called wa elm through integrating a time series pre processing method known as wavelet transform and a di model namely extreme learning machine for forecasting monthly flow in tigris river at baghdad in iraq which have a predominantly semi arid climate and therefore have a very complex river flow characteristic the architecture of the proposed model is decided based on several antecedent values identified through correlation analysis of the river flow data for different time lags the performance of the wa elm model is validated against the classical elm model developed for the same location by yaseen et al 2016c the performance of the models is evaluated using several numerical and graphical prediction skill indicators in general the results demonstrate enhanced forecasting ability of wa elm in addition the proposed model is found capable in forecasting monthly river flow with significant reliability in a semi arid environment it is found that di model behaves differently in term of optimal input attributes the wa elm showed the best results with consecutive three months antecedent river flow data as predictors whereas the stand alone elm is found to perform best with continuous five months antecedent data as predictors the possibility of further improvement of wa elm model can be explored in future through incorporation of more casual hydrological variables such as rainfall humidity and temperature the current study validated the performance of the proposed model in forecasting monthly river flow in future the performance of the model in prediction of river flow for shorter time scale such as daily or hourly river flow can be explored acknowledgments the authors greatly acknowledge the support by the professional development

6883,in this study we investigate changes in future streamflows in california using bias corrected and routed streamflows derived from global climate model gcm simulations under two representative concentration pathways rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on the mean streamflow annual maxima or seasonality we focus on projected changes across the distribution of streamflow and the underlying causes we report opposing trends in the two tails of the future streamflow simulations lower low flows and higher high flows with no change in the overall mean of future flows relative to the historical baseline statistically significant at 0 05 level furthermore results show that streamflow is projected to increase during most of the rainy season december to march while it is expected to decrease in the rest of the year i e wetter rainy seasons and drier dry seasons we argue that the projected changes to streamflow in california are driven by the expected changes to snow patterns and precipitation extremes in a warming climate changes to future low flows and extreme high flows can have significant implications for water resource planning drought

study aims to answer a simple but important question how will streamflow distribution change for northern california under a warming climate the insights gained by improving our understanding of the

a more comprehensive view of possible changes in streamflow distribution over northern california by analyzing the possible changes in different streamflow quantiles unlike previous studies and instead of gridded runoff simulations we employed a unique data set generated for the 4th california climate assessment group which includes climate model simulations bias corrected and routed for 59 sites across northern california for the period of 1950 2099 moreover in order to investigate the direction of change in river discharge in addition to investigating the mean flows we examine changes over different parts of the discharge regime from low to high flows 2 data and method daily streamflow m3 s data for 59 locations across northern california were developed at the scripps institution of oceanography university of california san diego and acquired from the 4th california climate assessment group pierce et al 2014 2015 fig s1 the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface model lohmann et al 1996 1998 a macro scale hydrological model framework that simulates surface and subsurface processes was forced with downscaled global climate model gcm simulations to route streamflow at a daily temporal scale by using the saint venant equations the use of downscaling techniques to convert the coarse spatial resolution in the gcms to high resolution hydrological variables is an inevitable step for the climate change impacts assessment studies mehrotra and sharma 2015 climate model simulations are submit to biases and uncertainties e g liu et al 2014 and bias correction methods are often used to improve the forcings pierce et al 2014 2015 here the vic model is driven by the high resolution localized constructed analogs loca downscaled and bias corrected minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation loca method has shown a superior performance to its predecessors including multivariate adapted constructed analogs moca for california and the 4th california climate assessment workforce is adopting it for policy making and climate adaptation purposes pierce et al 2014 the loca method calculates the simulated hydrological variable by using a multiscale spatial matching framework in order to select suitable analog days from historical observations for each downscaled point this is in oppose to using an average of several days to reproduce the downscaled products the loca method calculates the simulated hydrological variable by using a multiscale spatial matching framework in order to pick suitable analog days from historical observations pierce et al 2014 mentioned that the motivation behind developing the loca method was to have a framework that can better preserve regional patterns in temperature and precipitation and also better represent the maximum temperature and precipitation for california there are a number of limitations associated with the use of any downscaling technique including simplification of the physical processes that may result in systematic errors that can be distributed between temperature and precipitation mehrotra and sharma 2012 2016 more detailed description of the downscaling and bias correction methods to develop the streamflow dataset we used here together with limitations and advantages can be found in pierce et al 2014 2015 the vic model utilized the high resolution loca temperature and precipitation with a grid resolution of 0 0625 to obtain different hydroclimate variables such as daily streamflow the vic model parameters were obtained from the university of colorado hydrologically based dataset for entire california livneh et al 2013 maurer et al 2002 the vic physical based hydrological model solves the full water and energy balances equation and can represent the hydrological responses of the system to climatic changes including the soil moisture responses to the rainfall event maurer et al 2018 this widely used hydrological model has shown a great success in simulating several large scale continental rivers e g nijssen et al 1997 as well as regional smaller scale rivers e g lohmann et al 1998 the details on the vic model together with strengths weakness and parameterization of it can be found in the pierce et al 2016 as pierce et al 2016 indicated while the vic hydrological modeling framework is widely used in the hydrological community the use of any hydrological model will result in some degree of uncertainty to projected climate variables and future studies are encouraged to perform similar analysis using additional land surface models furthermore it is noteworthy that the antecedent moisture conditions in a drying climate were merely accounted for by the energy balance scheme of the vic model and further uncertainty analysis is required to scrutinize such impacts on the trends of streamflow this will be the subject of a future study in this study the bias corrected inputs to the vic model are based on ten gcms from the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 table s1 and two representative concentration pathways rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 we use these ten models selected from 32 different gcms by the climate action team research working group of the 4th california s climate change assessment as they cover a wide range of possible conditions that california may confront in the future cdwr 2015 furthermore the future climate related policies and actions in california would be based on the outputs of these climate models that is provided by the 4th california s climate change assessments www climateassessment ca gov for each site and scenario we calculated the ensemble median of daily streamflow based on all the ten climate models from 1950 to 2099 using 1950 to 2005 as the historical baseline period and 2020 to 2099 as the projection period to investigate changes in the magnitude and direction of discharge we computed annual time series for different discharge quantiles from low to high flows of the daily streamflow for each of the 59 locations lins and slack 1999 villarini and strong 2014 we then use the nonparametric mann kendall test kendall and gibbons 1990 mann 1945 to detect monotonic trends in different parts of the streamflow distribution an extensive discussion on the mann kendall test can be found in helsel and hirsch 1992 the test evaluates the null hypothesis h0 of no statistically significant change against the alternative hypothesis ha of a statistically significant trend in the time series at 0 05 significance 95 confidence level we also examined the projected change in the magnitude and direction of river discharge based on two hydrological indices namely 7 day peak flow and 7 day low flow see supplementary material section s1 monk et al 2007 olden and poff 2003 richter et al 1996 1998 finally we used the projected change in the mean monthly flows to compare the streamflows over the wet seasons versus the warm seasons to get insight about the possible seasonal changes in streamflow we compared the mean of the hydrological indices in the projection period relative to the baseline period under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 by computing normalized percent change future h i s t o r i c a l historical 100 3 results fig 1 shows presence absence of statistically significant trends at 5 level in the annual mean panel a c annual minima panel d f and annual maxima panel g i of ensemble median of daily streamflow data overall out of the 59 locations none exhibits statistically significant changes in the annual mean of daily streamflow for both the historical forcing fig 1a and the rcp 4 5 scenario fig 1b similar behavior is observed for the rcp8 5 scenario with only 2 locations showing statistically significant changes in the annual mean of streamflow fig 1c lack of pronounced signal of change in the annual mean discharge is also observed when we explore trends in the annual volume of ensemble daily streamflow data fig s2 these results are consistent with previous studies revealing that future annual mean flow and annual volume of water are not projected to change significantly relative to the baseline e g regonda et al 2005 stewart et al 2005 thorne et al 2015 however trends and patterns fundamentally change when investigating the upper and lower tails of the streamflow distribution fig 1d e show the changes in the magnitude of annual minima although the signal of change is relatively weak for the historical period fig 1e only 8 out of 59 sites show statistically significant change it becomes much stronger when we explore changes in the projection period as shown 19 and 54 sites out of 59 exhibit statistically significant decreasing trends in the discharge annual minima under the rcp 4 5 fig 1e and 8 5 fig 1f scenarios respectively investigating annual maxima reveals opposing trends 27 sites show statistically significant increasing trends in the baseline period whereas 29 and 55 sites exhibit statistically significant increasing trends under the rcp 4 5 fig 1h and rcp 8 5 fig 1i scenarios respectively therefore climate models point to a widespread decreasing increasing trends in the annual minima maxima over northern california under the rcp 8 5 scenario changes in the annual minimum and maximum discharge are larger and widespread over the entire northern california to get a more detailed picture on how the tails of discharge distribution are changing we investigate percent changes in the projected mean of 7 day low flows fig 2 a and c and 7 day high flows fig 2b and d relative to the historical period fig 2 depicts that the magnitudes of 7 day low flows are projected to slightly decrease for both concentration paths relative to the baseline and changes are marginally higher under the rcp 8 5 fig 2c considering the magnetite of 7 day high flows fig 2b and d most locations exhibit pronounced increasing patterns it is worth mentioning that the magnitude of change is higher under rcp 8 5 relative to rcp 4 5 most of the stations that show slightly decreasing trends in the magnitude of 7 day high flows are located in the southern part of the study region to this end our analysis points to a decreasing trend in the magnitude of low flows and increasing trend in the magnitude of high flows to further explore this issue we investigate how the distribution of river discharge is expected to change under global warming we extend our analysis to examine the presence of monotonic trends over different discharge quantiles i e q0 05 q0 25 q0 5 q0 75 q0 95 using the mann kendall test here we only show the results for rcp 8 5 for brevity and similar results for rcp 4 5 can be found in fig s3 fig 3 shows that the future projections point to statistically significant decreasing trends in the streamflow relative to the baseline period for the 5th 25th 50th and 75th percentiles while in the baseline period we do not observe a statistically significant change for the 95th percentiles of discharge a significant increasing trend for the 95th percentile of projections is observed consistent with the previous figures these trends are most prevalent over the northern part of the study area fig 3 confirms that current climate model simulations indicate an asymmetrical change in the tails of the streamflow distribution i e low flows decrease and high flows increase the change in the distribution of streamflow is more evident by looking at fig 4 which presents the empirical cumulative distribution functions ecdfs of the ensemble median of daily streamflow in the baseline and projection periods for two locations oroville lake fig 4a and shasta lake fig 4b the projected streamflow ecdfs confirm the results from fig 3 and show the potential changes in different parts of the discharge distribution the discharge below the 80th percentiles exhibits a lower low flow while it indicates higher high flows above the 80th percentiles to understand the seasonal changes we have also investigated percent changes in the projected mean of streamflows relative to the baseline period at the monthly scale figs 5 and s4 during the winter months december january and february and march when most of the annual precipitation is delivered majority of the sites depict an increase in the monthly mean of projected streamflow this increasing pattern is more prevalent for the sites that are located in the north part of the study region over the sacramento river basin in the rest of the year april to november the results point to a marked decrease in the mean of streamflow relative to the baseline period with deviation from the mean being more pronounced in april to july overall these results show that mean monthly streamflows over the rainy season are projected to increase by the end of the century under rcp 8 5 similar results for rcp 4 5 shown in fig s4 while for the rest of the year a decreasing trend is expected this indicates california can possibly face wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons by the end of this century this finding is in line with pierce et al 2013 that projected an increase in winter average precipitation in california note that these changes in the mean monthly streamflows are more noticeable for the higher emissions scenario rcp 8 5 fig s5 4 discussion and conclusion in this study we explore potential changes in future river flows in california using bias corrected and routed simulated streamflows from multi model climate simulations our results indicate that the annual mean of daily streamflow is not expected to change significantly by the end of this century however we observe opposing trends and sign of change when examining changes in the upper and lower tails of streamflow distribution results point to a widespread statistically significant increase in the magnitude of the annual streamflow maxima and a prevalent decreasing trend in the annual streamflow minima under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios investigating 7 day low and high flows and different quantiles of streamflow distribution also confirm this finding indicating that extreme high and low flows are expected to intensify while the mean flows are not expected to change significantly overall the decreasing increasing trends in the magnitude of 7 day high flows are vivid in the southern northern part of the study domain our results are in agreement with yoon et al 2015 who postulated future changes in large scale circulation patterns might intensify future floods and droughts our findings are also consistent with li et al 2017 who pointed to declines in low to moderated discharge in the future however in contrast to li et al 2017 our analysis does not identify a statistically significant change in the annual mean streamflow instead we only find an increasing pattern in the magnitude of high flows we also examine projected changes in the mean of monthly streamflow relative to the baseline period model simulations show that while annual mean of daily streamflow is not projected to significantly change mean of monthly streamflow is projected to increase during most of the rainy season december to march and to decrease in the dry season this increasing signal is more pronounced for the sites that are located in the sacramento river basin in other words not only the distribution of streamflow but also the seasonality of river discharge is projected to change by the end of this century note that as wasko and sharma 2017 indicated the response of streamflow to an extreme precipitation event depends on the catchment size and extreme precipitation events at a higher temperature level may not necessarily result in higher streamflow our results here indicate that in the future california can face wetter rainy seasons and drier dry seasons as indicated moreover das et al 2011b have shown the important role of warm season warming versus cool season warming on the streamflow level in the western united states they projected a higher reduction in streamflow under warmer warm season and an increase in the streamflow under warmer cool season therefore projected changes in the mean of monthly streamflow will be of key importance for improving our strategies to manage water resources in california while attribution of the projected changes in discharge is not the main focus of this study a possible explanation for the observed changes in river discharge is that low to moderate flow in rivers is sustained primarily by snow with snowpack decreasing in the western united states and snowmelt happening earlier in spring huning and margulis 2017 maurer et al 2007 mote et al 2005 stewart et al 2005 stewart et al 2005 examined the seasonality of streamflow in snowmelt dominated regions of western north america from 1948 to 2002 where they pointed to a reduction of spring and summer streamflow due to earlier snowmelt for the northern part of california pierce et al 2013 projected an increase in daily precipitation intensity in the winter season while spring precipitation is projected to decrease that can worsen the impact of earlier snowpack melting on the water resources a smaller contribution of snowmelt to streamflow and also reduction in the ratio of snow over rain can lead to lower low to moderate discharge during seasons with lower precipitation li et al 2017 mote et al 2005 moreover diffenbaugh et al 2015 indicated that snowpack in the montane regions of california has an important role in sustaining river discharge during the dry season however the projected increase in temperatures and consequently earlier snowmelt can result in elongated dry and low flow periods ashfaq et al 2013 diffenbaugh et al 2015 li et al 2017 stewart et al 2005 li et al 2017 showed that historically one third of precipitation over the entire western united states falls as snow which accounts for more than half of the total annual streamflow they projected that smaller fraction 40 to 30 of snowmelt will contribute to annual discharge in the future furthermore they argued that runoff will be more rainfall driven in the future over california on the other hand high flow events might be mainly controlled by moist and warm extreme ar events dettinger 2011 jeon et al 2015 an extensive discussion on the impacts of warming climate on ars can be found in espinoza et al 2018 where they indicated that all the studies conducted over western united states point to an increase in the frequency of ar events in a changing climate moreover in a recent study ragno et al 2018 showed that future extreme precipitation events are expected to intensify in california despite relatively unchanged precipitation mean their findings are consistent with our results on future changes to the high flows projected changes in california s streamflows can have profound implications for water resource management and infrastructure design and risk assessment this issue becomes even more important considering the already aging infrastructures e g dams levees and bridges designed based on historical extremes and the assumption of stationarity any shift in high flows in the

6883,in this study we investigate changes in future streamflows in california using bias corrected and routed streamflows derived from global climate model gcm simulations under two representative concentration pathways rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on the mean streamflow annual maxima or seasonality we focus on projected changes across the distribution of streamflow and the underlying causes we report opposing trends in the two tails of the future streamflow simulations lower low flows and higher high flows with no change in the overall mean of future flows relative to the historical baseline statistically significant at 0 05 level furthermore results show that streamflow is projected to increase during most of the rainy season december to march while it is expected to decrease in the rest of the year i e wetter rainy seasons and drier dry seasons we argue that the projected changes to streamflow in california are driven by the expected

study aims to answer a simple but important question how will streamflow distribution change for northern california under a warming climate the insights gained by improving our understanding of the

a more comprehensive view of possible changes in streamflow distribution over northern california by analyzing the possible changes in different streamflow quantiles unlike previous studies and instead of gridded runoff simulations we employed a unique data set generated for the 4th california climate assessment group which includes climate model simulations bias corrected and routed for 59 sites across northern california for the period of 1950 2099 moreover in order to investigate the direction of change in river discharge in addition to investigating the mean flows we examine changes over different parts of the discharge regime from low to high flows 2 data and method daily streamflow m3 s data for 59 locations across northern california were developed at the scripps institution of oceanography university of california san diego and acquired from the 4th california climate assessment group pierce et al 2014 2015 fig s1 the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface model lohmann et al 1996 1998 a macro scale hydrological model framework that simulates surface and subsurface processes was forced with downscaled global climate model gcm simulations to route streamflow at a daily temporal scale by using the saint venant equations the use of downscaling techniques to convert the coarse spatial resolution in the gcms to high resolution hydrological variables is an inevitable step for the climate change impacts assessment studies mehrotra and sharma 2015 climate model simulations are submit to biases and uncertainties e g liu et al 2014 and bias correction methods are often used to improve the forcings pierce et al 2014 2015 here the vic model is driven by the high resolution localized constructed analogs loca downscaled and bias corrected minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation loca method has shown a superior performance to its predecessors including multivariate adapted constructed analogs moca for california and the 4th california climate assessment workforce is adopting it for policy making and climate adaptation purposes pierce et al 2014 the loca method calculates the simulated hydrological variable by using a multiscale spatial matching framework in order to select suitable analog days from historical observations for each downscaled point this is in oppose to using an average of several days to reproduce the downscaled products the loca method calculates the simulated hydrological variable by using a multiscale spatial matching framework in order to pick suitable analog days from historical observations pierce et al 2014 mentioned that the motivation behind developing the loca method was to have a framework that can better preserve regional patterns in temperature and precipitation and also better represent the maximum temperature and precipitation for california there are a number of limitations associated with the use of any downscaling technique including simplification of the physical processes that may result in systematic errors that can be distributed between temperature and precipitation mehrotra and sharma 2012 2016 more detailed description of the downscaling and bias correction methods to develop the streamflow dataset we used here together with limitations and advantages can be found in pierce et al 2014 2015 the vic model utilized the high resolution loca temperature and precipitation with a grid resolution of 0 0625 to obtain different hydroclimate variables such as daily streamflow the vic model parameters were obtained from the university of colorado hydrologically based dataset for entire california livneh et al 2013 maurer et al 2002 the vic physical based hydrological model solves the full water and energy balances equation and can represent the hydrological responses of the system to climatic changes including the soil moisture responses to the rainfall event maurer et al 2018 this widely used hydrological model has shown a great success in simulating several large scale continental rivers e g nijssen et al 1997 as well as regional smaller scale rivers e g lohmann et al 1998 the details on the vic model together with strengths weakness and parameterization of it can be found in the pierce et al 2016 as pierce et al 2016 indicated while the vic hydrological modeling framework is widely used in the hydrological community the use of any hydrological model will result in some degree of uncertainty to projected climate variables and future studies are encouraged to perform similar analysis using additional land surface models furthermore it is noteworthy that the antecedent moisture conditions in a drying climate were merely accounted for by the energy balance scheme of the vic model and further uncertainty analysis is required to scrutinize such impacts on the trends of streamflow this will be the subject of a future study in this study the bias corrected inputs to the vic model are based on ten gcms from the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 table s1 and two representative concentration pathways rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 we use these ten models selected from 32 different gcms by the climate action team research working group of the 4th california s climate change assessment as they cover a wide range of possible conditions that california may confront in the future cdwr 2015 furthermore the future climate related policies and actions in california would be based on the outputs of these climate models that is provided by the 4th california s climate change assessments www climateassessment ca gov for each site and scenario we calculated the ensemble median of daily streamflow based on all the ten climate models from 1950 to 2099 using 1950 to 2005 as the historical baseline period and 2020 to 2099 as the projection period to investigate changes in the magnitude and direction of discharge we computed annual time series for different discharge quantiles from low to high flows of the daily streamflow for each of the 59 locations lins and slack 1999 villarini and strong 2014 we then use the nonparametric mann kendall test kendall and gibbons 1990 mann 1945 to detect monotonic trends in different parts of the streamflow distribution an extensive discussion on the mann kendall test can be found in helsel and hirsch 1992 the test evaluates the null hypothesis h0 of no statistically significant change against the alternative hypothesis ha of a statistically significant trend in the time series at 0 05 significance 95 confidence level we also examined the projected change in the magnitude and direction of river discharge based on two hydrological indices namely 7 day peak flow and 7 day low flow see supplementary material section s1 monk et al 2007 olden and poff 2003 richter et al 1996 1998 finally we used the projected change in the mean monthly flows to compare the streamflows over the wet seasons versus the warm seasons to get insight about the possible seasonal changes in streamflow we compared the mean of the hydrological indices in the projection period relative to the baseline period under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 by computing normalized percent change future h i s t o r i c a l historical 100 3 results fig 1 shows presence absence of statistically significant trends at 5 level in the annual mean panel a c annual minima panel d f and annual maxima panel g i of ensemble median of daily streamflow data overall out of the 59 locations none exhibits statistically significant changes in the annual mean of daily streamflow for both the historical forcing fig 1a and the rcp 4 5 scenario fig 1b similar behavior is observed for the rcp8 5 scenario with only 2 locations showing statistically significant changes in the annual mean of streamflow fig 1c lack of pronounced signal of change in the annual mean discharge is also observed when we explore trends in the annual volume of ensemble daily streamflow data fig s2 these results are consistent with previous studies revealing that future annual mean flow and annual volume of water are not projected to change significantly relative to the baseline e g regonda et al 2005 stewart et al 2005 thorne et al 2015 however trends and patterns fundamentally change when investigating the upper and lower tails of the streamflow distribution fig 1d e show the changes in the magnitude of annual minima although the signal of change is relatively weak for the historical period fig 1e only 8 out of 59 sites show statistically significant change it becomes much stronger when we explore changes in the projection period as shown 19 and 54 sites out of 59 exhibit statistically significant decreasing trends in the discharge annual minima under the rcp 4 5 fig 1e and 8 5 fig 1f scenarios respectively investigating annual maxima reveals opposing trends 27 sites show statistically significant increasing trends in the baseline period whereas 29 and 55 sites exhibit statistically significant increasing trends under the rcp 4 5 fig 1h and rcp 8 5 fig 1i scenarios respectively therefore climate models point to a widespread decreasing increasing trends in the annual minima maxima over northern california under the rcp 8 5 scenario changes in the annual minimum and maximum discharge are larger and widespread over the entire northern california to get a more detailed picture on how the tails of discharge distribution are changing we investigate percent changes in the projected mean of 7 day low flows fig 2 a and c and 7 day high flows fig 2b and d relative to the historical period fig 2 depicts that the magnitudes of 7 day low flows are projected to slightly decrease for both concentration paths relative to the baseline and changes are marginally higher under the rcp 8 5 fig 2c considering the magnetite of 7 day high flows fig 2b and d most locations exhibit pronounced increasing patterns it is worth mentioning that the magnitude of change is higher under rcp 8 5 relative to rcp 4 5 most of the stations that show slightly decreasing trends in the magnitude of 7 day high flows are located in the southern part of the study region to this end our analysis points to a decreasing trend in the magnitude of low flows and increasing trend in the magnitude of high flows to further explore this issue we investigate how the distribution of river discharge is expected to change under global warming we extend our analysis to examine the presence of monotonic trends over different discharge quantiles i e q0 05 q0 25 q0 5 q0 75 q0 95 using the mann kendall test here we only show the results for rcp 8 5 for brevity and similar results for rcp 4 5 can be found in fig s3 fig 3 shows that the future projections point to statistically significant decreasing trends in the streamflow relative to the baseline period for the 5th 25th 50th and 75th percentiles while in the baseline period we do not observe a statistically significant change for the 95th percentiles of discharge a significant increasing trend for the 95th percentile of projections is observed consistent with the previous figures these trends are most prevalent over the northern part of the study area fig 3 confirms that current climate model simulations indicate an asymmetrical change in the tails of the streamflow distribution i e low flows decrease and high flows increase the change in the distribution of streamflow is more evident by looking at fig 4 which presents the empirical cumulative distribution functions ecdfs of the ensemble median of daily streamflow in the baseline and projection periods for two locations oroville lake fig 4a and shasta lake fig 4b the projected streamflow ecdfs confirm the results from fig 3 and show the potential changes in different parts of the discharge distribution the discharge below the 80th percentiles exhibits a lower low flow while it indicates higher high flows above the 80th percentiles to understand the seasonal changes we have also investigated percent changes in the projected mean of streamflows relative to the baseline period at the monthly scale figs 5 and s4 during the winter months december january and february and march when most of the annual precipitation is delivered majority of the sites depict an increase in the monthly mean of projected streamflow this increasing pattern is more prevalent for the sites that are located in the north part of the study region over the sacramento river basin in the rest of the year april to november the results point to a marked decrease in the mean of streamflow relative to the baseline period with deviation from the mean being more pronounced in april to july overall these results show that mean monthly streamflows over the rainy season are projected to increase by the end of the century under rcp 8 5 similar results for rcp 4 5 shown in fig s4 while for the rest of the year a decreasing trend is expected this indicates california can possibly face wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons by the end of this century this finding is in line with pierce et al 2013 that projected an increase in winter average precipitation in california note that these changes in the mean monthly streamflows are more noticeable for the higher emissions scenario rcp 8 5 fig s5 4 discussion and conclusion in this study we explore potential changes in future river flows in california using bias corrected and routed simulated streamflows from multi model climate simulations our results indicate that the annual mean of daily streamflow is not expected to change significantly by the end of this century however we observe opposing trends and sign of change when examining changes in the upper and lower tails of streamflow distribution results point to a

6884,budyko type models in hydrology are simple but efficient descriptions of the vegetation mediated hydrologic cycle in catchments based on hypothesized similarities between vegetation and human water consumption interactions in terms of water demand constraints and system functioning as well as catchment processes and outcomes a corresponding budyko type framework is proposed here for human water consumption at the catchment scale to validate this framework socioeconomic data human water consumption and economic and agricultural structure data as well as hydrometeorological data for 51 human impacted catchments located in 10 major river basins in china were assembled the results demonstrate 1 similar observed patterns to the traditional budyko curves with two limits and a monotonous increase shape 2 the same functional form and mathematical features of the derived budyko type equation parameters of the new budyko type model for human consumption are estimated and analyzed based on the concept of water productivity this study suggests that the functioning of both social and hydrologic subsystems within catchment systems can be explored within a common conceptual framework thus providing a unified socio hydrologic basis for the study of human water systems keywords socio hydrology budyko equation human water consumption optimality water management 1 introduction freshwater scarcity is a major cause behind a number of global societal challenges such as poverty as well as risk to human health and sustainable development rijsberman 2006 the rapidly growing human population and climate change contribute to increased agricultural industrial and domestic water demands exacerbating tensions among multiple water users including ecosystems v√∂r√∂smarty et al 2000 ipcc 2013 in some developed basins human activities are even becoming the dominant factors as they alter water nutrient and energy cycles and landscape evolution vitousek et al 1997 v√∂r√∂smarty et al 2010 the pursuit of a deeper understanding of the interactions between human and water systems prompted the birth of socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2012 sivapalan and bl√∂schl 2015 which is expected to reveal knowledge that is more generalized regarding human intervention in the past and present in order to be more fully prepared for future water demand van emmerik et al 2014 constrained by the limits of the natural environment water management practices usually reflect local cultural values historical context and political realities padowski et al 2015 therefore the challenges posed by increasing demands for water for multiple human as well as environmental needs are addressed differently in different places governed by the factors mentioned above because of these various exhibited characteristics socio hydrologic studies of human water consumption and competition with environmental water use have tended to focus on individual case studies in different parts of the world e g van emmerik et al 2014 srinivasan 2015 however the ultimate goal should go beyond mimicking observations and further develop a generalized understanding of socio hydrologic system dynamics by finding common ground for particular types of problems sivapalan 2015 comparative studies involving extensive data analyses in multiple places would be a useful approach to generate patterns of coupled system behavior wherein the methods are usually associated with iterative processes of building a hypothesis identifying evidence from data and updating the hypothesis troy et al 2015 pande and sivapalan 2016 a common conceptual framework that helps to synthesize the outcomes of place based studies is needed to bring the fragmented results of quantitative data analyses together and to foster an accumulation of knowledge and understanding such a theoretical framework should encapsulate the physical and social controls affecting human water consumption a commonly adopted theoretical framework in catchment hydrology is the budyko model of long term water balance milly and shmakin 2002 xu et al 2013 budyko 1974 fitted an empirical equation to characterize long term water balance based on data from a large number of catchments located in a range of climatic regions because of its simplicity and ability to represent empirical data in diverse regions and contexts the budyko curve has been widely used to represent long term coupled water and energy cycles including the feedbacks between climate water soil and vegetation milly 1994 yang et al 2007 tang and wang 2017 budyko curves exhibit very particular behavior under low aridity and high aridity conditions represented by the energy and water constraints respectively of the functional relationship despite the empirical origins of the budyko curve theories based on optimality either maximization or minimization of suitably defined ecosystem functions have been proposed to explain the observed phenomena eagleson 1978 porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2013 recent research has expressed in terms of the optimality principle of entropy production wang et al 2015 the supportive evidence behind such a physical basis is that vegetation organizes itself into coherent spatial patterns and temporal dynamics as an optimal response to changing climatic and landscape conditions caylor et al 2004 fern√°ndez illescas and rodriguez iturbe 2004 wu and archer 2005 with a resultant imprint on the hydrologic responses as well berghuijs et al 2014 in the long term an equilibrium state of vegetation patterns and catchment water balance is reached eagleson 1978 donohue et al 2007 in human societies likewise the resulting feedbacks between human management activities and the natural hydrologic cycle can give rise to emergent dynamics in time and patterns in space low et al 1999 kinzig 2001 zehe and sivapalan 2009 consequently analysis of observed patterns of water consumption in space time should themselves be viewed as emergent patterns dynamics anderies et al 2002 walker and meyers 2004 controlled by physical factors e g climate vegetation soil and topography and by social factors e g technology level of socio economic development lifestyles and societal norms and values ceola et al 2016 one can imagine that climate and socioeconomic conditions govern the long term equilibrium of human water consumption and environmental water use and possibly human settlement patterns as a result constraints on human water consumption should also exist as the quantity and quality of water resources and socioeconomic levels limit water utilization to a certain extent sun et al 2015 such constraints should be presented when describing water consumption behavior in a mathematical framework the recognition of similarities between human water consumption and vegetation water consumption interactions therefore raises the prospect of developing a budyko type model for human water consumption as well as a direct analogy to the traditional budyko type model for understanding the long term water balance in catchment hydrology the use of such analogies is a method widely adopted in many other interdisciplinary fields e g levins and culver 1971 brander and taylor 1998 gao et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 this is the motivation behind the work presented in this paper the aim of this study was to address human water resources management at the catchment scale using two different but complementary approaches 1 a data based empirical analysis of human water consumption along the lines of budyko s classical work and 2 an optimality based theoretical derivation of a budyko type equation these two approaches were then reconciled to discuss the natural and societal controls on human water consumption the data for the empirical analysis came from several river basins in china the theoretical derivation involved application of an optimality theory widely used in analyses of contemporary water resources systems the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and the data assembled for the study section 3 compares the similarity between the budyko type frameworks for natural and social water balances and defines the variables associated with human consumption it presents empirical data on human consumption from study catchments in the form of budyko type curves section 4 presents the analytical derivation of the budyko type relationship for human consumption by invoking the optimality principle and the estimation of the model parameters finally section 5 presents a discussion of the results and a summary of the main conclusions 2 study areas and data sources in this study the 10 major river basins of china and the 51 large subbasins within those basins were selected for analysis the locations of which are shown in fig 1 these basins experience diverse climatic and economic conditions as well as differing extents of human interference long term 1980 2000 meteorological data from 824 national weather stations located within these basins were collected from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn including precipitation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature daily average temperature wind speed relative humidity sunshine duration and the altitudes and latitudes of the weather stations additionally data on crop structures within the basins were collected from local statistical yearbooks to represent the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of crops to quantify the agricultural water demand the second national water resources integrated plan of china nwripc ii carried out from 2002 to 2009 provides a comprehensive socioeconomic dataset for this study including available water resources and water consumption of agricultural industrial domestic and other sectors for every five years from 1980 to 2000 1980 1985 1990 1995 and 2000 led by the national development and reform commission and the ministry of water resources several ministries formed the national water resources comprehensive planning group including the ministry of agriculture the ministry of construction the ministry of land and resources the forestry bureau the environmental protection administration and the china meteorological administration over 300 related technical departments river basin authorities and provincial governments with approximately 15 000 people directly participated and cooperated in the whole process the survey contained two phases 1 establishing and analyzing the basic information of water resources conditions and utilization and 2 determining the national and regional water resources allocation for sustainable development in this work the water consumption survey consisted of water balance experiments in more than 800 irrigation areas typical water consumption censuses in approximately 10 000 industrial and service enterprises and urban water consumption information from over 600 counties with unified evaluation standards and technical requirements to evaluate the water resources at both administrative and basin scales the nation was cataloged into 1062 units the basic data were collected and summarized gradually from basic units to the major basins provinces with water balance correction at each level back and forth the balance considered relationships between 1 the surface water and groundwater 2 restoration and consumption 3 water supply water withdrawal water consumption and water drainage and 4 the calculation units administrative and basin scale to strengthen rationality and minimize uncertainty the data also coordinated with the existing data including previous water resources censuses bulletins and comprehensive and special planning reports as quality control approaches to ensure the reliability of the estimation results the major results of nwripc ii including the data used in this paper were published by the general institute of water resources planning and design 2014 3 methodology 3 1 introduction of the budyko framework to serve as a guide for the data analysis and the later theoretical derivation of the budyko equation we first present a conceptual framework based on a proposed analogy of water consumption by humans to vegetation water consumption in the water cycle the traditional budyko equation is formulated in terms of two nondimensional variables the evapotranspiration ratio e p and the aridity index e p p resulting in a relationship of the form e p f e p p where e is actual evapotranspiration p is rainfall and e p is potential evapotranspiration several mathematical forms have been proposed for the function f some empirical zhang et al 2001 2004 potter et al 2005 reflecting local climate and catchment characteristics and others conceptual or physically based yang et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 in this paper for consistency with later derivations we highlight the analytical formulation derived by wang and tang 2014 through the application of the optimality principle of entropy production wang et al 2015 which is expressed as follows 1 e p 1 e p p 1 e p p 2 4 Œ¥ 2 Œ¥ e p p 2 Œ¥ 2 Œ¥ wang and tang 2014 and wang et al 2015 discussed the definition and meaning of the parameter Œ¥ and interpreted it as e 0 e with a range between 0 and 1 the variable e 0 is initial evaporation defined as the portion of wetting available only for direct evaporation such as that which occurs because of vegetation interception and water storage in top soils the remaining part of the evaporation is defined as continuing evaporation e c e e 0 which competes with runoff during rainfall partitioning wang and tang 2014 vegetation change plays a critical role in regulating the catchment hydrological partitioning through altering the external environment water and energy balance and adjusting the internal characteristic e g rooting depth and leaf area donohue et al 2007 guswa 2008 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 as the main source of e 0 interception is highly related to canopy structure e g canopy cover leaf surface etc which adapts dynamically to the environmental conditions muzylo et al 2009 based on eq 1 the long term water balance can be expected to follow a family of curves depending on the magnitude of the parameter Œ¥ yang et al 2009 wang and tang 2014 as shown schematically in fig 2 a 3 2 analogy between human water consumption and evapotranspiration human water management in a social context is analogous to the natural water balance of catchments managed by vegetation one can recognize a remarkable similarity between the two kinds of water management by comparing human water consumption with vegetation water consumption i e evapotranspiration in terms of water demand humans need water for productive use such as agriculture for food production note humans also need water for direct consumption such as domestic usage but the amounts are much smaller whereas vegetation consumes water as a part of photosynthesis for biomass production in terms of constraints human water consumption is constrained by water availability water infrastructure and water demand under the given socioeconomic conditions in a similar way vegetation water consumption is constrained by water availability i e precipitation the ability of plants to access water e g root systems and evaporative demand i e solar radiation and wind in terms of system functioning the goal of the human subsystem is to utilize water for human demands and improve social welfare sivapalan 2015 the objective of the natural subsystem likewise can be interpreted as ecological or vegetation optimality eagleson et al 2002 schymanski et al 2007 or optimality of entropy production zhao et al 2016 in terms of catchment processes and outcomes water management by humans involves a judicious partitioning of the available water resources into that for human water consumption and the water left behind in the environment e g environmental flow in the case of natural catchments one can also think of water being managed analogously by natural vegetation through partitioning of the incoming precipitation into vegetation water consumption i e evapotranspiration and streamflow for aquatic ecosystems over a long period the essential equilibrium of both self organization systems vegetation and human is dynamic instead of varying around a stable point to achieve the optimum under a changing environment although the change rates of the two systems may be very different vegetation has coevolved with its environment by adjusting ecosystem structure function and floristics optimally givnish 1988 when natural or human induced disturbances occur vegetation structure and functioning adapts to them dynamically by changing structural attributes and distribution arora and boer 2009 thonicke et al 2010 similarly humans adapt to the environment by changing water use structure and water allocation furthermore humans can also improve water supply by building infrastructure e g inter basin water transfer projects and desalination plants which will shift the equilibrium to a new state due to the change of available water term in view of these similarities one is tempted to look for similarity between the conceptual frameworks applicable for socio hydrology and ecohydrology 3 3 budyko framework for human water consumption based on similarities based on the above arguments the nature of the partitioning of water through vegetation water and human water interactions and feedbacks is hypothesized in the form of common budyko type relationships as presented in fig 2 a and b postulating that under different local conditions the water partitioning could manifest in a family of budyko type curves as seen before in the traditional budyko type models the evaporation ratio e p is primarily governed by the aridity index e p p the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation in arid regions with e p p 1 actual evaporation is limited by water availability i e precipitation p whereas in humid regions with e p p 1 actual evaporation is constrained by energy availability i e potential evaporation e p a secondary consideration in this water partitioning is other climatic e g seasonality and landscape factors often reflected in the nature and dynamics of vegetation that has adapted to the environment in fig 2 a this control is expressed through the parameter Œ¥ of eq 1 analogously in the human subsystem actual human water consumption which refers to the net consumption in the processes of human water use measured by water withdrawal minus return flow is affected by water availability a on the one hand and by consumptive water demand u p on the other these being respectively the supply and demand for human water consumption water availability a is defined as the mean annual depth of water resources available to and accessible by humans through hydraulic infrastructure in the foreseeable future this is normally the sum of the net recharge of groundwater interbasin water transfers and surface runoff and excludes flood water 2 a w s w g w t w f where w s is the total surface water resources i e mean annual runoff restored from observed runoff and water withdrawal data w g is the net recharge of groundwater subtracting the phreatic evaporation lateral outflow and river and lake discharge from the total recharge w t is the water transferred from other catchments and w f is the depth of flood water that is not available for human water consumption because of flood control operation taking into account of the total reservoir storage capacity in each basin in the foreseeable future for this study the long term average result of a was adopted obtained directly from the official survey data from nwripc ii the role of a is analogous to that of precipitation p in catchment hydrology as it is the source for human water consumption it should be noted that in some basins such as the hai river basin groundwater depletion has occurred since the 1980s as over pumped groundwater has played an important role in water supply leading to bias in water availability a as well as in human water consumption modeling however this imbalance is not sustainable in the long term because the marginal costs including economic and environmental costs of groundwater over pumping increase with the amount of over pumping as a result the south to north water diversion project was planned and built from the 1990s to substitute groundwater supply and restore groundwater storage in the hai river basin thus the change in groundwater storage can be viewed as a source of bias in the short term in this work water demand u p is the sum of all water demands of human society that is agricultural domestic industrial and other urban water needs actual human water consumption u is defined as the actual consumptive water use of all sectors of human society and u a is then the water consumption ratio corresponding to e p in catchment hydrology actual human water consumption u can be decomposed into two parts the first one is the water consumption in industrial domestic and other sectors in urban areas denoted by u 0 which is usually guaranteed because its supply reliability is over 95 ministry of housing and urban rural development of china 1998 corresponding to the initial evaporation e 0 in catchment hydrology wang and tang 2014 in the long term e 0 varies when the canopy structure of the vegetation system changes to adapt to the environment likewise humans in urban areas can reduce their consumptive use to resist water stress for instance the severe drought in california since 2011 has led to restricted urban water consumption either mandatorily or voluntarily nagourney 2015 mann and gleick 2015 therefore this variable is not always constant in a changing environment the second part is water consumption in the agricultural sector denoted by u a which is usually not guaranteed because its supply reliability is only about 50 75 ministry of housing and urban rural development of china 2009 corresponding to continuing evaporation e c in catchment hydrology wang and tang 2014 we then have 3 u u 0 u a additionally runoff in catchment hydrology is the surplus of precipitation over evaporation and the corresponding term in the human subsystem is the water left over after human consumption which is equivalent to in stream environmental flows tennant 1976 poff and matthews 2013 and or groundwater recharge hu et al 2008 this is called environmental water use in this study and is denoted as l balancing human water consumption and environmental water use is one of the main objectives of sustainable river basin management loucks and beek 2005 heinz et al 2007 hu et al 2008 zhao et al 2009 thus the overall water balance in the social subsystem can be written as 4 a u l the differences and similarities between the variables associated with human water consumption and vegetation water consumption as in classical budyko type models are listed in table 1 3 4 estimation of consumptive water demand the variables defined in table 1 for the social subsystem can be collected directly or can be estimated as per their definitions from other data u and a are directly collected from the nwripc ii whereas u p is not available and needs to be estimated using relevant data the consumptive water demand estimation is described below in china agricultural water consumption comprises more than 70 of total water consumption yamada et al 2012 du et al 2015 and is usually not fully satisfied because of its low supply priority lack of irrigation infrastructure or both simultaneously in contrast water consumption in the industrial domestic and other urban sectors can be fully satisfied most of the time because these uses are much lower in terms of amounts but higher in terms of supply priority agricultural water supply is constrained by a range of factors in addition to water availability such as the capacity of channels roads over once productive farmland and heavy losses due to canal seepage brown and halweil 1998 large demand low supply priority and lack of proper engineering infrastructure make it difficult to fully satisfy agricultural water demand which can be verified by comparing actual irrigation water consumption with the irrigation demand estimated later thus u p can be decomposed into two parts 5 u p u pa u p 0 here u pa stands for the consumptive demand of irrigation i e the potential value of u a and u p 0 represents the consumptive water demand in the industrial domestic and other sectors in urban areas i e the potential value of u 0 a simplifying assumption is made to estimate the potential water consumption in urban areas u p 0 that is that u p 0 is approximately equal to the actual water consumption in these sectors such that 6 u 0 u p 0 this assumption is reasonable because u p 0 is fully supplied in most cases this equation may slightly underestimate u p 0 as well as the overall potential water consumption u p but this underestimation is deemed small enough to be negligible for two reasons 1 the required reliability of water supply systems in urban areas is over 95 and 2 the total amount of u 0 is less than 30 of the actual water consumption in china to estimate u pa a widely used method developed by the united nations food and agricultural organization fao is employed allen et al 1998 the potential irrigation water consumption u pa is estimated as the net irrigation requirement i r net multiplied by the fraction of agricultural area s 7 u pa i 1 n ir n e t 1 i s 1 i i r n e t 2 i s 2 i Œ∑ s 1 i s 2 i where u pa is the potential irrigation water demand per year mm year without water deficit i is the crop type n is the total number of crop types in the study area ir n e t 1 i and ir n e t 2 i are a crop s irrigation requirements in terms of irrigated and rain fed areas per month mm month respectively s 1 i and s 2 i are the irrigated and rain fed areas of a certain crop m2 respectively and Œ∑ is the water delivery coefficient of channels the value for each major river basin was obtained from the nwripc ii and is shown in table 3 the net irrigation requirement for the year ir net is defined as the sum of the difference between the monthly crop specific evapotranspiration e t cj and the monthly effective rainfall p effj ir net j 1 m e t cj p effj w h e n et cj p effj 8 ir net 0 w h e n et cj p effj where m is the total monthly growth of any given crop and j refers to the month for rain fed croplands when rainfall cannot fully meet the needs of the crops there is still a potential water demand to be met theoretically this demand can be met through irrigation if infrastructure is available thus it is included in the estimation of u pa effective precipitation p effj is the rainfall that infiltrates into the soil and can be utilized by the crops for growth in month j rosegrant et al 2008 the scs method developed by the united states department of agriculture soil conservation service usda 1970 is applied to calculate p effj 9 p effj max 0 f 1 253 p j 0 824 2 935 10 0 001 et cj w h e n p j 12 5 m m p effj p j w h e n p j 12 5 m m where p j is the precipitation in month j mm month and f is a correction factor which equals 1 012 for irrigated areas and 1 074 for rain fed lands the method and parameters are from international model for policy analysis of agricultural commodities and trade impact rosegrant et al 2008 for world wide food demand estimation to calculate crop specific evapotranspiration et cj the reference crop evapotranspiration et r and crop coefficient k c are needed the variable et r refers to the evapotranspiration for a reference surface completely covered with well grown uniform height grass under full irrigation allen et al 1998 the value of et r is estimated using the penman monteith pm equation as well as net radiation air temperature and humidity and wind speed data 10 et r 0 408 d r n g g 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a d g 1 0 34 u 2 where d is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 r n is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 g is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 t is mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 e s is saturation vapor pressure kpa and e a is actual vapor pressure kpa the crop coefficient k c is determined based on crop species local climate and growth stage allen et al 1998 the growth period can be divided into four stages initial development mid season and late season the value of k c remains constant as k cini and k cmid at the initial and mid season stages respectively k c increases linearly during the development stage of the crop from k cini to k cmid and then decreases linearly during the late season from k cmid to k clate the durations and k c values during these different stages can be found in the study by allen et al 1998 either assigned initial and mid season stages or interpolated development and late season stages with a daily time step then the crop evapotranspiration e of month j can be obtained as follows 11 et cj k c et r daily meteorological data were applied to calculate daily irrigation requirements the sum of all growing seasons values was regarded as the yearly demand which is a common method recommended by the fao allen et al 1998 the final outcomes of both survey data and estimation data would be unified in the annual mean value 4 results of data analysis and modeling the actual water consumption data were obtained directly from the nwripc ii where the survey data was corrected with water balance validation from various levels and aspects and coordinated with existing published data to minimize the uncertainty the estimation of consumptive demand of agriculture derived from pm model by the fao was compared with previous studies adopting various methods to validate the accuracy shown in table 2 in general the pm method adopted here demonstrated relatively good agreement between the predicted and observed et c and ir net but there were still some unavoidable biases related to the adjusted crop coefficients under various climate and soil conditions flumignan et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 even with its limitations the pm model has received common acceptance and is an international standard for calculating et c and modifying models wang et al 2017 yin et al 2008 based on the data and method after comparison and validation with previous studies the outcomes were analyzed in the proposed budyko model for human water consumption 4 1 budyko type model of human water consumption all the collected and estimated data on water consumption are listed in table 3 note that long term average values for water consumption were used here similar to the budyko type models in catchment hydrology according to the determination of a i e available water resources and infrastructure the study basins were classified into two types 1 those that lack adequate water resources and 2 those that lack adequate water supply infrastructure in some basins water supply depends not only on local precipitation but also on interbasin transfers for instance both the hai and northwest river basins receive interbasin transfers to support their economic development as available natural water resources cannot meet societal needs the south to north water diversion project was built to resolve the water shortage dilemma in the hai river basin in this case a is greater than the local natural water resources in contrast in some basins lack of infrastructure is the constraint on water supply such as in the southwest river basin this river basin is located in a humid region with abundant water resources where mean annual runoff is 693 mm however the economy and infrastructure in this river basin are under developed leading to a lower level of water consumption annual in stream flow in this basin is nearly 687 mm indicating that most of the water is left in the river instead of consumed by humans in this case a is less than the local natural water resources to verify the similarities between natural and social water cycles scatter plots of human water consumption and vegetation water consumption i e natural water balance in the form of the budyko model were compared and provide the foundation for the theoretical analogy fig 3 a and b provides a full picture of both social and natural water balances respectively for the selected catchments in china inspired by the classical budyko curve in the social case the results for human water consumption shown in fig 3 a are taken from the data presented in table 3 in the natural case the results presented in fig 3 b for comparison are 166 catchments reported by yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 and chen et al 2016 these catchments cover the 10 major river basins of mainland china with areas ranging from 372 to 121 330 km2 the values of p and e p for each catchment were calculated from the china meteorological administration whereas annual discharge data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china the record length was greater than 40 years fig 3 a describes the human water consumption patterns whereas fig 3 b portrays the watersheds in the same major river basins from the perspective of the vegetation mediated hydrologic cycle fig 3 a and b together provide two aspects for evaluating the catchments that is social and hydrological in fig 3 a inspired by the traditional budyko relationship a budyko relationship for human water consumption was plotted the positions of the data in both budyko type relationships i e u a vs u p a and e p vs e p p in fig 3 a the social case showed promise yet considerable scatter exists the scatter in the natural budyko curve as seen in fig 3 b has been explained in terms of landscape factors including land cover changes yang et al 2009 similarly the scatter in the social budyko curve can be induced by the uncertainties of the data and changes in related factors which serves as the motivation for theoretical derivation and interpretation fig 3 a also demonstrates two limits to human water consumption 1 water availability a which constrains water consumption in water limited catchments i e those with u p a 1 and 2 potential water consumption u p which constrains human water consumption in water abundant catchments i e those with u p a 1 these two limits on u a can be expressed as follows 12 u a 1 f o r u p a 1 u a u p a f o r u p a 1 combining the aridity index e p p and the demand index u p a the study catchments can be classified into four types 1 e p p 1 a n d u p a 1 such as the southeast and pearl river basins a majority of the yangtze river basins and some subbasins of the southwest and huai river basin where water is relatively abundant for meeting the demands of vegetation and humans respectively implying that the consumptive water demand of humans is less than water availability 2 e p p 1 a n d u p a 1 such as some subbasins of the huai and pearl river basins where water is abundant for meeting vegetation demand but is insufficient for meeting human demand which implies that the consumptive water demand of humans is larger than the water availability because of highly developed agriculture 3 e p p 1 a n d u p a 1 such as the songhua river basin a majority of the liao and southwest river basins and some subbasins of the yangtze and the northwest river basins where water is limited for meeting the demand of vegetation but is abundant for meeting human demand which indicates that the consumptive water demand of humans is smaller than the water availability because of a reliance on rain fed agriculture and undeveloped irrigation infrastructure 4 e p p 1 a n d u p a 1 such as the yellow river basin and a majority of the hai liao northwest and huai river basins where water is limited for meeting the demands of both vegetation and human which indicates that the consumptive water demand of humans is larger than the water availability because of developed irrigation and yet scarce water resources it should be noted that all ten major basins are relatively large and consist of subbasins with various climatic topographic vegetation and socioeconomic conditions thus the subbasins in a major basin may have different classifications from the perspective of human water consumption the water limited catchments belonging to catchment types 2 and 4 appear in the top right area of fig 3 a with the high water consumption ratio u a limited by water availability for catchment types 1 and 3 the actual water consumption u is limited by the potential water consumption u p and these catchment types appear in the lower left part of fig 3 a according to the analogy between the natural budyko curve and the social budyko curve similarities between water cycles in nature and in human society can be explored fortunately such similarities do exist based on the data analysis presented above supporting the assumption from a phenomenological perspective which is also the premise adopted here for discussing the theoretical foundation behind it two levels of comparison phenomenon and theory together can enhance the reliability and deepen the understanding of the social budyko model thus a theoretical analysis of the social budyko curve is presented invoking optimality theory used in water resources management which is also helpful for understanding social budyko curves and providing interpretations of the possible causes of the scatter 4 2 derivation of the budyko type model for human water consumption many previous studies have derived a range of models for long term catchment water balance based on the budyko hypothesis followed by theoretical or physical arguments e g zhang et al 2001 2004 potter et al 2005 yang et al 2007 2008 recently wang and tang 2014 derived a form of the budyko equation by building on the proportionality hypothesis and wang et al 2015 subsequently proposed a thermodynamic explanation for the hypothesis and thus for the budyko curve later work by zhao et al 2016 extended the application of optimality principles to catchment water balances at shorter time scales as well analogously we now derive a budyko type model of human water consumption based on the economic principle of maximum water benefit mwb which is a general water allocation rule for human society adopted in studies of contemporary water resources systems the detailed derivation is demonstrated in appendix a the final functional form is shown below 13 u a œï œï Œµ u p a u p a Œµ u p a œï œï Œµ u p a u p a Œµ u p a 2 4 œï Œµ 1 œï Œµ u p a 2 Œµ 1 œï Œµ where œï k a k l is a human environment benefit ratio k a is a parameter related to average economic losses due to water shortage in the agricultural sector k l is a parameter related to the average economic losses due to inadequate environmental flows or groundwater recharge and Œµ u 0 u is a guaranteed human water consumption ratio it was found that not all combinations of the two parameters œï and Œµ satisfied the upper limit which indicates that œï and Œµ are interdependent in particular when œï 1 that is when the average economic losses caused by water shortage in agricultural and environmental flows are equal eq 13 becomes 14 u a 1 u p a 1 u p a 2 4 Œµ 2 Œµ u p a 2 Œµ 2 Œµ eq 14 is identical to eq 1 above developed by wang and tang 2014 for catchment hydrology and also satisfies the boundary conditions of the budyko curve that is 15 u a 0 w h e n u p a 0 u a 1 w h e n u p a the reason behind the identical equations is the similarities of structures and optimality between the two subsystems as they are both constrained by demand and supply limits to achieve the dynamic optimality under given conditions the analogous nature gives rise to identical external patterns when œï 1 a more complex relationship between the value of human water consumption and the value of environmental water use is obtained still the resulting functional form is very similar to the model developed by wang et al 2015 and is only slightly different from many formulations already used in the literature for vegetation impact on long term water balance e g fu 1981 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2008 parameter œï represents the ratio of unit economic loss in society to that in the environment caused by water shortage and Œµ represents the effect of the demand structure of human water consumption the relative effects of these two parameters are shown in fig 4 by setting Œµ 0 35 in fig 4 a and œï 1 in fig 4 b in fig 4 a it is shown that a larger œï results in a higher u a that is when the unit economic loss caused by social water shortage increases humans would like to consume more water for societal needs and thus water left in the environment takes up a smaller fraction of the total available water moreover with increasing u p a differences between u a for different œï values become larger this implies that the larger the demand index u p a the bigger the impact of œï becomes however the effect of Œµ reveals a slightly different pattern as demonstrated in fig 4 b a larger Œµ leaves less water for the environment which implies that catchments with larger non agricultural demand tend to have more water allocated for human use because such non agricultural demand has a high supply priority when the demand index u p a is extremely low or high the effect of Œµ on u a is small implying that water consumption in catchments with very high or very low non agricultural demands is relatively independent of Œµ when the demand index u p a lies in the range of 1 to 2 that is with medium demand pressure Œµ strongly influences the shape of the curves with the insights gained from the theoretical analysis and in particular about the role and meaning of the two parameters œï and Œµ we now compare the water consumption behavior predicted by eq 14 with the observed data from the 10 river basins and 51 catchments in china the results for selected parameter combinations are shown in fig 5 this includes the best fit curve which is the gray solid curve with œï 1 00 and Œµ 0 48 a root mean square error rmse of 0 13 and a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 79 the dash dot curve on the top represents a case with non agricultural human water demand dominated structure with œï 1 00 and Œµ 0 85 the dashed curve at the bottom represents a case with more emphasis on the environment as characterized by œï 0 40 and Œµ 0 10 the catchments along this line indicate high values of environmental losses in developed regions or lack of infrastructure in undeveloped regions which leaves a large fraction of water to the environment the lines give a general description of the human water consumption patterns under certain conditions when socioeconomic or climatic changes occur the parameters of the lines can be adjusted to describe the new patterns adapting to the late environment the lines are derived from the dominant influencing factors whereas the dots are the individual manifestations because the structures of the lines have not taken all the related factors into consideration biases and differences between the lines and dots exist nevertheless the lines still provide a possible perspective to explain human water consumption behavior thorough analysis of these factors should be carried out based on more data from a larger range of the world this kind of analysis is left for further research 4 3 estimation of model parameters to make the theoretically derived equations more widely applicable parameters a maximum benefit without water shortage see more details in appendix a and k a are estimated from data based on the concept of water productivity wp wp kg m3 yr is the ratio of crop yield to the amount of water consumption reflecting the average benefit per unit water of the whole growing phase huang and li 2010 assessed the basin scale wp of irrigated grain crops e g wheat rice maize and soybeans in the major breadbasket basins of china meanwhile the convex quadratic water productive function is widely applied in the relationship between obtained yield and the total amount of evapotranspiration geerts and raes 2009 xiao et al 2008 summarized the parameters in the function and the maximum yield for different crops in various parts of china applying the parameters mentioned before we obtain 16 a i y mi ai i p i where a i is the maximum benefit of crop i without water deficit rmb year y mi is the maximum yield per unit area of crop i kg m2 year ai i is the irrigated area of crop i m2 and p i is the selling price of crop i rmb kg which was obtained from the china yearbook of agricultural price survey national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2004 combining the concept of wp and the parameters in the water production function the parameter k ai is 17 k ai wp i ai i p i 1000 where k ai is the average economic loss caused by yield reduction due to water deficit of crop i rmb yr mm and wp i is water productivity of crop i for irrigated land kg m3 yr then for a certain catchment k a and a are the sum of each crop s k ai and a i respectively weighted by area 18 k a i 1 n ai i ai k ai 19 a i 1 n ai i ai a i where ai is the total irrigated area m2 of the catchment the parameter Œµ u 0 u was calculated from the available water consumption data for each basin thus according to the results of u p a and u a in table 3 the value of œï was estimated from eq 13 the parameter k l was calculated by k l k a œï table 4 presents the results for the ten basins using the equations above and the parameters taken from huang and li 2010 cao et al 2014 and xiao et al 2008 the parameter Œµ of the ten basins fluctuated around 0 2 which represented the statement that the agricultural consumption takes up more than 70 of the total water consumption yamada et al 2012 du et al 2015 the parameter œï however demonstrated distinct differences among the basins as it can reflect the relative importance of economic benefit from irrigation in comparison with the environmental benefit the result was classified into four cases 1 when œï 1 k a is higher than k l indicating that the unit agricultural loss is larger than the unit environmental loss among the ten basins shown in table 4 the liao hai yellow and northwest river basins belong to this case where people value water for human consumption more than water for environmental flow strong evidence for this case is the construction of the south to north water diversion project which aims to transfer water to the hai and yellow river basins 2 in contrast in the songhua huai and southwest river basins where water resources are quite abundant œï 0 6 for the songhua river basin which is one of the main breadbaskets of china agriculture is the backbone of the region s economy however according to the government report of comprehensive planning of songhua river basin wang et al 2013 the distribution of water resources is uncoordinated with the productivity demand because of the lack of irrigation infrastructure the annual water shortage for irrigation can be as high as 5 billion m3 in this basin the small value of œï is not due to a higher emphasis on the environment but simply the lack of water supply infrastructure which is also the case for the southwest river basin ye and wu 2011 wang et al 2008 3 with œï 0 6 the pearl river basin is a different case this river basin has a highly developed economy especially in the pearl river delta but environmental problems such as saltwater intrusion in the delta area are quite severe and have caused frequent local drinking water crises almost every year since the late 20th century to solve this problem reservoirs have been operated to release environmental flow to control saltwater intrusion supported by a developed economy as well as abundant water resources this strategy has thus far worked successfully local water resources can almost fully satisfy human demand as well as maintain the environmental water demand leading to a small value of œï 4 the yangtze and southeast river basins have similar values of œï 0 6 œï 1 which indicates that the agricultural and environmental sectors are similar in importance in the minds of the local people 5 discussion and conclusions this paper highlights the similarities between human and vegetation water consumption behaviors the similarities can be explained in terms of certain organizing principles water balance partitioning into evaporation and runoff in a natural catchment has previously been shown to follow the optimality principle of entropy production wang et al 2015 whereas water partitioning between human water consumption and environmental water use in social subsystems has been shown in the current study to follow the principle of maximum water benefit here a budyko type model of human water consumption was presented based on the data of 10 major river basins and 51 of the basins tributary catchments in china showing that water balance in the social subsystem exhibits a similar pattern to that of the budyko curve in catchment hydrology when plotting the water consumption ratio u a versus the demand index u p a a budyko type relationship appears with both supply and demand constraints and monotonous increase to quantify this relationship further a new budyko type model was derived for social water balance based on the principle of water benefit maximization the mathematical features of the derived model were consistent with the corresponding equations for catchment water balance the parameters of the derived equations have physical and economic meanings and can be estimated for each basin it is noted that œï and Œµ have interdependent but varying effects on the shape of the budyko curve the Œµ values of the ten major river basins fluctuate around 0 2 with respect to the parameter œï the 10 major river basins can be classified into four types 1 extreme water shortage with emphasis on human demand œï 1 2 medium water shortage with competitive balance of human and environmental demands 0 6 œï 1 3 abundant water with insufficient infrastructure œï 0 6 and 4 abundant water with emphasis on environmental demand œï 0 6 sun et al 2017 revealed that in china agricultural is the largest contributor for provincial water footprint inequality whereas the effects of natural water availability and domestic and industrial water use are insignificant those outcomes also agree with this study that considerable amounts of water have not been exploited in water abundant basins whereas developed but water scarce basins suffer from water stress the cause can be partly attributed to irrational irrigation patterns and deficient water infrastructure leading to inefficient utilization of water guo and shen 2016 crop structure adjustment and water saving policies and technologies can play an important role in improving agricultural water efficiency to strengthen the sustainability of development and resistance to extreme events lu et al 2017 as an emerging interdisciplinary subject socio hydrology studies have included some quantitative analysis based on conceptual mathematical models in particular case studies e g zlinszky and timar 2013 viglione et al 2014 di baldassarre et al 2013 elshafei et al 2014 2015 but there is still a lack of generic and mechanic understanding feedback between human and water systems wada et al 2017 sanderson et al 2017 lu et al 2018 propose a typical bottom up upward socio hydrological water balance framework consisting of ecological social and hydrological subsystems to simulate the feedback and coevolution in human water systems the upward approach simulates and predicts overall catchment response based on process knowledge kleme≈° 1983 jarvis 1993 however the application of such a framework faces many challenges e g quantification of societal value changes technological progress and governance reform the top down downward approach adopted in this study in contrast can simplify the model significantly and encourage the discovery of common principles van emmerik et al 2014 elshafei et al 2014 srinivasan 2015 and is therefore more applicable to socio hydrology research at the system scale without sufficiently detailed process knowledge the development of a budyko type model of human water consumption in this study can be viewed as a crucial step for socio hydrology in that it helps to bridge a research gap between hydrology and sociology through a unified analysis framework making it easier to directly couple the social and natural subsystems together at the system level the similarities and the existence of common optimal principles of vegetation and human water consumption may encourage researchers to explore more theoretical connections between the two subsystems thus revealing more hidden patterns and providing more generic understandings in coupled human water systems the budyko type model presented in this paper also has other potential practical implications as a quantitative relationship balancing human and environmental water needs this model has the potential to be a generalized constraint in water resources system models to simplify the structure of existing models and develop a new generation of models especially for catchments where human activities dominate the water cycle application of the budyko model for human water consumption may be useful for extrapolating and predicting future human behaviors including the impacts of economic and climate conditions on catchment water balance as the long term averaged framework proposed in this study provides a theoretical framework of human water consumption behavior analysis it will be helpful in the calibration or validation of water resources system models by detecting the dynamic equilibrium when taking more related factors into consideration besides the major ones presented here this issue is left for further research many research questions raised during this study deserve further efforts aimed at their elucidation the quality of the initial survey data has been controlled by balancing water volume at each level and unifying with existing data while the data processing results have been validated by comparing with the previous studies however sources of error still exist for instance the channel water delivery coefficient Œ∑ is not fine enough to be defined at the subbasin level the crop coefficient k c under various climate and soil conditions brings unavoidable biases the analyses and modeling presented in this paper merely

2014 it can also be obtained by contacting the lead author we are grateful to the editors and the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and detailed suggestions which helped us substantially improve the paper appendix a over a long term period the total water benefit of human society can be divided into two parts i e benefit from direct human water consumption and benefit from environmental water use in both cases quadratic functions are simple common forms usually adopted in past studies tu et al 2008 in this study we employ these same quadratic forms for benefit functions representing both human water consumption and environmental water use for human water consumption we have a 1 œÉ u œÉ u 0 œÉ ua here œÉ u is the benefit of human water consumption u œÉ u 0 represents the benefit of water consumption in industrial domestic and other urban sectors u 0 and œÉ ua stands for the benefit of agricultural water consumption u a here œÉ u 0 can be considered as a constant for a given catchment as it can be assumed that u 0 is always guaranteed on the other hand œÉ ua is formulated in terms of a simple quadratic function similar to the concept of the shortage index widely used in the field of water resources planning and management tu et al 2008 zhao and zhao 2014 this is given by a 2 œÉ ua a k a s i a k a u p u u p u 0 2 here the term u p u u p u 0 is a water shortage fraction in agriculture the term s i u p u u p u 0 2 is defined similarly to the shortage index which reflects the water shortage fraction k a is a parameter related to economic losses due to water shortage in the agricultural sector and a is a parameter that stands for the maximum benefit without water shortage then it can be shown that a 3 œÉ u œÉ u 0 œÉ ua a k a u p u u p u 0 2 œÉ u 0 in the case of environmental water use l its maximum value cannot exceed a u 0 because once again it can be assumed that u 0 is guaranteed therefore the shortage term can be expressed as a u 0 l a u 0 then as before the benefit of environmental water use œÉ l can thus be formulated as a 4 œÉ l b k l a u 0 l a u 0 2 here k l is a parameter related to the economic losses due to inadequate environmental flows or groundwater recharge and b is a parameter that indicates the maximum value of the environment to people in the absence of water shortages then the total benefit of the social subsystem œÉ socialsys can be expressed as a 5 œÉ socialsys a b k a u p u u p u 0 2 k l a u 0 l a u 0 2 œÉ u 0 because œÉ u 0 and the parameters k a k l a and b can be treated as constants for a given catchment maximizing the total benefit to the social subsystem can be formulated as the following optimization problem a 6a max œÉ socialsys a b k a u p u u p u 0 2 k l a u 0 l a u 0 2 œÉ u 0 a 6b s u

can be solved by using lagrange multipliers a 7 max f u l Œª a b k a u p u u p u 0 2 k l a u 0 l a u 0 2 œÉ u 0 Œª a u l then the optimal solution is obtained by setting the partial derivatives of the

6884,budyko type models in hydrology are simple but efficient descriptions of the vegetation mediated hydrologic cycle in catchments based on hypothesized similarities between vegetation and human water consumption interactions in terms of water demand constraints and system functioning as well as catchment processes and outcomes a corresponding budyko type framework is proposed here for human water consumption at the catchment scale to validate this framework socioeconomic data human water consumption and economic and agricultural structure data as well as hydrometeorological data for 51 human impacted catchments located in 10 major river basins in china were assembled the results demonstrate 1 similar observed patterns to the traditional budyko curves with two limits and a monotonous increase shape 2 the same functional form and mathematical features of the derived budyko type equation parameters of the new budyko type model for human consumption are estimated and analyzed based on the concept of water productivity this study suggests that the functioning of both social and hydrologic subsystems within catchment systems can be explored within a common conceptual framework thus providing a unified socio hydrologic basis for the study of human water systems keywords socio hydrology budyko equation human water consumption optimality water management 1 introduction freshwater scarcity is a major cause behind a number of global societal challenges such as poverty as well as risk to human health and sustainable development rijsberman 2006 the rapidly growing human population and climate change contribute to increased agricultural industrial and domestic water demands exacerbating tensions among multiple water users including ecosystems v√∂r√∂smarty et al 2000 ipcc 2013 in some developed basins human activities are even becoming the dominant factors as they alter water nutrient and energy cycles and landscape evolution vitousek et al 1997 v√∂r√∂smarty et al 2010 the pursuit of a deeper understanding of the interactions between human and water systems prompted the birth of socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2012 sivapalan and bl√∂schl 2015 which is expected to reveal knowledge that is more generalized regarding human intervention in the past and present in order to be more fully prepared for future water demand van emmerik et al 2014 constrained by the limits of the natural environment water management practices usually reflect local cultural values historical context and political realities padowski et al 2015 therefore the challenges posed by increasing demands for water for multiple human as well as environmental needs are addressed differently in different places governed by the factors mentioned above because of these various exhibited characteristics socio hydrologic studies of human water consumption and competition with environmental water use have tended to focus on individual case studies in different parts of the world e g van emmerik et al 2014 srinivasan 2015 however the ultimate goal should go beyond mimicking observations and further develop a generalized understanding of socio hydrologic system dynamics by finding common ground for particular types of problems sivapalan 2015 comparative studies involving extensive data analyses in multiple places would be a useful approach to generate patterns of coupled system behavior wherein the methods are usually associated with iterative processes of building a hypothesis identifying evidence from data and updating the hypothesis troy et al 2015 pande and sivapalan 2016 a common conceptual framework that helps to synthesize the outcomes of place based studies is needed to bring the fragmented results of quantitative data analyses together and to foster an accumulation of knowledge and understanding such a theoretical framework should encapsulate the physical and social controls affecting human water consumption a commonly adopted theoretical framework in catchment hydrology is the budyko model of long term water balance milly and shmakin 2002 xu et al 2013 budyko 1974 fitted an empirical equation to characterize long term water balance based on data from a large number of catchments located in a range of climatic regions because of its simplicity and ability to represent empirical data in diverse regions and contexts the budyko curve has been widely used to represent long term coupled water and energy cycles including the feedbacks between climate water soil and vegetation milly 1994 yang et al 2007 tang and wang 2017 budyko curves exhibit very particular behavior under low aridity and high aridity conditions represented by the energy and water constraints respectively of the functional relationship despite the empirical origins of the budyko curve theories based on optimality either maximization or minimization of suitably defined ecosystem functions have been proposed to explain the observed phenomena eagleson 1978 porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2013 recent research has expressed in terms of the optimality principle of entropy production wang et al 2015 the supportive evidence behind such a physical basis is that vegetation organizes itself into coherent spatial patterns and temporal dynamics as an optimal response to changing climatic and landscape conditions caylor et al 2004 fern√°ndez illescas and rodriguez iturbe 2004 wu and archer 2005 with a resultant imprint on the hydrologic responses as well berghuijs et al 2014 in the long term an equilibrium state of vegetation patterns and catchment water balance is reached eagleson 1978 donohue et al 2007 in human societies likewise the resulting feedbacks between human management activities and the natural hydrologic cycle can give rise to emergent dynamics in time and patterns in space low et al 1999 kinzig 2001 zehe and sivapalan 2009 consequently analysis of observed patterns of water consumption in space time should themselves be viewed as emergent patterns dynamics anderies et al 2002 walker and meyers 2004 controlled by physical factors e g climate vegetation soil and topography and by social factors e g technology level of socio economic development lifestyles and societal norms and values ceola et al 2016 one can imagine that climate and socioeconomic conditions govern the long term equilibrium of human water consumption and environmental water use and possibly human settlement patterns as a result constraints on human water consumption should also exist as the quantity and quality of water resources and socioeconomic levels limit water utilization to a certain extent sun et al 2015 such constraints should be presented when describing water consumption behavior in a mathematical framework the recognition of similarities between human water consumption and vegetation water consumption interactions therefore raises the prospect of developing a budyko type model for human water consumption as well as a direct analogy to the traditional budyko type model for understanding the long term water balance in catchment hydrology the use of such analogies is a method widely adopted in many other interdisciplinary fields e g levins and culver 1971 brander and taylor 1998 gao et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 this is the motivation behind the work presented in this paper the aim of this study was to address human water resources management at the catchment scale using two different but complementary approaches 1 a data based empirical analysis of human water consumption along the lines of budyko s classical work and 2 an optimality based theoretical derivation of a budyko type equation these two approaches were then reconciled to discuss the natural and societal controls on human water consumption the data for the empirical analysis came from several river basins in china the theoretical derivation involved application of an optimality theory widely used in analyses of contemporary water resources systems the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and the data assembled for the study section 3 compares the similarity between the budyko type frameworks for natural and social water balances and defines the variables associated with human consumption it presents empirical data on human consumption from study catchments in the form of budyko type curves section 4 presents the analytical derivation of the budyko type relationship for human consumption by invoking the optimality principle and the estimation of the model parameters finally section 5 presents a discussion of the results and a summary of the main conclusions 2 study areas and data sources in this study the 10 major river basins of china and the 51 large subbasins within those basins were selected for analysis the locations of which are shown in fig 1 these basins experience diverse climatic and economic conditions as well as differing extents of human interference long term 1980 2000 meteorological data from 824 national weather stations located within these basins were collected from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn including precipitation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature daily average temperature wind speed relative humidity sunshine duration and the altitudes and latitudes of the weather stations additionally data on crop structures within the basins were collected from local statistical yearbooks to represent the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of crops to quantify the agricultural water demand the second national water resources integrated plan of china nwripc ii carried out from 2002 to 2009 provides a comprehensive socioeconomic dataset for this study including available water resources and water consumption of agricultural industrial domestic and other sectors for every five years from 1980 to 2000 1980 1985 1990 1995 and 2000 led by the national development and reform commission and the ministry of water resources several ministries formed the national water resources comprehensive planning group including the ministry of agriculture the ministry of construction the ministry of land and resources the forestry bureau the environmental protection administration and the china meteorological administration over 300 related technical departments river basin authorities and provincial governments with approximately 15 000 people directly participated and cooperated in the whole process the survey contained two phases 1 establishing and analyzing the basic information of water resources conditions and utilization and 2 determining the national and regional water resources allocation for sustainable development in this work the water consumption survey consisted of water balance experiments in more than 800 irrigation areas typical water consumption censuses in approximately 10 000 industrial and service enterprises and urban water consumption information from over 600 counties with unified evaluation standards and technical requirements to evaluate the water resources at both administrative and basin scales the nation was cataloged into 1062 units the basic data were collected and summarized gradually from basic units to the major basins provinces with water balance correction at each level back and forth the balance considered relationships between 1 the surface water and groundwater 2 restoration and consumption 3 water supply water withdrawal water consumption and water drainage and 4 the calculation units administrative and basin scale to strengthen rationality and minimize uncertainty the data also coordinated with the existing data including previous water resources censuses bulletins and comprehensive and special planning reports as quality control approaches to ensure the reliability of the estimation results the major results of nwripc ii including the data used in this paper were published by the general institute of water resources planning and design 2014 3 methodology 3 1 introduction of the budyko framework to serve as a guide for the data analysis and the later theoretical derivation of the budyko equation we first present a conceptual framework based on a proposed analogy of water consumption by humans to vegetation water consumption in the water cycle the traditional budyko equation is formulated in terms of two nondimensional variables the evapotranspiration ratio e p and the aridity index e p p resulting in a relationship of the form e p f e p p where e is actual evapotranspiration p is rainfall and e p is potential evapotranspiration several mathematical forms have been proposed for the function f some empirical zhang et al 2001 2004 potter et al 2005 reflecting local climate and catchment characteristics and others conceptual or physically based yang et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 in this paper for consistency with later derivations we highlight the analytical formulation derived by wang and tang 2014 through the application of the optimality principle of entropy production wang et al 2015 which is expressed as follows 1 e p 1 e p p 1 e p p 2 4 Œ¥ 2 Œ¥ e p p 2 Œ¥ 2 Œ¥ wang and tang 2014 and wang et al 2015 discussed the definition and meaning of the parameter Œ¥ and interpreted it as e 0 e with a range between 0 and 1 the variable e 0 is initial evaporation defined as the portion of wetting available only for direct evaporation such as that which occurs because of vegetation interception and water storage in top soils the remaining part of the evaporation is defined as continuing evaporation e c e e 0 which competes with runoff during rainfall partitioning wang and tang 2014 vegetation change plays a critical role in regulating the catchment hydrological partitioning through altering the external environment water and energy balance and adjusting the internal characteristic e g rooting depth and leaf area donohue et al 2007 guswa 2008 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 as the main source of e 0 interception is highly related to canopy structure e g canopy cover leaf surface etc which adapts dynamically to the environmental conditions muzylo et al 2009 based on eq 1 the long term water balance can be expected to follow a family of curves depending on the magnitude of the parameter Œ¥ yang et al 2009 wang and tang 2014 as shown schematically in fig 2 a 3 2 analogy between human water consumption and evapotranspiration human water management in a social context is analogous to the natural water balance of catchments managed by vegetation one can recognize a remarkable similarity between the two kinds of water management by comparing human water consumption with vegetation water consumption i e evapotranspiration in terms of water demand humans need water for productive use such as agriculture for food production note humans also need water for direct consumption such as domestic usage but the amounts are much smaller whereas vegetation consumes water as a part of photosynthesis for biomass production in terms of constraints human water consumption is constrained by water availability water infrastructure and water demand under the given socioeconomic conditions in a similar way vegetation water consumption is constrained by water availability i e precipitation the ability of plants to access water e g root systems and evaporative demand i e solar radiation and wind in terms of system functioning the goal of the human subsystem is to utilize water for human demands and improve social welfare sivapalan 2015 the objective of the natural subsystem likewise can be interpreted as ecological or vegetation optimality eagleson et al 2002 schymanski et al 2007 or optimality of entropy production zhao et al 2016 in terms of catchment processes and outcomes water management by humans involves a judicious partitioning of the available water resources into that for human water consumption and the water left behind in the environment e g environmental flow in the case of natural catchments one can also think of water being managed analogously by natural vegetation through partitioning of the incoming precipitation into vegetation water consumption i e evapotranspiration and streamflow for aquatic ecosystems over a long period the essential equilibrium of both self organization systems vegetation and human is dynamic instead of varying around a stable point to achieve the optimum under a changing environment although the change rates of the two systems may be very different vegetation has coevolved with its environment by adjusting ecosystem structure function and floristics optimally givnish 1988 when natural or human induced disturbances occur vegetation structure and functioning adapts to them dynamically by changing structural attributes and distribution arora and boer 2009 thonicke et al 2010 similarly humans adapt to the environment by changing water use structure and water allocation furthermore humans can also improve water supply by building infrastructure e g inter basin water transfer projects and desalination plants which will shift the equilibrium to a new state due to the change of available water term in view of these similarities one is tempted to look for similarity between the conceptual frameworks applicable for socio hydrology and ecohydrology 3 3 budyko framework for human water consumption based on similarities based on the above arguments the nature of the partitioning of water through vegetation water and human water interactions and feedbacks is hypothesized in the form of common budyko type relationships as presented in fig 2 a and b postulating that under different local conditions the water partitioning could manifest in a family of budyko type curves as seen before in the traditional budyko type models the evaporation ratio e p is primarily governed by the aridity index e p p the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation in arid regions with e p p 1 actual evaporation is limited by water availability i e precipitation p whereas in humid regions with e p p 1 actual evaporation is constrained by energy availability i e potential evaporation e p a secondary consideration in this water partitioning is other climatic e g seasonality and landscape factors often reflected in the nature and dynamics of vegetation that has adapted to the environment in fig 2 a this control is expressed through the parameter Œ¥ of eq 1 analogously in the human subsystem actual human water consumption which refers to the net consumption in the processes of human water use measured by water withdrawal minus return flow is affected by water availability a on the one hand and by consumptive water demand u p on the other these being respectively the supply and demand for human water consumption water availability a is defined as the mean annual depth of water resources available to and accessible by humans through hydraulic infrastructure in the foreseeable future this is normally the sum of the net recharge of groundwater interbasin water transfers and surface runoff and excludes flood water 2 a w s w g w t w f where w s is the total surface water resources i e mean annual runoff restored from observed runoff and water withdrawal data w g is the net recharge of groundwater subtracting the phreatic evaporation lateral outflow and river and lake discharge from the total recharge w t is the water transferred from other catchments and w f is the depth of flood water that is not available for human water consumption because of flood control operation taking into account of the total reservoir storage capacity in each basin in the foreseeable future for this study the long term average result of a was adopted obtained directly from the official survey data from nwripc ii the role of a is analogous to that of precipitation p in catchment hydrology as it is the source for human water consumption it should be noted that in some basins such as the hai river basin groundwater depletion has occurred since the 1980s as over pumped groundwater has played an important role in water supply leading to bias in water availability a as well as in human water consumption modeling however this imbalance is not sustainable in the long term because the marginal costs including economic and environmental costs of groundwater over pumping increase with the amount of over pumping as a result the south to north water diversion project was planned and built from the 1990s to substitute groundwater supply and restore groundwater storage in the hai river basin thus the change in groundwater storage can be viewed as a source of bias in the short term in this work water demand u p is the sum of all water demands of human society that is agricultural domestic industrial and other urban water needs actual human water consumption u is defined as the actual consumptive water use of all sectors of human society and u a is then the water consumption ratio corresponding to e p in catchment hydrology actual human water consumption u can be decomposed into two parts the first one is the water consumption in industrial domestic and other sectors in urban areas denoted by u 0 which is usually guaranteed because its supply reliability is over 95 ministry of housing and urban rural development of china 1998 corresponding to the initial evaporation e 0 in catchment hydrology wang and tang 2014 in the long term e 0 varies when the canopy structure of the vegetation system changes to adapt to the environment likewise humans in urban areas can reduce their consumptive use to resist water stress for instance the severe drought in california since 2011 has led to restricted urban water consumption either mandatorily or voluntarily nagourney 2015 mann and gleick 2015 therefore this variable is not always constant in a changing environment the second part is water consumption in the agricultural sector denoted by u a which is usually not guaranteed because its supply reliability is only about 50 75 ministry of housing and urban rural development of china 2009 corresponding to continuing evaporation e c in catchment hydrology wang and tang 2014 we then have 3 u u 0 u a additionally runoff in catchment hydrology is the surplus of precipitation over evaporation and the corresponding term in the human subsystem is the water left over after human consumption which is equivalent to in stream environmental flows tennant 1976 poff and matthews 2013 and or groundwater recharge hu et al 2008 this is called environmental water use in this study and is denoted as l balancing human water consumption and environmental water use is one of the main objectives of sustainable river basin management loucks and beek 2005 heinz et al 2007 hu et al 2008 zhao et al 2009 thus the overall water balance in the social subsystem can be written as 4 a u l the differences and similarities between the variables associated with human water consumption and vegetation water consumption as in classical budyko type models are listed in table 1 3 4 estimation of consumptive water demand the variables defined in table 1 for the social subsystem can be collected directly or can be estimated as per their definitions from other data u and a are directly collected from the nwripc ii whereas u p is not available and needs to be estimated using relevant data the consumptive water demand estimation is described below in china agricultural water consumption comprises more than 70 of total water consumption yamada et al 2012 du et al 2015 and is usually not fully satisfied because of its low supply priority lack of irrigation infrastructure or both simultaneously in contrast water consumption in the industrial domestic and other urban sectors can be fully satisfied most of the time because these uses are much lower in terms of amounts but higher in terms of supply priority agricultural water supply is constrained by a range of factors in addition to water availability such as the capacity of channels roads over once productive farmland and heavy losses due to canal seepage brown and halweil 1998 large demand low supply priority and lack of proper engineering infrastructure make it difficult to fully satisfy agricultural water demand which can be verified by comparing actual irrigation water consumption with the irrigation demand estimated later thus u p can be decomposed into two parts 5 u p u pa u p 0 here u pa stands for the consumptive demand of irrigation i e the potential value of u a and u p 0 represents the consumptive water demand in the industrial domestic and other sectors in urban areas i e the potential value of u 0 a simplifying assumption is made to estimate the potential water consumption in urban areas u p 0 that is that u p 0 is approximately equal to the actual water consumption in these sectors such that 6 u 0 u p 0 this assumption is reasonable because u p 0 is fully supplied in most cases this equation may slightly underestimate u p 0 as well as the overall potential water consumption u p but this underestimation is deemed small enough to be negligible for two reasons 1 the required reliability of water supply systems in urban areas is over 95 and 2 the total amount of u 0 is less than 30 of the actual water consumption in china to estimate u pa a widely used method developed by the united nations food and agricultural organization fao is employed allen et al 1998 the potential irrigation water consumption u pa is estimated as the net irrigation requirement i r net multiplied by the fraction of agricultural area s 7 u pa i 1 n ir n e t 1 i s 1 i i r n e t 2 i s 2 i Œ∑ s 1 i s 2 i where u pa is the potential irrigation water demand per year mm year without water deficit i is the crop type n is the total number of crop types in the study area ir n e t 1 i and ir n e t 2 i are a crop s irrigation requirements in terms of irrigated and rain fed areas per month mm month respectively s 1 i and s 2 i are the irrigated and rain fed areas of a certain crop m2 respectively and Œ∑ is the water delivery coefficient of channels the value for each major river basin was obtained from the nwripc ii and is shown in table 3 the net irrigation requirement for the year ir net is defined as the sum of the difference between the monthly crop specific evapotranspiration e t cj and the monthly effective rainfall p effj ir net j 1 m e t cj p effj w h e n et cj p effj 8 ir net 0 w h e n et cj p effj where m is the total monthly growth of any given crop and j refers to the month for rain fed croplands when rainfall cannot fully meet the needs of the crops there is still a potential water demand to be met theoretically this demand can be met through irrigation if infrastructure is available thus it is included in the estimation of u pa effective precipitation p effj is the rainfall that infiltrates into the soil and can be utilized by the crops for growth in month j rosegrant et al 2008 the scs method developed by the united states department of agriculture soil conservation service usda 1970 is applied to calculate p effj 9 p effj max 0 f 1 253 p j 0 824 2 935 10 0 001 et cj w h e n p j 12 5 m m p effj p j w h e n p j 12 5 m m where p j is the precipitation in month j mm month and f is a correction factor which equals 1 012 for irrigated areas and 1 074 for rain fed lands the method and parameters are from international model for policy analysis of agricultural commodities and trade impact rosegrant et al 2008 for world wide food demand estimation to calculate crop specific evapotranspiration et cj the reference crop evapotranspiration et r and crop coefficient k c are needed the variable et r refers to the evapotranspiration for a reference surface completely covered with well grown uniform height grass under full irrigation allen et al 1998 the value of et r is estimated using the penman monteith pm equation as well as net radiation air temperature and humidity and wind speed data 10 et r 0 408 d r n g g 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a d g 1 0 34 u 2 where d is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 r n is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 g is the

coefficient k c is determined based on crop species local climate and growth stage allen et al 1998 the growth period can be divided into four stages initial development mid season and late season the value of k c remains constant as k cini and k cmid at the initial and mid season stages respectively k c increases linearly during the development stage of the crop from k cini to k cmid and then decreases linearly during the late season from k cmid to k clate the durations and k c values during these different stages can be found in the study by allen et al 1998 either assigned initial and mid season stages or interpolated development and late season stages with a daily time step then the crop evapotranspiration e of month j can be obtained as follows 11 et cj k c et r daily meteorological data were applied to calculate daily irrigation requirements the sum of all growing seasons values was regarded as the yearly demand which is a common method recommended by the fao allen et al 1998 the final outcomes of both survey data and estimation data would be unified in the annual mean value 4 results of data analysis and modeling the actual water consumption data were obtained directly from the nwripc ii where the survey data was corrected with water balance validation from various levels and aspects and coordinated with existing published data to minimize the uncertainty the estimation of consumptive demand of agriculture derived from pm model by the fao was compared with previous studies adopting various methods to validate the accuracy shown in table 2 in general the pm method adopted here demonstrated relatively good agreement between the predicted and observed et c and ir net but there were still some unavoidable biases related to the adjusted crop coefficients under various climate and soil conditions flumignan et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 even with its limitations the pm model has received common acceptance and is an international standard for calculating et c and modifying models wang et al 2017 yin et al 2008 based on the data and method after comparison and validation with previous studies the outcomes were analyzed in the proposed budyko model for human water consumption 4 1 budyko type model of human water consumption all the collected and estimated data on water consumption are listed in table 3 note that long term average values for water consumption were used here similar to the budyko type models in catchment hydrology according to the determination of a i e available water resources and infrastructure the study basins were classified into two types 1 those that lack adequate water resources and 2 those that lack adequate water supply infrastructure in some basins water supply depends not only on local precipitation but also on interbasin transfers for instance both the hai and northwest river basins receive interbasin transfers to support their economic development as available natural water resources cannot meet societal needs the south to north water diversion project was built to resolve the water shortage dilemma in the hai river basin in this case a is greater than the local natural water resources in contrast in some basins lack of infrastructure is the constraint on water supply such as in the southwest river basin this river basin is located in a humid region with abundant water resources where mean annual runoff is 693 mm however the economy and infrastructure in this river basin are under developed leading to a lower level of water consumption annual in stream flow in this basin is nearly 687 mm indicating that most of the water is left in the river instead of consumed by humans in this case a is less than the local natural water resources to verify the similarities between natural and social water cycles scatter plots of human water consumption and vegetation water consumption i e natural water balance in the form of the budyko model were compared and provide the foundation for the theoretical analogy fig 3 a and b provides a full picture of both social and natural water balances respectively for the selected catchments in china inspired by the classical budyko curve in the social case the results for human water consumption shown in fig 3 a are taken from the data presented in table 3 in the natural case the results presented in fig 3 b for comparison are 166 catchments reported by yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 and chen et al 2016 these catchments cover the 10 major river basins of mainland china with areas ranging from 372 to 121 330 km2 the values of p and e p for each catchment were calculated from the china meteorological administration whereas annual discharge data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china the record length was greater than 40 years fig 3 a describes the human water consumption patterns whereas fig 3 b portrays the watersheds in the same major river basins from the perspective of the vegetation mediated hydrologic cycle fig 3 a and b together provide two aspects for evaluating the catchments that is social and hydrological in fig 3 a inspired by the traditional budyko relationship a budyko relationship for human water consumption was plotted the positions of the data in both budyko type relationships i e u a vs u p a and e p vs e p p in fig 3 a the social case showed promise yet considerable scatter exists the scatter in the natural budyko curve as seen in fig 3 b has been explained in terms of landscape factors including land cover changes yang et al 2009 similarly the scatter in the social budyko curve can be induced by the uncertainties of the data and changes in related factors which serves as the motivation for theoretical derivation and interpretation fig 3 a also demonstrates two limits to human water consumption 1 water availability a which constrains water consumption in water limited catchments i e those with u p a 1 and 2 potential water consumption u p which constrains human water consumption in water abundant catchments i e those with u p a 1 these two limits on u a can be expressed as follows 12 u a 1 f o r u p a 1 u a u p a f o r u p a 1 combining the aridity index e p p and the demand index u p a the study catchments can be classified into four types 1 e p p 1 a n d u p a 1 such as the southeast and pearl river basins a majority of the yangtze river basins and some subbasins of the southwest and huai river basin where water is relatively abundant for meeting the demands of vegetation and humans respectively implying that the consumptive water demand of humans is less than water availability 2 e p p 1 a n d u p a 1 such as some subbasins of the huai and pearl river basins where water is abundant for meeting vegetation demand but is insufficient for meeting human demand which implies that the consumptive water demand of humans is larger than the water availability because of highly developed agriculture 3 e p p 1 a n d u p a 1 such as the songhua river basin a majority of the liao and southwest river basins and some subbasins of the yangtze and the northwest river basins where water is limited for meeting the demand of vegetation but is abundant for meeting human demand which indicates that the consumptive water demand of humans is smaller than the water availability because of a reliance on rain fed agriculture and undeveloped irrigation infrastructure 4 e p p 1 a n d u p a 1 such as the yellow river basin and a majority of the hai liao northwest and huai river basins where water is limited for meeting the demands of both vegetation and human which indicates that the consumptive water demand of humans is larger than the water availability because of developed irrigation and yet scarce water resources it should be noted that all ten major basins are relatively large and consist of subbasins with various climatic topographic vegetation and socioeconomic conditions thus the subbasins in a major basin may have different classifications from the perspective of human water consumption the water limited catchments belonging to catchment types 2 and 4 appear in the top right area of fig 3 a with the high water consumption ratio u a limited by water availability for catchment types 1 and 3 the actual water consumption u is limited by the potential water consumption u p and these catchment types appear in the lower left part of fig 3 a according to the analogy between the natural budyko curve and the social budyko curve similarities between water cycles in nature and in human society can be explored fortunately such similarities do exist based on the data analysis presented above supporting the assumption from a phenomenological perspective which is also the premise adopted here for discussing the theoretical foundation behind it two levels of comparison phenomenon and theory together can enhance the reliability and deepen the understanding of the social budyko model thus a theoretical analysis of the social budyko curve is presented invoking optimality theory used in water resources management which is also helpful for understanding social budyko curves and providing interpretations of the possible causes of the scatter 4 2 derivation of the budyko type model for human water consumption many previous studies have derived a range of models for long term catchment water balance based on the budyko hypothesis followed by theoretical or physical arguments e g zhang et al 2001 2004 potter et al 2005 yang et al 2007 2008 recently wang and tang 2014 derived a form of the budyko equation by building on the proportionality hypothesis and wang et al 2015 subsequently proposed a thermodynamic explanation for the hypothesis and thus for the budyko curve later work by zhao et al 2016 extended the application of optimality principles to catchment water balances at shorter time scales as well analogously we now derive a budyko type model of human water consumption based on the economic principle of maximum water benefit mwb which is a general water allocation rule for human society adopted in studies of contemporary water resources systems the detailed derivation is demonstrated in appendix a the final functional form is shown below 13 u a œï œï Œµ u p a u p a Œµ u p a œï œï Œµ u p a u p a Œµ u p a 2 4 œï Œµ 1 œï Œµ u p a 2 Œµ 1 œï Œµ where œï k a k l is a human environment benefit ratio k a is a parameter related to average economic losses due to water shortage in the agricultural sector k l is a parameter related to the average economic losses due to inadequate environmental flows or groundwater recharge and Œµ u 0 u is a guaranteed human water consumption ratio it was found that not all combinations of the two parameters œï and Œµ satisfied the upper limit which indicates that œï and Œµ are interdependent in particular when œï 1 that is when the average economic losses caused by water shortage in agricultural and environmental flows are equal eq 13 becomes 14 u a 1 u p a 1 u p a 2 4 Œµ 2 Œµ u p a 2 Œµ 2 Œµ eq 14 is identical to eq 1 above developed by wang and tang 2014 for catchment hydrology and also satisfies the boundary conditions of the budyko curve that is 15 u a 0 w h e n u p a 0 u a 1 w h e n u p a the reason behind the identical equations is the similarities of structures and optimality between the two subsystems as they are both constrained by demand and supply limits to achieve the dynamic optimality under given conditions the analogous nature gives rise to identical external patterns when œï 1 a more complex relationship between the value of human water consumption and the value of environmental water use is obtained still the resulting functional form is very similar to the model developed by wang et al 2015 and is only slightly different from many formulations already used in the literature for vegetation impact on long term water balance e g fu 1981 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2008 parameter œï represents the ratio of unit economic loss in society to that in the environment caused by water shortage and Œµ represents the effect of the demand structure of human water consumption the relative effects of these two parameters are shown in fig 4 by setting Œµ 0 35 in fig 4 a and œï 1 in fig 4 b in fig 4 a it is shown that a larger œï results in a higher u a that is when the unit economic loss caused by social water shortage increases humans would like to consume more water for societal needs and thus water left in the environment takes up a smaller fraction of the total available water moreover with increasing u p a differences between u a for different œï values become larger this implies that the larger the demand index u p a the bigger the impact of œï becomes however the effect of Œµ reveals a slightly different pattern as demonstrated in fig 4 b a larger Œµ leaves less water for the environment which implies that catchments with larger non agricultural demand tend to have more water allocated for human use because such non agricultural demand has a high supply priority when the demand index u p a is extremely low or high the effect of Œµ on u a is small implying that water consumption in catchments with very high or very low non agricultural demands is relatively independent of Œµ when the demand index u p a lies in the range of 1 to 2 that is with medium demand pressure Œµ strongly influences the shape of the curves with the insights gained from the theoretical analysis and in particular about the role and meaning of the two parameters œï and Œµ we now compare the water consumption behavior predicted by eq 14 with the observed data from the 10 river basins and 51 catchments in china the results for selected parameter combinations are shown in fig 5 this includes the best fit curve which is the gray solid curve with œï 1 00 and Œµ 0 48 a root mean square error rmse of 0 13 and a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 79 the dash dot curve on the top represents a case with non agricultural human water demand dominated structure with œï 1 00 and Œµ 0 85 the dashed curve at the bottom represents a case with more emphasis on the environment as characterized by œï 0 40 and Œµ 0 10 the catchments along this line indicate high values of environmental losses in developed regions or lack of infrastructure in undeveloped regions which leaves a large fraction of water to the environment the lines give a general description of the human water consumption patterns under certain conditions when socioeconomic or climatic changes occur the parameters of the lines can be adjusted to describe the new patterns adapting to the late environment the lines are derived from the dominant influencing factors whereas the dots are the individual manifestations because the structures of the lines have not taken all the related factors into consideration biases and differences between the lines and dots exist nevertheless the lines still provide a possible perspective to explain human water consumption behavior thorough analysis of these factors should be carried out based on more data from a larger range of the world this kind of analysis is left for further research 4 3 estimation of model parameters to make the theoretically derived equations more widely applicable parameters a maximum benefit without water shortage see more details in appendix a and k a are estimated from data based on the concept of water productivity wp wp kg m3 yr is the ratio of crop yield to the amount of water consumption reflecting the average benefit per unit water of the whole growing phase huang and li 2010 assessed the basin scale wp of irrigated grain crops e g wheat rice maize and soybeans in the major breadbasket basins of china meanwhile the convex quadratic water productive function is widely applied in the relationship between obtained yield and the total amount of evapotranspiration geerts and raes 2009 xiao et al 2008 summarized the parameters in the function and the maximum yield for different crops in various parts of china applying the parameters mentioned before we obtain 16 a i y mi ai i p i where a i is the maximum benefit of crop i without water deficit rmb year y mi is the maximum yield per unit area of crop i kg m2 year ai i is the irrigated area of crop i m2 and p i is the selling price of crop i rmb kg which was obtained from the china yearbook of agricultural price survey national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2004 combining the concept of wp and the parameters in the water production function the parameter k ai is 17 k ai wp i ai i p i 1000 where k ai is the average economic loss caused by yield reduction due to water deficit of crop i rmb yr mm and wp i is water productivity of crop i for irrigated land kg m3 yr then for a certain catchment k a and a are the sum of each crop s k ai and a i respectively weighted by area 18 k a i 1 n ai i ai k ai 19 a i 1 n ai i ai a i where ai is the total irrigated area m2 of the catchment the parameter Œµ u 0 u was calculated from the available water consumption data for each basin thus according to the results of u p a and u a in table 3 the value of œï was estimated from eq 13 the parameter k l was calculated by k l k a œï table 4 presents the results for the ten basins using the equations above and the parameters taken from huang and li 2010 cao et al 2014 and xiao et al 2008 the parameter Œµ of the ten basins fluctuated around 0 2 which represented the statement that the agricultural consumption takes up more than 70 of the total water consumption yamada et al 2012 du et al 2015 the parameter œï however demonstrated distinct differences among the basins as it can reflect the relative importance of economic benefit from irrigation in comparison with the environmental benefit the result was classified into four cases 1 when œï 1 k a is higher than k l indicating that the unit agricultural loss is larger than the unit environmental loss among the ten basins shown in table 4 the liao hai yellow and northwest river basins belong to this case where people value water for human consumption more than water for environmental flow strong evidence for this case is the construction of the south to north water diversion project which aims to transfer water to the hai and yellow river basins 2 in contrast in the songhua huai and southwest river basins where water resources are quite abundant œï 0 6 for the songhua river basin which is one of the main breadbaskets of china agriculture is the backbone of the region s economy however according to the government report of comprehensive planning of songhua river basin wang et al 2013 the distribution of water resources is uncoordinated with the productivity demand because of the lack of irrigation infrastructure the annual water shortage for irrigation can be as high as 5 billion m3 in this basin the small value of œï is not due to a higher emphasis on the environment but simply the lack of water supply infrastructure which is also the case for the southwest river basin ye and wu 2011 wang et al 2008 3 with œï 0 6 the pearl river basin is a different case this river basin has a highly developed economy especially in the pearl river delta but environmental problems such as saltwater intrusion in the delta area are quite severe and have caused frequent local drinking water crises almost every year since the late 20th century to solve this problem reservoirs have been operated to release environmental flow to control saltwater intrusion supported by a developed economy as well as abundant water resources this strategy has thus far worked successfully local water resources can almost fully satisfy human demand as well as maintain the environmental water demand leading to a small value of œï 4 the yangtze and southeast river basins have similar values of œï 0 6 œï 1 which indicates that the agricultural and environmental sectors are similar in importance in the minds of the local people 5 discussion and conclusions this paper highlights the similarities between human and vegetation water consumption behaviors the similarities can be explained in terms of certain organizing principles water balance partitioning into evaporation and runoff in a natural catchment has previously been shown to follow the optimality principle of entropy production wang et al 2015 whereas water partitioning between human water consumption and environmental water use in social subsystems has been shown in the current study to follow the principle of maximum water benefit here a budyko type model of human water consumption was presented based on the data of 10 major river basins and 51 of the basins tributary catchments in china showing that water balance in the social subsystem exhibits a similar pattern to that of the budyko curve in catchment hydrology when plotting the water consumption ratio u a versus the demand index u p a a budyko type relationship appears with both supply and demand constraints and monotonous increase to quantify this relationship further a new budyko type model was derived for social water balance based on the principle of water benefit maximization the mathematical features of the derived model were consistent with the corresponding equations for catchment water balance the parameters of the derived equations have physical and economic meanings and can be estimated for each basin it is noted that œï and Œµ have interdependent but varying effects on the shape of the budyko curve the Œµ values of the ten major river basins fluctuate around 0 2 with respect to the parameter œï the 10 major river basins can be classified into four types 1 extreme water shortage with emphasis on human demand œï 1 2 medium water shortage with competitive balance of human and environmental demands 0 6 œï 1 3 abundant water with insufficient infrastructure œï 0 6 and 4 abundant water with emphasis on environmental demand œï 0 6 sun et al 2017 revealed that in china agricultural is the largest contributor for provincial water footprint inequality whereas the effects of natural water availability and domestic and industrial water use are insignificant those outcomes also agree with this study that considerable amounts of water have not been exploited in water abundant basins whereas developed but water scarce basins suffer from water stress the cause can be partly attributed to irrational irrigation patterns and deficient water infrastructure leading to inefficient utilization of water guo and shen 2016 crop structure adjustment and water saving policies and technologies can play an important role in improving agricultural water efficiency to strengthen the sustainability of development and resistance to extreme events lu et al 2017 as an emerging interdisciplinary subject socio hydrology studies have included some quantitative analysis based on conceptual mathematical models in particular case studies e g zlinszky and timar 2013 viglione et al 2014 di baldassarre et al 2013 elshafei et al 2014 2015 but there is still a lack of generic and mechanic understanding feedback between human and water systems wada et al 2017 sanderson et al 2017 lu et al 2018 propose a typical bottom up upward socio hydrological water balance framework consisting of ecological social and hydrological subsystems to simulate the feedback and coevolution in human water systems the upward approach simulates and predicts overall catchment response based on process knowledge kleme≈° 1983 jarvis 1993 however the application of such a framework faces many challenges e g quantification of societal value changes technological progress and governance reform the top down downward approach adopted in this study in contrast can simplify the model significantly and encourage the discovery of common principles van emmerik et al 2014 elshafei et al 2014 srinivasan 2015 and is therefore more applicable to socio hydrology research at the system scale without sufficiently detailed process knowledge the development of a budyko type model of human water consumption in this study can be viewed as a crucial step for socio hydrology in that it helps to bridge a research gap between hydrology and sociology through a unified analysis framework making it easier to directly couple the social and natural subsystems together at the system level the similarities and the existence of common optimal principles of vegetation and human water consumption may encourage researchers to explore more theoretical connections between the two subsystems thus revealing more hidden patterns and providing more generic understandings in coupled human water systems the budyko type model presented in this paper also has other potential practical implications as a quantitative relationship balancing human and environmental water needs this model has the potential to be a generalized constraint in water resources system models to simplify the structure of existing models and develop a new generation of models especially for catchments where human activities dominate the water cycle application of the budyko model for human water consumption may be useful for extrapolating and predicting future human behaviors including the impacts of economic and climate conditions on catchment water balance as the long term averaged framework proposed in this study provides a theoretical framework of human water consumption behavior analysis it will be helpful in the calibration or validation of water resources system models by detecting the dynamic equilibrium when taking more related factors into consideration besides the major ones presented here this issue is left for further research many research questions raised during this study deserve further efforts aimed at their elucidation the quality of the initial survey data has been controlled by balancing water volume at each level and unifying with existing data while the data processing results have been validated by comparing with the previous studies however sources of error still exist for instance the channel water delivery coefficient Œ∑ is not fine enough to be defined at the subbasin level the crop coefficient k c under various climate and soil conditions brings unavoidable biases the analyses and modeling presented in this paper merely represent initial steps towards these detailed future investigations acknowledgments this research was funded by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfc0401302 and

2014 it can also be obtained by contacting the lead author we are grateful to the editors and the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and detailed suggestions which helped us substantially improve the paper appendix a over a long term period the total water benefit of human society can be divided into two parts i e benefit from direct human water consumption and benefit from environmental water use in both cases quadratic functions are simple common forms usually adopted in past studies tu et al 2008 in this study we employ these same quadratic forms for benefit functions representing both human water consumption and environmental water use for human water consumption we have a 1 œÉ u œÉ u 0 œÉ ua here œÉ u is the benefit of human water consumption u œÉ u 0 represents the benefit of water consumption in industrial domestic and other urban sectors u 0 and œÉ ua stands for the benefit of agricultural water consumption u a here œÉ u 0 can be considered as a constant for a given catchment as it can be assumed that u 0 is always guaranteed on the other hand œÉ ua is formulated in terms of a simple quadratic function similar to the concept of the shortage index widely used in the field of water resources planning and management tu et al 2008 zhao and zhao 2014 this is given by a 2 œÉ ua a k a s i a k a u p u u p u 0 2 here the term u p u u p u 0 is a water shortage fraction in agriculture the term s i u p u u p u 0 2 is defined similarly to the shortage index which reflects the water shortage fraction k a is a parameter related to economic losses due to water shortage in the agricultural sector and a is a parameter that stands for the maximum benefit without water shortage then it can be shown that a 3 œÉ u œÉ u 0 œÉ ua a k a u p u u p u 0 2 œÉ u 0 in the case of environmental water use l its maximum value cannot exceed a u 0 because once again it can be assumed that u 0 is guaranteed therefore the shortage term can be expressed as a u 0 l a u 0 then as before the benefit of environmental water use œÉ l can thus be formulated as a 4 œÉ l b k l a u 0 l a u 0 2 here k l is a parameter related to the economic losses due to inadequate environmental flows or groundwater recharge and b is a parameter that indicates the maximum value of the environment to people in the absence of water shortages then the total benefit of the social subsystem œÉ socialsys can be expressed as a 5 œÉ socialsys a b k a u p u u p u 0 2 k l a u 0 l a u 0 2 œÉ u 0 because œÉ u 0 and the parameters k a k l a and b can be treated as constants for a given catchment maximizing the total benefit to the social subsystem can be formulated as the following optimization problem a 6a max œÉ socialsys a b k a u p u u p u 0 2 k l a u 0 l a u 0 2 œÉ u 0 a 6b s u

can be solved by using lagrange multipliers a 7 max f u l Œª a b k a u p u u p u 0 2 k l a u 0 l a u 0 2 œÉ u 0 Œª a u l then the optimal solution is obtained by setting the partial derivatives of the
