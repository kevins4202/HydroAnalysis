10380,the objective of the present study was to determine the effects of different irrigation levels applied with surface drip irrigation sdi and subsurface drip irrigation ssdi method on yield and bioethanol productivity of sorghum sorghum bicolor l cv early sumac in the west mediterranean region of turkey field study was conducted in batı akdeniz agricultural research institute in antalya during the growing seasons of 2017 2018 five different irrigation levels designated as full irrigation i100 with no water stress and slight i75 mild i50 severe water stress i25 and no irrigation i0 treatments were applied the results showed that different irrigation levels applied had statistically significant effect on yield and yield components such as plant height leaf number leaf area index chlorophyll context brix sucrose glucose fructose and bioethanol in both of the drip irrigation methods water deficit stress significantly p 0 01 decreased bioethanol yield the maximum bioethanol yield was obtained from ssdi method under full irrigation slight mild severe and full water deficit stress as much as 2085 2045 1684 1569 and 1407 l ha 1 respectively in 2017 and 2390 2266 1954 1901 and 1493 l ha 1 respectively in 2018 the highest water consumption was observed in i100 treatment as 553 6 mm for sdi in 2017 while the lowest was found in i0 treatment as 198 5 mm for sdi in 2018 the highest water productivity was found in i0 as 6 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 for ssdi method in 2018 and the lowest one was found in i25 as 2 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 for sdi in 2017 the results of the present study showed that an average water saving of 24 0 mm compared with the sdi method was achieved without any decrease in efficiency in the ssdi method keywords sorghum subsurface drip irrigation water deficit yield bioethanol 1 introduction rapid population growth in the world rapid pollution of existing natural resources global warming and climate change are increasing the pressure on water resources given the global warming and consequently the irregularity of rainfall regimes as well as the increasing competition on water resources it is recognized that the water allocated for agriculture has to be reduced gradually in order to provide maximum benefit from irrigation to use freshwater resources efficiently and economically it is necessary to use surface and subsurface drip irrigation methods that save water and energy minimize water losses and evaporation do not pollute the environment and increase the amount of yield and quality it is obvious that the worldwide decrease in water resources and the drought combined with high temperature will negatively affect the production and quality of sorghum the aegean and mediterranean regions where rainfall is irregular especially during growing periods will be more affected by this negativity although human beings started to use alternative energy sources centuries ago it is seen that these resources have changed shape and name with technological developments sources used for heating and cooking for centuries have taken the name of biomass in today s world and have been subject to different classifications even in itself in the last 20 years rapidly increasing biomass resources and their use due to increasing technological developments and energy requirements have caused attention to these resources among the modern biomass sources energy crops come first one of the mentioned energy plants the sorghum plant of the poacea family belongs to the andropogonae team wild and cultivated species bicolor l is located under moench formerly vulgare chopra 1982 sorghum animal feed is considered as one of the rare plants that can produce sugar and biofuel as well as consumption in human nutrition sorghum is known as the most suitable plant in ethanol sources high sugar content receiving a large amount of product per unit area and with a large planting area and features such as adaptability to different soils in europe and turkey in terms of economic production kaplan et al 2009 zega lizarazu and monti 2012 sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench is a c4 crop grown mainly for food and fodder fiber and fuel anami et al 2015 almodares et al 2007 assefa et al 2010 promkhambut et al 2010 and fracassoa et al 2016 argued that sorghum is tolerant of high temperature and drought conditions salinity and water logging respectively sorghum has a shorter growing period and lower water consumption compared to other field crops additionally sorghum is also an important source of bio energy in the world almodares and hadi 2009 the annual production is approximately 59 million tons from a harvest area of 42 million ha in the world fao 2018 total planting area and production of sorghum in turkey was about 136 ha and 361 ton in 2016 respectively sorghum production is carried out mostly in mediterranean and southeastern anatolia regions of turkey future weather projections for the south of turkey are for generally warmer and drier conditions long term average annual precipitation in the mediterranean and southeastern anatolia region is about 1100 mm and 752 mm and falling more than 98 of it from october to may therefore irrigation is needed at sorghum growing season to maintain and enhance crop growth and yield water deficit is a critical issue limiting sorghum growth by having impact on anatomical morphological physiological and biochemical processes assefa et al 2010 various studies have been reported for sorghum irrigation in the world brown et al 1964 and stewart et al 1983 determined the water consumption of sorghum by using furrow irrigation method while curt et al 1995 studied the water yield relationship of sorghum under lysimeter conditions dercas et al 1995 and mastrorilli et al 1995a investigated the effects of irrigation on the yield and quality characteristics of the sorghum according to the development periods flowering grain growth and ripening ghassemi et al 1997 found that water stress applied during the growing period did not have a statistically significant effect on seed quality as it reduced yield saeed and el nadi found that maximum dry matter dm yields were 16 3 11 8 and 10 5 t ha 1 for frequent intermediate and infrequent irrigation regimes mastrorilli et al 1999 reported that the effect of temporary water stress on yield depended on the phenological stage and determined that an early stress provoked an alteration of the water productivity which diminished by about 20 dercas and liakatas 2007 conducted two year field experiment in central greece and they concluded that non water stressed sweet sorghum plants produced above ground dry biomass by the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted during the fast growing stage younesi and moradi 2009 evaluated the effects of irrigation on grain yield yield components and they determined that water limitation had significant effect on grain yield and yield components philp et al 2010 stated that fully irrigated sorghum grown in the northern region of australia has a potential yield of 10 12 t ha 1 and the crop will use from 500 mm up to 750 mm of water mastrorilli et al 2011 studied the effects of two irrigation treatments 100 et and 50 et on two sorghum varieties biomass 133 and sucro 506 they found that the highest water productivity was obtained by irrigating 100 of crop evapotranspiration and in the event of reduced irrigation double cutting improved water productivity by 13 5 farre and faci 2006 determined the effects of sprinkler irrigation treatments on sorghum and they found that water productivity ranged from 1 46 to 0 23 g m 2 mm 1 and yield ranged from 854 to 643 g m 2 klocke 2009 examined the effects of irrigation on sorghum and determined that sorghum yields from the driest irrigation treatment produced only 0 34 t ha 1 less that the fully irrigated treatment vasilakoglou et al 2011 determined that the dry biomass juice and total sugar yields of sorghum that received 210 mm of irrigation water was 49 88 greater than the yields of sorghum that received the 120 mm of irrigation water garofalo and rinaldi 2013 investigated the effects of different irrigation water levels at 50 75 100 and 125 of etc on yield and quality of sorghum and they found that water use wu ranged between 891 and 566 mm the aboveground dry matter biomass between 4 097 and 1 825 g m 2 and water productivity between 8 49 and 4 00 kg m 3 several researches on sorghum have been carried out using the sdi and ssdi in the world sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2007 investigated the effects of different irrigation water levels 100 etm and 80 etm on sorghum in sdi and ssdi while the yield of green biomass and bioethanol in ssdi was determined as 148 2 t ha 1 and 9150 l ha 1 respectively these values were determined as 138 2 t ha 1 and 8390 l ha 1 in sdi in addition the researchers determined that for the production of 1 kg of dry biomass 189 l of irrigation water is needed for ssdi and 302 l of irrigation for sdi mygdakos et al 2009 determined the effects of sorghum irrigated by the sdi and ssdi and found that higher biomass production gross revenue and gross margin along with lower production cost were achieved when the ssdi 42 98 t ha 1 342 e ha 1 when the studies carried out in the last 20 years were examined it was seen that the studies carried out in sorghum focus on the relationship between irrigation and bioenergy almodares and hadi 2009 stated that sorghum plant may be an alternative to corn plant in bioethanol production in areas where water is limited while the potential for use of sorghum as an energy plant is constantly emphasized steduto et al 1997 research is required on production techniques under limited irrigation conditions vasilakoglou et al 2011 although the mediterranean basin of europe is very suitable for sorghum cultivation in terms of climatic conditions the scarcity of water resources limits the agriculture of the plant in question therefore developing suitable irrigation strategies by researching biomass yield under limited irrigation conditions is very important for the mediterranean basin various researches about sorghum have been conducted in turkey when these studies were examined it was observed that they are concentrated mostly on adaptation in sorghum duysal 1991 seed

and 3 respectively the values of the field capacity at site varied between 21 7 g g 1 to 24 0 g g 1 and permanent wilting point ranged from 11 3 g g 1 to 12 8 g g 1 irrigation water was pumped out from a deep well the electrical conductivity ec of irrigation water was 0 462 ds m 1 and the sodium adsorption ratio was 0 34 which does not risk for growing sorghum plants ayers and westcot 1985 table 3 2 3 plant material fertilizer applications planting early sumac sorghum variety grown widely in the region was used as a crop material fertilizer applications were based on soil analysis results and all of the plots received the same amount of total fertilizer the recommended dose of 75 kg ha 1 pure n p and k 15 15 15 composite before sowing and additional nitrogen dose of 115 kg ha 1 was applied as ammonium nitrate which is 50 of total nitrogen when the plants were 0 2 0 4 m high the sorghum seeds were planted on may 10 2017 and may 11 2018 with 0 45 0 05 m spacing 2 4 irrigation method and experimental design surface drip irrigation sdi and subsurface drip irrigation ssdi method were used for irrigating of experimental plots one polyethylene pe drip line with 16 mm diameter was laid along the plant row and in line drippers with a discharge of 2 l h 1 at 100 k pa pressure were inserted along the pipe at 0 25 m spacing drip lines were placed between the crop rows in the experimental plots which had 6 drip laterals laterals in the ssdi method were placed 40 cm below the soil surface the amount of irrigation water was controlled by means of a water counter on the main pipeline and valves located on each experimental plot the experimental plots having 5 4 m wide and 40 0 m long consisted of 12 plants rows fig 1 spaces between plots were 1 5 m and spaces between blocks were 2 0 m the experiment was performed as a randomized complete block design rcbd with two irrigation method as the main treatments based on different drip irrigation methods sdi and ssdi and 5 irrigation water levels i100 full irrigation with no water stress i75 slight water stress i50 mild water stress i25 severe water stress and i0 no irrigation treatment as the sub treatments with 3 replications the amount of water applied in full irrigation treatment i100 was calculated as the amount of water necessary to replenish to the field capacity in the upper 90 cm soil profile depth the quantity of irrigation water applied to the other treatments was decreased stepwise as 0 25 50 and 75 of water applied to the treatment i100 when 40 of the amount of available soil moisture in the upper 0 90 m soil depth in full irrigation treatment i100 was consumed the plants were irrigated soil moisture sensors drill drop probe sentek stepney south australia were installed 10 cm away from the laterals between the two drippers between the two lateral at depth of 1 m and were used throughout the season to monitor the soil moisture each probe had 10 sensors of equal length 10 cm which measured the soil water storage at ten different depths 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 70 70 80 80 90 and 90 100 cm 2 5 evapotranspiration et water productivity wp irrigation water productivity iwp and yield response factor ky evapotranspiration et was calculated using the soil water balance method for two growing season the equation can be written as doorenbos and pruitt 1977 1 et i p δs dp rf wg where et is evapotranspiration mm i is irrigation water applied mm p is amount of rainfall mm δs is change in soil water storage in the 0 90 m soil profile mm dp is deep percolation mm rf is amount of runoff mm and wg is water used by crop through capillary rise from groundwater mm for the calculation irrigation water applied i was measured using water meters and p was observed at the meteorological station located next to the experimental plot since the amount of irrigation water was controlled deep percolation and run off were assumed to be negligible since the groundwater table in the experimental area is 3 5 m below the ground surface wg is negligible liu and wei 1989 water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp were calculated using the following equations zhang et al 1999 2 wp y et 100 3 iwp yi yr i 100 where wp is water productivity kg m 3 iwp is irrigation water productivity kg mm 3 yı is the total yield of irrigation treatments t ha 1 yr is the

yx and ya are the maximum and actual yields etx and eta are the maximum and actual evapotranspiration and ky is a yield response factor representing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yield losses 2 6 harvest yield yield components and statistical analysis the crop was harvested on september 5 2017 and 2018 plant height leaf number leaf area index determined by li 3000c li cor lincoln ne usa chlorophyll content determined by apogee ccm 200 opti sciences inc hudson nh usa brix determined by refractometer glucose fructose sucrose and bioethanol determined by hplc schimadzu 20 at tokyo japan turhan et al 2010 were measured by randomly selecting and measuring 25 plants in each experimental plot the analysis of variance anova for data was done using spss statistical software to evaluate the effects of different irrigation levels on the yield and yield components of sorghum and the duncan s multiple range tests was used to compare the averages gomez and gomez 1984 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water storage soil water storage values during 2017 and 2018 growing periods for each treatment are given in fig 2 different irrigation water applications were started on june 10 2017 and 2018 in the first and second years of the study totally 18 and 16 irrigations were performed on surface and subsurface according to soil moisture content respectively in the first year of the study the soil moisture storage was between the field capacity and wilting point in all of the irrigation subjects except the rainfed treatments i0 whereas in the second year of the study it was both the rainfed treatment i0 and the treatment with 75 reduction in irrigation water i25 below the wilting point as shown in fig 2 the soil moisture storage decreased below the wilting point from the first week of july in both years on i0 and in i25 where the least irrigation water was applied the soil moisture storage decreased below the wilting point from the first week of august in the second year of the study for surface and subsurface drip irrigation methods soil water storage in sdi50 sdi25 sdi0 ssdi50 ssdi25 and ssdi0 treatment plots remained above 50 of available from first week of july in the first year and from second year of the study on the other hand soil water storage in deficit irrigation treatments sdi75 ssdi75 remained below the 50 of available water during most of the growing seasons it is reported that sorghum is a drought tolerant crop it is often preferred by producers in cases of expected water stress during the total growing period assefa et al 2010 however sorghum is highly sensitive to water stress during the flowering stage a stress at this stage reduced final biomass 52 number of seeds per panicle 58 and grain yield 61 in sorghum matthews et al 1990 immediately after an irrigation event a rapid increase in soil water storage was observed and thereafter a gradual decrease was a result of the redistribution of water in the soil the absorption of water by the plant in sdi and ssdi methods and the loss of water from the soil by evaporation in sdi method van donk et al 2013 ma et al 2020 it can be concluded that the ssdi method is more suitable than the sdi method as it prevents water losses by evaporation and provides better soil moisture distribution near the active sorghum roots 3 2 water use water productivity and irrigation water productivity hay and bioethanol yield amount of i et wp iwp hay and bioethanol yield data were given in table 4 a total of 30 5 and 35 mm of water was applied equally to all treatments in 2017 and 2018 for germination respectively the first irrigation treatment was carried out on june 19 2017 and 2018 and the final application was done on september 1 2017 and 2018 the amount of water applied to treatments in sdi methods ranged between 30 5 468 2 mm in first year and ranged between 35 0 398 8 mm in second year of experiment for ssdi method the amount of water ranged between 30 5 429 0 mm in first year and 35 0 391 7 mm in second year evapotranspiration et varied from 206 0 to 553 6 mm for sdi and 206 0 to 526 4 mm for ssdi in first year and 198 5 to 501 9 mm for sdi and 199 2 to 480 8 mm for ssdi in second year when the sdi and ssdi methods are compared it is noteworthy that a water saving of 27 2 mm in 2017 and 21 1 mm in 2018 has been achieved in terms of full irrigation i100 level sorghum et were reported to vary from 200 0 to 683 0 mm mastrorilli et al 1995b dercas et al 2001 sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2007 lamm et al 2010 klocke et al 2012 hao et al 2014 yimam et al 2015 mengistu et al 2016 wagle et al 2016 el awady et al 2003 stated that evaporation decreased with increasing drip line depth and evapotranspiration from drip irrigation could be reduce up to 40 when the drip line is buried at a depth of 15 cm compared with surface drip line sorghum growth increased by 69 by weight under subsurface drip compared with surface drip abd el mageed et al 2018 determined that evapotranspiration as 671 570 and 496 mm under stress free 100 etc moderate stress 85 etc and severe stress 75 etc respectively evapotranspiration obtained from the research with a two year average of 202 6 503 6 mm for ssdi and 202 3 527 8 mm for sdi is in agreement with the published findings sorghum hay yield varied from 7 44 t ha 1 to 20 52 t ha 1 for sdi and 9 96 t ha 1 to 23 67 t ha 1 for ssdi in 2017 and 7 85 t ha 1 to 21 07 t ha 1 for sdi and 11 97 t ha 1 to 26 48 t ha 1 for ssdi in 2018 table 4 reduction in the quantity of irrigation water resulted in a relatively lower yield the highest yield was obtained from i100 treatment in ssdi and the lowest yield was obtained from i0 treatment with no irrigation in sdi compared to ssdi100 treatment reductions in the yield were determined as 11 0 13 4 32 6 36 4 43 6 49 9 58 2 61 4 and 68 6 for ssdi75 sdi100 ssdi50 sdi50 ssdi25 ssdi0 sdi25 and sdi0 treatments respectively in first year and determined as 16 7 20 5 29 4 35 4 40 8 41 4 54 8 60 1 and 70 4 for ssdi75 sdi100 ssdi50 sdi50 ssdi25 ssdi0 sdi25 and sdi0 treatments respectively in second year of experiment singh and singh 1995 found that sorghum hay yield decreased by 54 under water stress conditions while silva et al 2016 reported a reduction of 56 sorghum hay yield varied from 5 to 41 t ha 1 sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2007 cotton et al 2013 papanikolaou and sakellariou makrantonaki 2013 campi et al 2014 the reason that the hay yield is increased by ssdi compared with sdi could be explained by the fact that irrigation water saved from evaporation was used by plants more beneficially evett et al 2005 the emergence of more positive conditions that use soil moisture effectively in a limited wetting zone badr et al 2010 and greater irrigation water use from a possible wetted root zone with the reduction of evaporation losses in the ssdi method umair et al 2019 bioethanol yield changed between 903 2085 l ha 1 in the first year of the study table 4 depending on the irrigation levels the highest bioethanol yield was obtained as 2085 l ha 1 from ssdi100 while the lowest average bioethanol yield was 903 l ha 1 from sdi0 in the second year of the study bioethanol yield values ranged from 1493 2390 l ha 1 depending on the irrigation levels the highest bioethanol yield was obtained from ssdi100 with 2390 l ha 1 while the lowest average bioethanol yield was 1407 l ha 1 in sdi0 farrell et al 2006 and yan and lin 2009 stated that bioethanol was one of the high potential alternative fuel energy sources since it was clean renewable carbon neutral and environmentally friendly smith and buxton 1993 reported that total sugar and bioethanol yields were similar in both full irrigation and rainfed conditions although bioethanol yield increased with irrigation sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2007 determined that bioethanol yield in subsurface drip irrigation surface drip irrigation and rainfed conditions as 9150 8390 and 670 l ha 1 respectively bioethanol yield of sorghum were reported to vary from 1473 to 7620 l ha 1 depending on full and deficit irrigation conditions smith and frederiksen 2000 wittenberg 2007 miller and ottman 2010 vasilakoglou et al 2011 zegada lizarazu and monti 2012 mengistu et al 2016 cotton et al 2013 liu et al 2013 and pang et al 2018 argued that water stress had a negative effect on bioethanol yield additionally they concluded that irrigation capacity had a positive impact on bioethanol yield camp 1998 concluded that yields for ssdi method were equal to or better than sdi methods in all cases including different crops soils and cropping conditions water and nutrients are used more efficiently and yields and product quality are often significantly improved the wp varied from 2 9 to 4 8 kg m 3 and 3 8 to 6 0 kg m 3 in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 4 mastrorilli et al 1995a stated that wp varies depending on the climate growing characteristics and physiological characteristics of the sorghum varieties while vasilakoglou et al 2011 stated that sorghum has higher wp in wet and dry growing conditions compared to other summer field crops curt et al 1995 mastrorilli et al 1995b steduto and albrizio 2005 saeed and el nadi 1998 steduto et al 1997 samui et al 2008 garofalo and rinaldi 2013 campi et al 2014 and mengistu et al 2016 determined that wp of sorghum as 5 4 5 2 5 0 7 6 5 2 5 0 6 3 6 8 and 6 2 kg m 3 respectively steduto and albrizio 2005 found wp equal to 5 7 kg m 3 with 510 mm of irrigation water in southern italy sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2007 determined wp values of 5 3 kg m 3 for subsurface drip irrigated and 4 2 kg m 3 for surface irrigated sweet sorghum in central greece abd el mageed et al 2018 determined the wp of the sorghum grown under non stress 100 etc moderate stress 85 etc and severe stress 75 etc conditions as 6 4 7 3 and 7 9 kg m 3 respectively in egypt additionally hassanli et al 2009 argued that iwp was not affected only by irrigation levels but also affected significantly by irrigation methods ssdi sdi results of this study are in agreement with the above mentioned studies 3 3 water yield relationship and yield response factor ky the relationship between evapotranspiration and hay yield was evaluated for each drip irrigation methods fig 3 there were significant linear relationships between evapotranspiration and hay yield for sdi and ssdi methods in the experimental years fig 3a b similar relationships between yield and evapotranspiration for sorghum was established in other studies stone and schlegel 2006 moberly et al 2017 schlegel et al 2017 yield response factor ky is an important parameter in planning irrigation applications and ky is an indicator of the effect of water deficiency on plant yield yield response factor ky values determined for sorghum as 0 77 and 0 91 for sdi and ssdi in the first year of the study and 0 82 and 0 88 for sdi and ssdi in the second year of the study respectively fig 4 average of ky value was computed as 0 80 for sdi and 0 90 for ssdi yield response factor is a measure of the degree of water deficiency effects during plant growing period on yield yield response factor is less than 1 ky 1 shows that crop is more tolerant to water deficit and recovers partially from stress exhibiting less than proportional reductions in yield with reduced water use fao 2012 reported the yield response factor as 0 90 for sorghum on the other hand manyathi 2014 and farhan and salih 2015 determined the yield response factor as 1 20 and 1 21 for sorghum respectively the reason for various ky values in the literature can be explain different region varieties soil conditions irrigation method and the amount of irrigation water applied the ky calculated for sorghum in this study indicates that this crop once under deficit irrigation conditions performs better than some other hay crops such as alfalfa and maize therefore when irrigation water is limited sorghum can be a good forage and energy alternative to less drought resistant crops 3 4 yield components the effects of the different treatments applied in this study were statistically significant on the yield components such as plant height leaf number leaf area index and chlorophyll content table 5 according to table 5 deficit irrigation treatments showed significant difference p 0 01 for plant height when the sdi and ssdi methods were evaluated in the first and second years the plant height was found statistically significant at the level of 1 error while in the first year of the study plant height changed between 199 3 and 315 7 cm in the second year it ranged from 207 0 to 325 7 cm depending on the irrigation levels the highest average plant length was obtained from the full irrigation level of the ssdi method with 315 7 cm in the first year while the lowest plant length was obtained from the rainfed treatments with 199 3 cm in sdi plant height is a good indicator used to determine the effect of water stress on the plant and it is among the most important parameters affecting the yield it was observed that as the irrigation level decreased plant height values also decreased qu et al 2014 reported that plant height was the most important factor affecting the dry matter yield in sorghum almodares et al 2013 stated that plant height was directly related to water stress and plant height decreases as irrigation water decreases the researchers calculated the plant height of keller and sofa sorghum varieties as 345 and 270 cm in irrigation intervals of 7 10 14 and 21 days on the other hand sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2006 reported plant height as 450 425 and 235 cm in ssdi sdi and rainfed conditions in greece respectively while mahinda 2014 determined plant height as 138 0 cm and 36 6 cm in full irrigation and rainfed treatments under tanzanian conditions abd el mageed et al 2018 gave the plant height as 165 156 and 138 cm respectively in their studies where 100 85 and 75 of crop water requirements were met as seen there are differences in studies regarding the effects of irrigation methods and levels on plant height singh and rajput 2007 argued that soil moisture content under ssdi was uniform as compared to sdi douh and boujelben 2010 compared sdi and ssdi and determined that irrigation methods had highly significant effect on plant height irrigation water shortage had a significant effect on leaf number as the applied irrigation amount decreased the leaf number also decreased table 5 the number of leaves in the first and second year of the study varied between 9 3 11 0 and 9 3 12 3 number plant 1 respectively the highest average number of leaves in the first year was obtained from sdi100 and ssdi100 treatments with 11 0 number plant 1 while the lowest number of leaves was obtained from the sdi0 treatments with 9 3 number plant 1 the number of leaves in ssdi increased compared with sdi mahinda 2014 reported the number of leaves in sorghum varying between 8 4 11 0 while rostampour 2013 claimed that the number of leaves decreased as the irrigation amount decreased the decrease in the number of leaves can be attributed to the lack of moisture in the soil profile lower water content causes the stomata in the leaves of the plant to close and therefore the photosynthetic ability of the plant decreases and the water stress that reduces the photosynthetic efficiency decreases the plant performance sanchez et al 2002 similarly abou kheira 2009 stated that the distribution of water in the soil profile irrigated by the ssdi was uniform compared to sdi therefore it could be concluded that under ssdi the water available in root zone was enough for plant growth parameters the results indicated that treatments had a significant effect on leaf area index p 0 01 leaf area index lai decreased with increasing deficiency in irrigation water in the first year of the study lai values ranged between 9 0 15 0 the highest average lai was obtained from full irrigation with 15 0 in ssdi100 treatments while the lowest average lai was obtained from sdi0 treatments with 9 0 lai values ranged between 10 4 16 1 in the second year of the study the highest average lai was obtained from the ssdi100 treatments with 16 1 while the lowest average lai was obtained from the ssdi25 ssdi0 and sdi0 treatments with 10 4 sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2006 and mahinda 2014 expressed lai varying between 4 5 8 7 and 7 5 18 8 respectively it was observed that as water stress increased lai values decreased in the study campi et al 2014 calculated lai under water constraint conditions 35 lower than the control lai was always lower under rainfed conditions than irrigated treatments as pointed by cosentino et al 2012 garrity et al 1984 reported 14 26 reduction in photosynthesis of water stressed sorghum accounted for a decrease in leaf area sorghum leaves can become erect under water stress and roll and this will decrease the leaf surface area exposed to incoming solar radiation and consequently water loss assefa et al 2010 the presence of water in the soil as much as the need for plants can also decrease lai breda 2003 kato and kamichika 2006 reported a negative correlation between actual evaporation and lai in sorghum it was concluded that lai is increased by ssdi compared with sdi camp 1998 argued that advantages of ssdi include less interference with cultural operations and improved cultural practices reduced weed germination and their growth reduced pest and diseases warmer soils reduced exposure of irrigation equipment to damage no soil crusting due to irrigation in the study there was significant difference in chlorophyll content cc among different treatments the highest average cc was obtained from ssdi100 treatment with 51 4 while the lowest was obtained from sdi0 treatment with 5 8 in the first year of the study the highest average cc was obtained from ssdi100 treatment with 50 6 while the lowest was obtained from sdi0 treatment with 9 7 in the second year of the study it was observed that cc values decreased as water stress increased xu et al 2000 reported a 23 reduction in total cc between stressed and non stressed plants cc is sensitive to water stress kapanigowda et al 2013 and low concentrations of cc limit photosynthetic potential directly and lead to a yield decline in the plants abdulai et al 2012 therefore higher cc values could be explained by the fact that ssdi allowed uniform soil moisture minimized the evaporative loss and delivered water directly to the plant root zone which increases growth parameters camp 1998 3 5 chemical components the data related to brix glucose fructose and sucrose are depicted in figs 5 8 respectively irrigation water shortage had a significant effect on brix as the applied irrigation amount decreased the brix increased fig 5 brix content values ranged from 11 6 to 16 1 in 2017 and from 11 2 to 15 7 in 2018 the highest average brix content was obtained from ssdi0 treatment in both years as much as 16 1 and 15 7 respectively it was observed that brix content values increased as water stress increased almodares et al 1996 stated that sorghum s brix content varied between 14 3 22 8 while may et al 2012 reported that the brix values of commercial sorghum varieties ranged from 15 to 19 vasilakoglou et al 2011 calculated brix content of sorghum ranging from 10 1 to 14 4 depending on varieties tardin et al 2012 and souza et al 2014 determined brix content of sorghum as 13 6 and 17 8 while silva et al 2016 found that brix values varied between 19 47 and 23 41 sorghum brix content was affected by day length sunshine duration and radiation teixeira et al 1999 varieties almodares et al 1996 vasilakoglou et al 2011 and the amount of water volume within the plant may et al 2012 generally the highest and the lowest amount of glucose fructose and sucrose content determined in i0 and i100 irrigation levels respectively figs 6 8 various studies emphasizes the role of soluble sugars in the protection against stress the low irrigation level i0 resulted in significantly more glucose fructose and sucrose content than the high irrigation level i100 this is due to some physiological mechanism for reducing the adverse effect of water deficit stress on plant productivity ludlow and muchow 1990 adrienn and janos 2012 application of intense water stress i0 caused an increase in glucose 3 1 g l 1 for 2017 and 3 3 g l 1 for 2018 fructose 2 9 g l 1 for 2017 and 1 3 g l 1 for 2018 in i50 and sucrose 7 7 g l 1 for 2017 and 11 3 g l 1 for 2018 compared with the relatively well irrigated treatments almodares and hadi 2009 found that sucrose content varied between 6 0 16 1 for 36 sweet sorghum varieties almodares et al 2013 determined the sucrose content of sofra variety as 10 5 while the value of sucrose for the keller variety was 10 2 grassi 2004 reported the amount of glucose in sorghum juice as 1 7 curt et al 1995 reported no clear effect of the irrigation regime on the contents of glucose fructose sucrose or total sugars in sorghum on the other hand massacci et al 1996 claimed that reduced irrigation resulted in higher level of sugar components similarly subramanian 2013 concluded that sucrose increased significantly under severe stress whereas the water stress did not affect the levels of glucose and fructose it could be attributed to the fact that at the reduced soil moisture condition the plant adopts dehydration tolerance by deposition of osmolytes such as sugars terzi et al 2009 attributed increased sucrose to the plant s growth sustenance during severe water stress periods 4 conclusion the effects of irrigation water amounts on hay and bioethanol yield plant height leaf number leaf area index chlorophyll content brix fructose glucose and sucrose were statistically significant the maximum hay and bioethanol yield was obtained from ssdi100 treatments brix and sugar glucose fructose and sucrose content increased as the amount of water deficiency increased subsurface drip irrigation method under full i100 and slight i75 irrigation conditions resulted in important water savings without significant differences in sorghum hay yield among treatments an average reduction in applied irrigation water as much as 23 2 mm were obtained when irrigation was applied by ssdi method compare to sdi the result of this study suggested that in areas with scarce water resources such as mediterranean regions ssdi method together with the application of controlled deficit irrigations about 25 could be used to save water and increase the hay and bioethanol productivity of sorghum

10380,the objective of the present study was to determine the effects of different irrigation levels applied with surface drip irrigation sdi and subsurface drip irrigation ssdi method on yield and bioethanol productivity of sorghum sorghum bicolor l cv early sumac in the west mediterranean region of turkey field study was conducted in batı akdeniz agricultural research institute in antalya during the growing seasons of 2017 2018 five different irrigation levels designated as full irrigation i100 with no water stress and slight i75 mild i50 severe water stress i25 and no irrigation i0 treatments were applied the results showed that different irrigation levels applied had statistically significant effect on yield and yield components such as plant height leaf number leaf area index chlorophyll context brix sucrose glucose fructose and bioethanol in both of the drip irrigation methods water deficit stress significantly p 0 01 decreased bioethanol yield the maximum bioethanol yield was obtained from ssdi method under full irrigation slight mild severe and full water deficit stress as much as 2085 2045 1684 1569 and 1407 l ha 1 respectively in 2017 and 2390 2266 1954 1901 and 1493 l ha 1 respectively in 2018 the highest water consumption was observed in i100 treatment as 553 6 mm for sdi in 2017 while the lowest was found in i0 treatment as 198 5 mm for sdi in 2018 the highest water productivity was found in i0 as 6 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 for ssdi method in 2018 and the lowest one was found in i25 as 2 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 for sdi in 2017 the results of the present study showed that an average water saving of 24 0 mm compared with the sdi method was achieved without any decrease in efficiency in the ssdi method keywords sorghum subsurface drip irrigation water deficit yield bioethanol 1 introduction rapid population growth in the world rapid pollution of existing natural resources global warming and climate change are increasing the pressure on water resources given the global warming and consequently the irregularity of rainfall regimes as well as the increasing competition on water resources it is recognized that the water allocated for agriculture has to be reduced gradually in order to provide maximum benefit from irrigation to use freshwater resources efficiently and economically it is necessary to use surface and subsurface drip irrigation methods that save water and energy minimize water losses and evaporation do not pollute the environment and increase the amount of yield and quality it is obvious that the worldwide decrease in water resources and the drought combined with high temperature will negatively affect the production and quality of sorghum the aegean and mediterranean regions where rainfall is irregular especially during growing periods will be more affected by this negativity although human beings started to use alternative energy sources centuries ago it is seen that these resources have changed shape and name with technological developments sources used for heating and cooking for centuries have taken the name of biomass in today s world and have been subject to different classifications even in itself in the last 20 years rapidly increasing biomass resources and their use due to increasing technological developments and energy requirements have caused attention to these resources among the modern biomass sources energy crops come first one of the mentioned energy plants the sorghum plant of the poacea family belongs to the andropogonae team wild and cultivated species bicolor l is located under moench formerly vulgare chopra 1982 sorghum animal feed is considered as one of the rare plants that can produce sugar and biofuel as well as consumption in human nutrition sorghum is known as the most suitable plant in ethanol sources high sugar content receiving a large amount of product per unit area and with a large planting area and features such as adaptability to different soils in europe and turkey in terms of economic production kaplan et al 2009 zega lizarazu and monti 2012 sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench is a c4 crop grown mainly for food and fodder fiber and fuel anami et al 2015 almodares et al 2007 assefa et al 2010 promkhambut et al 2010 and fracassoa et al 2016 argued that sorghum is tolerant of high temperature and drought conditions salinity and water logging respectively sorghum has a shorter growing period and lower water consumption compared to other field crops additionally sorghum is also an important source of bio energy in the world almodares and hadi 2009 the annual production is approximately 59 million tons from a harvest area of 42 million ha in the world fao 2018 total planting area and production of sorghum in turkey was about 136 ha and 361 ton in 2016 respectively sorghum production is carried out mostly in mediterranean and southeastern anatolia regions of turkey future weather projections for the south of turkey are for generally warmer and drier conditions long term average annual precipitation in the mediterranean and southeastern anatolia region is about 1100 mm and 752 mm and falling more than 98 of it from october to may therefore irrigation is needed at sorghum growing season to maintain and enhance crop growth and yield water deficit is a critical issue limiting sorghum growth by having impact on anatomical morphological physiological and biochemical processes assefa et al 2010 various studies have been reported for sorghum irrigation in the world brown et al 1964 and stewart et al 1983 determined the water consumption of sorghum by using furrow irrigation method while curt et al 1995 studied the water yield relationship of sorghum under lysimeter conditions dercas et al 1995 and mastrorilli et al 1995a investigated the effects of irrigation on the yield and quality characteristics of the sorghum according to the development periods flowering grain growth and ripening ghassemi et al 1997 found that water stress applied during the growing period did not have a statistically significant effect on seed quality as it reduced yield saeed and el nadi found that maximum dry matter dm yields were 16 3 11 8 and 10 5 t ha 1 for frequent intermediate and infrequent irrigation regimes mastrorilli et al 1999 reported that the effect of temporary water stress on yield depended on the phenological stage and determined that an early stress provoked an alteration of the water productivity which diminished by about 20 dercas and liakatas 2007 conducted two year field experiment in central greece and they concluded that non water stressed sweet sorghum plants produced above ground dry biomass by the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted during the fast growing stage younesi and moradi 2009 evaluated the effects of irrigation on grain yield yield components and they determined that water limitation had significant effect on grain yield and yield components philp et al 2010 stated that fully irrigated sorghum grown in the northern region of australia has a potential yield of 10 12 t ha 1 and the crop will use from 500 mm up to 750 mm of water mastrorilli et al 2011 studied the effects of two irrigation treatments 100 et and 50 et on two sorghum varieties biomass 133 and sucro 506 they found that the highest water productivity was obtained by irrigating 100 of crop evapotranspiration and in the event of reduced irrigation double cutting improved water productivity by 13 5 farre and faci 2006 determined the effects of sprinkler irrigation treatments on sorghum and they found that water productivity ranged from 1 46 to 0 23 g m 2 mm 1 and yield ranged from 854 to 643 g m 2 klocke 2009 examined the effects of irrigation on sorghum and determined that sorghum yields from the driest irrigation treatment produced only 0 34 t ha 1 less that the fully irrigated treatment vasilakoglou et al 2011 determined that the dry biomass juice and total sugar yields of sorghum that received 210 mm of irrigation water was 49 88 greater than the yields of sorghum that received the 120 mm of irrigation water garofalo and rinaldi 2013 investigated the effects of different irrigation water levels at 50 75 100 and 125 of etc on yield and quality of sorghum and they found that water use wu ranged between 891 and 566 mm the aboveground dry matter biomass between 4 097 and 1 825 g m 2 and water productivity between 8 49 and 4 00 kg m 3 several researches on sorghum have been carried out using the sdi and ssdi in the world sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2007 investigated the effects of different irrigation water levels 100 etm and 80 etm on sorghum in sdi and ssdi while the yield of green biomass and bioethanol in ssdi was determined as 148 2 t ha 1 and 9150 l ha 1 respectively these values were determined as 138 2 t ha 1 and 8390 l ha 1 in sdi in addition the researchers determined that for the production of 1 kg of dry biomass 189 l of irrigation water is needed for ssdi and 302 l of irrigation for sdi mygdakos et al 2009 determined the effects of sorghum irrigated by the sdi and ssdi and found that higher biomass production gross revenue and gross margin along with lower production cost were achieved when the ssdi 42 98 t ha 1 342 e ha 1 when the studies carried out in the last 20 years were examined it was seen that the studies carried out in sorghum focus on the relationship between irrigation and bioenergy almodares and hadi 2009 stated that sorghum plant may be an alternative to corn plant in bioethanol production in areas where water is limited while the potential for use of sorghum as an energy plant is constantly emphasized steduto et al 1997 research is required on production techniques under limited irrigation conditions vasilakoglou et al 2011 although the mediterranean basin of europe is very suitable for sorghum cultivation in terms of climatic conditions the scarcity of water resources limits the agriculture of the plant in question therefore developing suitable irrigation strategies by researching biomass yield under limited irrigation conditions is very important for the mediterranean basin various researches about sorghum have been conducted in turkey when these studies were examined it was observed that they are concentrated mostly on adaptation in sorghum duysal 1991 seed

akdeniz agricultural research institute batem located at a latitude of 36 56 n and a longitude of 30 53 e and an altitude of 28 m in antalya turkey in 2017 and 2018 the study area was located in a semi arid climate and the climate of the region is typically mediterranean i e mild and rainy in winter and dry and hot in summer the climatic variables for experimental years and long term means for may october are given in table 1 the rainfall received during the growing period in the first and second experimental years were 59 8 and 58 0 mm respectively 2 2 soil and irrigation water characteristics the soil of the research area is loam in texture unsalted and rich in calcium carbonate some physical and chemical properties of field soil and irrigation water are given in tables 2

results and all of the plots received the same amount of total fertilizer the recommended dose of 75 kg ha 1 pure n p and k 15 15 15 composite before sowing and additional nitrogen dose of 115 kg ha 1 was applied as ammonium nitrate which is 50 of total nitrogen when the plants were 0 2 0 4 m high the sorghum seeds were planted on may 10 2017 and may 11 2018 with 0 45 0 05 m spacing 2 4 irrigation method and experimental design surface drip irrigation sdi and subsurface drip irrigation ssdi method were used for irrigating of experimental plots one polyethylene pe drip line with 16 mm diameter was laid along the plant row and in line drippers with a discharge of 2 l h 1 at 100 k pa pressure were inserted along the pipe at 0 25 m spacing drip lines were placed between the crop rows in the experimental plots which had 6 drip laterals laterals in the ssdi method were placed 40 cm below the soil surface the amount of irrigation water was controlled by means of a water counter on the main pipeline and valves located on each experimental plot the experimental plots having 5 4 m wide and 40 0 m long consisted of 12 plants rows fig 1 spaces between plots were 1 5 m and spaces between blocks were 2 0 m the experiment was performed as a randomized complete block design rcbd with two irrigation method as the main treatments based on different drip irrigation methods sdi and ssdi and 5 irrigation water levels i100 full irrigation with no water stress i75 slight water stress i50 mild water stress i25 severe water stress and i0 no irrigation treatment as the sub treatments with 3 replications the amount of water applied in full irrigation treatment i100 was calculated as the amount of water necessary to replenish to the field capacity in the upper 90 cm soil profile depth the quantity of irrigation water applied to the other treatments was decreased stepwise as 0 25 50 and 75 of water applied to the treatment i100 when 40 of the amount of available soil moisture in the upper 0 90 m soil depth in full irrigation treatment i100 was consumed the plants were irrigated soil moisture sensors drill drop probe sentek stepney south australia were installed 10 cm away from

to evaluate the effects of different irrigation levels on the yield and yield components of sorghum and the duncan s multiple range tests was used to compare the averages gomez and gomez 1984 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water storage soil water storage values during 2017 and 2018 growing periods for each treatment are given in fig 2 different irrigation water applications were started on june 10 2017 and 2018 in the first and second years of the study totally 18 and 16 irrigations were performed on surface and subsurface according to soil moisture content respectively in the first year of the study the soil moisture storage was between the field capacity and wilting point in all of the irrigation subjects except the rainfed treatments i0 whereas in the second year of the study it was both the rainfed treatment i0 and the treatment with 75 reduction in irrigation water i25 below the wilting point as shown in fig 2 the soil moisture storage decreased below the wilting point from the first week of july in both years on i0 and in i25 where the least irrigation water was applied the soil moisture storage decreased below the wilting point from the first week of august in the second year of the study for surface and subsurface drip irrigation methods soil water storage in sdi50 sdi25 sdi0 ssdi50 ssdi25 and ssdi0 treatment plots remained above 50 of available from first week of july in the first year and from second year of the study on the other hand soil water storage in deficit irrigation treatments sdi75 ssdi75 remained below the 50 of available water during most of the growing seasons it is reported that sorghum is a drought tolerant crop it is often preferred by producers in cases of expected water stress during the total growing period assefa et al 2010 however sorghum is highly sensitive to water stress during the flowering stage a stress at this stage reduced final biomass 52 number of seeds per panicle 58 and grain yield 61 in sorghum matthews et al 1990 immediately after an irrigation event a rapid increase in soil water storage was observed and thereafter a gradual decrease was a result of the redistribution of water in the soil the absorption of water by the plant in sdi and ssdi methods and the loss of water from the soil by evaporation in sdi method van donk et al 2013 ma et al 2020 it can be concluded that the ssdi method is more suitable than the sdi method as it prevents water losses by evaporation and provides better soil moisture distribution near the active sorghum roots 3 2 water use water productivity and irrigation water productivity hay and bioethanol yield amount of i et wp iwp hay and bioethanol yield data were given in table 4 a total of 30 5 and 35 mm of water was applied equally to all treatments in 2017 and 2018 for germination respectively the first irrigation treatment was carried out on june 19 2017 and 2018 and the final application was done on september 1 2017 and 2018 the amount of water applied to treatments in sdi methods ranged between 30 5 468 2 mm in first year and ranged between 35 0 398 8 mm in second year of experiment for ssdi method the amount of water ranged between 30 5 429 0 mm in first year and 35 0 391 7 mm in second year evapotranspiration et varied from 206 0 to 553 6 mm for sdi and 206 0 to 526 4 mm for ssdi in first year and 198 5 to 501 9 mm for sdi and 199 2 to 480 8 mm for ssdi in second year when the sdi and ssdi methods are compared it is noteworthy that a water saving of 27 2 mm in 2017 and 21 1 mm in 2018 has been achieved in terms of full irrigation i100 level sorghum et were reported to vary from 200 0 to 683 0 mm mastrorilli et al 1995b dercas et al 2001 sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2007 lamm et al 2010 klocke et al 2012 hao et al 2014 yimam et al 2015 mengistu et al 2016 wagle et al 2016 el awady et al 2003 stated that evaporation decreased with increasing drip line depth and evapotranspiration from drip irrigation could be reduce up to 40 when the drip line is buried at a depth of 15 cm compared with surface drip line sorghum growth increased by 69 by weight under subsurface drip compared with surface drip abd el mageed et al 2018 determined that evapotranspiration as 671 570 and 496 mm under stress free 100 etc moderate stress 85 etc and severe stress 75 etc respectively evapotranspiration obtained from the research with a two year average of 202 6 503 6 mm for ssdi and 202 3 527 8 mm for sdi is in agreement with the published findings sorghum hay yield varied from 7 44 t ha 1 to 20 52 t ha 1 for sdi and 9 96 t ha 1 to 23 67 t ha 1 for ssdi in 2017 and 7 85 t ha 1 to 21 07 t ha 1 for sdi and 11 97 t ha 1 to 26 48 t ha 1 for ssdi in 2018 table 4 reduction in the quantity of irrigation water resulted in a relatively lower yield the highest yield was obtained from i100 treatment in ssdi and the lowest yield was obtained from i0 treatment with no irrigation in sdi compared to ssdi100 treatment reductions in the yield were determined as 11 0 13 4 32 6 36 4 43 6 49 9 58 2 61 4 and 68 6 for ssdi75 sdi100 ssdi50 sdi50 ssdi25 ssdi0 sdi25 and sdi0 treatments respectively in first year and determined as 16 7 20 5 29 4 35 4 40 8 41 4 54 8 60 1 and 70 4 for ssdi75 sdi100 ssdi50 sdi50 ssdi25 ssdi0 sdi25 and sdi0 treatments respectively in second year of experiment singh and singh 1995 found that sorghum hay yield decreased by 54 under water stress conditions while silva et al 2016 reported a reduction of 56 sorghum hay yield varied from 5 to 41 t ha 1 sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2007 cotton et al 2013 papanikolaou and sakellariou makrantonaki 2013 campi et al 2014 the reason that the hay yield is increased by ssdi compared with sdi could be explained by the fact that irrigation water saved from evaporation was used by plants more beneficially evett et al 2005 the emergence of more positive conditions that use soil moisture effectively in a limited wetting zone badr et al 2010 and greater irrigation water use from a possible wetted root zone with the reduction of evaporation losses in the ssdi method umair et al 2019 bioethanol yield changed between 903 2085 l ha 1 in the first year of the study table 4 depending on the irrigation levels the highest bioethanol yield was obtained as 2085 l ha 1 from ssdi100 while the lowest average bioethanol yield was 903 l ha 1 from sdi0 in the second year of the study bioethanol yield values ranged from 1493 2390 l ha 1 depending on the irrigation levels the highest bioethanol yield was obtained from ssdi100 with 2390 l ha 1 while the lowest average bioethanol yield was 1407 l ha 1 in sdi0 farrell et al 2006 and yan and lin 2009 stated that bioethanol was one of the high potential alternative fuel energy sources since it was clean renewable carbon neutral and environmentally friendly smith and buxton 1993 reported that total sugar and bioethanol yields were similar in both full irrigation and rainfed conditions although bioethanol yield increased with irrigation sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2007 determined that bioethanol yield in subsurface drip irrigation surface drip irrigation and rainfed conditions as 9150 8390 and 670 l ha 1 respectively bioethanol yield of sorghum were reported to vary from 1473 to 7620 l ha 1 depending on full and deficit irrigation conditions smith and frederiksen 2000 wittenberg 2007 miller and ottman 2010 vasilakoglou et al 2011 zegada lizarazu and monti 2012 mengistu et al 2016 cotton et al 2013 liu et al 2013 and pang et al 2018 argued that water stress had a negative effect on bioethanol yield additionally they concluded that irrigation capacity had a positive impact on bioethanol yield camp 1998 concluded that yields for ssdi method were equal to or better than sdi methods in all cases including different crops soils and cropping conditions water and nutrients are used more efficiently and yields and product quality are often significantly improved the wp varied from 2 9 to 4 8 kg m 3 and 3 8 to 6 0 kg m 3 in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 4 mastrorilli et al 1995a stated that wp varies depending on the climate growing characteristics and physiological characteristics of the sorghum varieties while vasilakoglou et al 2011 stated that sorghum has higher wp in wet and dry growing conditions compared to other summer field crops curt et al 1995 mastrorilli et al 1995b steduto and albrizio 2005 saeed and el nadi 1998 steduto et al 1997 samui et al 2008 garofalo and rinaldi 2013 campi et al 2014 and mengistu et al 2016 determined that wp of sorghum as 5 4 5 2 5 0 7 6 5 2 5 0 6 3 6 8 and 6 2 kg m 3 respectively steduto and albrizio 2005 found wp equal to 5 7 kg m 3 with 510 mm of irrigation water in southern italy sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2007 determined wp values of 5 3 kg m 3 for subsurface drip irrigated and 4 2 kg m 3 for surface irrigated sweet sorghum in central greece abd el mageed et al 2018 determined the wp of the sorghum grown under non stress 100 etc moderate stress 85 etc and severe stress 75 etc conditions as 6 4 7 3 and 7 9 kg m 3 respectively in egypt additionally hassanli et al 2009 argued that iwp was not affected only by irrigation levels but also affected significantly by irrigation methods ssdi sdi results of this study are in agreement with the above mentioned studies 3 3 water yield relationship and yield response factor ky the relationship between evapotranspiration and hay yield was evaluated for each drip irrigation methods fig 3 there were significant linear relationships between evapotranspiration and hay yield for sdi and ssdi methods in the experimental years fig 3a b similar relationships between yield and evapotranspiration for sorghum was established in other studies stone and schlegel 2006 moberly et al 2017 schlegel et al 2017 yield response factor ky is an important parameter in planning irrigation applications and ky is an indicator of the effect of water deficiency on plant yield yield response factor ky values determined for sorghum as 0 77 and 0 91 for sdi and ssdi in the first year of the study and 0 82 and 0 88 for sdi and ssdi in the second year of the study respectively fig 4 average of ky value was computed as 0 80 for sdi and 0 90 for ssdi yield response factor is a measure of the degree of water deficiency effects during plant growing period on yield yield response factor is less than 1 ky 1 shows that crop is more tolerant to water deficit and recovers partially from stress exhibiting less than proportional reductions in yield with reduced water use fao 2012 reported the yield response factor as 0 90 for sorghum on the other hand manyathi 2014 and farhan and salih 2015 determined the yield response factor as 1 20 and 1 21 for sorghum respectively the reason for various ky values in the literature can be explain different region varieties soil conditions irrigation method and the amount of irrigation water applied the ky calculated for sorghum in this study indicates that this crop once under deficit irrigation conditions performs better than some other hay crops such as alfalfa and maize therefore when irrigation water is limited sorghum can be a good forage and energy alternative to less drought resistant crops 3 4 yield components the effects of the different treatments applied in this study were statistically significant on the yield components such as plant height leaf number leaf area index and chlorophyll content table 5 according to table 5 deficit irrigation treatments showed significant difference p 0 01 for plant height when the sdi and ssdi methods were evaluated in the first and second years the plant height was found statistically significant at the level of 1 error while in the first year of the study plant height changed between 199 3 and 315 7 cm in the second year it ranged from 207 0 to 325 7 cm depending on the irrigation levels the highest average plant length was obtained from the full irrigation level of the ssdi method with 315 7 cm in the first year while the lowest plant length was obtained from the rainfed treatments with 199 3 cm in sdi plant height is a good indicator used to determine the effect of water stress on the plant and it is among the most important parameters affecting the yield it was observed that as the irrigation level decreased plant height values also decreased qu et al 2014 reported that plant height was the most important factor affecting the dry matter yield in sorghum almodares et al 2013 stated that plant height was directly related to water stress and plant height decreases as irrigation water decreases the researchers calculated the plant height of keller and sofa sorghum varieties as 345 and 270 cm in irrigation intervals of 7 10 14 and 21 days on the other hand sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2006 reported plant height as 450 425 and 235 cm in ssdi sdi and rainfed conditions in greece respectively while mahinda 2014 determined plant height as 138 0 cm and 36 6 cm in full irrigation and rainfed treatments under tanzanian conditions abd el mageed et al 2018 gave the plant height as 165 156 and 138 cm respectively in their studies where 100 85 and 75 of crop water requirements were met as seen there are differences in studies regarding the effects of irrigation methods and levels on plant height singh and rajput 2007 argued that soil moisture content under ssdi was uniform as compared to sdi douh and boujelben 2010 compared sdi and ssdi and determined that irrigation methods had highly significant effect on plant height irrigation water shortage had a significant effect on leaf number as the applied irrigation amount decreased the leaf number also decreased table 5 the number of leaves in the first and second year of the study varied between 9 3 11 0 and 9 3 12 3 number plant 1 respectively the highest average number of leaves in the first year was obtained from sdi100 and ssdi100 treatments with 11 0 number plant 1 while the lowest number of leaves was obtained from the sdi0 treatments with 9 3 number plant 1 the number of leaves in ssdi increased compared with sdi mahinda 2014 reported the number of leaves in sorghum varying between 8 4 11 0 while rostampour 2013 claimed that the number of leaves decreased as the irrigation amount decreased the decrease in the number of leaves can be attributed to the lack of moisture in the soil profile lower water content causes the stomata in the leaves of the plant to close and therefore the photosynthetic ability of the plant decreases and the water stress that reduces the photosynthetic efficiency decreases the plant performance sanchez et al 2002 similarly abou kheira 2009 stated that the distribution of water in the soil profile irrigated by the ssdi was uniform compared to sdi therefore it could be concluded that under ssdi the water available in root zone was enough for plant growth parameters the results indicated that treatments had a significant effect on leaf area index p 0 01 leaf area index lai decreased with increasing deficiency in irrigation water in the first year of the study lai values ranged between 9 0 15 0 the highest average lai was obtained from full irrigation with 15 0 in ssdi100 treatments while the lowest average lai was obtained from sdi0 treatments with 9 0 lai values ranged between 10 4 16 1 in the second year of the study the highest average lai was obtained from the ssdi100 treatments with 16 1 while the lowest average lai was obtained from the ssdi25 ssdi0 and sdi0 treatments with 10 4 sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2006 and mahinda 2014 expressed lai varying between 4 5 8 7 and 7 5 18 8 respectively it was observed that as water stress increased lai values decreased in the study campi et al 2014 calculated lai under water constraint conditions 35 lower than the control lai was always lower under rainfed conditions than irrigated treatments as pointed by cosentino et al 2012 garrity et al 1984 reported 14 26 reduction in photosynthesis of water stressed sorghum accounted for a decrease in leaf area sorghum leaves can become erect under water stress and roll and this will decrease the leaf surface area exposed to incoming solar radiation and consequently water loss assefa et al 2010 the presence of water in the soil as much as the need for plants can also decrease lai breda 2003 kato and kamichika 2006 reported a negative correlation between actual evaporation and lai in sorghum it was concluded that lai is increased by ssdi compared with sdi camp 1998 argued that advantages of ssdi include less interference with cultural operations and improved cultural practices reduced weed germination and their growth reduced pest and diseases warmer soils reduced exposure of irrigation equipment to damage no soil crusting due to irrigation in the study there was significant difference in chlorophyll content cc among different treatments the highest average cc was obtained from ssdi100 treatment with 51 4 while the lowest was obtained from sdi0 treatment with 5 8 in the first year of the study the highest average cc was obtained from ssdi100 treatment with 50 6 while the lowest was obtained from sdi0 treatment with 9 7 in the second year of the study it was observed that cc values decreased as water stress increased xu et al 2000 reported a 23 reduction in total cc between stressed and non stressed plants cc is sensitive to water stress kapanigowda et al 2013 and low concentrations of cc limit photosynthetic potential directly and lead to a yield decline in the plants abdulai et al 2012 therefore higher cc values could be explained by the fact that ssdi allowed uniform soil moisture minimized the evaporative loss and delivered water directly to the plant root zone which increases growth parameters camp 1998 3 5 chemical components the data related to brix glucose fructose and sucrose are depicted in figs 5 8 respectively irrigation water shortage had a significant effect on brix as the applied irrigation amount decreased the brix increased fig 5 brix content values ranged from 11 6 to 16 1 in 2017 and from 11 2 to 15 7 in 2018 the highest average brix content was obtained from ssdi0 treatment in both years as much as 16 1 and 15 7 respectively it was observed that brix content values increased as water stress increased almodares et al 1996 stated that sorghum s brix content varied between 14 3 22 8 while may et al 2012 reported that the brix values of commercial sorghum varieties ranged from 15 to 19 vasilakoglou et al 2011 calculated brix content of sorghum ranging from 10 1 to 14 4 depending on varieties tardin et al 2012 and souza et al 2014 determined brix content of sorghum as 13 6 and 17 8 while silva et al 2016 found that brix values varied between 19 47 and 23 41 sorghum brix content was affected by day length sunshine duration and radiation teixeira et al 1999 varieties almodares et al 1996 vasilakoglou et al 2011 and the amount of water volume within the plant may et al 2012 generally the highest and the lowest amount of glucose fructose and sucrose content determined in i0 and i100 irrigation levels respectively figs 6 8 various studies emphasizes the role of soluble sugars in the protection against stress the low irrigation level i0 resulted in significantly more glucose fructose and sucrose content than the high irrigation level i100 this is due to some physiological mechanism for reducing the adverse effect of water deficit stress on plant productivity ludlow and muchow 1990 adrienn and janos 2012 application of intense water stress i0 caused an increase in glucose 3 1 g l 1 for 2017 and 3 3 g l 1 for 2018 fructose 2 9 g l 1 for 2017 and 1 3 g l 1 for 2018 in i50 and sucrose 7 7 g l 1 for 2017 and 11 3 g l 1 for 2018 compared with the relatively well irrigated treatments almodares and hadi 2009 found that sucrose content varied between 6 0 16 1 for 36 sweet sorghum varieties almodares et al 2013 determined the sucrose content of sofra variety as 10 5 while the value of sucrose for the keller variety was 10 2 grassi 2004 reported the amount of glucose in sorghum juice as 1 7 curt et al 1995 reported no clear effect of the irrigation regime on the contents of glucose fructose sucrose or total sugars in sorghum on the other hand massacci et al 1996 claimed that reduced irrigation resulted in higher level of sugar components similarly subramanian 2013 concluded that sucrose increased significantly under severe stress whereas the water stress did not affect the levels of glucose and fructose it could be attributed to the fact that at the reduced soil moisture condition the plant adopts dehydration tolerance by deposition of osmolytes such as sugars terzi et al 2009 attributed increased sucrose to the plant s growth sustenance during severe water stress periods 4 conclusion the effects of irrigation water amounts on hay and bioethanol yield plant height leaf number leaf area index chlorophyll content brix fructose glucose and sucrose were statistically significant the maximum hay and bioethanol yield was obtained from ssdi100 treatments brix and sugar glucose fructose and sucrose content increased as the amount of water deficiency increased subsurface drip irrigation method under full i100 and slight i75 irrigation conditions resulted in important water savings without significant differences in sorghum hay yield among treatments an average reduction in applied irrigation water as much as 23 2 mm were obtained when irrigation was applied by ssdi method compare to sdi the result of this study suggested that in areas with scarce water resources such as mediterranean regions ssdi method together with the application of controlled deficit irrigations about 25 could be used to save water and increase the hay and bioethanol productivity of sorghum

10381,cucumber cucumis sativus l is widely grown in greenhouses in china as an offseason vegetable because of its high yield and economic benefits considering that cucumber is sensitive to soil water conditions optimal irrigation scheduling may further enhance cucumber yields and water productivity in this study a 3 season experiment from january 2018 to july 2019 was conducted in a new type of commercial solar greenhouse in north china three irrigation treatments with controlled soil matric potentials smp of 10 t1 15 t2 and 20 kpa t3 were established in drip irrigation plots and the local practice of furrow irrigation was applied as the control ck the cucumber yield and economic benefit for each treatment were measured and irrigation efficiency ie irrigation water productivity wpi and total economic gross margin and net margin irrigation water productivities referring to tewpi gewpi and newpi respectively were evaluated the results show that the fresh cucumber yields of the t1 treatment were the highest and were 2 2 4 3 and 4 4 higher than those of t2 t3 and ck respectively similarly the total revenue from t1 was the highest and was 2 2 3 9 higher than those from the other three treatments however the total yields and revenue among the four treatments were not significantly p 0 05 different the amount of irrigation water used in the ck treatment was the highest and was 126 188 and 204 higher than those in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively the ies in t1 to t3 were 1 03 1 38 and were much high than the value of 0 46 in ck wpi and the three economic irrigation water productivities tewpi gewpi and newpi were the highest in t3 and close to those in t2 then followed by t1 and the lowest was found in ck after fully considering the economic benefits and water productivity an smp threshold of 15 20 kpa and a wetting depth of 20 cm is recommended for cucumber production in drip irrigated greenhouses in north china keywords soil matric potential cucumber irrigation efficiency economic irrigation water productivity greenhouse 1 introduction cucumber is a very popular vegetable worldwide the total cucumber production including gherkins in 2018 was 75 2 million tons from 1 984 million cultivated hectares as reported by faostat 2020 china is one of the main countries that produce cucumbers the total cucumber production including gherkins in china in 2018 was 56 24 million tons from 1 044 million hectares which accounted for 52 7 and 74 8 of the corresponding world totals respectively faostat 2020 the yield per unit area in china was 53 86 kg ha 1 which was 42 higher than the world average faostat 2020 because cucumber is sensitive to cold and water stress it is generally cultivated in humid warm and water sufficient conditions li et al 2017b chen et al 2019 in north china the winter is very cold therefore cucumbers cannot be cultivated in open fields during that period however greenhouses are enclosed structures and the inside environment is much more favorable for plant growth than the outside environment the air temperature inside greenhouses can be 5 15 c higher than that outside during winter in north china li et al 2017a ni et al 2019 currently many greenhouses especially solar greenhouses have been built in north china to plant offseason crops such as cucumber tomato pepper melons and leaf vegetables li et al 2012 sun et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 abdalhi et al 2016 tang et al 2020 the total greenhouse area in china has been reported as 1 96 million ha and is mostly distributed in north china especially on the north china plain which is one of the key food production regions in china statistics 2019 zhang 2020 cucumber growth and fruit production are sensitive to soil water conditions and irrigation water amounts yuan et al 2006 abdalhi et al 2016 it was reported cucumber yield is linearly correlated with irrigation amount and the highest yield is achieved with the greatest irrigation amount mao et al 2003 yuan et al 2006 şimşek et al 2005 further reported that cucumber yield was linearly related to irrigation amount however the yield decreased when irrigation amount increased from 100 to 125 pan evaporation therefore proper irrigation scheduling could further improve cucumber production and irrigation efficiency in greenhouse cultivation contreras et al 2017 climate conditions are widely used for determining irrigation amounts this method is mainly based on the crop variety growth stage and climatic evaporation potential for a specific crop the irrigation amount is estimated based on the reference crop evapotranspiration eto and the crop water requirement etc or pan evaporation for example abdalhi et al 2016 and amer et al 2009 used irrigation amounts based on etc and found that the maximum cucumber yield was achieved at 100 etc though rahil and qanadillo 2015 found that the highest yield was obtained at 70 etc it was close to the yield at 100 etc similarly hashem et al 2011 found that the highest vegetative growth and cucumber yield in a greenhouse in egypt was obtained with 100 eto irrigation pan evaporation including from class a pans and 20 cm diameter pans has also been used to determine irrigation scheduling generally the highest irrigation amount was found to in the highest cucumber yield yuan et al 2006 ayas and demirtas 2009 çakir et al 2017 plants can extract water from soil because the water potential of the soil water is higher than that of the plant roots therefore soil water potential is a good way to determine the irrigation start time and the irrigation water amount shock and wang 2011 shock et al 2013 in china crop radish tomato potato cotton maize responses to soil matric potential smp have been studied and the optimal smps for most crops range from 15 to 30 kpa as measured in the upper 20 30 cm soil layer kang and wan 2005 wang et al 2007 wan et al 2010 wang et al 2011 wan et al 2012 liu et al 2012 reported that the optimal smp for chili pepper in open fields in northeast china was 30 40 kpa wan et al 2010 reported in a saline irrigation treatment in an open field in north china that cucumber plants could be irrigated using saline water with a salt solution of 1 1 4 9 g l 1 when the smp was higher than 20 kpa however the cucumber yield decreased with increasing salt solution and generally decreased from 130 103 ton ha 1 in the first season to 40 45 ton ha 1 in the second season and 24 30 ton ha 1 in the third season because of soil salt accumulation and climate variation cucumber plants are very sensitive to soil water conditions especially in greenhouses where crop yield can be 2 3 times higher than that in open fields panwar et al 2011 smp method could be used to timely evaluate soil and plant water status and then make proper irrigation schedules however few studies have investigated the proper soil water potential for guiding irrigation scheduling for cucumber plants especially under greenhouse cultivation conditions on the north china plain the north china plain is one of the main vegetable and grain production regions in china the vegetable and grain cultivation areas account for approximately 20 and 21 of the national total respectively and correspondingly produce 30 and 24 of the national yield statistics 2019 however water resources in this region are scarce and represent approximately 3 1 of the total water resources of china statistics 2019 a large amount of groundwater on the ncp is pumped to irrigate agricultural fields to support food production which has resulted in a rapid decline in the groundwater level on the ncp by 3 9 m yr 1 zhao et al 2019 therefore using water resources rationally and improving water use efficiency and water productivity are critical for sustainable developments in agriculture as well as in economic sectors in china the objectives in this study are to investigate the irrigation amount and cucumber yield under three soil water potentials under drip irrigation and furrow irrigation evaluate the irrigation efficiency irrigation water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity and finally recommend a proper irrigation scheduling method for cucumber cultivation in greenhouses on the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the three season experiment was conducted from february 2018 to july 2019 in a commercial greenhouse in xinmi city henan province north china 34 27 3 5 n 113 31 58 5 e the climate in this region is a continental monsoon climate the annual mean air temperature is 14 7 c with the highest temperatures in july and august and the lowest in january the annual total sunshine hours are 1870 hours the average annual rainfall is 542 mm with approximately 70 distributed from july to september the greenhouse soil physical and chemical properties were measured in the laboratory excluding field capacity and bulk density which were measured in situ the soil texture is silty loam based on the american soil texture classification and is very uniform in the upper 1 m soil layer table 1 the soil bulk density is 1 36 1 42 g cm 3 and the soil field capacity is 0 352 0 385 cm3 cm 3 the soil total nitrogen organic matter content no3 n available p and available k in the upper 20 cm layer were the highest then all decreased quickly and reached a stable value in the 20 100 cm soil layer the detailed soil chemical and hydraulic characteristics are listed in tables 1 and 2 the cucumber plants cucumis sativus l boxin 201 variety in the first and second seasons and boxin 301 in the third season were planted in a commercial chinese solar greenhouse this greenhouse has an east west orientation and faces south to capture as much solar energy as possible the inside soil surface is 1 5 m lower than the outside which impedes heat exchange from the inside to the outside and keeps the inside warm especially in the winter the solar greenhouse is 12 m in width and 70 m in length inside the back wall is 6 m thick at the bottom 2 m thick at the top and approximately 6 m high inside the top of the greenhouse was covered with 0 1 mm thick polyethylene plastic film which was replaced in september to maintain high solar transmissivity there was an adjusted width vent on the top of the greenhouse for natural ventilation when the inside temperature was higher than 30 c the farmers manually pulled the vent open and the open width of the vent normally ranged from 0 5 to 1 0 m depending on the outside climate conditions 2 2 experimental treatments this experiment included three treatments based on the soil matric potential which were 10 t1 15 t2 and 20 kpa t3 under drip irrigation conditions furrow irrigation is the traditional irrigation method widely used by local farmers and it was used as a control ck in this study when the soil matric potentials reached the target value for each drip irrigation treatment irrigation began soil matric potentials of 10 15 and 20 kpa are equivalent to soil water contents of 0 323 0 303 and 0 291 cm3 cm 3 respectively calculated using in situ measured soil water retention curve θ 0 493 s 0 179 n 8 r2 0 98 where θ is volumetric soil water content and s is the suction pressure in kpa because cucumber roots are mainly distributed in the upper 20 cm soil layer see section 3 2 root distribution soil matric potential and irrigation efficiency the designed wetting soil layer was 0 20 cm and the wetting depth was 20 cm the upper limit of the soil water content is the field capacity therefore the irrigation depth i mm was calculated each time as i 200 θfc θ where θfc and θ are the field capacity and the volumetric soil water content at the corresponding target smp for each treatment the irrigation depths for the t1 t2 and t3 treatments were 9 72 13 75 and 16 25 mm respectively the real irrigation amount was measured using a flow meter deployed in the main pipe at the head of the irrigation system in the experimental period there was a slight difference between the real irrigation amount and the designed irrigation amount due to slight variations in the farmers management of the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot the irrigation management for ck was the same as that used in local practice and was managed by the greenhouse owner generally furrow irrigation started when the farmer find some water stress phenomenon in stem extension leaf color leaf appearance and fruit growth furrow irrigation stopped when water level at furrows reached approximately two third the depth of furrow this irrigation management in furrow irrigation plot is fully experientially based the irrigation water for ck was also measured using a flow meter in the main pipe the greenhouse was divided into two parts a drip irrigation plot and a furrow irrigation plot the furrow irrigation plot was located in the eastern part with a length of 20 m and the drip irrigation plot was in the western part with a length of 50 m the three drip irrigation treatments were set up in a random design with three replications for each treatment each replicated subplot included three furrows the furrow irrigation treatment had four replicated subplots each furrow was measured as 12 m in length 0 8 m in width and 0 1 0 15 m in depth at the middle point the spacing between the furrows was 0 5 m for plant management and fruit harvest two rows of cucumber seedlings were planted on the two sides of each furrow with a plant spacing of 30 cm one drip line was deployed in each plant row to provide high irrigation uniformity the discharge of the drippers was 1 38 l h when the operating pressure was 0 10 0 15 mpa the dripper spacing in the drip line was 30 cm the irrigation water was first pumped from the groundwater and then stored in a tank with a volume of 10 m3 a pressure regulator and flow meter were deployed in the main pipe to control the working pressure in the irrigation system and to measure the irrigation water amount respectively there were three sub driplines one for each treatment each subline had a venturi fertilizer system to apply fertilizer to the plants in the furrow irrigation plot the irrigation times and water amounts were based on the farmer s experience and were the same as local practice the real irrigation amount was measured using a flow meter fertilizers were always applied at the beginning of each furrow to let the fertilizers flow with the irrigation water the total fertilizers applied for the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot and furrow plot ck treatment were the same in each experimental season 2 3 agronomic practices cucumber seedlings with 2 3 leaves were transplanted and then all fields were irrigated with 60 mm water to enhance seedlings standing as normal management in this region because crops were small and transpiration rate was low the first irrigation 60 mm was assumed to enough to fulfill the crop transpiration when they grew from having 2 3 leaves at transplantation to 5 6 leaves before irrigations resume during this non irrigation period we did not found clear water stress phenomena for example leaf curling at middle day further this water management was aiming to enhance root development both horizontally and vertically a better root system could increase the resilience of cucumber crops to water stress and other unfriendly growth condition in the whole season when plants grew to 50 cm high with 5 6 leaves and flowers the treatments began and the plants were irrigated with the set irrigation scheduling during the periods of flowering fruit growth and harvest the cucumber plants were attached to wires to support vertical stem growth when the plant height reached 2 m the plant stems were bent down to approximately 1 0 m high and the leaves in the lower part of the stem were trimmed this practice maintains the plant height within 1 2 m to help fruit harvest and plant management generally there were 10 13 leaves on each stem and the leaf area index ranged from 2 0 to 2 3 the growth period for each season is listed in table 3 before transplanting the soil in the upper 30 cm layer was plowed with fertilizer the basal fertilizer application included an organic fertilizer mixture of chicken manure and wheat straw at 200 m3 ha 1 and calcium superphosphate at 1200 kg ha 1 quicklime at 1050 kg ha 1 was also spread to soil surface and mixed with the upper soil to prevent bacteria and fungus growing and further slowdown the soil acidification nitrogen was applied through the drip irrigation system in the drip irrigation plot every irrigation and manually placed into the ditch to flow to the furrows with the irrigation water every 2 3 irrigation events in the furrow irrigation plot the amount of nitrogen applied was approximately 4 5 kg ha 1 day 1 all plots including furrows and the areas between furrows were covered with black plastic film to prevent soil evaporation and grass growth during all growth periods 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 soil root distribution to investigate the root distribution transparent tubes were vertically installed before seedling transplantation in the 2018 ws season thereafter cucumber seedlings were planted approximately 5 cm horizontally away from the tubes a tube was used for one replicated subplot in both the drip and furrow irrigation treatments the tubes were made of transparent plexiglas zealquest sci tech co ltd shanghai china and were 1 m long each tube was sealed at the bottom to prevent water from entering the part of the tube protruding from the soil surface was covered with a black plastic sheet to prevent light from entering the tube during measurement images of roots were captured at every 20 cm from the soil surface using a ci 602 root growth scanning system cid bioscience inc camas wa usa the roots were scanned every month from march to june in 2018 2 4 2 soil matric potential the soil matric potential was measured in both drip and furrow irrigation plots in the drip irrigation plot one tensiometer model t50 waterstar co ltd beijing china was deployed at 20 cm depth under the drippers in each replicated subplot in each treatment therefore each treatment in the drip irrigation plot had three tensiometers and three tensiometers were also deployed in the ck treatment the soil matric potential was measured at 8 00 every day for each treatment when two of the three soil matric potentials reached their corresponding target value irrigation began 2 4 3 cucumber yield and fruit revenue in this study only the yields of commercial cucumbers were recorded by farmers in both the drip and furrow irrigated plots in each treatment in the drip irrigation plot and ck three furrows including 6 rows were selected for yield recording the mean values of the three furrows were used for data comparisons the harvest intervals were 1 3 days depending on cucumber growth the price of cucumber fruits was recorded at each sale the seasonal cucumber yield was the sum of each harvest the total revenue from cucumber fruit in each season was the sum of the revenue from each sale all measured yield and recorded revenue data were converted into their values per hectare by considering the sampling area 2 4 4 microclimate microclimatic factors including solar radiation model tbq 2 jinzhou sunshine technology co ltd china air temperature and humidity model hmp60 vaisala co finland and wind speed model ec 9s jinzhou sunshine technology co ltd china were recorded at 30 second intervals and 30 minute averages were recorded using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa both inside and outside of the greenhouse in the first season the wind speeds inside were measured with a three cup anemometer model ec 9s jinzhou sunshine technology co ltd china with this sensor the highest recorded wind velocity was zero because the inside wind velocity mostly less than 0 2 m s 1 was less than the threshold of 0 5 m s 1 according to the manufacturer therefore in the last two seasons the inside wind velocity was measured with an ultrasonic anemometer with threshold of 0 01 s m 1 and resolution of 0 01 s m 1 model atmos 22 meter group inc usa the data were sampled every 1 minute and averaged over 5 minutes as recorded using an em50 data logger dynamax inc usa the climate station outside was deployed 1 m above the top of the greenhouse and the climate station inside was placed at the middle point of the greenhouse at 2 5 m above the soil surface 2 4 5 soil temperature soil temperatures inside the greenhouse were measured using 5te sensors dynamax inc usa at 10 20 and 30 cm depth in the main root zone in the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot and ck in the furrow irrigation plot all temperature signals were recorded every 5 minutes and stored in an em50 data logger dynamax inc usa from october 18 2018 to july 31 2019 2 5 calculations 2 5 1 reference crop evapotranspiration the reference crop evapotranspiration eto outside the solar greenhouse was calculated using the fao56 penman monteith method pm method allen et al 1998 however the inside eto calculated by the pm method is usually underestimated because of the low wind speed 0 01 0 2 m s 1 which can result in high aerodynamic resistance and an eto that is too low fernández et al 2010 therefore in this study an adjusted penman monteith method was used to calculate eto in which a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 was used fernández et al 2010 fernández et al 2011 the two eto methods are described as follows allen et al 1998 fernández et al 2010 1 o u t s i d e e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 2 i n s i d e e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 628 t 273 v

on the crop species and growth stage in this study the leaf area index during the flowering and harvest periods ranged from 2 0 to 2 3 which could result in a slight variation in kc therefore the kc value was set to 1 10 based on the suggestion of allen et al 1998 and other study sun et al 2019 2 5 2 irrigation efficiency irrigation water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity irrigation efficiency ie is defined as the ratio of the irrigation water consumed by the crops to the irrigation water perry 2007 similar to the definition of water productivity perry 2007 perry 2008

differences in cucumber yields and incomes among treatments were tested using the ibm spss statistics software package version 20 0 ibm corp usa at the 0 05 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 microclimate inside and outside the greenhouse fig 1 shows the monthly mean daily air temperature solar radiation wind speed relative humidity vapor pressure deficit vpd and eto inside and outside the greenhouse during the experimental period it can be found the inside climate is strongly coupled with those outside mainly because all energy inside is coming from the outside and the vent opening also enhances the exchanges of heat and mass however it should be noted that the difference in each climatic variable between inside and outside occurred and changed with month due to the plastic film covering the curves of the inside daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures were similar to those outside the annual minimum temperature occurred in december and january and the highest temperatures occurred in june and july however the inside temperatures during all experimental periods were higher than those outside especially during winter the smallest difference in mean air temperatures between the inside and outside was 1 6 2 9 c in june after which the difference increased gradually and reached 5 1 c in october and 9 2 c in november the greatest differences were found from december to february in december the inside monthly mean minimum and maximum air temperatures were 17 8 14 2 and 26 2 c respectively the corresponding temperatures were 16 9 13 4 and 24 8 c in january and 17 0 c 12 9 and 25 5 c in february the mean temperatures inside the greenhouse were higher than those outside by 15 9 16 2 and 14 8 c in december january and february respectively the inside temperature during the winter period was much more favorable to cucumber growth 20 30 c than the outside temperature heidari et al 2012 abdalhi et al 2016 hossain et al 2018 because the soil temperatures measured at the 10 20 and 30 cm depths were similar and no substantial differences were found among the treatments and irrigation methods the mean temperatures in the 0 30 cm soil layer are presented in fig 1 a the soil temperatures averaged over the 0 30 soil layer ranged from 18 8 19 0 c during the winter period from december to february and could successfully support plant growth the outside solar radiation was the highest in june and july and then decreased to lower values of 4 9 6 9 mj m 2 day 1 from november to february which were 67 lower than the highest value in june fig 1b the inside solar radiation showed a similar trend to that outside with the highest value in june and the lowest in december the transmissivity of the plastic cover ranged from 0 55 to 0 89 with a mean of 0 71 and was close to the value of 0 6 0 8 in solar greenhouses in other studies kitta et al 2012 graamans et al 2018 singh et al 2018 and of 0 6 0 7 in north china li et al 2017a ni et al 2019 the wind velocity inside was much lower than that outside the measured monthly mean wind speed outside ranged from 1 1 to 1 7 m s 1 inside it was 0 09 0 11 m s 1 with a mean of 0 10 m s 1 this low wind velocity of 0 08 0 15 m s 1 has also been reported by ni et al 2019 in a chinese solar greenhouse the inside wind velocity was much lower than and not closely related to that outside because the top cover impedes the exchange of heat and momentum between the inside and the outside liu et al 2015 the inside relative humidity rh ranged from 61 to 91 and was higher by 4 to 27 than that outside fig 1c from december to march inside rh was approximately 20 higher than that outside mainly because of plant transpiration and short period of natural ventilation however the vents were opened throughout the day from april to august to reduce heat loading inside the greenhouse which finally resulted in inside rh being close to that outside there was little difference in the vapor pressure deficit vpd inside and outside because the reduced vpd caused by the higher rh inside could offset the increased vpd from higher temperatures which resulted in a slight difference in vpd between the inside and the outside the reference crop evapotranspiration inside and outside was the highest in june and july decreased greatly and reached a minimum in the period from november to february then increased gradually fig 1d the inside eto from october to march was close to that outside and was lower than that during other periods the lowest inside eto from november to february averaged 1 0 mm day 1 which was approximately 27 of the inside maximum value 3 7 mm day 1 and 23 of the outside maximum 4 3 mm day 1 in june and july this indicates that crops grown in the greenhouse during the winter period could reduce water use by more than 70 compared to those grown in june and july similarly liu et al 2015 found that the eto inside a banana screenhouse in israel was reduced by 33 because of the screen cover inside a semicircular solar greenhouse the crop water requirements decreased by 16 20 abdalhi et al 2016 3 2 root distribution soil matric potential and irrigation efficiency the root distribution was first investigated by taking root samples using a spade from another cucumber greenhouse before this experiment we found that the roots were mainly distributed in the upper 10 cm soil layer and that the primary roots tended to extend horizontally more than vertically the root distribution in the upper 30 cm soil layer measured by a root monitor system is shown in fig 2 the measured cucumber roots in the middle growth stage may 8 2018 were mainly distributed in the upper 10 cm soil layer followed by a small portion in the 10 20 cm soil layer and roots were hardly found in the 20 30 cm soil layer there were no roots in the 30 80 cm layer therefore it is not shown in fig 2 the root distributions in both drip and furrow irrigation plots are similar indicating that the irrigation method had only a slight effect on root distribution in greenhouse cultivation conditions where the soil water content is generally high this root distribution confirmed that the wet depth of 20 cm for calculating the irrigation amount in this study is reasonable fig 3 shows the soil matric potential variations for the three treatments with drip irrigation and that in ck with furrow irrigation in the three seasons most soil matric potentials in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments were higher than the corresponding target values of 10 15 and 20 kpa indicating that the soil matric potential was well controlled however the soil matric potential varied greatly in the ck for example in the third season approximately half of irrigation applications started when the soil matric potential reached 15 kpa and one fourth started when the soil matric potential reached 10 kpa the cumulative irrigation amount for each treatment and ck is shown in fig 4 it is clear that the irrigation amount in ck was much higher than that at the three water matric potentials in the drip irrigation plot the total irrigation amount over the three seasons in the ck treatment was 2505 mm which was 1 26 1 88 and 2 04 times greater than that in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively among the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot the maximum total irrigation amount over the three seasons was 1109 mm in the t1 treatment followed by 870 mm in the t2 treatment and 825 mm the lowest in the t3 treatment the ie in the three seasons is listed in table 4 the highest mean ie over the three seasons was 1 38 in the t3 treatment followed by 1 31 in the t2 treatment and 1 03 in the t1 treatment all three ies for the three treatments were higher than 1 0 indicating that the irrigation amount was lower than the crop etc the ie in ck was 0 46 and the lowest among all treatments 3 3 crop yield and irrigation water productivity fig 5 shows the daily commercial fruit yield of each treatment in the three seasons there was great variation in the daily yield mainly because of the microclimate variation precipitation and cloudy days as well as low temperatures cause delays in cucumber growth and result in longer harvest intervals there was no great difference in the daily harvested yield among the t1 t2 and t3 treatments in all three seasons fig 5 the daily yield of the ck treatment was close to that of t1 t3 in the first and second seasons but lower in the third season the seasonal total yields for all treatments are listed in table 5 among the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot the highest yield was found in t1 followed by t2 and t3 indicating that higher soil matric potential resulted in higher yield however the differences in seasonal yield among these three treatments were small and not significant p 0 05 compared to that in t1 the yields in the t2 and t3 treatments were reduced by 2 2 and 4 3 on average respectively the seasonal yield of ck was close to that of t1 in the first and second seasons but lower by 10 3 in the third season over the three seasons the total yield of ck was close to that of t3 but lower by 4 6 and 2 3 than those of t1 and t2 respectively the lower yield of t3 compared to that of t1 may be due to the large water deficit 38 water deficit however the slightly lower yield in ck may be due to the high soil water variation caused by the long irrigation intervals fig 3 the irrigation water productivity for each treatment in the three seasons is listed in table 5 the wpi ranged from 34 2 to 83 7 kg m 3 with a mean of 56 1 kg m 3 in the drip irrigation plot however it ranged from 14 4 to 22 2 kg m 3 with a mean of 20 4 kg m 3 in ck clearly the wpi in the drip irrigation plot was 174 higher than that of ck in the furrow irrigation plot among the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot the wpi of t3 was the highest 62 1 kg m 3 followed by that of t2 60 2 kg m 3 and the lowest 48 3 kg m 3 was that of t1 the wpi generally decreased with the increasing irrigation amount the highest irrigation amount in ck had the lowest wpi and the lowest irrigation amount in t3 had the highest wpi this is mainly because of the slight difference in fruit yield among all treatments table 5 but the irrigation depth increased with the increasing smp threshold 3 4 cucumber revenue and economic irrigation water productivity the total revenue over the three seasons was the highest in t1 245 103 ha 1 followed by those in t2 239 103 ha 1 and t3 235 103 ha 1 table 6 the total revenue of ck was 236 103 ha 1 which was similar to those of t2 and t3 and 3 7 lower than that of t1 compared to the highest revenue from t1 those from t2 and t3 were 2 3 and 3 9 lower respectively this order of total revenue among the three treatments and ck was similar to that for yield and all the differences in total yield and revenue among the treatments were small 4 and not significant p 0 05 table 6 also shows the total economic irrigation water productivity tewpi gross economic irrigation water productivity gewpi and net economic irrigation water productivity newpi of each treatment in the three seasons similar to the order of wpi the highest tewpi was 28 5 m 3 in t3 followed by t2 27 5 m 3 and t1 22 1 m 3 and the lowest was 9 4 m 3 in ck additionally the mean tewpi in the drip irrigation plot was 26 0 m 3 and was 172 higher than that in ck in the furrow irrigation plot the gewpi and newpi among the treatments show the same trend as tewpi the highest was found at t3 followed by t2 and t3 and the least was at ck 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between irrigation frequency irrigation amount and irrigation efficient in general drip irrigation supplies water frequently with small amount water each time this irrigation scheduling could maintain the soil water content in optimal level with slight variation in this study the total number of irrigation events in the t1 treatment over the three seasons was 109 which was the highest followed by 60 times in t2 and 47 times in t3 there were 48 irrigation events in the ck treatment which was close to the number for t3 high irrigation frequency at a high soil matric threshold resulted in large total irrigation amount wang et al 2007 they found the total irrigation depth decreased from 153 to 45 mm when the smp threshold decreased from 15 to 45 kpa in a potato experiment in north china wang et al 2007 however low frequency irrigation like the furrow irrigation in this study will has large irrigation intervals and finally results in greater soil matric variation compared to drip irrigation fig 3 this experience based knowledge used in furrow irrigation differs with farmers crops soil texture and fertility thus the uncertain in the environmental change for crop growth may influence irrigation implementation and further enlarge the soil water variation in this study t1 treatment has the largest irrigation amount which could be due to the highest irrigation frequency 109 times over the three seasons however there was only a slight difference in the irrigation amount between the t2 and t3 treatments this means that the greater number of irrigation times in t2 could offset the smaller irrigation amount each time and result in a similar total irrigation amount as that in t3 the high irrigation depth at ck was mainly due to the irrigation amount applied each time which was based on the local farmers knowledge the average irrigation amount per event at ck was 52 2 mm which was 3 4 times higher than that 10 2 17 6 mm per event used in drip irrigation the high irrigation depth per event in the ck treatment could offset the effect of having fewer irrigation times resulting in a greater irrigation amount than that used in drip irrigation yaghi et al 2013 reported that the total irrigation depth under furrow irrigation was 672 mm in 14 irrigation events however it decreased to 289 mm with 23 irrigation events in a drip irrigation field irrigation efficiency ie is the ratio of the crop water requirement etc to the irrigation amount this index can comprehensively evaluate the whole irrigation system including the irrigation method irrigation scheduling and field management perry 2007 perry 2011 higher values indicate greater water use due to plant evapotranspiration the ies over the three seasons ranged from 1 03 to 1 38 in the drip irrigation plot indicating all irrigation amounts was used for crop evapotranspiration the ie in ck was 0 46 indicating that approximately 54 of the irrigation water could not be used by plants and was lost similarly another cucumber experiment reported that the ie was 0 56 under surface irrigation compared to 0 92 under drip irrigation yaghi et al 2013 the low ie in the ck treatment means that extra water was pumped from the groundwater which accelerates the drop in the groundwater level considering that the soil surface was fully covered by plastic film to prevent soil evaporation the lost water likely moved to a deeper soil layer the accumulated ions in the upper soil layer also move down with soil water eventually reaching the groundwater and causing pollution liu et al 2013 investigated the nitrogen distribution in wheat maize fields and greenhouses and found that the no3 n in wheat maize fields moved to a 6 3 m depth at a movement rate of 6 cm yr 1 however the no3 n in greenhouses moved to a 9 0 m depth at a rate of 15 26 cm yr 1 the no3 n depth in a greenhouse was close to the groundwater level of 11 0 m after 18 years of operation the researchers cited the high irrigation amount and nitrogen application level in greenhouses as the main reasons for the deeper no3 n distribution and faster movement rate compared to those in wheat maize fields 4 2 cucumber productions to irrigation amount and soil water potential cucumber crop is much sensitive to soil water condition and irrigation amount yuan et al 2006 abdalhi et al 2016 the highest cucumber yield in greenhouses was found when the soil water content was higher than 85 field capacity fc hossain et al 2018 li et al 2019 in this study the highest cucumber yield was found in the t1 treatment where soil water potential 10 kpa referring to 87 fc is the highest on average and the irrigation amount was close to the crop water requirement however irrigation amounts in treatments t2 and t3 were lower than crop etc and crop was greatly over irrigated in ck both reduced cucumber yield tables 4 and 5 similarly yuan et al 2006 used 20 cm pan evaporation epan to determine an irrigation schedule and found that the highest irrigation amount 1 00 epan in the spring season and 1 75 epan in the autumn season resulted in the highest cucumber yield in both experimental seasons in a rain shelter in japan mao et al 2003 also found in spring in north china that the cucumber yield increased with the irrigation amount and the highest yield of 194 ton ha 1 was achieved at the maximum irrigation amount of 726 mm abdalhi et al 2016 reported that the maximum cucumber yield in a semicircular solar greenhouse was achieved at 100 etc however 50 etc and 150 etc reduced yields by 39 and 4 respectively similarly hashem et al 2011 found in a greenhouse in egypt that the highest vegetative growth and cucumber yield were obtained with a 100 eto irrigation amount and both higher and lower irrigation amounts 120 and 80 eto respectively decreased yield amer et al 2009 also reported in a greenhouse in egypt that the highest yield of 35 6 kg ha 1 was found at full irrigation with a 1 0 etc irrigation amount and yield decreased by 27 0 and 13 8 when the irrigation amount was reduced to 0 64 etc and 0 84 etc respectively all the above studies show that the highest cucumber yield was found at full irrigation with an irrigation amount of approximately 100 etc there were great variations in the cucumber yield in the same treatment in the three seasons the main reason for this was the different growth period durations in the three seasons the fruit harvest durations in the 2018 ws 2018 aw and 2019 ws seasons were 107 83 and 185 days respectively the corresponding mean daily production was 1584 904 and 1573 kg ha 1 day 1 in the t1 treatment and 1597 933 and 1426 kg ha 1 day 1 in the ck treatment the daily yields for the same treatment were similar in the 2018 ws and 2019 ws seasons however both were approximately 40 higher than that in the 2018 aw season this was because cucumber plants in the 2018 aw season were affected by root rot disease starting at the end of october 2018 during the period from the end of october to the end of november this root rot disease was not well controlled which caused the daily cucumber yield to decrease to approximately 1000 kg ha 1 day 1 an approximately 30 reduction compared to that 1500 kg ha 1 day 1 under normal conditions in most periods in october 2018 from november 25 2018 the plants were greatly affected by root rot disease and the cucumber yield decreased quickly the last harvest was on december 7 with a yield of approximately 100 kg ha 1 day 1 therefore the mean daily yield in the 2018 aw season was much lower than that in the 2018 ws and 2019 ws seasons the seasonal cucumber production ranged from 150 to 290 ton ha 1 with a mean daily production of approximately 1500 kg ha 1 day 1 excluding that from 20018 aw because of the short growth period and the influence of root rot disease the cucumber yields found in this study are higher than the values of 37 8 ton ha 1 cultivated in an autumn season by abdalhi et al 2016 110 130 ton ha 1 grown from february to july by hossain et al 2018 45 1 57 3 ton ha 1 from february to june in palestine by rahil and qanadillo 2015 50 8 76 7 ton ha 1 from july to october in turkey şimşek et al 2005 84 3 86 1 ton ha 1 in the winter spring season and 39 6 40 5 ton ha 1 in the autumn winter season by zhang et al 2012 approximately 100 ton ha 1 in the spring and summer seasons by sun et al 2019 and 140 200 ton ha 1 in the spring season in north china by mao et al 2003 the higher yield found in this study indicates that the controlled soil matric potential from 10 to 20 kpa in this greenhouse is good for cucumber growth wan et al 2010 reported in an open field in beijing china that cucumber is very sensitive to salt in the irrigation water they found that seasonal cucumber production ranged from 103 to 129 ton ha 1 in the first season when the irrigation salt solution was 1 1 4 9 ds m 1 while it decreased to 24 45 ton ha 1 in the second and third seasons because of salt accumulation in soil even when the smp was maintained at higher than 20 kpa irrigation water productivity wpi is the fresh cucumber production per unit of irrigation water used a higher wpi indicates more production potential from the same amount of irrigation water in this study the highest wpi 62 11 kg m 3 was found at treatment t3 followed by t2 60 21 kg m 3 t1 48 28 kg m 3 and ck 20 44 kg m 3 the largest irrigation amount in ck resulted in the least wpi and the smallest irrigation amounts in t2 and t3 caused the highest wpi mainly because of the slight difference in yield production table 6 mao et al 2003 reported that the highest wpi of cucumber was 56 6 kg m 3 which was found with the lowest irrigation amount however the lowest wpi was 26 7 kg m 3 when the yield and irrigation amount were the highest similarly çakir et al 2017 also reported that the highest wpi 56 kg m 3 was found with the lowest irrigation amount 0 75 times pan evaporation these conclusions are close to our results however ayas and demirtas 2009 reported that the highest wpi was 31 9 kg m 3 for the highest irrigation amount in an unheated greenhouse in turkey the highest cucumber yield in the t1 treatment was 4 6 higher than that in the ck treatment however the difference was not significant p 0 05 this means that drip irrigation with well controlled soil water conditions does not greatly improve cucumber yield compared to local practices similarly hossain et al 2018 studied the response of cucumber yield to irrigation water and nitrogen amount in a drip irrigated greenhouse in north china and reported that the highest cucumber yield was found with the highest irrigation amount when the soil water was at higher than 85 field capacity and was only 0 5 higher than that under local practices with full irrigation however the irrigation amount in the 85 fc treatment was 22 lower than that used in local practices rahil and qanadillo 2015 reported that the highest cucumber yield in greenhouse cultivation in palestine was found at 70 etc the yield was 6 2 higher than that under traditional furrow irrigation but reduced the irrigation amount by 36 lv et al 2019 further found in north china that drip irrigation did not obviously increase tomato yield in a four season greenhouse experiment however the irrigation amount 360 380 mm used in drip irrigation was lower than that used in traditional furrow irrigation 620 660 mm sun et al 2013 reported a similar result that drip irrigation with an optimal irrigation amount did not increase the tomato yield in a greenhouse but reduced the irrigation amount by 50 and the nitrogen application amount by 80 therefore drip irrigation with an optimal irrigation amount in greenhouse cultivation does not obviously increase crop yield compared to that under traditional practices in north china however drop irrigation can reduce the irrigation amount by approximately 50 and increase ie and wpi by approximately 100 4 3 economic benefit and economic irrigation water productivity the total cucumber revenue is the most issue that the farmers concern in this study we recorded the daily cucumber yield and the selling price which are the two factors for cucumber revenue fig 6 shows the daily revenue of each treatment and selling price at each market in the three seasons generally the price was high from november to march with a value of 0 6 1 2 kg 1 and the highest price occurred in january and february this is because cucumber cannot be cultivated in open fields from november to march due to the low temperatures which causes cucumber production to decrease in the market and increases cucumber prices the price from april to july mostly ranged from 0 3 0 5 kg 1 because in that season cucumbers planted in open fields increasingly reach the market the daily revenue varied greatly within the same season as well as among the different seasons in the first season the highest daily revenue occurred in march then it remained relatively constant in april and may thereafter decreased gradually mainly because both yield and price decreased in the second season the highest daily revenue occurred in september decreased to 450 ha 1 day 1 in october and november and further decreased greatly in december mainly because of the substantial yield reduction despite the increasing prices in the last season the daily revenue first varied from 450 to 850 ha 1 day 1 in january and february mainly because of the highest price in this experimental season 1 0 1 3 kg 1 decreased in march due to price decreases and low yields 1000 kg ha 1 day 1 and varied greatly in april mainly because of yield variation the daily revenue varied from 700 to 1200 ha 1 day 1 in may and june mainly because of the high yield 2000 2500 kg ha 1 day 1 and then decreased quickly in july from 850 to 300 ha 1 day 1 mainly because the yield decreased from 2500 to 500 kg ha 1 day 1 the total cucumber revenue over the three seasons was between 235 103 and 245 103 ha 1 this yields annual cucumber revenue of 118 103 122 103 ha 1 and is 21 22 times higher than the average revenue of 5 6 103 ha 1 in the agriculture sector of china in 2018 statistics 2019 this means that greenhouse conditions for both drip and furrow irrigation could greatly improve farmer revenue when the cost was taken into account table 6 the total net revenue over the three seasons was the highest in t1 treatment 132 103 ha 1 followed by t2 127 103 ha 1 and t3 123 103 ha 1 and the least was 119 103 ha 1 found in ck though the total revenue in ck was close to t2 and t3 and 3 6 lower than that in t1 the net revenue in ck was 9 62 lower than that in t1 the cost from irrigation water and the labor used over the three seasons in ck was7660 ha 1 which was higher than the cost of 2863 3796 ha 1 in drip irrigations and finally reduced the net revenue economic irrigation water productivity is an indicator to evaluate the economic performance of irrigation fernández et al 2020 in this study three economic water productivity indicators tewpi gewpi and newpi were used to evaluate economic water productivities under the three irrigation treatments in drip irrigation and furrow irrigation the statistical results are showed in table 6 over the three seasons the largest tewpi was found at t3 treatment followed by t2 and t1 and the lowest was found in ck similarly the largest gewpi and newpi were found at t3 and followed by t2 t1 and ck generally tewpi gewpi and newpi at t3 were 2 4 higher than t2 however 20 23 higher than t1 and 67 68 higher than ck therefore it can be concluded that drip irrigation could greatly improve the economic irrigation water productivity and maintaining soil water potential between 15 and 20 kpa could further improve economic irrigation water productivity based on chinese economic statistical data from 2018 statistics 2019 the gross domestic product gdp per unit of water consumption was 21 7 m 3 and that in the agricultural sector was 2 5 m 3 the tewpi 25 7 m 3 in the drip irrigation plot was approximately 30 higher than that at the gdp level and approximately 9 times higher than that in the agricultural sector therefore the production of cucumbers as well as other offseason vegetables in greenhouses using drip irrigation is a good alternative approach for farmers to increase their revenue as well as economic irrigation water productivity 4 4 optimal irrigation scheduling for cucumber cultivation in greenhouses optimized irrigation scheduling should fully consider the economic benefits as well as the environmental benefits of crop production in this study the highest cucumber yield and revenue were found in the t1 treatment but they were not significantly p 0 05 higher than the corresponding yield and revenue in the t2 t3 and ck treatments tables 5 and 6 this means that all treatments have similar economic benefits the environmental benefit can be evaluated with the irrigation amount irrigation efficiency and irrigation water productivity because all these factors show how efficiently water resources are used in this greenhouse cultivation system fig 7 shows the mean wpi and ie over the three seasons for the three soil matric potential thresholds in the drip irrigation plot we did not show the values for ck in fig 7 because its irrigation amount was 2 3 3 times higher and both wpi and ie were 1 2 2 0 times lower than those in drip irrigation fig 7 shows that wpi and ie decreased with the increasing smp threshold the lowest wpi and ie were found at an smp of 10 kpa in the t1 treatment and both increased by 25 28 at an smp of 15 kpa and by 29 34 at an smp of 20 kpa though the t1 treatment had the maximum yield and revenue under full irrigation the t2 and t3 treatments with water deficits of 22 26 had similar yields to t1 but higher irrigation efficiency and irrigation water productivity similarly rahil and qanadillo 2015 reported that irrigation water with 70 etc resulted in the highest yield and water use efficiency economic irrigation water productivity could evaluate both economic benefit and environmental benefit fernández et al 2020 based on the data in table 6 tewpi gewpi and newpi at t3 were the highest and close to those at t2 however approximately 20 higher than t1 and 70 higher than ck therefore the better performance in economic irrigation water productivity in t2 and t3 should be considered in making drip irrigation scheduling for cucumber crop in greenhouse cultivation the cucumber yield found in this study was much higher than those in other greenhouses and open fields mao et al 2003 yuan et al 2006 wan et al 2010 rahil and qanadillo 2015 abdalhi et al 2016 hossain et al 2018 one main reason for this is that the soil water was controlled at an optimal level 10 20 kpa in this experiment shock and wang 2011 summarized the soil water potential of different crops and suggested controlling the soil water potential at higher than 15 30 kpa for cucumber plants with drip irrigation rahil and qanadillo 2015 reported that a controlled soil matric potential higher than 50 60 kpa could reduce cucumber yield by 24 compared to the highest value they obtained considering the high economic benefit and water use efficiency an smp threshold of 15 20 kpa is recommended for cucumber cultivation in drip irrigated greenhouses in north china designed wetting depth depends on the main root distribution coupling root distribution and irrigation water distribution in soil could greatly improve irrigation efficiency and reduce water loss or crop water stress this study show cucumber root mainly develops within the upper 20 cm depth when soil water is sufficient fig 2 similarly chen et al 2008 reported that approximately 95 cucumber root horizontally distributed within 0 15 cm region around the stem and approximately 90 in upper 20 cm depth under drip irrigation and zhang et al 2013 found approximately 70 cucumber root distributed in the upper 15 cm soil layer and 90 in the upper 30 cm soil layer therefore we suggested taking the wetting depth as 20 cm for calculating water amount at each irrigation event under drip irrigation 5 conclusion in this study a three season experiment was conducted in a solar greenhouse to investigate cucumber yield revenue and water use efficiency under three drip irrigation regimes and local furrow irrigation conditions the main results are as follows 1 the total cucumber yield and revenue over the three seasons were the highest in the t1 treatment and were higher by 2 2 4 3 and 4 4 than those in t2 t3 and ck respectively however the total cucumber yield and revenue were not significantly f 0 05 different among the four treatments 2 the irrigation amount in ck was the highest and was 126 188 and 204 higher than that in t1 t2 and t3 respectively this resulted in the lowest ie of 0 46 in ck and ies of 1 03 1 31 and 1 38 in t1 t2 and t3 respectively this means that more than 54 of irrigation water was lost in ck however all irrigation amount was used for crop evapotranspiration in drip irrigation 3 irrigation water productivity generally decreased with the increasing soil matric potential in the drip irrigation plot and all wpi values in the drip irrigation plot were 36 103 higher than that in ck similarly the three economic irrigation water productivities was the largest at t3 followed by t2 and t3 and those at ck was the lowest 4 a soil matric potential threshold of 15 20 kpa and wetting depth of 20 cm are recommended for cucumber cultivation in drip irrigated greenhouses in north china based on a full consideration of the economic benefits and water productivity

10381,cucumber cucumis sativus l is widely grown in greenhouses in china as an offseason vegetable because of its high yield and economic benefits considering that cucumber is sensitive to soil water conditions optimal irrigation scheduling may further enhance cucumber yields and water productivity in this study a 3 season experiment from january 2018 to july 2019 was conducted in a new type of commercial solar greenhouse in north china three irrigation treatments with controlled soil matric potentials smp of 10 t1 15 t2 and 20 kpa t3 were established in drip irrigation plots and the local practice of furrow irrigation was applied as the control ck the cucumber yield and economic benefit for each treatment were measured and irrigation efficiency ie irrigation water productivity wpi and total economic gross margin and net margin irrigation water productivities referring to tewpi gewpi and newpi respectively were evaluated the results show that the fresh cucumber yields of the t1 treatment were the highest and were 2 2 4 3 and 4 4 higher than those of t2 t3 and ck respectively similarly the total revenue from t1 was the highest and was 2 2 3 9 higher than those from the other three treatments however the total yields and revenue among the four treatments were not significantly p 0 05 different the amount of irrigation water used in the ck treatment was the highest and was 126 188 and 204 higher than those in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively the ies in t1 to t3 were 1 03 1 38 and were much high than the value of 0 46 in ck wpi and the three economic irrigation water productivities tewpi gewpi and newpi were the highest in t3 and close to those in t2 then followed by t1 and the lowest was found in ck after fully considering the economic benefits and water productivity an smp threshold of 15 20 kpa and a wetting depth of 20 cm is recommended for cucumber production in drip irrigated greenhouses in north china keywords soil matric potential cucumber irrigation efficiency economic irrigation water productivity greenhouse 1 introduction cucumber is a very popular vegetable worldwide the total cucumber production including gherkins in 2018 was 75 2 million tons from 1 984 million cultivated hectares as reported by faostat 2020 china is one of the main countries that produce cucumbers the total cucumber production including gherkins in china in 2018 was 56 24 million tons from 1 044 million hectares which accounted for 52 7 and 74 8 of the corresponding world totals respectively faostat 2020 the yield per unit area in china was 53 86 kg ha 1 which was 42 higher than the world average faostat 2020 because cucumber is sensitive to cold and water stress it is generally cultivated in humid warm and water sufficient conditions li et al 2017b chen et al 2019 in north china the winter is very cold therefore cucumbers cannot be cultivated in open fields during that period however greenhouses are enclosed structures and the inside environment is much more favorable for plant growth than the outside environment the air temperature inside greenhouses can be 5 15 c higher than that outside during winter in north china li et al 2017a ni et al 2019 currently many greenhouses especially solar greenhouses have been built in north china to plant offseason crops such as cucumber tomato pepper melons and leaf vegetables li et al 2012 sun et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 abdalhi et al 2016 tang et al 2020 the total greenhouse area in china has been reported as 1 96 million ha and is mostly distributed in north china especially on the north china plain which is one of the key food production regions in china statistics 2019 zhang 2020 cucumber growth and fruit production are sensitive to soil water conditions and irrigation water amounts yuan et al 2006 abdalhi et al 2016 it was reported cucumber yield is linearly correlated with irrigation amount and the highest yield is achieved with the greatest irrigation amount mao et al 2003 yuan et al 2006 şimşek et al 2005 further reported that cucumber yield was linearly related to irrigation amount however the yield decreased when irrigation amount increased from 100 to 125 pan evaporation therefore proper irrigation scheduling could further improve cucumber production and irrigation efficiency in greenhouse cultivation contreras et al 2017 climate conditions are widely used for determining irrigation amounts this method is mainly based on the crop variety growth stage and climatic evaporation potential for a specific crop the irrigation amount is estimated based on the reference crop evapotranspiration eto and the crop water requirement etc or pan evaporation for example abdalhi et al 2016 and amer et al 2009 used irrigation amounts based on etc and found that the maximum cucumber yield was achieved at 100 etc though rahil and qanadillo 2015 found that the highest yield was obtained at 70 etc it was close to the yield at 100 etc similarly hashem et al 2011 found that the highest vegetative growth and cucumber yield in a greenhouse in egypt was obtained with 100 eto irrigation pan evaporation including from class a pans and 20 cm diameter pans has also been used to determine irrigation scheduling generally the highest irrigation amount was found to in the highest cucumber yield yuan et al 2006 ayas and demirtas 2009 çakir et al 2017 plants can extract water from soil because the water potential of the soil water is higher than that of the plant roots therefore soil water potential is a good way to determine the irrigation start time and the irrigation water amount shock and wang 2011 shock et al 2013 in china crop radish tomato potato cotton maize responses to soil matric potential smp have been studied and the optimal smps for most crops range from 15 to 30 kpa as measured in the upper 20 30 cm soil layer kang and wan 2005 wang et al 2007 wan et al 2010 wang et al 2011 wan et al 2012 liu et al 2012 reported that the optimal smp for chili pepper in open fields in northeast china was 30 40 kpa wan et al 2010 reported in a saline irrigation treatment in an open field in north china that cucumber plants could be irrigated using saline water with a salt solution of 1 1 4 9 g l 1 when the smp was higher than 20 kpa however the cucumber yield decreased with increasing salt solution and generally decreased from 130 103 ton ha 1 in the first season to 40 45 ton ha 1 in the second season and 24 30 ton ha 1 in the third season because of soil salt accumulation and climate variation cucumber plants are very sensitive to soil water conditions especially in greenhouses where crop yield can be 2 3 times higher than that in open fields panwar et al 2011 smp method could be used to timely evaluate soil and plant water status and then make proper irrigation schedules however few studies have investigated the proper soil water potential for guiding irrigation scheduling for cucumber plants especially under greenhouse cultivation conditions on the north china plain the north china plain is one of the main vegetable and grain production regions in china the vegetable and grain cultivation areas account for approximately 20 and 21 of the national total respectively and correspondingly produce 30 and 24 of the national yield statistics 2019 however water resources in this region are scarce and represent approximately 3 1 of the total water resources of china statistics 2019 a large amount of groundwater on the ncp is pumped to irrigate agricultural fields to support food production which has resulted in a rapid decline in the groundwater level on the ncp by 3 9 m yr 1 zhao et al 2019 therefore using water resources rationally and improving water use efficiency and water productivity are critical for sustainable developments in agriculture as well as in economic sectors in china the objectives in this study are to investigate the irrigation amount and cucumber yield under three soil water potentials under drip irrigation and furrow irrigation evaluate the irrigation efficiency irrigation water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity and finally recommend a proper irrigation scheduling method for cucumber cultivation in greenhouses on the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the three season experiment was conducted from february 2018 to july 2019 in a commercial greenhouse in xinmi city henan province north china 34 27 3 5 n 113 31 58 5 e the climate in this region is a continental monsoon climate the annual mean air temperature is 14 7 c with the highest temperatures in july and august and the lowest in january the annual total sunshine hours are 1870 hours the average annual rainfall is 542 mm with approximately 70 distributed from july to september the greenhouse soil physical and chemical properties were measured in the laboratory excluding field capacity and bulk density which were measured in situ the soil texture is silty loam based on the american soil texture classification and is very uniform in the upper 1 m soil layer table 1 the soil bulk density is 1 36 1 42 g cm 3 and the soil field capacity is 0 352 0 385 cm3 cm 3 the soil total nitrogen organic matter content no3 n available p and available k in the upper 20 cm layer were the highest then all decreased quickly and reached a stable value in the 20 100 cm soil layer the detailed soil chemical and hydraulic characteristics are listed in tables 1 and 2 the cucumber plants cucumis sativus l boxin 201 variety in the first and second seasons and boxin 301 in the third season were planted in a commercial chinese solar greenhouse this greenhouse has an east west orientation and faces south to capture as much solar energy as possible the inside soil surface is 1 5 m lower than the outside which impedes heat exchange from the inside to the outside and keeps the inside warm especially in the winter the solar greenhouse is 12 m in width and 70 m in length inside the back wall is 6 m thick at the bottom 2 m thick at the top and approximately 6 m high inside the top of the greenhouse was covered with 0 1 mm thick polyethylene plastic film which was replaced in september to maintain high solar transmissivity there was an adjusted width vent on the top of the greenhouse for natural ventilation when the inside temperature was higher than 30 c the farmers manually pulled the vent open and the open width of the vent normally ranged from 0 5 to 1 0 m depending on the outside climate conditions 2 2 experimental treatments this experiment included three treatments based on the soil matric potential which were 10 t1 15 t2 and 20 kpa t3 under drip irrigation conditions furrow irrigation is the traditional irrigation method widely used by local farmers and it was used as a control ck in this study when the soil matric potentials reached the target value for each drip irrigation treatment irrigation began soil matric potentials of 10 15 and 20 kpa are equivalent to soil water contents of 0 323 0 303 and 0 291 cm3 cm 3 respectively calculated using in situ measured soil water retention curve θ 0 493 s 0 179 n 8 r2 0 98 where θ is volumetric soil water content and s is the suction pressure in kpa because cucumber roots are mainly distributed in the upper 20 cm soil layer see section 3 2 root distribution soil matric potential and irrigation efficiency the designed wetting soil layer was 0 20 cm and the wetting depth was 20 cm the upper limit of the soil water content is the field capacity therefore the irrigation depth i mm was calculated each time as i 200 θfc θ where θfc and θ are the field capacity and the volumetric soil water content at the corresponding target smp for each treatment the irrigation depths for the t1 t2 and t3 treatments were 9 72 13 75 and 16 25 mm respectively the real irrigation amount was measured using a flow meter deployed in the main pipe at the head of the irrigation system in the experimental period there was a slight difference between the real irrigation amount and the designed irrigation amount due to slight variations in the farmers management of the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot the irrigation management for ck was the same as that used in local practice and was managed by the greenhouse owner generally furrow irrigation started when the farmer find some water stress phenomenon in stem extension leaf color leaf appearance and fruit growth furrow irrigation stopped when water level at furrows reached approximately two third the depth of furrow this irrigation management in furrow irrigation plot is fully experientially based the irrigation water for ck was also measured using a flow meter in the main pipe the greenhouse was divided into two parts a drip irrigation plot and a furrow irrigation plot the furrow irrigation plot was located in the eastern part with a length of 20 m and the drip irrigation plot was in the western part with a length of 50 m the three drip irrigation treatments were set up in a random design with three replications for each treatment each replicated subplot included three furrows the furrow irrigation treatment had four replicated subplots each furrow was measured as 12 m in length 0 8 m in width and 0 1 0 15 m in depth at the middle point the spacing between the furrows was 0 5 m for plant management and fruit harvest two rows of cucumber seedlings were planted on the two sides of each furrow with a plant spacing of 30 cm one drip line was deployed in each plant row to provide high irrigation uniformity the discharge of the drippers was 1 38 l h when the operating pressure was 0 10 0 15 mpa the dripper spacing in the drip line was 30 cm the irrigation water was first pumped from the groundwater and then stored in a tank with a volume of 10 m3 a pressure regulator and flow meter were deployed in the main pipe to control the working pressure in the irrigation system and to measure the irrigation water amount respectively there were three sub driplines one for each treatment each subline had a venturi fertilizer system to apply fertilizer to the plants in the furrow irrigation plot the irrigation times and water amounts were based on the farmer s experience and were the same as local practice the real irrigation amount was measured using a flow meter fertilizers were always applied at the beginning of each furrow to let the fertilizers flow with the irrigation water the total fertilizers applied for the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot and furrow plot ck treatment were the same in each experimental season 2 3 agronomic practices cucumber seedlings with 2 3 leaves were transplanted and then all fields were irrigated with 60 mm water to enhance seedlings standing as normal management in this region because crops were small and transpiration rate was low the first irrigation 60 mm was assumed to enough to fulfill the crop transpiration when they grew from having 2 3 leaves at transplantation to 5 6 leaves before irrigations resume during this non irrigation period we did not found clear water stress phenomena for example leaf curling at middle day further this water management was aiming to enhance root development both horizontally and vertically a better root system could increase the resilience of cucumber crops to water stress and other unfriendly growth condition in the whole season when plants grew to 50 cm high with 5 6 leaves and flowers the treatments began and the plants were irrigated with the set irrigation scheduling during the periods of flowering fruit growth and harvest the cucumber plants were attached to wires to support vertical stem growth when the plant height reached 2 m the plant stems were bent down to approximately 1 0 m high and the leaves in the lower part of the stem were trimmed this practice maintains the plant height within 1 2 m to help fruit harvest and plant management generally there were 10 13 leaves on each stem and the leaf area index ranged from 2 0 to 2 3 the growth period for each season is listed in table 3 before transplanting the soil in the upper 30 cm layer was plowed with fertilizer the basal fertilizer application included an organic fertilizer mixture of chicken manure and wheat straw at 200 m3 ha 1 and calcium superphosphate at 1200 kg ha 1 quicklime at 1050 kg ha 1 was also spread to soil surface and mixed with the upper soil to prevent bacteria and fungus growing and further slowdown the soil acidification nitrogen was applied through the drip irrigation system in the drip irrigation plot every irrigation and manually placed into the ditch to flow to the furrows with the irrigation water every 2 3 irrigation events in the furrow irrigation plot the amount of nitrogen applied was approximately 4 5 kg ha 1 day 1 all plots including furrows and the areas between furrows were covered with black plastic film to prevent soil evaporation and grass growth during all growth periods 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 soil root distribution to investigate the root distribution transparent tubes were vertically installed before seedling transplantation in the 2018 ws season thereafter cucumber seedlings were planted approximately 5 cm horizontally away from the tubes a tube was used for one replicated subplot in both the drip and furrow irrigation treatments the tubes were made of transparent plexiglas zealquest sci tech co ltd shanghai china and were 1 m long each tube was sealed at the bottom to prevent water from entering the part of the tube protruding from the soil surface was covered with a black plastic sheet to prevent light from entering the tube during measurement images of roots were captured at every 20 cm from the soil surface using a ci 602 root growth scanning system cid bioscience inc camas wa usa the roots were scanned every month from march to june in 2018 2 4 2 soil matric potential the soil matric potential was measured in both drip and furrow irrigation plots in the drip irrigation plot one tensiometer model t50 waterstar co ltd beijing china was deployed at 20 cm depth under the drippers in each replicated subplot in each treatment therefore each treatment in the drip irrigation plot had three tensiometers and three tensiometers were also deployed in the ck treatment the soil matric potential was measured at 8 00 every day for each treatment when two of the three soil matric potentials reached their corresponding target value irrigation began 2 4 3 cucumber yield and fruit revenue in this study only the yields of commercial cucumbers were recorded by farmers in both the drip and furrow irrigated plots in each treatment in the drip irrigation plot and ck three furrows including 6 rows were selected for yield recording the mean values of the three furrows were used for data comparisons the harvest intervals were 1 3 days depending on cucumber growth the price of cucumber fruits was recorded at each sale the seasonal cucumber yield was the sum of each harvest the total revenue from cucumber fruit in each season was the sum of the revenue from each sale all measured yield and recorded revenue data were converted into their values per hectare by considering the sampling area 2 4 4 microclimate microclimatic factors including solar radiation model tbq 2 jinzhou sunshine technology co ltd china air temperature and humidity model hmp60 vaisala co finland and wind speed model ec 9s jinzhou sunshine technology co ltd china were recorded at 30 second intervals and 30 minute averages were recorded using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa both inside and outside of the greenhouse in the first season the wind speeds inside were measured with a three cup anemometer model ec 9s jinzhou sunshine technology co ltd china with this sensor the highest recorded wind velocity was zero because the inside wind velocity mostly less than 0 2 m s 1 was less than the threshold of 0 5 m s 1 according to the manufacturer therefore in the last two seasons the inside wind velocity was measured with an ultrasonic anemometer with threshold of 0 01 s m 1 and resolution of 0 01 s m 1 model atmos 22 meter group inc usa the data were sampled every 1 minute and averaged over 5 minutes as recorded using an em50 data logger dynamax inc usa the climate station outside was deployed 1 m above the top of the greenhouse and the climate station inside was placed at the middle point of the greenhouse at 2 5 m above the soil surface 2 4 5 soil temperature soil temperatures inside the greenhouse were measured using 5te sensors dynamax inc usa at 10 20 and 30 cm depth in the main root zone in the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot and ck in the furrow irrigation plot all temperature signals were recorded every 5 minutes and stored in an em50 data logger dynamax inc usa from october 18 2018 to july 31 2019 2 5 calculations 2 5 1 reference crop evapotranspiration the reference crop evapotranspiration eto outside the solar greenhouse was calculated using the fao56 penman monteith method pm method allen et al 1998 however the inside eto calculated by the pm method is usually underestimated because of the low wind speed 0 01 0 2 m s 1 which can result in high aerodynamic resistance and an eto that is too low fernández et al 2010 therefore in this study an adjusted penman monteith method was used to calculate eto in which a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 was used fernández et al 2010 fernández et al 2011 the two eto methods are described as follows allen et al 1998 fernández et al 2010 1 o u t s i d e e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 2 i n s i d e e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 628 t 273 v

requirement et c under sufficient soil water conditions can be estimated using the et o and crop coefficient k c by the following method allen et al 1998 3 e t c e t 0 k c the crop coefficient depends on the crop species and growth stage in this study the leaf area index during the flowering and harvest periods ranged from 2 0 to 2 3 which could result in a slight variation in kc therefore the kc value was set to 1 10 based on the suggestion of allen et al 1998 and other study sun et al 2019 2 5 2 irrigation efficiency irrigation water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity irrigation efficiency ie is defined as the ratio of the irrigation water consumed by the crops to the irrigation water perry 2007 similar to the definition of water productivity perry 2007 perry 2008 perry et al 2009 perry 2011 heydari 2014 the irrigation water productivity wpi was defined as the cucumber production to the irrigation water amount fernández et al 2020 to evaluate economic performance of irrigation water total economic irrigation water productivity tewpi gross economic irrigation water productivity gewpi and net economic irrigation water productivity newpi were calculated following fernández et al 2020 the calculation equations for the above indicators are listed as follows 4 ie et c i 5 wpi 100y i kg m 3 6 tewpi te 10 i m 3 7 gewpi ge 10 i m 3 8 newpi ne 10

differences in cucumber yields and incomes among treatments were tested using the ibm spss statistics software package version 20 0 ibm corp usa at the 0 05 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 microclimate inside and outside the greenhouse fig 1 shows the monthly mean daily air temperature solar radiation wind speed relative humidity vapor pressure deficit vpd and eto inside and outside the greenhouse during the experimental period it can be found the inside climate is strongly coupled with those outside mainly because all energy inside is coming from the outside and the vent opening also enhances the exchanges of heat and mass however it should be noted that the difference in each climatic variable between inside and outside occurred and changed with month due to the plastic film covering the curves of the inside daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures were similar to those outside the annual minimum temperature occurred in december and january and the highest temperatures occurred in june and july however the inside temperatures during all experimental periods were higher than those outside especially during winter the smallest difference in mean air temperatures between the inside and outside was 1 6 2 9 c in june after which the difference increased gradually and reached 5 1 c in october and 9 2 c in november the greatest differences were found from december to february in december the inside monthly mean minimum and maximum air temperatures were 17 8 14 2 and 26 2 c respectively the corresponding temperatures were 16 9 13 4 and 24 8 c in january and 17 0 c 12 9 and 25 5 c in february the mean temperatures inside the greenhouse were higher than those outside by 15 9 16 2 and 14 8 c in december january and february respectively the inside temperature during the winter period was much more favorable to cucumber growth 20 30 c than the outside temperature heidari et al 2012 abdalhi et al 2016 hossain et al 2018 because the soil temperatures measured at the 10 20 and 30 cm depths were similar and no substantial differences were found among the treatments and irrigation methods the mean temperatures in the 0 30 cm soil layer are presented in fig 1 a the soil temperatures averaged over the 0 30 soil layer ranged from 18 8 19 0 c during the winter period from december to february and could successfully support plant growth the outside solar radiation was the highest in june and july and then decreased to lower values of 4 9 6 9 mj m 2 day 1 from november to february which were 67 lower than the highest value in june fig 1b the inside solar radiation showed a similar trend to that outside with the highest value in june and the lowest in december the transmissivity of the plastic cover ranged from 0 55 to 0 89 with a mean of 0 71 and was close to the value of 0 6 0 8 in solar greenhouses in other studies kitta et al 2012 graamans et al 2018 singh et al 2018 and of 0 6 0 7 in north china li et al 2017a ni et al 2019 the wind velocity inside was much lower than that outside the measured monthly mean wind speed outside ranged from 1 1 to 1 7 m s 1 inside it was 0 09 0 11 m s 1 with a mean of 0 10 m s 1 this low wind velocity of 0 08 0 15 m s 1 has also been reported by ni et al 2019 in a chinese solar greenhouse the inside wind velocity was much lower than and not closely related to that outside because the top cover impedes the exchange of heat and momentum between the inside and the outside liu et al 2015 the inside relative humidity rh ranged from 61 to 91 and was higher by 4 to 27 than that outside fig 1c from december to march inside rh was approximately 20 higher than that outside mainly because of plant transpiration and short period of natural ventilation however the vents were opened throughout the day from april to august to reduce heat loading inside the greenhouse which finally resulted in inside rh being close to that outside there was little difference in the vapor pressure deficit vpd inside and outside because the reduced vpd caused by the higher rh inside could offset the increased vpd from higher temperatures which resulted in a slight difference in vpd between the inside and the outside the reference crop evapotranspiration inside and outside was the highest in june and july decreased greatly and reached a minimum in the period from november to february then increased gradually fig 1d the inside eto from october to march was close to that outside and was lower than that during other periods the lowest inside eto from november to february averaged 1 0 mm day 1 which was approximately 27 of the inside maximum value 3 7 mm day 1 and 23 of the outside maximum 4 3 mm day 1 in june and july this indicates that crops grown in the greenhouse during the winter period could reduce water use by more than 70 compared to those grown in june and july similarly liu et al 2015 found that the eto inside a banana screenhouse in israel was reduced by 33 because of the screen cover inside a semicircular solar greenhouse the crop water requirements decreased by 16 20 abdalhi et al 2016 3 2 root distribution soil matric potential and irrigation efficiency the root distribution was first investigated by taking root samples using a spade from another cucumber greenhouse before this experiment we found that the roots were mainly distributed in the upper 10 cm soil layer and that the primary roots tended to extend horizontally more than vertically the root distribution in the upper 30 cm soil layer measured by a root monitor system is shown in fig 2 the measured cucumber roots in the middle growth stage may 8 2018 were mainly distributed in the upper 10 cm soil layer followed by a small portion in the 10 20 cm soil layer and roots were hardly found in the 20 30 cm soil layer there were no roots in the 30 80 cm layer therefore it is not shown in fig 2 the root distributions in both drip and furrow irrigation plots are similar indicating that the irrigation method had only a slight effect on root distribution in greenhouse cultivation conditions where the soil water content is generally high this root distribution confirmed that the wet depth of 20 cm for calculating the irrigation amount in this study is reasonable fig 3 shows the soil matric potential variations for the three treatments with drip irrigation and that in ck with furrow irrigation in the three seasons most soil matric potentials in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments were higher than the corresponding target values of 10 15 and 20 kpa indicating that the soil matric potential was well controlled however the soil matric potential varied greatly in the ck for example in the third season approximately half of irrigation applications started when the soil matric potential reached 15 kpa and one fourth started when the soil matric potential reached 10 kpa the cumulative irrigation amount for each treatment and ck is shown in fig 4 it is clear that the irrigation amount in ck was much higher than that at the three water matric potentials in the drip irrigation plot the total irrigation amount over the three seasons in the ck treatment was 2505 mm which was 1 26 1 88 and 2 04 times greater than that in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively among the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot the maximum total irrigation amount over the three seasons was 1109 mm in the t1 treatment followed by 870 mm in the t2 treatment and 825 mm the lowest in the t3 treatment the ie in the three seasons is listed in table 4 the highest mean ie over the three seasons was 1 38 in the t3 treatment followed by 1 31 in the t2 treatment and 1 03 in the t1 treatment all three ies for the three treatments were higher than 1 0 indicating that the irrigation amount was lower than the crop etc the ie in ck was 0 46 and the lowest among all treatments 3 3 crop yield and irrigation water productivity fig 5 shows the daily commercial fruit yield of each treatment in the three seasons there was great variation in the daily yield mainly because of the microclimate variation precipitation and cloudy days as well as low temperatures cause delays in cucumber growth and result in longer harvest intervals there was no great difference in the daily harvested yield among the t1 t2 and t3 treatments in all three seasons fig 5 the daily yield of the ck treatment was close to that of t1 t3 in the first and second seasons but lower in the third season the seasonal total yields for all treatments are listed in table 5 among the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot the highest yield was found in t1 followed by t2 and t3 indicating that higher soil matric potential resulted in higher yield however the differences in seasonal yield among these three treatments were small and not significant p 0 05 compared to that in t1 the yields in the t2 and t3 treatments were reduced by 2 2 and 4 3 on average respectively the seasonal yield of ck was close to that of t1 in the first and second seasons but lower by 10 3 in the third season over the three seasons the total yield of ck was close to that of t3 but lower by 4 6 and 2 3 than those of t1 and t2 respectively the lower yield of t3 compared to that of t1 may be due to the large water deficit 38 water deficit however the slightly lower yield in ck may be due to the high soil water variation caused by the long irrigation intervals fig 3 the irrigation water productivity for each treatment in the three seasons is listed in table 5 the wpi ranged from 34 2 to 83 7 kg m 3 with a mean of 56 1 kg m 3 in the drip irrigation plot however it ranged from 14 4 to 22 2 kg m 3 with a mean of 20 4 kg m 3 in ck clearly the wpi in the drip irrigation plot was 174 higher than that of ck in the furrow irrigation plot among the three treatments in the drip irrigation plot the wpi of t3 was the highest 62 1 kg m 3 followed by that of t2 60 2 kg m 3 and the lowest 48 3 kg m 3 was that of t1 the wpi generally decreased with the increasing irrigation amount the highest irrigation amount in ck had the lowest wpi and the lowest irrigation amount in t3 had the highest wpi this is mainly because of the slight difference in fruit yield among all treatments table 5 but the irrigation depth increased with the increasing smp threshold 3 4 cucumber revenue and economic irrigation water productivity the total revenue over the three seasons was the highest in t1 245 103 ha 1 followed by those in t2 239 103 ha 1 and t3 235 103 ha 1 table 6 the total revenue of ck was 236 103 ha 1 which was similar to those of t2 and t3 and 3 7 lower than that of t1 compared to the highest revenue from t1 those from t2 and t3 were 2 3 and 3 9 lower respectively this order of total revenue among the three treatments and ck was similar to that for yield and all the differences in total yield and revenue among the treatments were small 4 and not significant p 0 05 table 6 also shows the total economic irrigation water productivity tewpi gross economic irrigation water productivity gewpi and net economic irrigation water productivity newpi of each treatment in the three seasons similar to the order of wpi the highest tewpi was 28 5 m 3 in t3 followed by t2 27 5 m 3 and t1 22 1 m 3 and the lowest was 9 4 m 3 in ck additionally the mean tewpi in the drip irrigation plot was 26 0 m 3 and was 172 higher than that in ck in the furrow irrigation plot the gewpi and newpi among the treatments show the same trend as tewpi the highest was found at t3 followed by t2 and t3 and the least was at ck 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between irrigation frequency irrigation amount and irrigation efficient in general drip irrigation supplies water frequently with small amount water each time this irrigation scheduling could maintain the soil water content in optimal level with slight variation in this study the total number of irrigation events in the t1 treatment over the three seasons was 109 which was the highest followed by 60 times in t2 and 47 times in t3 there were 48 irrigation events in the ck treatment which was close to the number for t3 high irrigation frequency at a high soil matric threshold resulted in large total irrigation amount wang et al 2007 they found the total irrigation depth decreased from 153 to 45 mm when the smp threshold decreased from 15 to 45 kpa in a potato experiment in north china wang et al 2007 however low frequency irrigation like the furrow irrigation in this study will has large irrigation intervals and finally results in greater soil matric variation compared to drip irrigation fig 3 this experience based knowledge used in furrow irrigation differs with farmers crops soil texture and fertility thus the uncertain in the environmental change for crop growth may influence irrigation implementation and further enlarge the soil water variation in this study t1 treatment has the largest irrigation amount which could be due to the highest irrigation frequency 109 times over the three seasons however there was only a slight difference in the irrigation amount between the t2 and t3 treatments this means that the greater number of irrigation times in t2 could offset the smaller irrigation amount each time and result in a similar total irrigation amount as that in t3 the high irrigation depth at ck was mainly due to the irrigation amount applied each time which was based on the local farmers knowledge the average irrigation amount per event at ck was 52 2 mm which was 3 4 times higher than that 10 2 17 6 mm per event used in drip irrigation the high irrigation depth per event in the ck treatment could offset the effect of having fewer irrigation times resulting in a greater irrigation amount than that used in drip irrigation yaghi et al 2013 reported that the total irrigation depth under furrow irrigation was 672 mm in 14 irrigation events however it decreased to 289 mm with 23 irrigation events in a drip irrigation field irrigation efficiency ie is the ratio of the crop water requirement etc to the irrigation amount this index can comprehensively evaluate the whole irrigation system including the irrigation method irrigation scheduling and field management perry 2007 perry 2011 higher values indicate greater water use due to plant evapotranspiration the ies over the three seasons ranged from 1 03 to 1 38 in the drip irrigation plot indicating all irrigation amounts was used for crop evapotranspiration the ie in ck was 0 46 indicating that approximately 54 of the irrigation water could not be used by plants and was lost similarly another cucumber experiment reported that the ie was 0 56 under surface irrigation compared to 0 92 under drip irrigation yaghi et al 2013 the low ie in the ck treatment means that extra water was pumped from the groundwater which accelerates the drop in the groundwater level considering that the soil surface was fully covered by plastic film to prevent soil evaporation the lost water likely moved to a deeper soil layer the accumulated ions in the upper soil layer also move down with soil water eventually reaching the groundwater and causing pollution liu et al 2013 investigated the nitrogen distribution in wheat maize fields and greenhouses and found that the no3 n in wheat maize fields moved to a 6 3 m depth at a movement rate of 6 cm yr 1 however the no3 n in greenhouses moved to a 9 0 m depth at a rate of 15 26 cm yr 1 the no3 n depth in a greenhouse was close to the groundwater level of 11 0 m after 18 years of operation the researchers cited the high irrigation amount and nitrogen application level in greenhouses as the main reasons for the deeper no3 n distribution and faster movement rate compared to those in wheat maize fields 4 2 cucumber productions to irrigation amount and soil water potential cucumber crop is much sensitive to soil water condition and irrigation amount yuan et al 2006 abdalhi et al 2016 the highest cucumber yield in greenhouses was found when the soil water content was higher than 85 field capacity fc hossain et al 2018 li et al 2019 in this study the highest cucumber yield was found in the t1 treatment where soil water potential 10 kpa referring to 87 fc is the highest on average and the irrigation amount was close to the crop water requirement however irrigation amounts in treatments t2 and t3 were lower than crop etc and crop was greatly over irrigated in ck both reduced cucumber yield tables 4 and 5 similarly yuan et al 2006 used 20 cm pan evaporation epan to determine an irrigation schedule and found that the highest irrigation amount 1 00 epan in the spring season and 1 75 epan in the autumn season resulted in the highest cucumber yield in both experimental seasons in a rain shelter in japan mao et al 2003 also found in spring in north china that the cucumber yield increased with the irrigation amount and the highest yield of 194 ton ha 1 was achieved at the maximum irrigation amount of 726 mm abdalhi et al 2016 reported that the maximum cucumber yield in a semicircular solar greenhouse was achieved at 100 etc however 50 etc and 150 etc reduced yields by 39 and 4 respectively similarly hashem et al 2011 found in a greenhouse in egypt that the highest vegetative growth and cucumber yield were obtained with a 100 eto irrigation amount and both higher and lower irrigation amounts 120 and 80 eto respectively decreased yield amer et al 2009 also reported in a greenhouse in egypt that the highest yield of 35 6 kg ha 1 was found at full irrigation with a 1 0 etc irrigation amount and yield decreased by 27 0 and 13 8 when the irrigation amount was reduced to 0 64 etc and 0 84 etc respectively all the above studies show that the highest cucumber yield was found at full irrigation with an irrigation amount of approximately 100 etc there were great variations in the cucumber yield in the same treatment in the three seasons the main reason for this was the different growth period durations in the three seasons the fruit harvest durations in the 2018 ws 2018 aw and 2019 ws seasons were 107 83 and 185 days respectively the corresponding mean daily production was 1584 904 and 1573 kg ha 1 day 1 in the t1 treatment and 1597 933 and 1426 kg ha 1 day 1 in the ck treatment the daily yields for the same treatment were similar in the 2018 ws and 2019 ws seasons however both were approximately 40 higher than that in the 2018 aw season this was because cucumber plants in the 2018 aw season were affected by root rot disease starting at the end of october 2018 during the period from the end of october to the end of november this root rot disease was not well controlled which caused the daily cucumber yield to decrease to approximately 1000 kg ha 1 day 1 an approximately 30 reduction compared to that 1500 kg ha 1 day 1 under normal conditions in most periods in october 2018 from november 25 2018 the plants were greatly affected by root rot disease and the cucumber yield decreased quickly the last harvest was on december 7 with a yield of approximately 100 kg ha 1 day 1 therefore the mean daily yield in the 2018 aw season was much lower than that in the 2018 ws and 2019 ws seasons the seasonal cucumber production ranged from 150 to 290 ton ha 1 with a mean daily production of approximately 1500 kg ha 1 day 1 excluding that from 20018 aw because of the short growth period and the influence of root rot disease the cucumber yields found in this study are higher than the values of 37 8 ton ha 1 cultivated in an autumn season by abdalhi et al 2016 110 130 ton ha 1 grown from february to july by hossain et al 2018 45 1 57 3 ton ha 1 from february to june in palestine by rahil and qanadillo 2015 50 8 76 7 ton ha 1 from july to october in turkey şimşek et al 2005 84 3 86 1 ton ha 1 in the winter spring season and 39 6 40 5 ton ha 1 in the autumn winter season by zhang et al 2012 approximately 100 ton ha 1 in the spring and summer seasons by sun et al 2019 and 140 200 ton ha 1 in the spring season in north china by mao et al 2003 the higher yield found in this study indicates that the controlled soil matric potential from 10 to 20 kpa in this greenhouse is good for cucumber growth wan et al 2010 reported in an open field in beijing china that cucumber is very sensitive to salt in the irrigation water they found that seasonal cucumber production ranged from 103 to 129 ton ha 1 in the first season when the irrigation salt solution was 1 1 4 9 ds m 1 while it decreased to 24 45 ton ha 1 in the second and third seasons because of salt accumulation in soil even when the smp was maintained at higher than 20 kpa irrigation water productivity wpi is the fresh cucumber production per unit of irrigation water used a higher wpi indicates more production potential from the same amount of irrigation water in this study the highest wpi 62 11 kg m 3 was found at treatment t3 followed by t2 60 21 kg m 3 t1 48 28 kg m 3 and ck 20 44 kg m 3 the largest irrigation amount in ck resulted in the least wpi and the smallest irrigation amounts in t2 and t3 caused the highest wpi mainly because of the slight difference in yield production table 6 mao et al 2003 reported that the highest wpi of cucumber was 56 6 kg m 3 which was found with the lowest irrigation amount however the lowest wpi was 26 7 kg m 3 when the yield and irrigation amount were the highest similarly çakir et al 2017 also reported that the highest wpi 56 kg m 3 was found with the lowest irrigation amount 0 75 times pan evaporation these conclusions are close to our results however ayas and demirtas 2009 reported that the highest wpi was 31 9 kg m 3 for the highest irrigation amount in an unheated greenhouse in turkey the highest cucumber yield in the t1 treatment was 4 6 higher than that in the ck treatment however the difference was not significant p 0 05 this means that drip irrigation with well controlled soil water conditions does not greatly improve cucumber yield compared to local practices similarly hossain et al 2018 studied the response of cucumber yield to irrigation water and nitrogen amount in a drip irrigated greenhouse in north china and reported that the highest cucumber yield was found with the highest irrigation amount when the soil water was at higher than 85 field capacity and was only 0 5 higher than that under local practices with full irrigation however the irrigation amount in the 85 fc treatment was 22 lower than that used in local practices rahil and qanadillo 2015 reported that the highest cucumber yield in greenhouse cultivation in palestine was found at 70 etc the yield was 6 2 higher than that under traditional furrow irrigation but reduced the irrigation amount by 36 lv et al 2019 further found in north china that drip irrigation did not obviously increase tomato yield in a four season greenhouse experiment however the irrigation amount 360 380 mm used in drip irrigation was lower than that used in traditional furrow irrigation 620 660 mm sun et al 2013 reported a similar result that drip irrigation with an optimal irrigation amount did not increase the tomato yield in a greenhouse but reduced the irrigation amount by 50 and the nitrogen application amount by 80 therefore drip irrigation with an optimal irrigation amount in greenhouse cultivation does not obviously increase crop yield compared to that under traditional practices in north china however drop irrigation can reduce the irrigation amount by approximately 50 and increase ie and wpi by approximately 100 4 3 economic benefit and economic irrigation water productivity the total cucumber revenue is the most issue that the farmers concern in this study we recorded the daily cucumber yield and the selling price which are the two factors for cucumber revenue fig 6 shows the daily revenue of each treatment and selling price at each market in the three seasons generally the price was high from november to march with a value of 0 6 1 2 kg 1 and the highest price occurred in january and february this is because cucumber cannot be cultivated in open fields from november to march due to the low temperatures which causes cucumber production to decrease in the market and increases cucumber prices the price from april to july mostly ranged from 0 3 0 5 kg 1 because in that season cucumbers planted in open fields increasingly reach the market the daily revenue varied greatly within the same season as well as among the different seasons in the first season the highest daily revenue occurred in march then it remained relatively constant in april and may thereafter decreased gradually mainly because both yield and price decreased in the second season the highest daily revenue occurred in september decreased to 450 ha 1 day 1 in october and november and further decreased greatly in december mainly because of the substantial yield reduction despite the increasing prices in the last season the daily revenue first varied from 450 to 850 ha 1 day 1 in january and february mainly because of the highest price in this experimental season 1 0 1 3 kg 1 decreased in march due to price decreases and low yields 1000 kg ha 1 day 1 and varied greatly in april mainly because of yield variation the daily revenue varied from 700 to 1200 ha 1 day 1 in may and june mainly because of the high yield 2000 2500 kg ha 1 day 1 and then decreased quickly in july from 850 to 300 ha 1 day 1 mainly because the yield decreased from 2500 to 500 kg ha 1 day 1 the total cucumber revenue over the three seasons was between 235 103 and 245 103 ha 1 this yields annual cucumber revenue of 118 103 122 103 ha 1 and is 21 22 times higher than the average revenue of 5 6 103 ha 1 in the agriculture sector of china in 2018 statistics 2019 this means that greenhouse conditions for both drip and furrow irrigation could greatly improve farmer revenue when the cost was taken into account table 6 the total net revenue over the three seasons was the highest in t1 treatment 132 103 ha 1 followed by t2 127 103 ha 1 and t3 123 103 ha 1 and the least was 119 103 ha 1 found in ck though the total revenue in ck was close to t2 and t3 and 3 6 lower than that in t1 the net revenue in ck was 9 62 lower than that in t1 the cost from irrigation water and the labor used over the three seasons in ck was7660 ha 1 which was higher than the cost of 2863 3796 ha 1 in drip irrigations and finally reduced the net revenue economic irrigation water productivity is an indicator to evaluate the economic performance of irrigation fernández et al 2020 in this study three economic water productivity indicators tewpi gewpi and newpi were used to evaluate economic water productivities under the three irrigation treatments in drip irrigation and furrow irrigation the statistical results are showed in table 6 over the three seasons the largest tewpi was found at t3 treatment followed by t2 and t1 and the lowest was found in ck similarly the largest gewpi and newpi were found at t3 and followed by t2 t1 and ck generally tewpi gewpi and newpi at t3 were 2 4 higher than t2 however 20 23 higher than t1 and 67 68 higher than ck therefore it can be concluded that drip irrigation could greatly improve the economic irrigation water productivity and maintaining soil water potential between 15 and 20 kpa could further improve economic irrigation water productivity based on chinese economic statistical data from 2018 statistics 2019 the gross domestic product gdp per unit of water consumption was 21 7 m 3 and that in the agricultural sector was 2 5 m 3 the tewpi 25 7 m 3 in the drip irrigation plot was approximately 30 higher than that at the gdp level and approximately 9 times higher than that in the agricultural sector therefore the production of cucumbers as well as other offseason vegetables in greenhouses using drip irrigation is a good alternative approach for farmers to increase their revenue as well as economic irrigation water productivity 4 4 optimal irrigation scheduling for cucumber cultivation in greenhouses optimized irrigation scheduling should fully consider the economic benefits as well as the environmental benefits of crop production in this study the highest cucumber yield and revenue were found in the t1 treatment but they were not significantly p 0 05 higher than the corresponding yield and revenue in the t2 t3 and ck treatments tables 5 and 6 this means that all treatments have similar economic benefits the environmental benefit can be evaluated with the irrigation amount irrigation efficiency and irrigation water productivity because all these factors show how efficiently water resources are used in this greenhouse cultivation system fig 7 shows the mean wpi and ie over the three seasons for the three soil matric potential thresholds in the drip irrigation plot we did not show the values for ck in fig 7 because its irrigation amount was 2 3 3 times higher and both wpi and ie were 1 2 2 0 times lower than those in drip irrigation fig 7 shows that wpi and ie decreased with the increasing smp threshold the lowest wpi and ie were found at an smp of 10 kpa in the t1 treatment and both increased by 25 28 at an smp of 15 kpa and by 29 34 at an smp of 20 kpa though the t1 treatment had the maximum yield and revenue under full irrigation the t2 and t3 treatments with water deficits of 22 26 had similar yields to t1 but higher irrigation efficiency and irrigation water productivity similarly rahil and qanadillo 2015 reported that irrigation water with 70 etc resulted in the highest yield and water use efficiency economic irrigation water productivity could evaluate both economic benefit and environmental benefit fernández et al 2020 based on the data in table 6 tewpi gewpi and newpi at t3 were the highest and close to those at t2 however approximately 20 higher than t1 and 70 higher than ck therefore the better performance in economic irrigation water productivity in t2 and t3 should be considered in making drip irrigation scheduling for cucumber crop in greenhouse cultivation the cucumber yield found in this study was much higher than those in other greenhouses and open fields mao et al 2003 yuan et al 2006 wan et al 2010 rahil and qanadillo 2015 abdalhi et al 2016 hossain et al 2018 one main reason for this is that the soil water was controlled at an optimal level 10 20 kpa in this experiment shock and wang 2011 summarized the soil water potential of different crops and suggested controlling the soil water potential at higher than 15 30 kpa for cucumber plants with drip irrigation rahil and qanadillo 2015 reported that a controlled soil matric potential higher than 50 60 kpa could reduce cucumber yield by 24 compared to the highest value they obtained considering the high economic benefit and water use efficiency an smp threshold of 15 20 kpa is recommended for cucumber cultivation in drip irrigated greenhouses in north china designed wetting depth depends on the main root distribution coupling root distribution and irrigation water distribution in soil could greatly improve irrigation efficiency and reduce water loss or crop water stress this study show cucumber root mainly develops within the upper 20 cm depth when soil water is sufficient fig 2 similarly chen et al 2008 reported that approximately 95 cucumber root horizontally distributed within 0 15 cm region around the stem and approximately 90 in upper 20 cm depth under drip irrigation and zhang et al 2013 found approximately 70 cucumber root distributed in the upper 15 cm soil layer and 90 in the upper 30 cm soil layer therefore we suggested taking the wetting depth as 20 cm for calculating water amount at each irrigation event under drip irrigation 5 conclusion in this study a three season experiment was conducted in a solar greenhouse to investigate cucumber yield revenue and water use efficiency under three drip irrigation regimes and local furrow irrigation conditions the main results are as follows 1 the total cucumber yield and revenue over the three seasons were the highest in the t1 treatment and were higher by 2 2 4 3 and 4 4 than those in t2 t3 and ck respectively however the total cucumber yield and revenue were not significantly f 0 05 different among the four treatments 2 the irrigation amount in ck was the highest and was 126 188 and 204 higher than that in t1 t2 and t3 respectively this resulted in the lowest ie of 0 46 in ck and ies of 1 03 1 31 and 1 38 in t1 t2 and t3 respectively this means that more than 54 of irrigation water was lost in ck however all irrigation amount was used for crop evapotranspiration in drip irrigation 3 irrigation water productivity generally decreased with the increasing soil matric potential in the drip irrigation plot and all wpi values in the drip irrigation plot were 36 103 higher than that in ck similarly the three economic irrigation water productivities was the largest at t3 followed by t2 and t3 and those at ck was the lowest 4 a soil matric potential threshold of 15 20 kpa and wetting depth of 20 cm are recommended for cucumber cultivation in drip irrigated greenhouses in north china based on a full consideration of the economic benefits and water productivity

10382,the accurate and efficient management of irrigation and fertilizer is essential for the effective intensive production of greenhouse cherry tomato in this study we evaluated the effects of irrigation and fertilizer combinations on yield growth and nutritional and taste quality of cherry tomato more specifically we applied a quadratic orthogonal rotation combination design with four experimental factors at five levels 1 68 1 0 1 1 68 for a total of 23 treatments over two consecutive growing seasons in 2018 a multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation mfce was constructed including four factors and 14 subfactors as well as a water and fertilizer multi factor regulation model for the integrated growth of cherry tomato single experimental factor effects included irrigation in the spring season 2018s with the other experimental factors following a downward opening parabola with integrated cherry tomato growth for both seasons the integrated growth increased with irrigation and exhibited a rise and subsequent fall with phosphate p2o5 and potash k2o in 2018s as well as with irrigation and nitrogen n levels in the fall season 2018 f the experimental factor interaction values of 1 68 for irrigation 1978 0 m3 ha 0 94 for n 482 2 kg ha 0 69 for p2o5 104 4 kg ha and 0 65 for k2o 181 3 kg ha were observed to be optimal for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018s the corresponding combination for 2018 f was determined as 0 70 for irrigation 1082 9 m3 ha 0 51 for n 287 9 kg ha 0 for p2o5 126 5 kg ha and 0 41 for k2o 159 7 kg ha furthermore the irrigation n p2o5 and k2o intervals that maximized cherry tomato growth over the two seasons were as follows i 1780 2 1978 0 m3 ha 434 0 482 2 kg ha 94 0 104 4 kg ha and 163 2 181 3 kg ha for 2018s and 974 6 1082 9 m3 ha 259 1 287 9 kg ha 113 9 126 5 kg ha and 143 7 159 7 kg ha for 2018 f respectively comprehensively understanding the growth of cherry tomato can potentially enhance cherry tomato production in the arid regions of northwestern china keywords lycopersicon esculentum m water and fertilizer fuzzy algorithm comprehensive model simulated optimization 1 introduction the accurate and efficient usage of water and fertilizer has become a major concern over the past decade mutambara et al 2016 in 2015 the ministry of agriculture of china in conjunction with the eight departments of the chinese government released the national agricultural sustainable development plan for 2015 2030 china 2015 the plan emphasized the need for economical efficient water and fertilizer management in agricultural production in order to ensure crop yield and quality uncontrolled irrigation and blind fertilization result in serious water waste low fertilizer utilization groundwater pollution and soil salinization consequently constituting a considerable proportion of production costs thompson et al 2007 min et al 2011 thus over the past decade attention has been focused on the rapid development of water saving irrigation strategies as well as a method for precise fertilizer applications in greenhouse crop management parry et al 2005 topcu et al 2007 cherry tomato is a high grade popular horticultural crop due to its high soluble solid content and unique aroma and taste beckles 2012 liu et al 2018 water and fertilizer are two important factors that ensure the yield growth and quality of cherry tomatoes brauman et al 2013 duncan et al 2018 efficient irrigation ensures the growth of crops particularly as crop sensitivity to moisture content directly affects its physiological metabolic processes bajji et al 2001 christmann et al 2007 when irrigation is lacking the chemical environment of the roots of the crop will change thus altering the yield and quality of the aboveground fruit coyago cruz et al 2019 hou et al 2019 meanwhile an excessive water supply will weaken the active oxygen metabolism of the crop which will consequently negatively affect the yield and quality of the fruit lin et al 2004 n p and k fertilizers are the most basic three elements required by crops and are pivotal for the successful implementation of nutrient management practices in crop production systems han et al 2011 dordas and sioulas 2008 found that increasing n can affect yield photosynthetic efficiency and the physiology of safflower carthamus tinctorius l under rainfed conditions rehim et al 2012 used freundlich model to evaluated p application methods and found that increasing the p rate up to 104 kg ha improved the grain yield wang et al 2009 used pot experiment to determine the effects of k fertilizer on the taste compounds of fresh tomato fruits and observed that the concentration of titratable acidity increased with k supply increasing the amount of fertilization was found to increase the content of vitamin c vc and nitrate in the fruit however it also reduced the tssc content thus deteriorating the taste of the fruit thus the optimal water and fertilizer amounts vary with indicator and must be balanced in order to optimize the integrated growth of cherry tomato numerous techniques have been applied to evaluate the growth of crops for example the use of questionnaires grey relational analysis gra game theory and principal components analysis pca have been widely used in the evaluation of crop growth and development wei et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 however some methods are influenced by human factors while others base their evaluations on raw data resulting in uncertainties in the final evaluation results wang et al 2011 zhong et al 2017 furthermore the optimal amounts of water and fertilizer for cherry tomato vary with indicator mori et al 2008 zeng et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to coordinate the response of multiple indicators of cherry tomato growth with water and fertilizer management the multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation mfce framework is a fuzzy algorithm that combines qualitative and quantitative data to increase precision thus obtaining broader and more accurate evaluation results compared to the aforementioned methods yao et al 2019 proposed a fuzzy system based on eight environmental conditions of induced landslide disasters whereby five landslide risk factors from a multi level analysis system were employed for the mfce system zhou et al 2014 used a multi level multi factor and non structural fuzzy optimum decision model for the optimal selection of compact heat exchangers including six design projects and eight influencing factors the model was able to successfully cover the majority of the effective factors and determine the optimal design projects the application of mfce can achieve robust results due its superiority in dealing with multiple indicators based on the limitations in the current literature the current study has the following aims 1 to establish a scientific evaluation system for the yield growth and quality of cherry tomatoes through the multilevel fuzzy evaluation method and to determine the integrated growth of cherry tomato in different seasons 2 to explore the response of integrated cherry tomato growth to several single factors and the interaction of two and three factors in different seasons and 3 to determine the optimal water and fertilizer combination for the integrated growth of cherry tomato over seasons the optimal amounts of irrigation and fertilization were obtained based on the comprehensive consideration of multiple indicators from different factors this strategy is able to overcome the bias of the results from single type indicators or single evaluation methods and can support the decision system of cherry tomato production in northwestern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and crop the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse over two consecutive growing seasons 2018 march july denoted as 2018s and 2018 august december denoted 2018 f in the northwest a f university campus latitude n34 16 longitude e108 02 altitude 450 m of yangling shaanxi province china based on the koppen climate classification this region is categorized as a cold temperate zone dwa and experiences dry winters the greenhouse was made of a steel frame 100 m 17 m with a double layer polyethylene sheet placed on the surface and an east west orientation the crop rows were oriented in the north south direction in order to eliminate test errors caused by the greenhouse microclimate the test plot was set in the south span and four rows of protection were planted close to the exit and the innermost side the physical and chemical properties of the test soil of the two seasons were listed in table 1 cherry tomato seedlings lycopersicon esculentum m fenmei 1 were planted in the field on march 15 2018 and subsequently uprooted on july 20 2018 in the 2018s season for the 2018 f season the seeds were planted on august 10 2018 and uprooted on december 10 2018 drip irrigation under the membrane was used with a drip tape spacing 0 5 m flow rate 1 5 l h in order to reduce evapotranspiration and attain irrigation retention the plant spacing of the cherry tomatoes was consistent with the spacing of the drip tape each cherry tomato plant was fixed in a vertical direction with a nylon rope based on the production cycle of local farmers we retained the fruit of the 7 th and 5 th cherry tomato panicles in 2018s and 2018 f respectively as this cherry tomato variety is an infinite growth type we cut off the growth points of the cherry tomatoes following the flower bud differentiation of the 7 th and 5 th panicle in order to prevent the growth of new flower spikes furthermore we cut the side branches every 2 3 days to limit nutrient diversion these side branches were then used to measure total biomass 2 2 experimental design the experiments were conducted using a quadratic orthogonal rotation combination design implemented 1 2 with four experimental factors at five levels 23 treatments in total irrigation n p and k fertilizer levels were defined as the experimental factors table 2 all treatments were conducted using a completely randomized block design in three replicates each treated plot was separated by a 0 1 mm black plastic film in order to prevent the influence of water and fertilizer side leakage each treated plot 9 m long and 1 2 m wide was planted with 32 cherry tomato plants a base fertilizer including all p fertilizers superphosphate and quarter of total n fertilizer urea and k fertilizer potassium sulfate was initially applied to the planting ridges of each treated plot before the plants were planted all treated plots were then irrigated to field capacity at flowering varying amounts of irrigation water and fertilizers were applied to all treated plots the total irrigation and fertilizer amounts are reported in table 3 the irrigation period was every 2 3 days for 2018s and 3 5 days for 2018 f note that on rainy days no irrigation was conducted irrigation volumes were recorded with a hall digital display electronic flowmeter k24 lan bao technology co ltd china at the head of each irrigation treatment fertilizers were applied using high frequency drip fertigation farneselli et al 2015 the n and k fertilizers were first dissolved in a fertilizer facility before their application to the plant roots the fertilizers were applied seven times in 2018s and five times in 2018 f when all fruit bunches were inflated 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 meteorological data meteorological data was recorded by a small weather station

and maximum measurable weight of 500 g 2 3 3 growth data the total dry biomass of the cherry tomato was taken as the sum of the root stem leave and fruit after transplanting the entire cherry tomato was placed into an oven temperature control range of 50 300 c volume of 650 l over 105 c for 40 min followed by 70 c until a constant weight was reached the total dry biomass was then weighed the stems and leaves of the marked plants were collected in the field to measure the corresponding dry biomass which was then added to the total dry biomass of the plants the net photosynthetic rate was determined using an li 6800 portable photosynthetic apparatus li cor usa during the 4 th panicle 2018s and 3 rd panicle 2018 f ripening period total n and p levels were measured using an aa3 high

the cherry tomato 4 th panicle 2018s and 3 rd panicle 2018 f reached maturity we selected 18 fruits in each of the three replicates of each treatment six per replicate in order to evaluate the taste quality of the cherry tomato it is worth noting that all fruits were red and unsoftened with a quality of 18 1 g 2 4 multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model 2 4 1 construction of fuzzy evaluation factor and subfactor sets 1 all cherry tomato indicators were categorized into the following factors yield growth nutritional quality and taste quality 5 u i u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 where u1 u 4 are the yield growth and nutritional and taste quality indicators respectively 2 all secondary indicators were classified and denoted as subfactors more specifically fruit number per plant sfw g and yield t ha were classified as yield indicators u1 while total biomass g net photosynthetic rate μmol m2 s and total n p k mg g were classified as growth indicators u2 vc mg 100 g and lycopene mg kg were classified as nutritional quality indicators u3 and tssc oa tss and sar were classified as taste quality indicators u4 6 u i j u 1 u 11 u 12 u 13 u 2 u 21 u 22 u 23 u 24 u 25 u 3 u 31 u 32 u 4 u

and its relevant subfactors had a corresponding set of evaluation values the test consisted of 23 treatments generating 23 evaluation values as defined below 7 v i v 1 v 2 v 23 8 v i j v 1 v 2 v 23 where vi is the evaluation value of each factor and vij is the evaluation value of each subfactor 2 4 3 determination of multi level fuzzy evaluation factor weights 1 determination of factor weights by analytic hierarchy process ahp ahp is currently the most commonly applied evaluation method because it can systematically evaluate objects using simple calculation methods in particular ahp uses questionnaire results to establish a judgment matrix which decomposes the total decision into target factor and subfactor layers fig 1 by analyzing the relationship between the indicators and establishing a comparison matrix the complex problem is decomposed into several criteria and indicators table 5 each indicator is quantified and compared in order to determine the individual weight of each factor ai and subfactor aij in the hierarchical model detailed calculation methods are provided in the literature karami 2006 2 determination of subfactor weights via the entropy method the entropy method is commonly used to determine the objective weight of an indicator it can effectively reflect the information implied by the data and demonstrates strong operability for the calculation of subfactor weights using the entropy method the measured data of the subfactor set is initially standardized as follows 9 r j z x j z z 1 n x j z j 1 2 m z 1 2 n 0 r i j 1 where xjz is the measured data m is the number of evaluation indicators and n is the number of evaluation objects the information entropy of the subfactor set is then calculated in particular the j th index information entropy eij is defined as 10 e i j ln n 1 z 1 n r j z ln r j z i 1 2 3 j 1 2 3 m where eij is the information entropy of the j th subfactor of the i th factor the entropy weight wij of the j th subfactor is subsequently determined as follows 11 w i j 1 e i j m j 1 m e i j 0 w i j 1 j 1 m w i j 1 3 calculation of multilevel fuzzy evaluation values the single level fuzzy evaluation of the factor sets is performed using the following formula 12 b i z w i j r j z w 11 w 12 w 1 m w 21 w 22 w 2 m w 31 w 32 w 3 m w 41 w 42 w 4 m r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n b 11 b 12 b 1 n b 21 b 22 b 2 n b 31 b 32 b 3 n b 41 b 42 b 4 n where biz is the fuzzy evaluation index of the i th factor set and rjz is standardized data moreover the quadratic fuzzy evaluation of the subfactor set described is as follows 13 b z a i b i z a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 b 11 b 12 b 1 n b 21 b 22 b 2 n b 31 b 32 b 3 n b 41 b 42 b 4 n b 1 b 2 b n where bz refers to the multilevel comprehensive fuzzy evaluation index of the z th treatment 2 5 data analysis excel office2016 microsoft corp usa was used to organize the data and determine the value of each process by taking the average of the three repetitions analysis was performed using the dps 7 05 data processing system software hangzhou ruifeng information technology co ltd china the ahp entropy and multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods were executed using matlab 2016 mathworks usa 3 results 3 1 multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of cherry tomato for the multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation analysis of cherry tomato the weight of factor ai in the first layer and the weight of subfactor wij in the second layer were calculated using ahp and the entropy method respectively table 6 these two sets of weights were then merged together the fuzzy evaluation values under all treatments are reported in table 7 the higher the fuzzy evaluation value of the treatment the better the overall growth of the treated cherry tomato results demonstrate that in 2018s t2 exhibited the highest evaluation value while t8 was associated with the lowest for 2018 f t19 and t7 demonstrated the maximum and minimum evaluation values respectively 3 2 integrated growth response of cherry tomato to water and fertilizer combinations the final cherry tomato multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation value was imported into dps for quadratic polynomial fitting the quadratic polynomial regression equation y1 for 2018s and y2 for 2018 f used to determine the effects on the integrated growth of cherry tomato from irrigation x1 n x2 p2o5 x3 and k2o x4 fertilizers is described as follows 14 y1 0 04677 0 00390x1 0 00201x2 0 00107x3 0 00013x4 0 00151x1 2 0 00107 x2 2 0 00218x3 2 0 00381x4 2 0 00114x1x3 0 00286x1x4 15 y2 0 04953 0

level p value 0 004 moreover the r2 of y2 was determined as 0 933 and the regression was significant at the 0 01 level p value 0 0001 this indicates that the regression models for both seasons are accurate and thus this regression model can be used to evaluate the effects of irrigation n p and k fertilizers on the integrated growth of cherry tomato 3 2 1 single experimental factors effects on the integrated growth of cherry tomato for the 2018s growing season the integrated growth of cherry tomatoes exhibited an approximately linear relationship with irrigation and a downward opening parabola relationship with n p2o5 and k2o the integrated growth evaluation value of cherry tomato gradually increased with irrigation levels indicating that increasing irrigation amounts was beneficial to the integrated growth of cherry tomato in addition the evaluation value gradually increased with n p2o5 and k2o levels below 0 94 482 2 kg ha 0 25 150 8 kg ha and 0 02 292 0 kg ha respectively when the elements exceeded these amounts the integrated growth evaluation value exhibited a downward trend fig 2 a in the 2018 f growing season the four factors exhibited a downward opening parabola relationship with the integrated growth of cherry tomato more specifically the integrated growth evaluation value of cherry tomato gradually increased with irrigation n p2o5 and k2o followed by a subsequent gradual decrease peak levels were observed at the 0 52 irrigation 1022 4 m3 ha 0 33 n 264 3 kg ha 0 05 p2o5 130 3 kg ha and 0 41 k2o 159 7 kg ha levels fig 2b 3 2 2 interaction effects on the integrated growth of cherry tomato in the 2018s growing season the irrigation p2o5 and irrigation k2o interactions were significant for the integrated growth evaluation value of cherry tomato in particular the evaluation value was observed to gradually increase with both irrigation and p2o5 followed by a rapid decrease with further increases of p2o5 maximum levels were observed as 1 68 irrigation 1978 0 m3 ha and 0 69 p2o5 104 4 kg ha fig 3 a the irrigation k2o interaction exhibited a similar trend with differing maximum levels irrigation 1 68 1978 0 m3 ha k2o 0 65 181 3 kg ha fig 3b for the 2018 f growing season the only observed significant interaction was that of irrigation n the evaluation value gradually increased and subsequently gradually decreased with irrigation n levels peak levels were observed at the 0 70 irrigation 1082 9m3 ha and 0 51 n 287 9 kg ha levels fig 4 3 2 3 three experimental factors interaction analysis for the integrated growth of cherry tomato irrigation n p2o5 and k2o were simulated using a three experimental factor combination with an additional factor at the 0 level figs 5 and 6 present the experimental factor coupling diagrams determined for the two seasons we analyzed the effect of the three experimental factors combinations on the integrated growth of cherry tomato at the 1 682 1 682 levels for the n p2o5 k2o combination in 2018s mid to high levels of n 0 94 mid to low levels of p2o5 0 69 and mid to low levels of k2o 0 65 were observed to be beneficial for the integrated growth of cherry tomato however the opposite was observed for very low or very high levels of n p2o5 and k2o fig 5a for the irrigation p2o5 k2o combination the evaluation value was optimal for high irrigation 1 68 and mid to low p2o5 0 69 and k2o levels 0 65 in contrast negative effects on the evaluation value were observed for lower irrigation higher p2o5 and lower k2o levels fig 5b in terms of the irrigation n k2o combination high irrigation 1 68 mid to high n 0 94 and mid to low k2o 0 65 levels were beneficial for the integrated growth of cherry tomato yet the opposite was observed for lower irrigation and n and higher lower k2o levels fig 5c the irrigation n p2o5 combination exhibits a similar trend to that of irrigation p2o5 k2o with the most favorable combination of the former for the integrated growth of cherry tomato given as high irrigation 1 68 mid to high n 0 94 and mid to low k2o 0 65 amounts fig 5d the results demonstrate that irrigation was more important than other factors for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018s for the 2018 f n p2o5 k2o combination mid to high n 0 51 medium p2o5 0 and mid to low k2o 0 41 levels were beneficial for the integrated growth of cherry tomato however at low n levels increasing p2o5 and k2o amounts did not increase the evaluation value this indicates that n played a vital role in the 2018 f integrated growth of cherry tomato while exceedingly low n levels had negative effects on integrated growth fig 6a the irrigation p2o5 k2o and irrigation p2o5 k2o combinations exhibited similar effects demonstrating that irrigation was also key for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018 f fig 6b in terms of the irrigation n k2o combination the evaluation value was optimized for mid to high irrigation 0 70 and n 0 51 and mid to low k2o 0 41 levels however at low levels of n increasing the amount of k failed to have a positive impact on the evaluation value this highlights the significant roles of irrigation and n for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018 f fig 6c the irrigation n p2o5 and irrigation n k2o combinations exhibited similar trends thus results demonstrate that irrigation and n were more important than p2o5 for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018 f fig 6d 3 3 optimal water and fertilizer measures for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in order to determine the optimum water and fertilizer combination for the integrated growth of cherry tomato the four experimental factor combination with the highest mfce value was determined using a simulation optimization 2018s 1 68 0 94 0 69 0 65 2018 f 0 70 0 51 0 0 41 the water and fertilizer intervals were set to more than 90 of the optimal value to ensure the applicability of the final results to actual production management scenarios from the simulation analysis the optimal strategy of water and fertilizer were determined as follows 2018s 1780 2 1978 0 m3 ha irrigation 434 0 482 2 kg ha n 94 0 104 4 kg ha p2o5 163 2 181 3 kg ha k2o 2018 f 974 6 1082 9 m3 ha irrigation 259 1 287 9 kg ha n 113 9 126 5 kg ha p2o5 143 7 159 7 kg ha k2o 4 discussion much research has evaluated single indicators via subjective or objective techniques however the comprehensive evaluation of multiple indicators is lacking more importantly the results of these studies only obtained the best treatment among all the treatments no further modeling to analyze which led to the results could not be accurate enough since the treatment is only an interval wang et al 2015 2017a hou et al 2019 keabetswe et al 2019 in the current study in order to coordinate the effects of various indicators on the integrated growth of cherry tomatoes the ahp and the entropy methods were employed to determine the weights of the factors and subfactors we then applied the fuzzy mathematics principle to perform mfce on the weights tables 6 and 7 and obtained the largest mfce value 2018s t10 2018 f t19 furthermore the regression model of irrigation n p2o5 k2o for cherry tomato was established according to the evaluation results and also the optimal water and fertilizer amounts were calculated by simulating the regression model therefore our proposed model can more accurately explain the water and fertilizer requirements for the integrated growth of cherry tomato across seasons yield and nutritional and taste quality are considered as the most important indicators in the production of cherry tomatoes moreover ensuring the growth of crops is also a crucial factor cole et al 2016 in the present study we determined that a high irrigation amount was required in 2018s for the integrated growth of cherry tomatoes yet for 2018 f this amount was significantly reduced fig 2 although high irrigation is not conducive to the comprehensive improvement of tomato quality favati et al 2009 de pascale et al 2016 sufficient irrigation is able to increase the yield and growth wang et al 2011 the difference in the amount of required irrigation between the two seasons may be attributed to temperature and relative humidity variations in the environment the average temperature of 2018s was 2 3 c higher than that of 2018 f however relative humidity differed by just 0 16 table 4 it is well known that temperature affects the transpiration of crops thus causing variations in the absorption of water by crops lechaudel et al 2013 wang et al 2017b this is consistent with our results the integrated growth evaluation values experienced a gradual increase and subsequent fall with n p2o5 and k2o in the two seasons fig 2 therefore the excessive or insufficient application of n p2o5 and k2o will have a negative impact on the integrated growth of cherry tomatoes which is consistent with several reports in the current literature ozores hampton et al 2015 wang and xing 2017 we also identified the significant interaction effects of irrigation p2o5 and irrigation k2o in 2018s while only the irrigation n combination was significant in 2018 f figs 3 and 4 trends of the three experimental factor combinations with integrated growth were similar within the same season although optimal values varied in addition n p2o5 and k2o variations were consistent in both seasons with the exception of irrigation yet optimal fertilizer values differed since the cherry tomato grow longer in 2018s figs 5 and 6 therefore the optimum absorption amount of n p2o5 and k2o was observed to be different in the two seasons yet their variation was consistent these findings also suggest that irrigation and fertilizer measures must be coordinated with specific goals due to the difference in amount of the irrigation and fertilizers in two seasons the results demonstrate that mfce can effectively weigh the cherry tomato yield growth parameters and quality to optimize the integrated growth of cherry tomato in different seasons the cherry tomato integrated growth indicators are a function of water and fertilizer combinations and thus the determined mfce values are also affected by these combinations therefore there is a lack of consistency in the conclusions of previous studies on the simulation optimization of such regression models gallardo et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 yang et al 2018 this can be attributed to the limited studies on the comprehensive evaluation of growth indicators as well as the influence of external factors such as cultivation facilities and the greenhouse microclimate 5 conclusion numerous indicators can be applied in order to evaluate the growth of cherry tomatoes yet for different single indicators the optimal solution is different we comprehensively evaluated cherry tomato yield growth and nutritional and taste quality using an integrated growth model based on mfce which subsequently increased the accuracy of the amount of irrigation and fertilizers we identified irrigation to play the most important role in the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018s while for 2018 f irrigation and n where the key indicators we determined the optimal water and fertilizer measures for two seasons using simulation analysis as follows irrigation n p2o5 k2o at 1780 2 1978 0 m3 ha 434 0 482 2 kg ha 94 0 104 4 kg ha 163 2 181 3 kg ha for 2018s and 974 6 1082 9 m3 ha 259 1 287 9 kg ha 113 9 126 5 kg ha 143 7 159 7 kg ha for 2018 f our results play an important role in guiding

10382,the accurate and efficient management of irrigation and fertilizer is essential for the effective intensive production of greenhouse cherry tomato in this study we evaluated the effects of irrigation and fertilizer combinations on yield growth and nutritional and taste quality of cherry tomato more specifically we applied a quadratic orthogonal rotation combination design with four experimental factors at five levels 1 68 1 0 1 1 68 for a total of 23 treatments over two consecutive growing seasons in 2018 a multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation mfce was constructed including four factors and 14 subfactors as well as a water and fertilizer multi factor regulation model for the integrated growth of cherry tomato single experimental factor effects included irrigation in the spring season 2018s with the other experimental factors following a downward opening parabola with integrated cherry tomato growth for both seasons the integrated growth increased with irrigation and exhibited a rise and subsequent fall with phosphate p2o5 and potash k2o in 2018s as well as with irrigation and nitrogen n levels in the fall season 2018 f the experimental factor interaction values of 1 68 for irrigation 1978 0 m3 ha 0 94 for n 482 2 kg ha 0 69 for p2o5 104 4 kg ha and 0 65 for k2o 181 3 kg ha were observed to be optimal for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018s the corresponding combination for 2018 f was determined as 0 70 for irrigation 1082 9 m3 ha 0 51 for n 287 9 kg ha 0 for p2o5 126 5 kg ha and 0 41 for k2o 159 7 kg ha furthermore the irrigation n p2o5 and k2o intervals that maximized cherry tomato growth over the two seasons were as follows i 1780 2 1978 0 m3 ha 434 0 482 2 kg ha 94 0 104 4 kg ha and 163 2 181 3 kg ha for 2018s and 974 6 1082 9 m3 ha 259 1 287 9 kg ha 113 9 126 5 kg ha and 143 7 159 7 kg ha for 2018 f respectively comprehensively understanding the growth of cherry tomato can potentially enhance cherry tomato production in the arid regions of northwestern china keywords lycopersicon esculentum m water and fertilizer fuzzy algorithm comprehensive model simulated optimization 1 introduction the accurate and efficient usage of water and fertilizer has become a major concern over the past decade mutambara et al 2016 in 2015 the ministry of agriculture of china in conjunction with the eight departments of the chinese government released the national agricultural sustainable development plan for 2015 2030 china 2015 the plan emphasized the need for economical efficient water and fertilizer management in agricultural production in order to ensure crop yield and quality uncontrolled irrigation and blind fertilization result in serious water waste low fertilizer utilization groundwater pollution and soil salinization consequently constituting a considerable proportion of production costs thompson et al 2007 min et al 2011 thus over the past decade attention has been focused on the rapid development of water saving irrigation strategies as well as a method for precise fertilizer applications in greenhouse crop management parry et al 2005 topcu et al 2007 cherry tomato is a high grade popular horticultural crop due to its high soluble solid content and unique aroma and taste beckles 2012 liu et al 2018 water and fertilizer are two important factors that ensure the yield growth and quality of cherry tomatoes brauman et al 2013 duncan et al 2018 efficient irrigation ensures the growth of crops particularly as crop sensitivity to moisture content directly affects its physiological metabolic processes bajji et al 2001 christmann et al 2007 when irrigation is lacking the chemical environment of the roots of the crop will change thus altering the yield and quality of the aboveground fruit coyago cruz et al 2019 hou et al 2019 meanwhile an excessive water supply will weaken the active oxygen metabolism of the crop which will consequently negatively affect the yield and quality of the fruit lin et al 2004 n p and k fertilizers are the most basic three elements required by crops and are pivotal for the successful implementation of nutrient management practices in crop production systems han et al 2011 dordas and sioulas 2008 found that increasing n can affect yield photosynthetic efficiency and the physiology of safflower carthamus tinctorius l under rainfed conditions rehim et al 2012 used freundlich model to evaluated p application methods and found that increasing the p rate up to 104 kg ha improved the grain yield wang et al 2009 used pot experiment to determine the effects of k fertilizer on the taste compounds of fresh tomato fruits and observed that the concentration of titratable acidity increased with k supply increasing the amount of fertilization was found to increase the content of vitamin c vc and nitrate in the fruit however it also reduced the tssc content thus deteriorating the taste of the fruit thus the optimal water and fertilizer amounts vary with indicator and must be balanced in order to optimize the integrated growth of cherry tomato numerous techniques have been applied to evaluate the growth of crops for example the use of questionnaires grey relational analysis gra game theory and principal components analysis pca have been widely used in the evaluation of crop growth and development wei et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 however some methods are influenced by human factors while others base their evaluations on raw data resulting in uncertainties in the final evaluation results wang et al 2011 zhong et al 2017 furthermore the optimal amounts of water and fertilizer for cherry tomato vary with indicator mori et al 2008 zeng et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to coordinate the response of multiple indicators of cherry tomato growth with water and fertilizer management the multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation mfce framework is a fuzzy algorithm that combines qualitative and quantitative data to increase precision thus obtaining broader and more accurate evaluation results compared to the aforementioned methods yao et al 2019 proposed a fuzzy system based on eight environmental conditions of induced landslide disasters whereby five landslide risk factors from a multi level analysis system were employed for the mfce system zhou et al 2014 used a multi level multi factor and non structural fuzzy optimum decision model for the optimal selection of compact heat exchangers including six design projects and eight influencing factors the model was able to successfully cover the majority of the effective factors and determine the optimal design projects the application of mfce can achieve robust results due its superiority in dealing with multiple indicators based on the limitations in the current literature the current study has the following aims 1 to establish a scientific evaluation system for the yield growth and quality of cherry tomatoes through the multilevel fuzzy evaluation method and to determine the integrated growth of cherry tomato in different seasons 2 to explore the response of integrated cherry tomato growth to several single factors and the interaction of two and three factors in different seasons and 3 to determine the optimal water and fertilizer combination for the integrated growth of cherry tomato over seasons the optimal amounts of irrigation and fertilization were obtained based on the comprehensive consideration of multiple indicators from different factors this strategy is able to overcome the bias of the results from single type indicators or single evaluation methods and can support the decision system of cherry tomato production in northwestern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and crop the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse over two consecutive growing seasons 2018 march july denoted as 2018s and 2018 august december denoted 2018 f in the northwest a f university campus latitude n34 16 longitude e108 02 altitude 450 m of yangling shaanxi province china based on the koppen climate classification this region is categorized as a cold temperate zone dwa and experiences dry winters the greenhouse was made of a steel frame 100 m 17 m with a double layer polyethylene sheet placed on the surface and an east west orientation the crop rows were oriented in the north south direction in order to eliminate test errors caused by the greenhouse microclimate the test plot was set in the south span and four rows of protection were planted close to the exit and the innermost side the physical and chemical properties of the test soil of the two seasons were listed in table 1 cherry tomato seedlings lycopersicon esculentum m fenmei 1 were planted in the field on march 15 2018 and subsequently uprooted on july 20 2018 in the 2018s season for the 2018 f season the seeds were planted on august 10 2018 and uprooted on december 10 2018 drip irrigation under the membrane was used with a drip tape spacing 0 5 m flow rate 1 5 l h in order to reduce evapotranspiration and attain irrigation retention the plant spacing of the cherry tomatoes was consistent with the spacing of the drip tape each cherry tomato plant was fixed in a vertical direction with a nylon rope based on the production cycle of local farmers we retained the fruit of the 7 th and 5 th cherry tomato panicles in 2018s and 2018 f respectively as this cherry tomato variety is an infinite growth type we cut off the growth points of the cherry tomatoes following the flower bud differentiation of the 7 th and 5 th panicle in order to prevent the growth of new flower spikes furthermore we cut the side branches every 2 3 days to limit nutrient diversion these side branches were then used to measure total biomass 2 2 experimental design the experiments were conducted using a quadratic orthogonal rotation combination design implemented 1 2 with four experimental factors at five levels 23 treatments in total irrigation n p and k fertilizer levels were defined as the experimental factors table 2 all treatments were conducted using a completely randomized block design in three replicates each treated plot was separated by a 0 1 mm black plastic film in order to prevent the influence of water and fertilizer side leakage each treated plot 9 m long and 1 2 m wide was planted with 32 cherry tomato plants a base fertilizer including all p fertilizers superphosphate and quarter of total n fertilizer urea and k fertilizer potassium sulfate was initially applied to the planting ridges of each treated plot before the plants were planted all treated plots were then irrigated to field capacity at flowering varying amounts of irrigation water and fertilizers were applied to all treated plots the total irrigation and fertilizer amounts are reported in table 3 the irrigation period was every 2 3 days for 2018s and 3 5 days for 2018 f note that on rainy days no irrigation was conducted irrigation volumes were recorded with a hall digital display electronic flowmeter k24 lan bao technology co ltd china at the head of each irrigation treatment fertilizers were applied using high frequency drip fertigation farneselli et al 2015 the n and k fertilizers were first dissolved in a fertilizer facility before their application to the plant roots the fertilizers were applied seven times in 2018s and five times in 2018 f when all fruit bunches were inflated 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 meteorological data meteorological data was recorded by a small weather station hobo event data logger onset computer corp usa located inside the greenhouse one digit after the decimal point temperature c and relative humidity were simultaneously logged every 15 min table 4 2 3 2 yield data the single fruit weight sfw was measured when the fruit was ripe and the number of fruit per plant was recorded during the ripening period of the cherry tomato when fruit maturity was consistent the yield was recorded at intervals of 3 4 days ten plants were labeled in each plot to determine the yield of the cherry tomato the fruit was weighed using a balance with a 0 01 g accuracy and maximum measurable weight of 500 g 2 3 3 growth data the total dry biomass of the cherry tomato was taken as the sum of the root stem leave and fruit after transplanting the entire cherry tomato was placed into an oven temperature control range of 50 300 c volume of 650 l over 105 c for 40 min followed by 70 c until a constant weight was reached the total dry biomass was then weighed the stems and leaves of the marked plants were collected in the field to measure the corresponding dry biomass which was then added to the total dry biomass of the plants the net photosynthetic rate was determined using an li 6800 portable photosynthetic apparatus li cor usa during the 4 th panicle 2018s and 3 rd panicle 2018 f ripening period total n and p levels were measured using an aa3 high

roots stems leaves and fruits total biomass and total element amounts were measured at the end of fruit harvesting and measurements were repeated three times 2 3 4 nutritional quality of fruit vitamin c vc concentrations were determined via molybdenum blue colorimetry following the addition of oxalic acid edta solution to the fruit and the subsequent grinding the homogenate was centrifuged and the supernatant was extracted a uv 2500 spectrophotometer shimadzu corporation japan was then used to compare colors the final value of vc was calculated as follows 1 v c m g 100 g c v t v s f w 100 where

the cherry tomato 4 th panicle 2018s and 3 rd panicle 2018 f reached maturity we selected 18 fruits in each of the three replicates of each treatment six per replicate in order to evaluate the taste quality of the cherry tomato it is worth noting that all fruits were red and unsoftened with a quality of 18 1 g 2 4 multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model 2 4 1 construction of fuzzy evaluation factor and subfactor sets 1 all cherry tomato indicators were categorized into the following factors yield growth nutritional quality and taste quality 5 u i u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 where u1 u 4 are the yield growth and nutritional and taste quality indicators respectively 2 all secondary indicators were classified and denoted as subfactors more specifically fruit number per plant sfw g and yield t ha were classified as yield indicators u1 while total biomass g net photosynthetic rate μmol m2 s and total n p k mg g were classified as growth indicators u2 vc mg 100 g and lycopene mg kg were classified as nutritional quality indicators u3 and tssc oa tss and sar were classified as taste quality indicators u4 6 u i j u 1 u 11 u 12 u 13 u 2 u 21 u 22 u 23 u 24 u 25 u 3 u 31 u 32 u 4 u

and its relevant subfactors had a corresponding set of evaluation values the test consisted of 23 treatments generating 23 evaluation values as defined below 7 v i v 1 v 2 v 23 8 v i j v 1 v 2 v 23 where vi is the evaluation value of each factor and vij is the evaluation value of each subfactor 2 4 3 determination of multi level fuzzy evaluation factor weights 1 determination of factor weights by analytic hierarchy process ahp ahp is currently the most commonly applied evaluation method because it can systematically evaluate objects using simple calculation methods in particular ahp uses questionnaire results to establish a judgment matrix which decomposes the total decision into target factor and subfactor layers fig 1 by analyzing the relationship between the indicators and establishing a comparison matrix the complex problem is decomposed into several criteria and indicators table 5 each indicator is quantified and compared in order to determine the individual weight of each factor ai and subfactor aij in the hierarchical model detailed calculation methods are provided in the literature karami 2006 2 determination of subfactor weights via the entropy method the entropy method is commonly used to determine the objective weight of an indicator it can effectively reflect the information implied by the data and demonstrates strong operability for the calculation of subfactor weights using the entropy method the measured data of the subfactor set is initially standardized as follows 9 r j z x j z z 1 n x j z j 1 2 m z 1 2 n 0 r i j 1 where xjz is the measured data m is the number of evaluation indicators and n is the number of evaluation objects the information entropy of the subfactor set is then calculated in particular the j th index information entropy eij is defined as 10 e i j ln n 1 z 1 n r j z ln r j z i 1 2 3 j 1 2 3 m where eij is the information entropy of the j th subfactor of the i th factor the entropy weight wij of the j th subfactor is subsequently determined as follows 11 w i j 1 e i j m j 1 m e i j 0 w i j 1 j 1 m w i j 1 3 calculation of multilevel fuzzy evaluation values the single level fuzzy evaluation of the factor sets is performed using the following formula 12 b i z w i j r j z w 11 w 12 w 1 m w 21 w 22 w 2 m w 31 w 32 w 3 m w 41 w 42 w 4 m r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n b 11 b 12 b 1 n b 21 b 22 b 2 n b 31 b 32 b 3 n b 41 b 42 b 4 n where biz is the fuzzy evaluation index of the i th factor set and rjz is standardized data moreover the quadratic fuzzy evaluation of the subfactor set described is as follows 13 b z a i b i z a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 b 11 b 12 b 1 n b 21 b 22 b 2 n b 31 b 32 b 3 n b 41 b 42 b 4 n b 1 b 2 b n where bz refers to the multilevel comprehensive fuzzy evaluation index of the z th treatment 2 5 data analysis excel office2016 microsoft corp usa was used to organize the data and determine the value of each process by taking the average of the three repetitions analysis was performed using the dps 7 05 data processing system software hangzhou ruifeng information technology co ltd china the ahp entropy and multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods were executed using matlab 2016 mathworks usa 3 results 3 1 multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of cherry tomato for the multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation analysis of cherry tomato the weight of factor ai in the first layer and the weight of subfactor wij in the second layer were calculated using ahp and the entropy method respectively table 6 these two sets of weights were then merged together the fuzzy evaluation values under all treatments are reported in table 7 the higher the fuzzy evaluation value of the treatment the better the overall growth of the treated cherry tomato results demonstrate that in 2018s t2 exhibited the highest evaluation value while t8 was associated with the lowest for 2018 f t19 and t7 demonstrated the maximum and minimum evaluation values respectively 3 2 integrated growth response of cherry tomato to water and fertilizer combinations the final cherry tomato multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation value was imported into dps for quadratic polynomial fitting the quadratic polynomial regression equation y1 for 2018s and y2 for 2018 f used to determine the effects on the integrated growth of cherry tomato from irrigation x1 n x2 p2o5 x3 and k2o x4 fertilizers is described as follows 14 y1 0 04677 0 00390x1 0 00201x2 0 00107x3 0 00013x4 0 00151x1 2 0 00107 x2 2 0 00218x3 2 0 00381x4 2 0 00114x1x3 0 00286x1x4 15 y2 0 04953 0

level p value 0 004 moreover the r2 of y2 was determined as 0 933 and the regression was significant at the 0 01 level p value 0 0001 this indicates that the regression models for both seasons are accurate and thus this regression model can be used to evaluate the effects of irrigation n p and k fertilizers on the integrated growth of cherry tomato 3 2 1 single experimental factors effects on the integrated growth of cherry tomato for the 2018s growing season the integrated growth of cherry tomatoes exhibited an approximately linear relationship with irrigation and a downward opening parabola relationship with n p2o5 and k2o the integrated growth evaluation value of cherry tomato gradually increased with irrigation levels indicating that increasing irrigation amounts was beneficial to the integrated growth of cherry tomato in addition the evaluation value gradually increased with n p2o5 and k2o levels below 0 94 482 2 kg ha 0 25 150 8 kg ha and 0 02 292 0 kg ha respectively when the elements exceeded these amounts the integrated growth evaluation value exhibited a downward trend fig 2 a in the 2018 f growing season the four factors exhibited a downward opening parabola relationship with the integrated growth of cherry tomato more specifically the integrated growth evaluation value of cherry tomato gradually increased with irrigation n p2o5 and k2o followed by a subsequent gradual decrease peak levels were observed at the 0 52 irrigation 1022 4 m3 ha 0 33 n 264 3 kg ha 0 05 p2o5 130 3 kg ha and 0 41 k2o 159 7 kg ha levels fig 2b 3 2 2 interaction effects on the integrated growth of cherry tomato in the 2018s growing season the irrigation p2o5 and irrigation k2o interactions were significant for the integrated growth evaluation value of cherry tomato in particular the evaluation value was observed to gradually increase with both irrigation and p2o5 followed by a rapid decrease with further increases of p2o5 maximum levels were observed as 1 68 irrigation 1978 0 m3 ha and 0 69 p2o5 104 4 kg ha fig 3 a the irrigation k2o interaction exhibited a similar trend with differing maximum levels irrigation 1 68 1978 0 m3 ha k2o 0 65 181 3 kg ha fig 3b for the 2018 f growing season the only observed significant interaction was that of irrigation n the evaluation value gradually increased and subsequently gradually decreased with irrigation n levels peak levels were observed at the 0 70 irrigation 1082 9m3 ha and 0 51 n 287 9 kg ha levels fig 4 3 2 3 three experimental factors interaction analysis for the integrated growth of cherry tomato irrigation n p2o5 and k2o were simulated using a three experimental factor combination with an additional factor at the 0 level figs 5 and 6 present the experimental factor coupling diagrams determined for the two seasons we analyzed the effect of the three experimental factors combinations on the integrated growth of cherry tomato at the 1 682 1 682 levels for the n p2o5 k2o combination in 2018s mid to high levels of n 0 94 mid to low levels of p2o5 0 69 and mid to low levels of k2o 0 65 were observed to be beneficial for the integrated growth of cherry tomato however the opposite was observed for very low or very high levels of n p2o5 and k2o fig 5a for the irrigation p2o5 k2o combination the evaluation value was optimal for high irrigation 1 68 and mid to low p2o5 0 69 and k2o levels 0 65 in contrast negative effects on the evaluation value were observed for lower irrigation higher p2o5 and lower k2o levels fig 5b in terms of the irrigation n k2o combination high irrigation 1 68 mid to high n 0 94 and mid to low k2o 0 65 levels were beneficial for the integrated growth of cherry tomato yet the opposite was observed for lower irrigation and n and higher lower k2o levels fig 5c the irrigation n p2o5 combination exhibits a similar trend to that of irrigation p2o5 k2o with the most favorable combination of the former for the integrated growth of cherry tomato given as high irrigation 1 68 mid to high n 0 94 and mid to low k2o 0 65 amounts fig 5d the results demonstrate that irrigation was more important than other factors for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018s for the 2018 f n p2o5 k2o combination mid to high n 0 51 medium p2o5 0 and mid to low k2o 0 41 levels were beneficial for the integrated growth of cherry tomato however at low n levels increasing p2o5 and k2o amounts did not increase the evaluation value this indicates that n played a vital role in the 2018 f integrated growth of cherry tomato while exceedingly low n levels had negative effects on integrated growth fig 6a the irrigation p2o5 k2o and irrigation p2o5 k2o combinations exhibited similar effects demonstrating that irrigation was also key for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018 f fig 6b in terms of the irrigation n k2o combination the evaluation value was optimized for mid to high irrigation 0 70 and n 0 51 and mid to low k2o 0 41 levels however at low levels of n increasing the amount of k failed to have a positive impact on the evaluation value this highlights the significant roles of irrigation and n for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018 f fig 6c the irrigation n p2o5 and irrigation n k2o combinations exhibited similar trends thus results demonstrate that irrigation and n were more important than p2o5 for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018 f fig 6d 3 3 optimal water and fertilizer measures for the integrated growth of cherry tomato in order to determine the optimum water and fertilizer combination for the integrated growth of cherry tomato the four experimental factor combination with the highest mfce value was determined using a simulation optimization 2018s 1 68 0 94 0 69 0 65 2018 f 0 70 0 51 0 0 41 the water and fertilizer intervals were set to more than 90 of the optimal value to ensure the applicability of the final results to actual production management scenarios from the simulation analysis the optimal strategy of water and fertilizer were determined as follows 2018s 1780 2 1978 0 m3 ha irrigation 434 0 482 2 kg ha n 94 0 104 4 kg ha p2o5 163 2 181 3 kg ha k2o 2018 f 974 6 1082 9 m3 ha irrigation 259 1 287 9 kg ha n 113 9 126 5 kg ha p2o5 143 7 159 7 kg ha k2o 4 discussion much research has evaluated single indicators via subjective or objective techniques however the comprehensive evaluation of multiple indicators is lacking more importantly the results of these studies only obtained the best treatment among all the treatments no further modeling to analyze which led to the results could not be accurate enough since the treatment is only an interval wang et al 2015 2017a hou et al 2019 keabetswe et al 2019 in the current study in order to coordinate the effects of various indicators on the integrated growth of cherry tomatoes the ahp and the entropy methods were employed to determine the weights of the factors and subfactors we then applied the fuzzy mathematics principle to perform mfce on the weights tables 6 and 7 and obtained the largest mfce value 2018s t10 2018 f t19 furthermore the regression model of irrigation n p2o5 k2o for cherry tomato was established according to the evaluation results and also the optimal water and fertilizer amounts were calculated by simulating the regression model therefore our proposed model can more accurately explain the water and fertilizer requirements for the integrated growth of cherry tomato across seasons yield and nutritional and taste quality are considered as the most important indicators in the production of cherry tomatoes moreover ensuring the growth of crops is also a crucial factor cole et al 2016 in the present study we determined that a high irrigation amount was required in 2018s for the integrated growth of cherry tomatoes yet for 2018 f this amount was significantly reduced fig 2 although high irrigation is not conducive to the comprehensive improvement of tomato quality favati et al 2009 de pascale et al 2016 sufficient irrigation is able to increase the yield and growth wang et al 2011 the difference in the amount of required irrigation between the two seasons may be attributed to temperature and relative humidity variations in the environment the average temperature of 2018s was 2 3 c higher than that of 2018 f however relative humidity differed by just 0 16 table 4 it is well known that temperature affects the transpiration of crops thus causing variations in the absorption of water by crops lechaudel et al 2013 wang et al 2017b this is consistent with our results the integrated growth evaluation values experienced a gradual increase and subsequent fall with n p2o5 and k2o in the two seasons fig 2 therefore the excessive or insufficient application of n p2o5 and k2o will have a negative impact on the integrated growth of cherry tomatoes which is consistent with several reports in the current literature ozores hampton et al 2015 wang and xing 2017 we also identified the significant interaction effects of irrigation p2o5 and irrigation k2o in 2018s while only the irrigation n combination was significant in 2018 f figs 3 and 4 trends of the three experimental factor combinations with integrated growth were similar within the same season although optimal values varied in addition n p2o5 and k2o variations were consistent in both seasons with the exception of irrigation yet optimal fertilizer values differed since the cherry tomato grow longer in 2018s figs 5 and 6 therefore the optimum absorption amount of n p2o5 and k2o was observed to be different in the two seasons yet their variation was consistent these findings also suggest that irrigation and fertilizer measures must be coordinated with specific goals due to the difference in amount of the irrigation and fertilizers in two seasons the results demonstrate that mfce can effectively weigh the cherry tomato yield growth parameters and quality to optimize the integrated growth of cherry tomato in different seasons the cherry tomato integrated growth indicators are a function of water and fertilizer combinations and thus the determined mfce values are also affected by these combinations therefore there is a lack of consistency in the conclusions of previous studies on the simulation optimization of such regression models gallardo et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 yang et al 2018 this can be attributed to the limited studies on the comprehensive evaluation of growth indicators as well as the influence of external factors such as cultivation facilities and the greenhouse microclimate 5 conclusion numerous indicators can be applied in order to evaluate the growth of cherry tomatoes yet for different single indicators the optimal solution is different we comprehensively evaluated cherry tomato yield growth and nutritional and taste quality using an integrated growth model based on mfce which subsequently increased the accuracy of the amount of irrigation and fertilizers we identified irrigation to play the most important role in the integrated growth of cherry tomato in 2018s while for 2018 f irrigation and n where the key indicators we determined the optimal water and fertilizer measures for two seasons using simulation analysis as follows irrigation n p2o5 k2o at 1780 2 1978 0 m3 ha 434 0 482 2 kg ha 94 0 104 4 kg ha 163 2 181 3 kg ha for 2018s and 974 6 1082 9 m3 ha 259 1 287 9 kg ha 113 9 126 5 kg ha 143 7 159 7 kg ha for 2018 f our results play an important role in guiding irrigation and fertilization strategies on the efficient usage of irrigation n p2o5 and k2o in the arid regions of northwestern china declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there

10383,we investigate how user managed small scale irrigation can influence inclusive rural transformation cultivating inclusive rural transformation is key to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries but existing research rarely analyses the holistic impacts of rural development projects on this process we use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to rigorously measure impacts and uncover the causal pathways of a canal irrigation project for rice farmers in the philippines finding that positive impacts were heavily determined by market access and the strength of the local economy we also find limited impacts for poorer farmers located further downstream on the irrigation canals based on these findings we draw several lessons about the complementary conditions and support that are required in order for irrigation to be an effective tool in promoting inclusive rural transformation in developing countries keywords rural transformation small scale irrigation impact evaluation rice production philippines 1 introduction it is well documented that improved irrigation increases agricultural productivity but higher crop yields alone are not enough to drive transformational change for rural households lipton et al 2003 pinstrup andersen and shimokawa 2006 rural transformation refers to the transition of a low productivity labour intensive rural economy to one that is market oriented capital intensive and comprised of productive on and off farm activities timmer 2009 berdegué et al 2013 rising crop productivity is part of this transition but sustainable and inclusive rural transformation also involves changes in the composition of livelihood activities and continuous improvements in incomes assets off farm productivity social capital nutrition education and gender equity ifad 2016 fao 2017 by increasing and stabilising yields along with other mechanisms better irrigation has the potential to contribute to each of these aspects of inclusive rural transformation but empirical evidence on its wider impacts is scarce this paper addresses this research gap with an in depth impact evaluation of a small scale irrigation project for smallholder rice farmers in the philippines in a bid to inform ongoing efforts to shape and accelerate the most desirable forms of rural transformation in developing countries we focus on smallholder farmers as they constitute some of the world s poorest people and are particularly at risk of exclusion from the rural transformation process fao 2017 and focus on small scale irrigation in particular because the low cost of its construction and maintenance means it is well suited to supporting this group xie et al 2014 focusing on user managed irrigation systems also helps to fill a significant knowledge gap on the benefits of irrigation management transfer about which there remains considerable doubts senanayake et al 2015 we use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data from treatment and control households to analyse the project s impacts on a set of indicators within a novel inclusive rural transformation framework as part of the investigation we take advantage of the differences between the project regions to identify important contextual factors that shaped impacts to our knowledge this is the first impact evaluation study to apply an inclusive rural transformation framework in this manner the remainder of the paper first outlines the potential linkages between small scale irrigation and inclusive rural transformation around which the framework of impact indicators is based this is followed by an overview of the case study project details of the data and methodology a profile of the sample a presentation and discussion of the results and the conclusions and policy implications potential links between small scale irrigation and inclusive rural transformation there is a large body of evidence showing that well managed irrigation systems help farmers to increase their cropping intensity and cultivate year round leading to higher and more stable crop yields lipton et al 2003 hussain and hanjra 2004 pinstrup andersen and shimokawa 2006 this effect on agricultural production can contribute in turn to the rural transformation processes in several ways as evidenced during the green revolution for instance more reliable production can promote agricultural modernisation by increasing farmers incentives to adopt new technologies evenson and gollin 2003 estudillo and keijiro 2006 hazell 2009 improved irrigation could also promote higher value market oriented agricultural production by increasing farmers production capacity and marketable surplus and potentially by allowing farmers to grow cash crops that are hard to grow with rain fed irrigation namara et al 2010 burney and naylor 2012 in bangladesh for instance mottaleb et al 2015 find that better irrigation infrastructure increased rice farmers market integration thanks to their increased marketable surplus while in india mishra et al 2018 find a positive link between irrigation and contract farming among smallholders in addition more reliable and efficient crop production could also change risk attitudes and reduce labour requirements both of which may encourage farmers to advance into the type of productive off farm activities characteristic of a transforming economy freguin gresh et al 2012 as irrigation water can also be used to improve grazing lands and for other livestock needs better irrigation can especially encourage more livestock production a link supported by evidence from mali and nepal dillon 2011 adb 2012 although largely untested better irrigation could also theoretically contribute to improved nutrition education and social capital all key components of a sustainable rural transformation process better nutrition and food security may be achieved as households consume more fruits vegetables staples and livestock products thanks to their higher crop yields enhanced livestock production and greater market integration higher labour productivity and income as a result of better irrigation could also reduce the need for children to work on family farms leading to higher school enrolment and attendance fao 2012 an irrigation project in madagascar for instance was found to have increased incomes and as a result increased the amount that farmers spent on their children s education ring et al 2018 higher education also has the potential to in turn complement the impact of irrigation on productivity as part of a virtuous cycle hanjra et al 2009 social capital could be improved through user managed irrigation schemes a common aspect of small scale irrigation which can increase social cohesion and mutual support kähkönen 1999 an irrigation project in mali for instance found evidence of increased meal sharing as a form of risk protection among households with irrigation dillon 2011 as with education higher social capital can also feed back into the performance of the irrigation system by increasing collective action within user managed systems as has been found among water user associations in japan takayama et al 2018 the capacity of better irrigation to promote transformation that is inclusive lies in its potential benefits for smallholder farmers as well as women two of the groups most at risk of exclusion fao 2017 regarding smallholders small scale irrigation systems are cheaper to implement and maintain making them an accessible and sustainable option for these farmers among smallholders those located downstream who are usually the poorest and often suffer from overuse of water by those located upstream stand to benefit the most from more efficient and better managed canal systems namara et al 2010 darko et al 2016 moreover research shows that where there are low transmission losses and other supporting factors equitable irrigation systems are also the most productive for all users steiner and walter 1992 women could benefit through new economic opportunities as livelihoods are enhanced through the mechanisms discussed above however there is also potential for women to be left to tend the family farm while men pursue other high value activities smith 2004 slavchevska et al 2016 when they engage in democratically managed water user groups women could also improve their representation and responsibilities within their communities sargeson and jacka 2017 in practice however these groups tend to suffer from high levels of exclusion especially of women meinzen dick and zwarteveen 1998 hussain 2007 of the few existing studies that analyse the impact of irrigation on outcomes other than yields the findings are not all positive and some even demonstrate how irrigation can hinder the rural transformation process by making livelihoods more static studies of small scale irrigation projects for rice farmers in the philippines and india that compared treatment and control groups to measure impacts found that improved irrigation led beneficiaries to consolidate their livelihoods around rice production while control households diversified and were able to keep pace with the income improvements of beneficiaries world bank 2008 jica 2012 without sufficient gains from specialisation such an effect can hinder income growth and increase vulnerability to crop specific shocks thus reducing resilience and potentially hindering livelihood choices and technology adoption feder et al 1985 lin 2011 makate et al 2016 there is also evidence that a lack of crop diversity can have a negative effect on dietary diversity and nutrition sekabira and nalunga 2015 for the same projects in the philippines and india and another in madagascar impacts on inclusivity were also doubtful world bank 2008 jica 2012 ring et al 2018 in each case a failure of collective action and instances of elite capture within the user groups led to inequitable water distribution and hence increased inequality between up and downstream households this confirms a common concern about small scale canal irrigation that without effective institutions managing the systems the benefits of irrigation are likely to be unequal and captured by wealthier farmers located upstream magistro et al 2007 meinzen dick 2007 world bank 2008 burney and naylor 2012 irrigation governance is a contested issue and despite knowledge gaps and doubts over their effectiveness that are fuelled by findings such as those above there are growing calls for an increase irrigation management transfer particularly in africa and for water user groups to be provided with more support responsibility and involvement in policy formation senanayake et al 2015 mutambara et al 2016 ifad 2018 findings from the studies mentioned above indicate that contextual factors such as the strength of local institutions will be important in determining which of the potential positive and negative links between irrigation and rural transformation are realised the quality of local markets for inputs outputs and credit are also likely to play an important role shifts in livelihood activities and benefits from specialisation for instance cannot be supported through irrigation without market and value chain connectivity namara et al 2010 freguin gresh et al 2012 fao 2017 2 details of the case study project the irrigated rice production enhancement project irpep was implemented in region vi western visayas region viii eastern visayas and region x northern mindanao of the philippines between 2010 2015 with a budget of 25 million by the time of its completion the project had provided support to 109 communal irrigation systems cis and the irrigators associations ias that manage them covering 9 347 ha of land cis are externally initiated small scale canal diversion irrigation systems that cover areas no larger than 1 000 ha and account for around 35 per cent of the total irrigated land in the country nia 2017 for each cis there is an ia composed of farmers who use the system which is tasked with maintaining the system monitoring and policing water usage and collecting user fees the project targeted smallholders because they represent one of the country s poorest groups due mainly to their low productivity and vulnerability to frequent climatic shocks issues exacerbated by the low irrigation coverage in the country bordey et al 2016 irpep targeted cis that had inadequate or inefficient water supply but high potential for improvement and whose users had low income and crop productivity for each of these cis irpep extended the canals of the cis to cover more land repaired canals damaged by climatic shocks and lined canals with concrete to prevent water seepage in addition irpep provided training to ia officers to manage the system sustainably and equitably encouraged women s participation in ias and offered marketing facilitation services by lining the canals to reduce transmission losses and improving system management a key aim of the project was to improve water supply to households located downstream on the canals the three project regions have different characteristics that could influence the project s impacts in each area for instance region vi and viii are more at risk of climatic shocks compared to region x in fact region viii was very severely affected by super typhoon haiyan during the project s implementation which caused serious damage to infrastructure and strained local institutions to cope with the implications ultimately leading to them being excluded from this study so as not to distort the findings region x is much wealthier and its economy is mainly focused on cash crop production compared to region vi which is more focused on rice and livestock production and has a larger services sector psa 2016 despite being poorer region vi has experienced much larger poverty reduction in recent years while growth in region x has been less pro poor an issue attributed partly to the poor connectivity of households in rural areas neda 2017a b de la rosa 2018 3 data and methodology 3 1 data and indicators the quantitative data comes from a household questionnaire administered 18 months after irpep s completion between march and may 2017 the electronic questionnaire was administered in tagalog by a local data collection team after being piloted in two neutral areas in region x we use data from 580 households in region vi from 20 treatment and 20 control cis and 566 households in region x from 16 treatment and 17 control cis equally split between beneficiary and control households 1 1 the sample size was determined based on obtaining a minimum detectable effect size of 10 using the formula outlined in world bank 2007 several measures were taken during both the sampling and data analysis stages to obtain comparable treatment and control groups to measure irpep s impact in the sampling stage we first used propensity score matching psm to identify similar treatment and control cis from a longlist of all the cis in the two regions with the scores calculated to represent the likelihood of a cis being selected for irpep khandker et al 2010 these scores were created using pre project data linked to the project s selection criteria including the average yields of users distance to the regional capital and the percentage of the system that is operational by removing cis without at least one match in the opposite group we used the scores to create a shortlist of potential treatment and control cis from which we selected the final set for the sample with expert input from project staff as the project may have had a spillover effect on the local economy treatment and control cis were not selected from within the same barangay the sample was not separated at a higher administrative level such as at the municipality or provincial level because it was not expected that these spillover effects for small scale rice farmers in this timeframe would be powerful enough to effect the local economy outside of the barangay from the selected cis we randomly selected households from amongst the cis users for the household survey this was done using lists of cis members provided by the ia from which all members were assigned a number and then selected through a random number generator if a household was not available two more attempts were made to conduct the interview after which they were replaced with a new randomly selected household after the data was collected we verified the sample and removed 29 treatment households who still did not have access to rehabilitated irrigation and 195 control households who had already received similar irrigation support from the philippines government complementary qualitative data were collected through key informant interviews kiis and focus group discussions fgds this included a kii with the national project coordinator and one fgd with other project staff at the national level along with a kii and three fgds with regional staff in each of the three project regions in addition 12 fgds were held with officers from 6 treatment and 6 control ias of the selected cis and 12 kiis were also held with the presidents of the same 12 ias in order to test the potential linkages between irrigation and inclusive rural transformation outlined above we use the household dataset to create indicators relating to agricultural production income livelihood composition asset ownership nutrition social capital education and women s inclusion regarding agricultural productivity we focus on rice production given its importance for smallholder livelihoods and because too few households grew other crops to facilitate a meaningful analysis to represent asset ownership we create an index that incorporates ownership of a range of productive assets calculated using principle component analysis filmer and pritchett 2001 we also create an index for livestock ownership based on tropical livestock units jahnke 1982 household dietary diversity scores are used to assess impact on nutrition whereby a score is assigned based on the consumption of different food groups in the past 24 h fao 2010 to assess impacts by parcel location we compare key indicators from each impact domain for households who used only downstream parcels during the study period against households who used at least one up or midstream parcel this classification was chosen so as to focus on those households likely to be the poorest as all of their parcels are downstream although only a small proportion of households had a mix of up mid and downstream parcels 3 2 impact estimation methodology we estimate the average treatment effect on the treated atet for irpep using an inverse probability weighted regression adjustment ipwra approach an impact estimation method that improves the comparability of the treatment and control samples using both weighting and regression adjustment see wooldridge 2010 austin and stuart 2015 in this model all treatment households are assigned a weight of one and control households are assigned a weight that represents the inverse of the probability of their being a control household these probability weights are calculated in a similar way to the propensity scores created for the sample design whereby the likelihood of being in the treatment or control group is modelled based on pre project livelihood capacities and other factors likely to influence their participation 2 2 the variables used to the create the scores consisted of the age education and gender of the household head household size asset ownership at the start of the project climatic shocks in the past year number of ia members in the household amount of land owned and proportion of land owned up mid downstream on the irrigation canal using the inverse of the probability means that we assign greater weight to control households who better represent a common treatment household rather than a common control household we employ the ipwra model as it allows for the use of additional control variables within a regression framework which are important to incorporate in the case of detailed agricultural data and does not require the dropping of a large number of households as with some psm algorithms formally these weights are calculated as follows 1 i p w a t e t t p 1 t 1 p where t the treatment status 1 treated 0 control and p the probability of receiving the treatment they received given the set of weighting variables the next step is to run a regression adjustment model with the weights applied to each household separate models are run for the treatment and control groups and in each case an expected value for the impact indicator is estimated the formal specification of the regression model is as follows 2 y i β 0 β 1 t i σ x i j β 2 j e i where y is the outcome for household i for the impact indicator ti is the treatment status for household i xij represents an i x j matrix of control variables used in the model β 1 is the coefficient of the treatment indicator and β 2 j is a vector of coefficients to be estimated for each of the control variables βo is the constant and ei is the error term which was calculated using a cluster robust estimator at the province level cameron and miller 2015 control variables were chosen based on their likelihoods to have influenced the outcome variable while not having been affected by the project meaning that different sets of control variables were used depending on the outcome variable being analysed 3 3 control variables for each impact indicator were selected from the following list province location on irrigation canal distance from local market education of household head age of household head average age in household number of adults in household household size experiences drought flood pest outbreak shock in past year soil fertility hectares of land owned received training on rice production water management input subsidy received loan in past 12 months baseline asset index the final estimated impact the atet is then calculated as follows 3 a t e t y ˆ 1 y ˆ o where y ˆ 1 is the average expected outcome for the treatment households and y ˆ o is the average expected outcome for control households obtained from the regression in eq 2 above both the inverse probability weighting and regression adjustment components of the ipwra model can be used individually for this type of impact analysis but to produce consistent estimates the former is dependent on the weights being correctly specified and the latter is dependent on the correct specification of the regression model however the ipwra model only requires one of the two to be correctly specified for the estimates to be consistent therefore the model is classified as a doubly robust estimator tests of the effectiveness of the model indicate that we were able to further reduce the minor imbalances between treatment and control the households for the variables used to weight the sample the standardised mean difference smd was reduced from 0 09 to 0 07 and the variance ratio vr was reduced from 1 11 to 1 09 4 4 an smd of below 0 1 is recommended for a well balanced sample austin 2009 to test the sensitivity of the results to model specification the results were also verified using a secondary model based on a nearest neighbour psm algorithm austin 2011 which produced qualitatively similar results suggesting that our findings are consistent across model specifications 5 5 results from this secondary model are presented in appendix a 4 profile of the sample table 1 presents descriptive statistics on livelihood characteristics for the sample households in regions vi and x for both regions average incomes are both well below the national average of php140 259 as well as the regional averages of php76 459 for region vi and php120 799 for region x psa 2016 although income and land use in region vi are considerably lower than in region x rice production is widespread amongst the sample but average harvests are larger in region x and a much larger proportion of harvests are sold rather than consumed in this region although poorer the livelihoods of households in region vi are more diversified compared to households in region x with the latter more dependent on rice sales this diversity in region vi may be survival rather than opportunity based given their lower incomes lower land access and higher risk of climatic shocks ellis 2000 svodziwa 2018 conversely households in region x may show signs of transformation in terms of the benefits they are gaining from specialising in rice farming but they do not show signs of shifting into more lucrative on and off farm activities they also seem to face barriers to their rice marketing with further investigation finding that the majority of the rice sold by these farmers was unprocessed qualitative data from the region also highlights that cis in the region are located far from local government offices and trading centers a disconnection which may explain why their profile differs from their wealthier cash crop producing rural neighbours in the rest of the region 5 results and discussion 5 1 agricultural production and income table 2 presents the results for irpep s impact on rice production per hectare cropping intensity production efficiency and rice sales in region vi and x the mean values for each of the impact indicators can be found in appendix b we find that rice yields were significantly increased in both regions but more so in region vi 13 per cent compared to eight per cent however cropping intensity measured by the proportion of operable land that was cultivated was only increased in region x and was significantly reduced in region vi the efficiency of production measured by the value of inputs including water user fees but not including land used to produce one tonne of rice was only improved in region x insights from the qualitative data suggest that efficiency of production was not impacted in region vi due to farmers being unable to afford or access efficiency enhancing inputs such as improved seed varieties as well as their having to pay higher water user fees due to the strengthened collection capacity of the ias while the project encouraged this among the ias to ensure the sustainability of the cis the sustainability of the project s impacts on livelihoods requires an increase in production efficiency to justify these costs which does not seem to have occurred in region vi only in region x did the project increase the proportion of rice harvest that was sold by nine percentage points and income from rice sales by 128 per cent in region vi further analysis finds that there was instead a significant increase in the proportion of harvest used to pay back costs incurred during production insights from the qualitative data suggest that this outcome was partially caused by farmers taking loans from local traders to fund their production which then had to be repaid with their harvest the large impact on income from rice sales in region x seems to have been driven by the increase in yields rather than improvements in marketing qualitative data from region x highlights similar issues of farmers being tied into credit for harvest arrangements with local traders along with high transport costs and limited access to post harvest processing machinery ia leaders also reported that they have attempted to establish collective crop selling and value chain access for their members but have failed due to farmers persistent sale to local traders based on traders lower processing requirements and the credit and immediate payment they provide in a similar vein it was widely reported that the marketing support provided by irpep which was not provided in region vi was largely ineffective for the same reason and thus is unlikely to be the reason for the different impacts in the two regions we were unable to analyse the project s impact on crop diversity as very few households grew crops other than rice in the two regions which implies that the project s impacts on agricultural productivity were restricted to rice production for projects like irpep that are focused around the production of a single crop it is expected that the economic benefits from specialisation counteract the potential increase in households vulnerability to crop specific shocks however such benefits are only reflected in farm incomes in region x 5 2 household income and livelihood composition presented in table 3 we find a 19 per cent increase in income for households in region vi compared to a significant increase of just 0 4 per cent in region x this comes despite the lack of impact on rice sales in region vi and the large impact in region x shown in table 2 the livelihood composition results in table 3 show that there was a shift in both regions these indicators represent the proportion of income composed from the different sources and as they are themselves percentages the impact estimates represent the change in the number of percentage points in the income composition for each source rather than a direct percentage change in region vi the share of income from crop sales reduced significantly by five percentage points compared to the control group which reflects the reduction in cropping intensity noted above while the share from the sale of livestock products and from off farm waged labour increased by five and three percentage points respectively additional analysis finds that livestock income per capita increased by 193 per cent in this region in region x the share of income from crop sales increased significantly by 11 percentage points while the share from off farm waged labour reduced significantly by nine percentage points we also find reductions in the share of income from livestock production and household enterprises but these results are not statistically significant these results highlight the potential for opposing impacts of small scale irrigation projects on livelihood composition based on context impacts which can help or hinder the rural transformation process households in region vi are poorer but with more diversified livelihoods have restricted access to agricultural inputs and are more at risk of climatic shocks livestock production is also a major part of the rural economy irpep s impacts in this region indicate that the project helped to enhance households already diversified portfolio of activities further reducing concentration on staple crop production and increasing the benefits from existing market linkages in livestock as well as off farm waged activities all signs of advancement in rural transformation at the household level the results in region x have less positive implications here although wealthier households began with a restricted range of livelihood activities which the project seems to have entrenched although gaining somewhat from their specialisation in rice production the marketing barriers they face mean that these gains have been insufficient to justify this concentration in terms of total household income echoing past studies in the philippines and india jica 2012 world bank 2008 livelihood concentration is usually driven by the prospect of significant gains from specialisation or due to a lack of opportunities to diversify freguin gresh et al 2012 the relative poverty compared to the rest of the country of the beneficiaries in this region and the constraints to their rice marketing along with the region s issues with connectivity and inequality implies that their increased specialisation may be due to a lack of other opportunities 5 3 assets nutrition social capital and education presented in table 4 we find that ownership of livestock and of other productive assets increased significantly in region vi dietary diversity an indicator of nutrition was also significantly increased as was involvement in community groups an indicator of social capital regarding education we find a large positive but non significant impact on enrolment which may be linked to the low sample size as the sample for this estimate is restricted to households with school age children for region x we do not find significant impacts on any of these indicators the different impacts on these indicators in the two regions are seemingly linked to the larger impact on income in region vi in the qualitative interviews households in region vi noted that they used higher incomes from the project to purchase healthier foods and to send their children to school in addition the project s support to ias may have also contributed to the impact on social capital in the qualitative interviews it was highlighted that the strengthened ias in both regions helped to increase community engagement although the lack of impact in region x suggests that households may have faced additional barriers to improving social capital in this area these results also highlight important links between small scale irrigation livestock and dietary diversity in region vi we find livestock ownership and income to have increased similar to findings from previous studies in mali nepal and vietnam dillon 2011 adb 2012 nguyen et al 2017 furthermore enhanced livestock activities may have also contributed to improved dietary diversity in region vi as further analysis indicates that the project had a significantly positive impact on the consumption of both meat and eggs in the region 5 4 women s inclusion table 5 shows that the favourable impacts in region vi also apply to women s inclusion in economic activities in region vi we find a significant increase of four percentage points in the share of household income provided by women s income from waged labour and from household enterprises that they own as with the livelihood composition indicators this is a percentage indicator with impact measured in percentage points and a significant increase of six per cent in the likelihood of a female household member owning their own enterprise for both regions analysis of data collected from ias also suggests that the project increased the number of women serving as ia officers this impact could potentially have been mutually complementary to the impacts on women s economic inclusion in region vi women s involvement in collective action groups can enhance their income generating capacity by increasing their economic opportunities and credit access providing protection from risk transferring knowledge and skills and providing assistance in long term asset accumulation pandolfelli et al 2007 quisumbing and kumar 2011 schroeder et al 2013 in turn the breaking of social norms achieved through autonomous income generation more knowledge and assets and increased strength in numbers can lead to increased representation and standing of women in their communities and households fao 2011 in region vi these results suggest that women were not excluded from the positive contributions of the project on rural transformation furthermore women s increased economic activities may have contributed to the impact on total household income and their increased income and bargaining power may have also fed into the positive impacts on education and nutrition conversely in region x women s economic opportunities do not seem to have changed as part of the project s overall lack of influence on components of rural transformation in the region while in region vi the expansion into livestock production and non farm activities likely presented more opportunities for women to increase their income generating capacities the increased focus on farm production in region x may have restricted their activities to family farming slavchevska et al 2016 5 5 impacts by parcel location there were significant positive impacts on rice yields and rice sale income for households that cultivated downstream parcels table 6 respondents in the qualitative interviews attributed this mainly to better regulation of water use along the canals by ias although the yield impact was very similar households with up or midstream parcels had a much larger impact on rice sale income despite this we do not find a significant impact on total income for either group there was also no impact for either group on women s income but there was a significant positive impact for downstream households on group meeting attendance not shown in the table is the impact for these households on income composition for which the majority of income sources were not significantly impacted except that the proportion of income from selling rice increased for up and midstream households given their restricted irrigation water supply before the project downstream households were expected to benefit relatively more from the project if they had the same amount of access to inputs as those further upstream the similar yield impacts for the two groups thus implies input constraints may have hindered poorer downstream households from fully capitalising on the improved water supply something that is supported by the qualitative data the smaller impact on income from rice sales for downstream households indicates that downstream households may also face greater obstacles to market access the impact on income for up and midstream households echoes that for the wealthier households in region x whereby large rice income gains were counteracted by reduced involvement in other activities however the opposite effect was not found for downstream households as was found for the poorer households in region vi implying the diversification benefits for poorer households were specific to region vi the positive impact on social capital for downstream households without a significant impact on income suggests that this impact was driven by increased involvement of these households in communal activities of the cis and ia potentially due to the productivity benefits 6 conclusions and policy implications this paper highlights the potential for user managed small scale irrigation to contribute to the rural transformation process finding that strengthening such irrigation systems within an enabling environment can improve several of the components of the transformation process for smallholder farmers and rural women this can help to accelerate the transformation process itself as well as improve its inclusivity by supporting two groups who are most at risk of exclusion from the process in one project region that provided a supportive environment we find that small scale irrigation projects have the potential to contribute considerably to inclusive rural transformation before the project households in region vi were reasonably well connected living in a small but densely populated area and the regional economy was structured to provide opportunities for rewarding livelihood expansion in addition due to exposure to frequent climatic shocks the livelihoods of households in this region were characterised by diversification for survival and risk mitigation for smallholders within this context there is evidence that already diversified livelihood activities can be enhanced and become more characteristic of the lucrative activities typical of a transforming rural economy this impact on livelihoods comes particularly through fruitful links between irrigation and livestock and is also reflected in more income generating opportunities for women in the other project region however less enabling local conditions led to limited impacts on the components of inclusive rural transformation we find that where smallholders livelihoods are more static and issues of connectivity market access and unbalanced economic growth hinder livelihood expansion and value chain access projects such as irpep struggle to contribute to inclusive rural transformation by themselves in the worst cases broader strategies to modernise the rural economy and to draw labour into more productive rural and urban sectors could even be hindered as smallholders become entrenched in existing livelihood activities and potentially become more vulnerable to shocks the finding that improved water supply and regulation can specifically benefit downstream households in terms of yields and on farm income is promising and highlights the benefits of supporting ias to manage systems equitably broader livelihood benefits for these households however may be hindered by poverty related obstacles such as limited access to inputs and markets based on these results if small scale irrigation is to be used as a tool to promote inclusive rural transformation it must be combined with strategies to foster complementary market linkages for smallholder farmers at the household level these strategies must focus on building strong agricultural input and output markets including financial markets for these producers to access and opportunities for them to expand livelihoods into more lucrative on and off farm activities without this broader efforts to improve irrigation could cause smallholder farmers to be left behind in the transformation process by larger producers who are better equipped to take advantage of the benefits of improved irrigation particular attention is needed to ensure the inclusion of smallholder farmers located downstream as well as rural women in farm households who often face more obstacles to market access and inclusion fao 2017 the strong link indicated by this paper between small scale irrigation and livestock production among smallholders is surely an opportunity to capitalise upon in this case given the rising urban demand for animal protein in developing countries henchion et al 2017 regarding the specific components of inclusive rural transformation we add further evidence supporting the link between irrigation and yields with rice production increasing by 13 and eight per cent respectively in regions vi and x however we note that improvements in production efficiency for smallholders can be hindered by input and credit access constraints which can subsequently limit benefits from crop sales and make it hard for farmers to adjust to the higher user fees that they are now paying to the more effective ias in addition we find that increased income and livestock ownership from improved irrigation can increase dietary diversity consumption of livestock products and social capital with the latter also being improved through strengthened ias finally on the under studied link between small scale irrigation and women s empowerment for low income rural households we find that improving irrigation infrastructure and encouraging women s involvement in its management can considerably improve women s economic opportunities and their role in the community our results also highlight the effectiveness of user managed small scale irrigation systems when ias are provided with appropriate support we find that these institutions can provide effective and efficient system management to the particular benefit of those located downstream and provide an avenue for women to gain greater responsibility and representation in the community based on our findings an avenue for future initiatives could be to equip these institutions to provide further support to the livelihoods of system users in ways that address the input market and credit access barriers that mitigated the impacts of irpep funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant

10383,we investigate how user managed small scale irrigation can influence inclusive rural transformation cultivating inclusive rural transformation is key to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries but existing research rarely analyses the holistic impacts of rural development projects on this process we use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to rigorously measure impacts and uncover the causal pathways of a canal irrigation project for rice farmers in the philippines finding that positive impacts were heavily determined by market access and the strength of the local economy we also find limited impacts for poorer farmers located further downstream on the irrigation canals based on these findings we draw several lessons about the complementary conditions and support that are required in order for irrigation to be an effective tool in promoting inclusive rural transformation in developing countries keywords rural transformation small scale irrigation impact evaluation rice production philippines 1 introduction it is well documented that improved irrigation increases agricultural productivity but higher crop yields alone are not enough to drive transformational change for rural households lipton et al 2003 pinstrup andersen and shimokawa 2006 rural transformation refers to the transition of a low productivity labour intensive rural economy to one that is market oriented capital intensive and comprised of productive on and off farm activities timmer 2009 berdegué et al 2013 rising crop productivity is part of this transition but sustainable and inclusive rural transformation also involves changes in the composition of livelihood activities and continuous improvements in incomes assets off farm productivity social capital nutrition education and gender equity ifad 2016 fao 2017 by increasing and stabilising yields along with other mechanisms better irrigation has the potential to contribute to each of these aspects of inclusive rural transformation but empirical evidence on its wider impacts is scarce this paper addresses this research gap with an in depth impact evaluation of a small scale irrigation project for smallholder rice farmers in the philippines in a bid to inform ongoing efforts to shape and accelerate the most desirable forms of rural transformation in developing countries we focus on smallholder farmers as they constitute some of the world s poorest people and are particularly at risk of exclusion from the rural transformation process fao 2017 and focus on small scale irrigation in particular because the low cost of its construction and maintenance means it is well suited to supporting this group xie et al 2014 focusing on user managed irrigation systems also helps to fill a significant knowledge gap on the benefits of irrigation management transfer about which there remains considerable doubts senanayake et al 2015 we use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data from treatment and control households to analyse the project s impacts on a set of indicators within a novel inclusive rural transformation framework as part of the investigation we take advantage of the differences between the project regions to identify important contextual factors that shaped impacts to our knowledge this is the first impact evaluation study to apply an inclusive rural transformation framework in this manner the remainder of the paper first outlines the potential linkages between small scale irrigation and inclusive rural transformation around which the framework of impact indicators is based this is followed by an overview of the case study project details of the data and methodology a profile of the sample a presentation and discussion of the results and the conclusions and policy implications potential links between small scale irrigation and inclusive rural transformation there is a large body of evidence showing that well managed irrigation systems help farmers to increase their cropping intensity and cultivate year round leading to higher and more stable crop yields lipton et al 2003 hussain and hanjra 2004 pinstrup andersen and shimokawa 2006 this effect on agricultural production can contribute in turn to the rural transformation processes in several ways as evidenced during the green revolution for instance more reliable production can promote agricultural modernisation by increasing farmers incentives to adopt new technologies evenson and gollin 2003 estudillo and keijiro 2006 hazell 2009 improved irrigation could also promote higher value market oriented agricultural production by increasing farmers production capacity and marketable surplus and potentially by allowing farmers to grow cash crops that are hard to grow with rain fed irrigation namara et al 2010 burney and naylor 2012 in bangladesh for instance mottaleb et al 2015 find that better irrigation infrastructure increased rice farmers market integration thanks to their increased marketable surplus while in india mishra et al 2018 find a positive link between irrigation and contract farming among smallholders in addition more reliable and efficient crop production could also change risk attitudes and reduce labour requirements both of which may encourage farmers to advance into the type of productive off farm activities characteristic of a transforming economy freguin gresh et al 2012 as irrigation water can also be used to improve grazing lands and for other livestock needs better irrigation can especially encourage more livestock production a link supported by evidence from mali and nepal dillon 2011 adb 2012 although largely untested better irrigation could also theoretically contribute to improved nutrition education and social capital all key components of a sustainable rural transformation process better nutrition and food security may be achieved as households consume more fruits vegetables staples and livestock products thanks to their higher crop yields enhanced livestock production and greater market integration higher labour productivity and income as a result of better irrigation could also reduce the need for children to work on family farms leading to higher school enrolment and attendance fao 2012 an irrigation project in madagascar for instance was found to have increased incomes and as a result increased the amount that farmers spent on their children s education ring et al 2018 higher education also has the potential to in turn complement the impact of irrigation on productivity as part of a virtuous cycle hanjra et al 2009 social capital could be improved through user managed irrigation schemes a common aspect of small scale irrigation which can increase social cohesion and mutual support kähkönen 1999 an irrigation project in mali for instance found evidence of increased meal sharing as a form of risk protection among households with irrigation dillon 2011 as with education higher social capital can also feed back into the performance of the irrigation system by increasing collective action within user managed systems as has been found among water user associations in japan takayama et al 2018 the capacity of better irrigation to promote transformation that is inclusive lies in its potential benefits for smallholder farmers as well as women two of the groups most at risk of exclusion fao 2017 regarding smallholders small scale irrigation systems are cheaper to implement and maintain making them an accessible and sustainable option for these farmers among smallholders those located downstream who are usually the poorest and often suffer from overuse of water by those located upstream stand to benefit the most from more efficient and better managed canal systems namara et al 2010 darko et al 2016 moreover research shows that where there are low transmission losses and other supporting factors equitable irrigation systems are also the most productive for all users steiner and walter 1992 women could benefit through new economic opportunities as livelihoods are enhanced through the mechanisms discussed above however there is also potential for women to be left to tend the family farm while men pursue other high value activities smith 2004 slavchevska et al 2016 when they engage in democratically managed water user groups women could also improve their representation and responsibilities within their communities sargeson and jacka 2017 in practice however these groups tend to suffer from high levels of exclusion especially of women meinzen dick and zwarteveen 1998 hussain 2007 of the few existing studies that analyse the impact of irrigation on outcomes other than yields the findings are not all positive and some even demonstrate how irrigation can hinder the rural transformation process by making livelihoods more static studies of small scale irrigation projects for rice farmers in the philippines and india that compared treatment and control groups to measure impacts found that improved irrigation led beneficiaries to consolidate their livelihoods around rice production while control households diversified and were able to keep pace with the income improvements of beneficiaries world bank 2008 jica 2012 without sufficient gains from specialisation such an effect can hinder income growth and increase vulnerability to crop specific shocks thus reducing resilience and potentially hindering livelihood choices and technology adoption feder et al 1985 lin 2011 makate et al 2016 there is also evidence that a lack of crop diversity can have a negative effect on dietary diversity and nutrition sekabira and nalunga 2015 for the same projects in the philippines and india and another in madagascar impacts on inclusivity were also doubtful world bank 2008 jica 2012 ring et al 2018 in each case a failure of collective action and instances of elite capture within the user groups led to inequitable water distribution and hence increased inequality between up and downstream households this confirms a common concern about small scale canal irrigation that without effective institutions managing the systems the benefits of irrigation are likely to be unequal and captured by wealthier farmers located upstream magistro et al 2007 meinzen dick 2007 world bank 2008 burney and naylor 2012 irrigation governance is a contested issue and despite knowledge gaps and doubts over their effectiveness that are fuelled by findings such as those above there are growing calls for an increase irrigation management transfer particularly in africa and for water user groups to be provided with more support responsibility and involvement in policy formation senanayake et al 2015 mutambara et al 2016 ifad 2018 findings from the studies mentioned above indicate that contextual factors such as the strength of local institutions will be important in determining which of the potential positive and negative links between irrigation and rural transformation are realised the quality of local markets for inputs outputs and credit are also likely to play an important role shifts in livelihood activities and benefits from specialisation for instance cannot be supported through irrigation without market and value chain connectivity namara et al 2010 freguin gresh et al 2012 fao 2017 2 details of the case study project the irrigated rice production enhancement project irpep was implemented in region vi western visayas region viii eastern visayas and region x northern mindanao of the philippines between 2010 2015 with a budget of 25 million by the time of its completion the project had provided support to 109 communal irrigation systems cis and the irrigators associations ias that manage them covering 9 347 ha of land cis are externally initiated small scale canal diversion irrigation systems that cover areas no larger than 1 000 ha and account for around 35 per cent of the total irrigated land in the country nia 2017 for each cis there is an ia composed of farmers who use the system which is tasked with maintaining the system monitoring and policing water usage and collecting user fees the project targeted smallholders because they represent one of the country s poorest groups due mainly to their low productivity and vulnerability to frequent climatic shocks issues exacerbated by the low irrigation coverage in the country bordey et al 2016 irpep targeted cis that had inadequate or inefficient water supply but high potential for improvement and whose users had low income and crop productivity for each of these cis irpep extended the canals of the cis to cover more land repaired canals damaged by climatic shocks and lined canals with concrete to prevent water seepage in addition irpep provided training to ia officers to manage the system sustainably and equitably encouraged women s participation in ias and offered marketing facilitation services by lining the canals to reduce transmission losses and improving system management a key aim of the project was to improve water supply to households located downstream on the canals the three project regions have different characteristics that could influence the project s impacts in each area for instance region vi and viii are more at risk of climatic shocks compared to region x in fact region viii was very severely affected by super typhoon haiyan during the project s implementation which caused serious damage to infrastructure and strained local institutions to cope with the implications ultimately leading to them being excluded from this study so as not to distort the findings region x is much wealthier and its economy is mainly focused on cash crop production compared to region vi which is more focused on rice and livestock production and has a larger services sector psa 2016 despite being poorer region vi has experienced much larger poverty reduction in recent years while growth in region x has been less pro poor an issue attributed partly to the poor connectivity of households in rural areas neda 2017a b de la rosa 2018 3 data and methodology 3 1 data and indicators the quantitative data comes from a household questionnaire administered 18 months after irpep s completion between march and may 2017 the electronic questionnaire was administered in tagalog by a local data collection team after being piloted in two neutral areas in region x we use data from 580 households in region vi from 20 treatment and 20 control cis and 566 households in region x from 16 treatment and 17 control cis equally split between beneficiary and control households 1 1 the sample size was determined based on obtaining a minimum detectable effect size of 10 using the formula outlined in world bank 2007 several measures were taken during both the sampling and data analysis stages to obtain comparable treatment and control groups to measure irpep s impact in the sampling stage we first used propensity score matching psm to identify similar treatment and control cis from a longlist of all the cis in the two regions with the scores calculated to represent the likelihood of a cis being selected for irpep khandker et al 2010 these scores were created using pre project data linked to the project s selection criteria including the average yields of users distance to the regional capital and the percentage of the system that is operational by removing cis without at least one match in the opposite group we used the scores to create a shortlist of potential treatment and control cis from which we selected the final set for the sample with expert input from project staff as the project may have had a spillover effect on the local economy treatment and control cis were not selected from within the same barangay the sample was not separated at a higher administrative level such as at the municipality or provincial level because it was not expected that these spillover effects for small scale rice farmers in this timeframe would be powerful enough to effect the local economy outside of the barangay from the selected cis we randomly selected households from amongst the cis users for the household survey this was done using lists of cis members provided by the ia from which all members were assigned a number and then selected through a random number generator if a household was not available two more attempts were made to conduct the interview after which they were replaced with a new randomly selected household after the data was collected we verified the sample and removed 29 treatment households who still did not have access to rehabilitated irrigation and 195 control households who had already received similar irrigation support from the philippines government complementary qualitative data were collected through key informant interviews kiis and focus group discussions fgds this included a kii with the national project coordinator and one fgd with other project staff at the national level along with a kii and three fgds with regional staff in each of the three project regions in addition 12 fgds were held with officers from 6 treatment and 6 control ias of the selected cis and 12 kiis were also held with the presidents of the same 12 ias in order to test the potential linkages between irrigation and inclusive rural transformation outlined above we use the household dataset to create indicators relating to agricultural production income livelihood composition asset ownership nutrition social capital education and women s inclusion regarding agricultural productivity we focus on rice production given its importance for smallholder livelihoods and because too few households grew other crops to facilitate a meaningful analysis to represent asset ownership we create an index that incorporates ownership of a range of productive assets calculated using principle component analysis filmer and pritchett 2001 we also create an index for livestock ownership based on tropical livestock units jahnke 1982 household dietary diversity scores are used to assess impact on nutrition whereby a score is assigned based on the consumption of different food groups in the past 24 h fao 2010 to assess impacts by parcel location we compare key indicators from each impact domain for households who used only downstream parcels during the study period against households who used at least one up or midstream parcel this classification was chosen so as to focus on those households likely to be the poorest as all of their parcels are downstream although only a small proportion of households had a mix of up mid and downstream parcels 3 2 impact estimation methodology we estimate the average treatment effect on the treated atet for irpep using an inverse probability weighted regression adjustment ipwra approach an impact estimation method that improves the comparability of the treatment and control samples using both weighting and regression adjustment see wooldridge 2010 austin and stuart 2015 in this model all treatment households are assigned a weight of one and control households are assigned a weight that represents the inverse of the probability of their being a control household these probability weights are calculated in a similar way to the propensity scores created for the sample design whereby the likelihood of being in the treatment or control group is modelled based on pre project livelihood capacities and other factors likely to influence their participation 2 2 the variables used to the create the scores consisted of the age education and gender of the household head household size asset ownership at the start of the project climatic shocks in the past year number of ia members in the household amount of land owned and proportion of land owned up mid downstream on the irrigation canal using the inverse of the probability means that we assign greater weight to control households who better represent a common treatment household rather than a common control household we employ the ipwra model as it allows for the use of additional control variables within a regression framework which are important to incorporate in the case of detailed agricultural data and does not require the dropping of a large number of households as with some psm algorithms formally these weights are calculated as follows 1 i p w a t e t t p 1 t 1 p where t the treatment status 1 treated 0 control and p the probability of receiving the treatment they received given the set of weighting variables the next step is to run a regression adjustment model with the weights applied to each household separate models are run for the treatment and control groups and in each case an expected value for the impact indicator is estimated the formal specification of the regression model is as follows 2 y i β 0 β 1 t i σ x i j β 2 j e i where y is the outcome for household i for the impact indicator ti is the treatment status for household i xij represents an i x j matrix of control variables used in the model β 1 is the coefficient of the treatment indicator and β 2 j is a vector of coefficients to be estimated for each of the control variables βo is the constant and ei is the error term which was calculated using a cluster robust estimator at the province level cameron and miller 2015 control variables were chosen based on their likelihoods to have influenced the outcome variable while not having been affected by the project meaning that different sets of control variables were used depending on the outcome variable being analysed 3 3 control variables for each impact indicator were selected from the following list province location on irrigation canal distance from local market education of household head age of household head average age in household number of adults in household household size experiences drought flood pest outbreak shock in past year soil fertility hectares of land owned received training on rice production water management input subsidy received loan in past 12 months baseline asset index the final estimated impact the atet is then calculated as follows 3 a t e t y ˆ 1 y ˆ o where y ˆ 1 is the average expected outcome for the treatment households and y ˆ o is the average expected outcome for control households obtained from the regression in eq 2 above both the inverse probability weighting and regression adjustment components of the ipwra model can be used individually for this type of impact analysis but to produce consistent estimates the former is dependent on the weights being correctly specified and the latter is dependent on the correct specification of the regression model however the ipwra model only requires one of the two to be correctly specified for the estimates to be consistent therefore the model is classified as a doubly robust estimator tests of the effectiveness of the model indicate that we were able to further reduce the minor imbalances between treatment and control the households for the variables used to weight the sample the standardised mean difference smd was reduced from 0 09 to 0 07 and the variance ratio vr was reduced from 1 11 to 1 09 4 4 an smd of below 0 1 is recommended for a well balanced sample austin 2009 to test the sensitivity of the results to model specification the results were also verified using a secondary model based on a nearest neighbour psm algorithm austin 2011 which produced qualitatively similar results suggesting that our findings are consistent across model specifications 5 5 results from this secondary model are presented in appendix a 4 profile of the sample table 1 presents descriptive statistics on livelihood characteristics for the sample households in regions vi and x for both regions average incomes are both well below the national average of php140 259 as well as the regional averages of php76 459 for region vi and php120 799 for region x psa 2016 although income and land use in region vi are considerably lower than in region x rice production is widespread amongst the sample but average harvests are larger in region x and a much larger proportion of harvests are sold rather than consumed in this region although poorer the livelihoods of households in region vi are more diversified compared to households in region x with the latter more dependent on rice sales this diversity in region vi may be survival rather than opportunity based given their lower incomes lower land access and higher risk of climatic shocks ellis 2000 svodziwa 2018 conversely households in region x may show signs of transformation in terms of the benefits they are gaining from specialising in rice farming but they do not show signs of shifting into more lucrative on and off farm activities they also seem to face barriers to their rice marketing with further investigation finding that the majority of the rice sold by these farmers was unprocessed qualitative data from the region also highlights that cis in the region are located far from local government offices and trading centers a disconnection which may explain why their profile differs from their wealthier cash crop producing rural neighbours in the rest of the region 5 results and discussion 5 1 agricultural production and income table 2 presents the results for irpep s impact on rice production per hectare cropping intensity production efficiency and rice sales in region vi and x the mean values for each of the impact indicators can be found in appendix b we find that rice yields were significantly increased in both regions but more so in region vi 13 per cent compared to eight per cent however cropping intensity measured by the proportion of operable land that was cultivated was only increased in region x and was significantly reduced in region vi the efficiency of production measured by the value of inputs including water user fees but not including land used to produce one tonne of rice was only improved in region x insights from the qualitative data suggest that efficiency of production was not impacted in region vi due to farmers being unable to afford or access efficiency enhancing inputs such as improved seed varieties as well as their having to pay higher water user fees due to the strengthened collection capacity of the ias while the project encouraged this among the ias to ensure the sustainability of the cis the sustainability of the project s impacts on livelihoods requires an increase in production efficiency to justify these costs which does not seem to have occurred in region vi only in region x did the project increase the proportion of rice harvest that was sold by nine percentage points and income from rice sales by 128 per cent in region vi further analysis finds that there was instead a significant increase in the proportion of harvest used to pay back costs incurred during production insights from the qualitative data suggest that this outcome was partially caused by farmers taking loans from local traders to fund their production which then had to be repaid with their harvest the large impact on income from rice sales in region x seems to have been driven by the increase in yields rather than improvements in marketing qualitative data from region x highlights similar issues of farmers being tied into credit for harvest arrangements with local traders along with high transport costs and limited access to post harvest processing machinery ia leaders also reported that they have attempted to establish collective crop selling and value chain access for their members but have failed due to farmers persistent sale to local traders based on traders lower processing requirements and the credit and immediate payment they provide in a similar vein it was widely reported that the marketing support provided by irpep which was not provided in region vi was largely ineffective for the same reason and thus is unlikely to be the reason for the different impacts in the two regions we were unable to analyse the project s impact on crop diversity as very few households grew crops other than rice in the two regions which implies that the project s impacts on agricultural productivity were restricted to rice production for projects like irpep that are focused around the production of a single crop it is expected that the economic benefits from specialisation counteract the potential increase in households vulnerability to crop specific shocks however such benefits are only reflected in farm incomes in region x 5 2 household income and livelihood composition presented in table 3 we find a 19 per cent increase in income for households in region vi compared to a significant increase of just 0 4 per cent in region x this comes despite the lack of impact on rice sales in region vi and the large impact in region x shown in table 2 the livelihood composition results in table 3 show that there was a shift in both regions these indicators represent the proportion of income composed from the different sources and as they are themselves percentages the impact estimates represent the change in the number of percentage points in the income composition for each source rather than a direct percentage change in region vi the share of income from crop sales reduced significantly by five percentage points compared to the control group which reflects the reduction in cropping intensity noted above while the share from the sale of livestock products and from off farm waged labour increased by five and three percentage points respectively additional analysis finds that livestock income per capita increased by 193 per cent in this region in region x the share of income from crop sales increased significantly by 11 percentage points while the share from off farm waged labour reduced significantly by nine percentage points we also find reductions in the share of income from livestock production and household enterprises but these results are not statistically significant these results highlight the potential for opposing impacts of small scale irrigation projects on livelihood composition based on context impacts which can help or hinder the rural transformation process households in region vi are poorer but with more diversified livelihoods have restricted access to agricultural inputs and are more at risk of climatic shocks livestock production is also a major part of the rural economy irpep s impacts in this region indicate that the project helped to enhance households already diversified portfolio of activities further reducing concentration on staple crop production and increasing the benefits from existing market linkages in livestock as well as off farm waged activities all signs of advancement in rural transformation at the household level the results in region x have less positive implications here although wealthier households began with a restricted range of livelihood activities which the project seems to have entrenched although gaining somewhat from their specialisation in rice production the marketing barriers they face mean that these gains have been insufficient to justify this concentration in terms of total household income echoing past studies in the philippines and india jica 2012 world bank 2008 livelihood concentration is usually driven by the prospect of significant gains from specialisation or due to a lack of opportunities to diversify freguin gresh et al 2012 the relative poverty compared to the rest of the country of the beneficiaries in this region and the constraints to their rice marketing along with the region s issues with connectivity and inequality implies that their increased specialisation may be due to a lack of other opportunities 5 3 assets nutrition social capital and education presented in table 4 we find that ownership of livestock and of other productive assets increased significantly in region vi dietary diversity an indicator of nutrition was also significantly increased as was involvement in community groups an indicator of social capital regarding education we find a large positive but non significant impact on enrolment which may be linked to the low sample size as the sample for this estimate is restricted to households with school age children for region x we do not find significant impacts on any of these indicators the different impacts on these indicators in the two regions are seemingly linked to the larger impact on income in region vi in the qualitative interviews households in region vi noted that they used higher incomes from the project to purchase healthier foods and to send their children to school in addition the project s support to ias may have also contributed to the impact on social capital in the qualitative interviews it was highlighted that the strengthened ias in both regions helped to increase community engagement although the lack of impact in region x suggests that households may have faced additional barriers to improving social capital in this area these results also highlight important links between small scale irrigation livestock and dietary diversity in region vi we find livestock ownership and income to have increased similar to findings from previous studies in mali nepal and vietnam dillon 2011 adb 2012 nguyen et al 2017 furthermore enhanced livestock activities may have also contributed to improved dietary diversity in region vi as further analysis indicates that the project had a significantly positive impact on the consumption of both meat and eggs in the region 5 4 women s inclusion table 5 shows that the favourable impacts in region vi also apply to women s inclusion in economic activities in region vi we find a significant increase of four percentage points in the share of household income provided by women s income from waged labour and from household enterprises that they own as with the livelihood composition indicators this is a percentage indicator with impact measured in percentage points and a significant increase of six per cent in the likelihood of a female household member owning their own enterprise for both regions analysis of data collected from ias also suggests that the project increased the number of women serving as ia officers this impact could potentially have been mutually complementary to the impacts on women s economic inclusion in region vi women s involvement in collective action groups can enhance their income generating capacity by increasing their economic opportunities and credit access providing protection from risk transferring knowledge and skills and providing assistance in long term asset accumulation pandolfelli et al 2007 quisumbing and kumar 2011 schroeder et al 2013 in turn the breaking of social norms achieved through autonomous income generation more knowledge and assets and increased strength in numbers can lead to increased representation and standing of women in their communities and households fao 2011 in region vi these results suggest that women were not excluded from the positive contributions of the project on rural transformation furthermore women s increased economic activities may have contributed to the impact on total household income and their increased income and bargaining power may have also fed into the positive impacts on education and nutrition conversely in region x women s economic opportunities do not seem to have changed as part of the project s overall lack of influence on components of rural transformation in the region while in region vi the expansion into livestock production and non farm activities likely presented more opportunities for women to increase their income generating capacities the increased focus on farm production in region x may have restricted their activities to family farming slavchevska et al 2016 5 5 impacts by parcel location there were significant positive impacts on rice yields and rice sale income for households that cultivated downstream parcels table 6 respondents in the qualitative interviews attributed this mainly to better regulation of water use along the canals by ias although the yield impact was very similar households with up or midstream parcels had a much larger impact on rice sale income despite this we do not find a significant impact on total income for either group there was also no impact for either group on women s income but there was a significant positive impact for downstream households on group meeting attendance not shown in the table is the impact for these households on income composition for which the majority of income sources were not significantly impacted except that the proportion of income from selling rice increased for up and midstream households given their restricted irrigation water supply before the project downstream households were expected to benefit relatively more from the project if they had the same amount of access to inputs as those further upstream the similar yield impacts for the two groups thus implies input constraints may have hindered poorer downstream households from fully capitalising on the improved water supply something that is supported by the qualitative data the smaller impact on income from rice sales for downstream households indicates that downstream households may also face greater obstacles to market access the impact on income for up and midstream households echoes that for the wealthier households in region x whereby large rice income gains were counteracted by reduced involvement in other activities however the opposite effect was not found for downstream households as was found for the poorer households in region vi implying the diversification benefits for poorer households were specific to region vi the positive impact on social capital for downstream households without a significant impact on income suggests that this impact was driven by increased involvement of these households in communal activities of the cis and ia potentially due to the productivity benefits 6 conclusions and policy implications this paper highlights the potential for user managed small scale irrigation to contribute to the rural transformation process finding that strengthening such irrigation systems within an enabling environment can improve several of the components of the transformation process for smallholder farmers and rural women this can help to accelerate the transformation process itself as well as improve its inclusivity by supporting two groups who are most at risk of exclusion from the process in one project region that provided a supportive environment we find that small scale irrigation projects have the potential to contribute considerably to inclusive rural transformation before the project households in region vi were reasonably well connected living in a small but densely populated area and the regional economy was structured to provide opportunities for rewarding livelihood expansion in addition due to exposure to frequent climatic shocks the livelihoods of households in this region were characterised by diversification for survival and risk mitigation for smallholders within this context there is evidence that already diversified livelihood activities can be enhanced and become more characteristic of the lucrative activities typical of a transforming rural economy this impact on livelihoods comes particularly through fruitful links between irrigation and livestock and is also reflected in more income generating opportunities for women in the other project region however less enabling local conditions led to limited impacts on the components of inclusive rural transformation we find that where smallholders livelihoods are more static and issues of connectivity market access and unbalanced economic growth hinder livelihood expansion and value chain access projects such as irpep struggle to contribute to inclusive rural transformation by themselves in the worst cases broader strategies to modernise the rural economy and to draw labour into more productive rural and urban sectors could even be hindered as smallholders become entrenched in existing livelihood activities and potentially become more vulnerable to shocks the finding that improved water supply and regulation can specifically benefit downstream households in terms of yields and on farm income is promising and highlights the benefits of supporting ias to manage systems equitably broader livelihood benefits for these households however may be hindered by poverty related obstacles such as limited access to inputs and markets based on these results if small scale irrigation is to be used as a tool to promote inclusive rural transformation it must be combined with strategies to foster complementary market linkages for smallholder farmers at the household level these strategies must focus on building strong agricultural input and output markets including financial markets for these producers to access and opportunities for them to expand livelihoods into more lucrative on and off farm activities without this broader efforts to improve irrigation could cause smallholder farmers to be left behind in the transformation process by larger producers who are better equipped to take advantage of the benefits of improved irrigation particular attention is needed to ensure the inclusion of smallholder farmers located downstream as well as rural women in farm households who often face more obstacles to market access and inclusion fao 2017 the strong link indicated by this paper between small scale irrigation and livestock production among smallholders is surely an opportunity to capitalise upon in this case given the rising urban demand for animal protein in developing countries henchion et al 2017 regarding the specific components of inclusive rural transformation we add further evidence supporting the link between irrigation and yields with rice production increasing by 13 and eight per cent respectively in regions vi and x however we note that improvements in production efficiency for smallholders can be hindered by input and credit access constraints which can subsequently limit benefits from crop sales and make it hard for farmers to adjust to the higher user fees that they are now paying to the more effective ias in addition we find that increased income and livestock ownership from improved irrigation can increase dietary diversity consumption of livestock products and social capital with the latter also being improved through strengthened ias finally on the under studied link between small scale irrigation and women s empowerment for low income rural households we find that improving irrigation infrastructure and encouraging women s involvement in its management can considerably improve women s economic opportunities and their role in the community our results also highlight the effectiveness of user managed small scale irrigation systems when ias are provided with appropriate support we find that these institutions can provide effective and efficient system management to the particular benefit of those located downstream and provide an avenue for women to gain greater responsibility and representation in the community based on our findings an avenue for future initiatives could be to equip these institutions to provide further support to the livelihoods of system users in ways that address the input market and credit access barriers that mitigated the impacts of irpep funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant

10384,inappropriate water and fertilizer management can lead to unstable crop yield and excessive irrigation and fertilization can potentially cause soil degradation and groundwater pollution a two year field experiment was conducted on drip fertigated spring maize zea mays l in ningxia of northwest china to explore the effects of four irrigation amounts i75 0 75etc i90 0 90etc i105 1 05etc and i120 1 20etc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration and four n p2o5 k2o fertilization rates f60 30 30 f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 in 2016 f150 70 70 f225 110 110 f300 150 150 and f375 180 180 in 2017 on maize growth grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation economic benefit and soil nitrate residue no3 n considering the goal of conserving both water and fertilizer while maintaining relatively high yields and minimizing soil no3 n a management strategy to optimize irrigation and fertilization regimes was developed based on the response surface methodology the results showed that irrigation amount and fertilization rate significantly affected leaf area index aboveground biomass grain yield and harvest index the irrigation fertilization interaction significantly affected plant and grain nitrogen accumulation in 2016 with lower fertilization range grain yield and grain nitrogen accumulation were highest under i120f240 120 120 reaching 14 440 kg ha 1 and 184 50 kg ha 1 respectively in 2017 with higher fertilization range both grain yield and grain nitrogen accumulation initially increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation and fertilization regimes grain yield and grain nitrogen accumulation were highest under i90f300 150 150 reaching 16 884 kg ha 1 and 195 09 kg ha 1 respectively although plant nitrogen uptake was dramatically higher under i90f375 180 180 than those in the other treatments grain yield was markedly lower under i90f300 150 150 and nitrogen harvest index was also lower soil no3 n increased with increasing fertilization rate but it decreased with increasing irrigation amount when irrigation amount and fertilization rate increased at the same time the soil no3 n accumulation area moved deeper in the soil profile soil no3 n content and distribution in the 60 100 cm soil layer showed an increasing trend but this trend was less obvious than that in the 0 60 cm soil layer when the irrigation amount was 447 452 mm and the n p2o5 k2o fertilization rate ranged from 290 145 145 to 303 152 152 kg ha 1 grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit 13 688 cny ha 1 can reach 95 confidence interval of their maximum values simultaneously this study can provide a theoretical basis for high efficient water and fertilizer utilization in sustainable spring maize zea mays l production in northwest china keywords drip irrigation spring maize grain yield nitrogen uptake soil no3 n 1 introduction ningxia is one of the most important spring maize growing regions in northwest china which is situated in the arid and semi arid region of china spring maize production in this area plays an important role in ensuring food security and avoiding energy crisis in china the primary irrigation method used on farmlands mostly sandy loam soil type in this region is basin irrigation zhao et al 2014 zheng et al 2019 however precipitation varies widely among seasons and years and water deficit frequently occurs during the maize growing seasons with decreases in the amount of water available from the yellow river and increases in non agricultural water demand shortages of water available for agricultural production have gradually restricted the sustainable development of local agriculture pereira et al 2007 fertilizer use efficiency is low in this area because fertilizers are overused and all fertilizer applications are typically made at planting this production practice has led to serious irrigation water loss and low efficiency of irrigation water use meanwhile excessive fertilizer applications and poor fertilization methods have resulted in low fertilizer use efficiency some reports have demonstrated that excessive irrigation amounts and nitrogen application rates can stimulate nitrate no3 n accumulation in the soil profile and degrade both surface and groundwater resources resulting in eutrophication and undrinkable water supplies barton and colmer 2006 nangia et al 2010 ziadi et al 2012 wang et al 2019a b in order to increase maize yield while reducing water and fertilizer inputs maintain sustainable crop production and improve the ecological environment of farmland in china governments have advocated that famers to develop high efficient and water saving production technologies drip irrigation is an efficient water saving irrigation technology providing accurate and timely application of water and fertilizer fan et al 2016 2017 jiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 yan et al 2019 wang et al 2020 this technique has increased crop yields decreased water requirements decreased tillage costs and reduced fertilizer application rates lekakis et al 2011 a properly designed drip fertigation system can maximize crop water and nutrient uptake while minimizing nutrient leaching gardenas et al 2005 thus drip irrigation has been widely accepted and used for crop production in arid and semi arid regions fanish et al 2011 zhou et al 2006 many previous studies have reported the obvious advantages of drip irrigation compared with other irrigation methods such as basin irrigation furrow and alternate furrow methods for instance some studies concluded that drip irrigation significantly improved water fertilizer and other chemical applications and increased crop production and water use efficiency pablo et al 2007 sampathkumar and pandian 2011 as other literature showed that drip irrigation improved both water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency and reduced the loss of soil no3 n and the risk of no3 n moving to deep soil depths wang et al 2018a chilundo et al 2017 an increasing number of farmers in china intend to use drip irrigation because the fertigation system can save much water and increase crop production in areas of water scarcity du et al 2008 tian et al 2016 yang et al 2016 drip irrigation and appropriate nitrogen fertilizer application rates have significantly promoted maize nitrogen uptake and increased grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency sui et al 2018 different irrigation methods and fertilization application rates have varying effects on nutrients and water distribution in the soil and plant nutrient uptake sui et al 2018 for example flood irrigation is a common method to provide nutrients for crop growth but this system has additional problems such as low nitrogen use efficiency high rate of nutrient loss due to leaching and the occurrence of crop injury playan et al 1997 yan et al 2020 indicated that most soil no3 n remained above 40 cm in the drip irrigation treatment and reduced the probability of soil no3 n leaching compared with flood irrigation soil no3 n accumulated more in the surface soil layer under drip fertigation than under border irrigation and the leaching amount decreased by 85 9 wei et al 2010 maize total nitrogen uptake amount was 13 3 higher under drip irrigation than nitrogen uptake in the conventional furrow irrigation system and yield increased by 13 7 with drip irrigation sandhu et al 2019 when water applications were optimized using drip irrigation grain yield increased by 28 in sandy soil and 12 in clay soil compared with rainfed yield and partial fertilizer productivity and nitrogen phosphorus and potassium uptake also increased wu et al 2019 gheysari et al 2009 found that nitrogen application rates of 142 and 189 kg n ha 1 resulted in higher nitrogen uptake with higher amounts of drip irrigation than with lower amounts of drip irrigation based on soil water depletion in addition wang et al 2017b and sui et al 2018 demonstrated the potential of using drip irrigation with assessments of optimal n level to effectively manage nitrogen applications and increase maize yields in china although previous studies have optimized water supply and fertilizer input for maximizing crop yield water use efficiency or economic benefit few studies have investigated their effects on plant nitrogen uptake and soil nutrient residue to decrease the risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater and improve maize yield nitrogen uptake and net returns that comprehensively develop sustainable agriculture thus understanding and mastering crop nitrogen uptake and soil nutrient distribution under drip fertigation can aid in the development of reasonable irrigation fertilization systems and promote sustainable agricultural development that further improves crop yields and nitrogen uptake and decreases the risk of groundwater pollution a two year field experiment was conducted on spring maize to determine the effects of drip irrigation amount and fertilization rate on maize growth grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation economic benefit and soil nitrate residue and determine the appropriate irrigation and nitrogen ranges for simultaneously optimizing the grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit of drip irrigated spring maize the results of this study can provide a theoretical basis and technical reference for producing high maize yield while synergistically utilizing water and nutrients in arid and semi arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiments were conducted during the spring maize growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 at the water saving irrigation station 36 50 n 106 00 e in tongxin ningxia province of china the region is classified as a temperate arid zone with a continental climate the 30 year average temperature is 8 6 c the average annual sunshine hours are 3024 h and the frost free period is 169 d the average annual rainfall is 273 mm and the average annual evaporation is 2325 mm during the 2016 and 2017 spring maize growing seasons apr sep maximum temperatures were 35 and 36 minimum temperatures were 5 and 1 and the effective rainfall amounts from maize planting to 20 days before harvest were 100 mm and 190 mm respectively fig 1 the sandy loam soil in the experimental area had a soil bulk density of 1 43 g cm 3 a field capacity of 28 95 volumetric water content a total n content of 0 65 g kg 1 a soil organic matter content of 8 10 g kg 1 a total p content of 0 77 g kg 1 an available phosphorus content of 21 65 mg kg 1 an available potassium content of 170 00 mg kg 1 and a ph of 7 8 2 2 experimental treatments and design the maize variety xianyu 335 was planted on 10th april 2016 and 12th april 2017 urea ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and potassium sulfate were used as fertilizers the drip irrigation fertilization system included a water pump filter fertilizer tanks and water distribution pipeline system the drip tape was an in line drip tape with drippers spaced 30 cm apart the dripper flow rate was 2 5 l h 1 and the dripper operating pressure was 0 1 mpa the experimental treatments consisted of four irrigation amounts and four fertilization rates the four irrigation treatments were based on fractions of crop evapotranspiration etc and designated as i75 0 75etc i90 0 90etc i105 1 05etc and i120 1 20etc respectively etc was calculated as allen et al 1998 1 e t c k c e t 0 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation during the maize growing season of 2001 2015 fig 1 kc is the crop coefficient for maize which was determined according to the maize growth stage the kc values were 0 7 from ve to v5 1 2 during v6 r2 and 0 6 during r3 r6 allen et al 1998 an appropriate ratio of n p2o5 k2o enhances the utilization of fertilizer and improves crop growth and yield gao et al 2006 recommended a n p2o5 k2o ratio of 1 0 0 5 1 0 approximately for maize however considering the high initial available potassium content in the study area the ratio of n p2o5 k2o was adjusted to 1 0 0 5 0 5 approximately the four fertilization rates were 60 30 30 120 60 60 180 90 90 and 240 120 120 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 in 2016 designated as f60 30 30 f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 respectively however it was found that maize yield continued to increase with increasing fertilization rate until f240 120 120 in 2016 to verify if near f240 120 120 was best for maize production the four fertilization rates were further increased to 150 70 70 225 110 110 300 150 150 and 375 180 180 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 in 2017 designated as f150 70 70 f225 110 110 f300 150 150 and f375 180 180 respectively each plot in the experimental area was 6 6 m wide and 27 5 m long each treatment was repeated three times and randomly arranged within 48 plots to prevent water movement between adjacent plots a 1 0 m wide buffer zone was set up between two plots spring maize was planted in alternating wide 70 cm and narrow 40 cm rows with maize plants spaced 20 cm apart in the rows the drip tape was placed in between two narrow rows with one drip tape irrigating two rows of spring maize fig 2 according to the growth characteristics of spring maize fertilizer treatments were applied a total of seven times during the entire 2016 growing season and a total of eight times during the entire 2017 growing season fig 3 the irrigation period began at the end of the maize seedling stag in addition we needed to ensure that the each treatment did not result in deep drainage out of the 0 100 cm soil profile after a single irrigation the maximum water storage capacity in the 0 100 cm soil profile was 286 mm therefore the designed irrigation interval was 12 days because of low soil moisture content after planting in 2017 we provided a small irrigation of 22 mm at the seedling stage since the effective rainfall during august 2017 was relatively large the 7th 8th and 9th irrigation were mainly used for fertilization and not for water supplementation therefore since small irrigation amounts used during these last three irrigation just enough to apply fertilizers to the soil surface the fertilizer was not transported to the active root zone sullivan et al 2000 and this application method was not conducive to the absorption of fertilizer by roots the irrigation amount for the i75 treatment was about 20 mm and the others were adjusted proportionally during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the actual irrigation amounts were 322 mm and 316 mm under i75 404 mm and 397 mm under i90 485 mm and 467 mm under i105 and 566 mm and 541 mm under i120 respectively fig 3 pesticides and herbicides were spread in the fields before sowing in the fields before sowing so the plots were kept free of weeds insects and diseases during the growing seasons 2 3 measurements and calculations leaf area index lai aboveground biomass grain yield and harvest index at the middle of the silking stage leaf area of five representative plants in each plot was measured leaf length l measured from ligule to leaf tip and width w measured at the widest portion of the leaf blade were used to calculate leaf area la using the formula la 0 75 w l lai was calculated as the leaf area per plant land area per plant ren et al 2016 five representative plants were sampled at harvest in each plot by cutting the plants at the soil surface removing the surface soil the maize plants were put in an oven at 105 c for 0 5 h for initial drying and subsequently dried at 75 c to constant weight plant mass was then determined using an electronic balance the average dry matter mass of each plot was calculated by multiplying average dry matter mass by the plant population at the same time that plants were sampled for aboveground biomass from each plot 10 adjacent plants were sampled in each of four rows irrigated by two adjacent drip irrigation lines the sampled plants were put into nylon mesh bags and dried the dried samples were threshed and the grain was weighed the grain yield of each plot was calculated and reported at 14 water content

irrigation tape fig 2 the soil samples at each sampling location were divided into 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm depth intervals the soil samples were processed by air milling and fine screening a 2 mol l kcl solution was used for extraction 5 g of dry soil 1 10 soil liquid ratio and the soil no3 n content was determined by using the same autoanalyzer mentioned previously wang

irrigation treatments grain yield under f180 90 90 was significantly greater than that under f120 60 60 but there was no significant difference between f120 60 60 and f240 120 120 fig 4e in the i120

i120f240 120 120 treatment 14 440 kg ha 1 even though fertilization rate and irrigation amount were smaller 60 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1and 82 mm respectively under i105f180 90 90 compared with i120f240 120 120 there was no significant yield difference between the two treatments fig 4e in 2017 for a given irrigation amount grain yield initially increased and then decreased with increasing fertilization

significant irrigation fertilizer interaction for harvest index maximum values were obtained under i120f60 30 30 65 1 fig 4g and d90n150 61 3 fig 4h in 2016 and 2017 respectively in 2016 the harvest index of the i120f60 30 30 treatment increased by 14 61 but the yield decreased by 26 32 compared with the i120f240 120 120 treatment fig 4e g in 2017 there was no significant difference in harvest index between i90f150 70 70 and i90f300 150 150 treatments but the yield of the i90f150 70 70 treatment decreased by 21 21 compared with that of the i90f300 150 150 treatment fig 4f and h considering the high target yield expected for this region low fertilization treatments are not suitable for maize production here thus determining a reasonable irrigation fertilization combination is important for improving maize yield 3 2 spring maize nitrogen accumulation n harvest index and nue in 2016 and 2017 irrigation amount fertilization rate and the irrigation fertilization interaction exhibited

and 72 54 to 195 09 kg ha 1 in 2017 and nitrogen harvest index varied from 0 52 to 0 73 in 2016 and from 0 54 to 0 66 in 2017 for a given irrigation amount in 2016 total nitrogen accumulation and grain nitrogen accumulation increased with increasing fertilization rate in 2017 the total nitrogen accumulation and grain nitrogen accumulation of the i75 irrigation treatment first increased and then decreased with increasing fertilization rate under the i90 irrigation amount in 2017 there was no significant difference between f300 150 150 and f375 180 180 treatments with regards to total nitrogen accumulation and grain nitrogen accumulation table 2 in 2016 total nitrogen accumulation and grain nitrogen accumulation in the i120f240 120 120 treatment were significantly greater than those of other treatments but its nitrogen harvest index was not significantly different than those of other treatments including i105f120 60 60 i105f180 90 90 i105f240 120 120 i120f120 60 60 and i120f180 90 90 however the nitrogen harvest index of the i120f240 120 120 treatment was significantly greater than observed for many other treatments in 2017 the nitrogen harvest index was greatest in the i75f300 150 150 but was not significantly different from nitrogen harvest index under i90f150 70 70 i105f150 70 70 i105f225 110 110 i105f375 180 180 i120f225 110 110 and i120f375 180 180 however the i75f300 150 150 treatment did produce a significantly greater nitrogen harvest index than other treatments under i75 and i90 in 2017 grain nitrogen accumulation initially increased and then decreased with increasing fertilization rate indicating that under a given irrigation amount appropriate increases in fertilization rate were beneficial to grain nitrogen accumulation but excessive fertilization would affect the nitrogen distribution among vegetative organs and reproductive organs resulting in decreased grain nitrogen accumulation under i75 and i90 total nitrogen accumulation and grain nitrogen accumulation of the f150 70 70 and f225 110 110 treatments in 2017 were higher compared to those of the f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 treatments in 2016 respectively this can be due to the higher rainfall in 2017 190 mm compared with that in 2016 100 mm in addition at the same irrigation level nue decreased with the increase of fertilization rate in the two years in general nue of each treatment in 2016 was higher than that in 2017 which may be related to the increase of fertilization rate in 2017 table 2 3 3 soil no3 n distribution in spring maize root zone in 2016 and 2017 the irrigation fertilization interaction had very significant effects on soil no3 n contents p 0 01 table 1 the contents varied between 5 00 and 25 44 mg kg 1 in 2016 and between 4 96 and 35 00 mg kg 1 in 2017 and increased with increasing fertilization rate fig 5 soil no3 n contents increased as irrigation amounts decreased in 2016 and 2017 under the i75 irrigation treatment soil no3 n was mainly distributed in the 0 60 cm soil layer the exception was found under i75f225 110 110 in 2017 where there was a soil no3 n accumulation zone at a horizontal distance of 20 30 cm from the drip tape and at a depth of 40 cm below the soil surface soil no3 n content in other treatments decreased with increasing soil depth at the different sampling points fig 5a in the i90 irrigation treatment fig 5b the soil no3 n accumulation area appeared at 40 cm depth below the soil surface soil no3 n contents for this irrigation treatment generally decreased with increasing soil depth and soil no3 n contents in the 40 60 cm soil layer were lower than those observed in other soil layers in the i105 irrigation treatment soil no3 n accumulation area also appeared at 40 cm depth below the soil surface fig 5c as the soil depth increased at the drip line soil no3 n content first increased and then decreased and soil no3 n contents at the sampling points 25 5 cm and 55 cm from the drip tape decreased with increasing soil depth for most treatments soil no3 n contents at a given soil depth showed a trend of initially decreasing and then increasing as horizontal distance from the drip tape increased in the i120 irrigation treatment soil no3 n accumulation area tended to move to lower soil depths than those observed in other irrigation treatments fig 5d also the accumulation area tended to move horizontally towards the sampling site that was 55 cm from the drip tape this change in the accumulation area was more obvious at increased fertilization rate soil no3 n contents at 20 30 cm distance from the irrigation line and at the 60 cm soil depth were generally lower than those in other soil layers however soil no3 n contents initially increased and then decreased at any given depth when moving horizontally away from the drip line 3 4 soil no3 n accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil profile at spring maize harvest further analyses of soil no3 n accumulation data in the 0 100 cm soil profile at spring maize harvest showed that there was a significant difference in soil no3 n accumulation among different water and fertilizer supply treatments fig 6 in 2016 fig 6a in the i75 irrigation treatment under f60 30 30 f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 soil no3 n accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil profile were 60 44 73 74 79 98 and 105 30 kg ha 1 respectively in the i90 irrigation treatment the corresponding values were 58 21 65 66 78 80 and 94 88 kg ha 1 in the i105 irrigation treatment the corresponding values were 53 64 64 27 69 15 and 75 54 kg ha 1 in the i120 irrigation treatment the respective values were 44 05 61 35 62 33 and 66 85 kg ha 1 in 2017 fig 6b in the i75 irrigation treatment under f60 30 30 f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 soil no3 n accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil profile were 65 37 75 01 87 02 and 123 46 kg ha 1 respectively in the i90 irrigation treatment the corresponding values were 61 35 71 89 84 40 and 113 76 kg ha 1 in the i105 irrigation treatment the corresponding values were 58 49 71 09 81 58 and 109 86 kg ha 1 in the i120 irrigation treatment the corresponding values were 38 61 55 24 64 12 and 108 03 kg ha 1 the data acquired in 2016 and 2017 clearly showed that soil no3 n accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil profile increased as fertilization rate increased and decreased as irrigation amount increased by calculating the ratio of no3 n accumulation in each soil layer to total no3 n accumulation for each irrigation treatment it was seen that no3 n accumulation was greatest in the 0 40 cm soil layer and no3 n accumulation followed the order of i75 i90 i105 i120 with increasing irrigation amount the proportion of soil no3 n accumulation in the 60 100 cm soil layer gradually increased and this phenomenon was more obvious in 2017 fig 6b soil no3 n accumulation in the 60 100 cm soil layer in the i75 and i90 treatments were 30 80 and 16 39 greater than those under i120 in 2017 fig 6b the results also showed that soil no3 n mainly concentrated in the surface soil layer in 2016 with increasing irrigation amount and fertilization rate soil no3 n will move downwards with water and move more no3 n into deep soils 3 5 economic benefit over the two years the gross profit ranged from 15 660 to 25 920 cny ha 1 in 2016 and from 17 762 to 30 391 cny ha 1 in 2017 compared with the minimum value the highest gross profit increased by 65 5 and 71 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively at the same irrigation level the net return first increased and then decreased with the increase of fertilizer rate reaching the maximum of 14 086 cny ha 1 under i120f180 90 90 in 2016 and 18 303 cny ha 1 under i90f300 150 150 in 2017 respectively the differences in net return were up to 7 814 cny ha 1 in 2016 and 10 805 cny ha 1 in 2017 table 3 the result indicates that inappropriate irrigation amount and fertilizer rate significantly reduced gross profit and net return of spring maize 3 6 optimization of water and fertilizer management based on yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit the data collected over the two years were comprehensively analyzed by considering the effects of different fertilization rates and irrigation amounts irrigation amount and fertilization rate were treated as independent variables and grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit were considered as the response variables based on the least squares method the data were analyzed using mathematica 9 0 wang et al 2018b and a binary quadratic regression equation was determined and used to calculate the amounts of irrigation and fertilization needed to maximize grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit table 4 the fitting results showed that the maximum yield of 15 009 kg ha 1 was achieved when 463 mm of irrigation water and 303 152 152 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 were applied the grain nitrogen accumulation was maximized at 176 59 kg n ha 1 with the application of 545 mm of irrigation water and 505 253 253 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 the economic benefit was maximized at 14 409 cny ha 1 with the application of 452 mm of irrigation water and 278 139 139 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 table 4 it was difficult to obtain the maximum grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit simultaneously therefore it is acceptable to consider the 95 confidence intervals for maximum grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit fig 7 when irrigation ranged from 447 to 542 mm and the fertilization rate ranged from 290 to 360 kg n ha 1 with a n p2o5 k2o ratio of 1 0 0 5 0 5 grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefits reached 95 of their maximum values simultaneously however fig 6 indicated that inappropriate irrigation amount and fertilization rate can cause no3 n leaching into deep soil layers and increase the risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater we were concerned about conserving both water and fertilizer so the optimal irrigation amount ranged from 447 452 mm and optimal fertilization rate ranged from 290 145 145 to 303 152 152 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation amount and fertilization rate on leaf area index aboveground biomass grain yield harvest index and nitrogen uptake and utilization of spring maize fertilizers are necessary for crop growth min et al 2016 wang et al 2017a zhang et al 2015 the amount of fertilizer available for uptake directly affects the growth and development of crops thereby affecting crop yields srivastava et al 2018 in this study we found that lai and aboveground biomass in 2017 were generally higher than those in 2016 under the same irrigation amount the reason may be that the rainfall and range of fertilization rates in 2016 were smaller than those in 2017 which could not effectively meet the growth requirements of spring maize in this region data from the two years showed that lai under i120f240 120 120 in 2016 and under i120f375 180 180 in 2017 were greatest which were significantly greater than lai in the f120 60 60 treatment in 2016 except for i120f120 60 60 and in the f150 70 70 treatment in 2017 indicating that maize lai did not increase linearly with increased fertilization rate guo et al 2015 reported that suitable irrigation and nitrogen rate can significantly increase maize aboveground biomass grain yield and harvest index and nitrogen uptake by maize increased with increasing irrigation amount and nitrogen they reported a parabolic response of maize yield to nitrogen rate yang and wang 2011 concluded that maize yield and nitrogen accumulation increased with nitrogen application rate but under the 12 000 m3 ha irrigation amount there was no significant increase in grain yield when the nitrogen rate were over 225 kg n ha 1 wang et al 2018a reported that nitrogen rates of 240 kg n ha 1 and 290 kg n ha 1 produced maize yields that were not significantly different from each other and nitrogen uptake by plants initially increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen rate such that the nitrogen rate of 240 kg n ha 1 maximized grain yield our results showed that maximum harvest index was obtained in the i120f60 30 30 treatment in 2016 and in the i90f150 70 70 treatment in 2017 however the yields of these two treatments were 26 32 and 21 21 lower than the maximum yields respectively therefore considering the higher target yield expected for this region low fertilization treatments are not suitable for maize production here in addition this study showed that the yield and grain nitrogen accumulation in the i90 irrigation treatment and f300 150 150 fertilization treatment were highest in 2017 the study also showed that f375 180 180 increased the crop total nitrogen uptake but grain nitrogen uptake and grain yield did not increase and it reduced the nitrogen harvest index in 2016 and 2017 nitrogen harvest index ranged from 0 52 to 0 73 and from 0 50 to 0 66 which further indicated that the nutrients absorbed by maize were mainly used to form seeds and to increase yield the grain nitrogen accumulation and yield under i90f300 150 150 were greatest and were significantly greater than those under i90f375 180 180 i105f300 150 150 and i120f300 150 150 the data demonstrated that excessive irrigation and fertilization would reduce grain nitrogen uptake and grain yield therefore a reasonable irrigation amount and fertilization rate plays an important role in increasing nitrogen uptake and crop yield 4 2 effects of irrigation amount and fertilization rate on soil no3 n content and distribution of spring maize roots in the soil profile as the main form of nitrogen for crop absorption and utilization soil no3 n concentrations can affect water and nutrient uptake of plants nie et al 2012 gorska et al 2008 its distribution and residual in the soil profile are affected by crop nitrogen absorption irrigation method and nitrogen fertilization rate sun et al 2012 excessive fertilization will significantly increase soil no3 n residual xu et al 2020 in this current study irrigation amount and fertilization rate had prominent effects on soil no3 n distribution and residual increasing fertilization rate increased the soil no3 n content while increasing irrigation amount reduced the soil no3 n content as irrigation amount and fertilization rate increased the deep soil no3 n content tended to increase gradually in the i105 and i120 irrigation treatments the soil no3 n accumulation area appeared between 40 cm and 60 cm below the drip line and the no3 n accumulation area was increasingly obvious as the fertilization rate increased which is similar to the finding of li et al 2004 badr et al 2010 also showed that no3 n migrated with water and accumulated near the wetting front this is because no3 n is very soluble in water and moves with water water uptake by roots causes water to move horizontally after entering the soil with no3 n accumulating at the edge of the wetting front however the greater water content in the soil below the drip line hinders the vertical movement of no3 n and the higher soil water content that remains below the drip line over longer time can result in poor soil aeration producing a condition that is conducive to denitrification weier et al 1993 in addition the present study indicated that the proportion of soil no3 n accumulation in the 60 100 cm soil layer gradually increased with increasing irrigation amount for example the soil no3 n accumulation in the i120 irrigation treatment was on average 30 80 and 16 39 greater than those in the i75 and i90 treatments in 2017 respectively this results indicated that excessive irrigation will produce seepage of water by gravity that causes no3 n to leach into deep soil layers and can increase the risk of groundwater pollution liang and mackenzie 1994 therefore application of reasonable irrigation amount and fertilization rate can slow no3 n migration into deep soil and thus reduce the risk of groundwater pollution 4 3 the combined effects of irrigation amount and fertilization rate many researchers have established the relationships between irrigation amount fertilizer inputs and crop yield through a combination of multivariate regression and spatial analyses wang et al 2018b a b zou et al 2020 in this study we further analyzed the relationships between water fertilizer inputs and crop yield nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit by considering the 95 confidence interval for the maximum values of those parameters from fig 6 we know that appropriate irrigation amount and fertilization rate can cause no3 n to leach into deep soil layers and increase the risk of nitrate leaching an irrigation range of 447 452 mm and a fertilization range of 290 145 145 to 303 152 152 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 resulted in 95 of the maximum values of grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefits 13 688 cny ha 1 which is recommended as the optimal irrigation and fertilization strategy for sustainable spring maize production in the study region 5 conclusions for a given irrigation amount grain yield initially increased and then decreased as fertilization rate increased in 2017 and reached the maximum value of 16 884 kg ha 1 under i90f300 150 150 the total nitrogen accumulation of spring maize increased with increasing fertilization rate in both years the soil no3 n readily moved with water and the no3 n content in the spring maize root zone was proportional to fertilization rate and inversely proportional to irrigation amount considering the goal of conserving both water and fertilizer as well as decreasing the risk of groundwater pollution while maintaining high maize yield an irrigation range of 447 452 mm combined with a fertilization rate of 290 145 145 and 303 152 152 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 was recommended to maintain 95 maximum values of maize grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit 13 688 cny ha 1 simultaneously the results of this study are of great significance for the scientific management of drip irrigation and fertilization of spring maize in ningxia of china and maybe similar arid and semi arid maize production areas acknowldgement this study was jointly sponsored by the national key research and development program of china no 2017yfc0403303 the

10384,inappropriate water and fertilizer management can lead to unstable crop yield and excessive irrigation and fertilization can potentially cause soil degradation and groundwater pollution a two year field experiment was conducted on drip fertigated spring maize zea mays l in ningxia of northwest china to explore the effects of four irrigation amounts i75 0 75etc i90 0 90etc i105 1 05etc and i120 1 20etc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration and four n p2o5 k2o fertilization rates f60 30 30 f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 in 2016 f150 70 70 f225 110 110 f300 150 150 and f375 180 180 in 2017 on maize growth grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation economic benefit and soil nitrate residue no3 n considering the goal of conserving both water and fertilizer while maintaining relatively high yields and minimizing soil no3 n a management strategy to optimize irrigation and fertilization regimes was developed based on the response surface methodology the results showed that irrigation amount and fertilization rate significantly affected leaf area index aboveground biomass grain yield and harvest index the irrigation fertilization interaction significantly affected plant and grain nitrogen accumulation in 2016 with lower fertilization range grain yield and grain nitrogen accumulation were highest under i120f240 120 120 reaching 14 440 kg ha 1 and 184 50 kg ha 1 respectively in 2017 with higher fertilization range both grain yield and grain nitrogen accumulation initially increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation and fertilization regimes grain yield and grain nitrogen accumulation were highest under i90f300 150 150 reaching 16 884 kg ha 1 and 195 09 kg ha 1 respectively although plant nitrogen uptake was dramatically higher under i90f375 180 180 than those in the other treatments grain yield was markedly lower under i90f300 150 150 and nitrogen harvest index was also lower soil no3 n increased with increasing fertilization rate but it decreased with increasing irrigation amount when irrigation amount and fertilization rate increased at the same time the soil no3 n accumulation area moved deeper in the soil profile soil no3 n content and distribution in the 60 100 cm soil layer showed an increasing trend but this trend was less obvious than that in the 0 60 cm soil layer when the irrigation amount was 447 452 mm and the n p2o5 k2o fertilization rate ranged from 290 145 145 to 303 152 152 kg ha 1 grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit 13 688 cny ha 1 can reach 95 confidence interval of their maximum values simultaneously this study can provide a theoretical basis for high efficient water and fertilizer utilization in sustainable spring maize zea mays l production in northwest china keywords drip irrigation spring maize grain yield nitrogen uptake soil no3 n 1 introduction ningxia is one of the most important spring maize growing regions in northwest china which is situated in the arid and semi arid region of china spring maize production in this area plays an important role in ensuring food security and avoiding energy crisis in china the primary irrigation method used on farmlands mostly sandy loam soil type in this region is basin irrigation zhao et al 2014 zheng et al 2019 however precipitation varies widely among seasons and years and water deficit frequently occurs during the maize growing seasons with decreases in the amount of water available from the yellow river and increases in non agricultural water demand shortages of water available for agricultural production have gradually restricted the sustainable development of local agriculture pereira et al 2007 fertilizer use efficiency is low in this area because fertilizers are overused and all fertilizer applications are typically made at planting this production practice has led to serious irrigation water loss and low efficiency of irrigation water use meanwhile excessive fertilizer applications and poor fertilization methods have resulted in low fertilizer use efficiency some reports have demonstrated that excessive irrigation amounts and nitrogen application rates can stimulate nitrate no3 n accumulation in the soil profile and degrade both surface and groundwater resources resulting in eutrophication and undrinkable water supplies barton and colmer 2006 nangia et al 2010 ziadi et al 2012 wang et al 2019a b in order to increase maize yield while reducing water and fertilizer inputs maintain sustainable crop production and improve the ecological environment of farmland in china governments have advocated that famers to develop high efficient and water saving production technologies drip irrigation is an efficient water saving irrigation technology providing accurate and timely application of water and fertilizer fan et al 2016 2017 jiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 yan et al 2019 wang et al 2020 this technique has increased crop yields decreased water requirements decreased tillage costs and reduced fertilizer application rates lekakis et al 2011 a properly designed drip fertigation system can maximize crop water and nutrient uptake while minimizing nutrient leaching gardenas et al 2005 thus drip irrigation has been widely accepted and used for crop production in arid and semi arid regions fanish et al 2011 zhou et al 2006 many previous studies have reported the obvious advantages of drip irrigation compared with other irrigation methods such as basin irrigation furrow and alternate furrow methods for instance some studies concluded that drip irrigation significantly improved water fertilizer and other chemical applications and increased crop production and water use efficiency pablo et al 2007 sampathkumar and pandian 2011 as other literature showed that drip irrigation improved both water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency and reduced the loss of soil no3 n and the risk of no3 n moving to deep soil depths wang et al 2018a chilundo et al 2017 an increasing number of farmers in china intend to use drip irrigation because the fertigation system can save much water and increase crop production in areas of water scarcity du et al 2008 tian et al 2016 yang et al 2016 drip irrigation and appropriate nitrogen fertilizer application rates have significantly promoted maize nitrogen uptake and increased grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency sui et al 2018 different irrigation methods and fertilization application rates have varying effects on nutrients and water distribution in the soil and plant nutrient uptake sui et al 2018 for example flood irrigation is a common method to provide nutrients for crop growth but this system has additional problems such as low nitrogen use efficiency high rate of nutrient loss due to leaching and the occurrence of crop injury playan et al 1997 yan et al 2020 indicated that most soil no3 n remained above 40 cm in the drip irrigation treatment and reduced the probability of soil no3 n leaching compared with flood irrigation soil no3 n accumulated more in the surface soil layer under drip fertigation than under border irrigation and the leaching amount decreased by 85 9 wei et al 2010 maize total nitrogen uptake amount was 13 3 higher under drip irrigation than nitrogen uptake in the conventional furrow irrigation system and yield increased by 13 7 with drip irrigation sandhu et al 2019 when water applications were optimized using drip irrigation grain yield increased by 28 in sandy soil and 12 in clay soil compared with rainfed yield and partial fertilizer productivity and nitrogen phosphorus and potassium uptake also increased wu et al 2019 gheysari et al 2009 found that nitrogen application rates of 142 and 189 kg n ha 1 resulted in higher nitrogen uptake with higher amounts of drip irrigation than with lower amounts of drip irrigation based on soil water depletion in addition wang et al 2017b and sui et al 2018 demonstrated the potential of using drip irrigation with assessments of optimal n level to effectively manage nitrogen applications and increase maize yields in china although previous studies have optimized water supply and fertilizer input for maximizing crop yield water use efficiency or economic benefit few studies have investigated their effects on plant nitrogen uptake and soil nutrient residue to decrease the risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater and improve maize yield nitrogen uptake and net returns that comprehensively develop sustainable agriculture thus understanding and mastering crop nitrogen uptake and soil nutrient distribution under drip fertigation can aid in the development of reasonable irrigation fertilization systems and promote sustainable agricultural development that further improves crop yields and nitrogen uptake and decreases the risk of groundwater pollution a two year field experiment was conducted on spring maize to determine the effects of drip irrigation amount and fertilization rate on maize growth grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation economic benefit and soil nitrate residue and determine the appropriate irrigation and nitrogen ranges for simultaneously optimizing the grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit of drip irrigated spring maize the results of this study can provide a theoretical basis and technical reference for producing high maize yield while synergistically utilizing water and nutrients in arid and semi arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiments were conducted during the spring maize growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 at the water saving irrigation station 36 50 n 106 00 e in tongxin ningxia province of china the region is classified as a temperate arid zone with a continental climate the 30 year average temperature is 8 6 c the average annual sunshine hours are 3024 h and the frost free period is 169 d the average annual rainfall is 273 mm and the average annual evaporation is 2325 mm during the 2016 and 2017 spring maize growing seasons apr sep maximum temperatures were 35 and 36 minimum temperatures were 5 and 1 and the effective rainfall amounts from maize planting to 20 days before harvest were 100 mm and 190 mm respectively fig 1 the sandy loam soil in the experimental area had a soil bulk density of 1 43 g cm 3 a field capacity of 28 95 volumetric water content a total n content of 0 65 g kg 1 a soil organic matter content of 8 10 g kg 1 a total p content of 0 77 g kg 1 an available phosphorus content of 21 65 mg kg 1 an available potassium content of 170 00 mg kg 1 and a ph of 7 8 2 2 experimental treatments and design the maize variety xianyu 335 was planted on 10th april 2016 and 12th april 2017 urea ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and potassium sulfate were used as fertilizers the drip irrigation fertilization system included a water pump filter fertilizer tanks and water distribution pipeline system the drip tape was an in line drip tape with drippers spaced 30 cm apart the dripper flow rate was 2 5 l h 1 and the dripper operating pressure was 0 1 mpa the experimental treatments consisted of four irrigation amounts and four fertilization rates the four irrigation treatments were based on fractions of crop evapotranspiration etc and designated as i75 0 75etc i90 0 90etc i105 1 05etc and i120 1 20etc respectively etc was calculated as allen et al 1998 1 e t c k c e t 0 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation during the maize growing season of 2001 2015 fig 1 kc is the crop coefficient for maize which was determined according to the maize growth stage the kc values were 0 7 from ve to v5 1 2 during v6 r2 and 0 6 during r3 r6 allen et al 1998 an appropriate ratio of n p2o5 k2o enhances the utilization of fertilizer and improves crop growth and yield gao et al 2006 recommended a n p2o5 k2o ratio of 1 0 0 5 1 0 approximately for maize however considering the high initial available potassium content in the study area the ratio of n p2o5 k2o was adjusted to 1 0 0 5 0 5 approximately the four fertilization rates were 60 30 30 120 60 60 180 90 90 and 240 120 120 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 in 2016 designated as f60 30 30 f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 respectively however it was found that maize yield continued to increase with increasing fertilization rate until f240 120 120 in 2016 to verify if near f240 120 120 was best for maize production the four fertilization rates were further increased to 150 70 70 225 110 110 300 150 150 and 375 180 180 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 in 2017 designated as f150 70 70 f225 110 110 f300 150 150 and f375 180 180 respectively each plot in the experimental area was 6 6 m wide and 27 5 m long each treatment was repeated three times and randomly arranged within 48 plots to prevent water movement between adjacent plots a 1 0 m wide buffer zone was set up between two plots spring maize was planted in alternating wide 70 cm and narrow 40 cm rows with maize plants spaced 20 cm apart in the rows the drip tape was placed in between two narrow rows with one drip tape irrigating two rows of spring maize fig 2 according to the growth characteristics of spring maize fertilizer treatments were applied a total of seven times during the entire 2016 growing season and a total of eight times during the entire 2017 growing season fig 3 the irrigation period began at the end of the maize seedling stag in addition we needed to ensure that the each treatment did not result in deep drainage out of the 0 100 cm soil profile after a single irrigation the maximum water storage capacity in the 0 100 cm soil profile was 286 mm therefore the designed irrigation interval was 12 days because of low soil moisture content after planting in 2017 we provided a small irrigation of 22 mm at the seedling stage since the effective rainfall during august 2017 was relatively large the 7th 8th and 9th irrigation were mainly used for fertilization and not for water supplementation therefore since small irrigation amounts used during these last three irrigation just enough to apply fertilizers to the soil surface the fertilizer was not transported to the active root zone sullivan et al 2000 and this application method was not conducive to the absorption of fertilizer by roots the irrigation amount for the i75 treatment was about 20 mm and the others were adjusted proportionally during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the actual irrigation amounts were 322 mm and 316 mm under i75 404 mm and 397 mm under i90 485 mm and 467 mm under i105 and 566 mm and 541 mm under i120 respectively fig 3 pesticides and herbicides were spread in the fields before sowing in the fields before sowing so the plots were kept free of weeds insects and diseases during the growing seasons 2 3 measurements and calculations leaf area index lai aboveground biomass grain yield and harvest index at the middle of the silking stage leaf area of five representative plants in each plot was measured leaf length l measured from ligule to leaf tip and width w measured at the widest portion of the leaf blade were used to calculate leaf area la using the formula la 0 75 w l lai was calculated as the leaf area per plant land area per plant ren et al 2016 five representative plants were sampled at harvest in each plot by cutting the plants at the soil surface removing the surface soil the maize plants were put in an oven at 105 c for 0 5 h for initial drying and subsequently dried at 75 c to constant weight plant mass was then determined using an electronic balance the average dry matter mass of each plot was calculated by multiplying average dry matter mass by the plant population at the same time that plants were sampled for aboveground biomass from each plot 10 adjacent plants were sampled in each of four rows irrigated by two adjacent drip irrigation lines the sampled plants were put into nylon mesh bags and dried the dried samples were threshed and the grain was weighed the grain yield of each plot was calculated and reported at 14 water content

significant differences using the duncan s multiple range tests at a significant level of p 0 05 ning et al 2012 the response surface methodology was used to optimize the irrigation amount and fertilization rate which allowed the graphical visualization of responses of grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit to irrigation amount and fertilization rate the surfaces were overlapped to find the appropriate water and fertilizer ranges that satisfied all the responses myers et al 2004 wang et al 2018a b 3 results 3 1 lai aboveground biomass grain yield and harvest index

greater than that under f120 60 60 in 2016 fig 4 a and lai under f225 110 110 was significantly greater than that under f150 70 70 in 2017 fig 4b in the i90 irrigation treatment lai with under f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 were significantly greater than that under f120 60 60 in 2016 and lai under f300 150 150 was significantly greater than that under f225 110 110 treatment in 2017 in the i105 irrigation treatment lai under f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 were significantly greater than that under f120 60 60 in 2016 and lai under f225 110 110 was significantly greater than that under f150 75 75 and was significantly less than that under f375 180 180 in 2017 in the i120 irrigation treatment lai under f120 60 60 was significantly greater than that under f60 30 30 in 2016 and lai under f225 110 110 was significantly greater than that under f150 75 75 in 2017 in general for a given irrigation amount in 2016 the aboveground biomass under f60 30 30 and f120 60 60 was less than that under f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 fig 4c the aboveground biomass under i75 and i105 initially increased and then decreased with increasing fertilization rate in 2017 fig 4d in 2016 in the i75 i90 and i105 irrigation treatments grain yield under f180 90 90 was significantly greater than that under f120 60 60 but there was no significant difference between f120 60 60 and f240 120 120 fig 4e in the i120 60 60 irrigation treatment grain yield did not differ significantly among f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 and i105f180 90 90 had an obvious yield advantage grain yield was highest in the i120f240 120 120 treatment 14 440 kg ha 1 even though fertilization rate and irrigation amount were smaller 60 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1and 82 mm respectively under i105f180 90 90 compared with i120f240 120 120 there was no significant yield difference between the two treatments fig 4e in 2017 for a given irrigation amount grain yield initially increased and then decreased with increasing fertilization rate fig 4f grain yield under f300 150 150 was significantly greater than those under f225 110 110 and f375 180 180 grain yield was greatest 16 884 kg ha 1 under i90f300 150 150 because of the significant irrigation fertilizer interaction for harvest index maximum values were obtained under i120f60 30 30 65 1 fig 4g and d90n150 61 3 fig 4h in 2016 and 2017 respectively in 2016 the harvest index of the i120f60 30 30 treatment increased by 14 61 but the yield decreased by 26 32 compared with the i120f240 120 120 treatment fig 4e g in 2017 there was no significant difference in harvest index between i90f150 70 70 and i90f300 150 150 treatments but the yield of the i90f150 70 70 treatment decreased by 21 21 compared with that of the i90f300 150 150 treatment fig 4f and h considering the high target yield expected for this region low fertilization treatments are not suitable for maize production here thus determining a reasonable irrigation fertilization combination is important for improving maize yield 3 2 spring maize nitrogen accumulation n harvest index and nue in 2016 and 2017 irrigation amount fertilization rate and the irrigation fertilization interaction exhibited significant effects on total nitrogen accumulation grain nitrogen accumulation nitrogen harvest index and nue p 0 01 table 2 the total nitrogen accumulation varied greatly under different water and fertilization treatments total nitrogen accumulation varied from 54 31 255 64 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 119 50 to 336 23 kg ha 1 in 2017 grain nitrogen accumulation varied from 30 81 184 50 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 72 54 to 195 09 kg ha 1 in 2017 and nitrogen harvest index varied from 0 52 to 0 73 in 2016 and from 0 54 to 0 66 in 2017 for a given irrigation amount in 2016 total nitrogen accumulation and grain nitrogen accumulation increased with increasing fertilization rate in 2017 the total nitrogen accumulation and grain nitrogen accumulation of the i75 irrigation treatment first increased and then decreased with increasing fertilization rate under the i90 irrigation amount in 2017 there was no significant difference between f300 150 150 and f375 180 180 treatments with regards to total nitrogen accumulation and grain nitrogen accumulation table 2 in 2016 total nitrogen accumulation and grain nitrogen accumulation in the i120f240 120 120 treatment were significantly greater than those of other treatments but its nitrogen harvest index was not significantly different than those of other treatments including i105f120 60 60 i105f180 90 90 i105f240 120 120 i120f120 60 60 and i120f180 90 90 however the nitrogen harvest index of the i120f240 120 120 treatment was significantly greater than observed for many other treatments in 2017 the nitrogen harvest index was greatest in the i75f300 150 150 but was not significantly different from nitrogen harvest index under i90f150 70 70 i105f150 70 70 i105f225 110 110 i105f375 180 180 i120f225 110 110 and i120f375 180 180 however the i75f300 150 150 treatment did produce a significantly greater nitrogen harvest index than other treatments under i75 and i90 in 2017 grain nitrogen accumulation initially increased and then decreased with increasing fertilization rate indicating that under a given irrigation amount appropriate increases in fertilization rate were beneficial to grain nitrogen accumulation but excessive fertilization would affect the nitrogen distribution among vegetative organs and reproductive organs resulting in decreased grain nitrogen accumulation under i75 and i90 total nitrogen accumulation and grain nitrogen accumulation of the f150 70 70 and f225 110 110 treatments in 2017 were higher compared to those of the f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 treatments in 2016 respectively this can be due to the higher rainfall in 2017 190 mm compared with that in 2016 100 mm in addition at the same irrigation level nue decreased with the increase of fertilization rate in the two years in general nue of each treatment in 2016 was higher than that in 2017 which may be related to the increase of fertilization rate in 2017 table 2 3 3 soil no3 n distribution in spring maize root zone in 2016 and 2017 the irrigation fertilization interaction had very significant effects on soil no3 n contents p 0 01 table 1 the contents varied between 5 00 and 25 44 mg kg 1 in 2016 and between 4 96 and 35 00 mg kg 1 in 2017 and increased with increasing fertilization rate fig 5 soil no3 n contents increased as irrigation amounts decreased in 2016 and 2017 under the i75 irrigation treatment soil no3 n was mainly distributed in the 0 60 cm soil layer the exception was found under i75f225 110 110 in 2017 where there was a soil no3 n accumulation zone at a horizontal distance of 20 30 cm from the drip tape and at a depth of 40 cm below the soil surface soil no3 n content in other treatments decreased with increasing soil depth at the different sampling points fig 5a in the i90 irrigation treatment fig 5b the soil no3 n accumulation area appeared at 40 cm depth below the soil surface soil no3 n contents for this irrigation treatment generally decreased with increasing soil depth and soil no3 n contents in the 40 60 cm soil layer were lower than those observed in other soil layers in the i105 irrigation treatment soil no3 n accumulation area also appeared at 40 cm depth below the soil surface fig 5c as the soil depth increased at the drip line soil no3 n content first increased and then decreased and soil no3 n contents at the sampling points 25 5 cm and 55 cm from the drip tape decreased with increasing soil depth for most treatments soil no3 n contents at a given soil depth showed a trend of initially decreasing and then increasing as horizontal distance from the drip tape increased in the i120 irrigation treatment soil no3 n accumulation area tended to move to lower soil depths than those observed in other irrigation treatments fig 5d also the accumulation area tended to move horizontally towards the sampling site that was 55 cm from the drip tape this change in the accumulation area was more obvious at increased fertilization rate soil no3 n contents at 20 30 cm distance from the irrigation line and at the 60 cm soil depth were generally lower than those in other soil layers however soil no3 n contents initially increased and then decreased at any given depth when moving horizontally away from the drip line 3 4 soil no3 n accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil profile at spring maize harvest further analyses of soil no3 n accumulation data in the 0 100 cm soil profile at spring maize harvest showed that there was a significant difference in soil no3 n accumulation among different water and fertilizer supply treatments fig 6 in 2016 fig 6a in the i75 irrigation treatment under f60 30 30 f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 soil no3 n accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil profile were 60 44 73 74 79 98 and 105 30 kg ha 1 respectively in the i90 irrigation treatment the corresponding values were 58 21 65 66 78 80 and 94 88 kg ha 1 in the i105 irrigation treatment the corresponding values were 53 64 64 27 69 15 and 75 54 kg ha 1 in the i120 irrigation treatment the respective values were 44 05 61 35 62 33 and 66 85 kg ha 1 in 2017 fig 6b in the i75 irrigation treatment under f60 30 30 f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 soil no3 n accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil profile were 65 37 75 01 87 02 and 123 46 kg ha 1 respectively in the i90 irrigation treatment the corresponding values were 61 35 71 89 84 40 and 113 76 kg ha 1 in the i105 irrigation treatment the corresponding values were 58 49 71 09 81 58 and 109 86 kg ha 1 in the i120 irrigation treatment the corresponding values were 38 61 55 24 64 12 and 108 03 kg ha 1 the data acquired in 2016 and 2017 clearly showed that soil no3 n accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil profile increased as fertilization rate increased and decreased as irrigation amount increased by calculating the ratio of no3 n accumulation in each soil layer to total no3 n accumulation for each irrigation treatment it was seen that no3 n accumulation was greatest in the 0 40 cm soil layer and no3 n accumulation followed the order of i75 i90 i105 i120 with increasing irrigation amount the proportion of soil no3 n accumulation in the 60 100 cm soil layer gradually increased and this phenomenon was more obvious in 2017 fig 6b soil no3 n accumulation in the 60 100 cm soil layer in the i75 and i90 treatments were 30 80 and 16 39 greater than those under i120 in 2017 fig 6b the results also showed that soil no3 n mainly concentrated in the surface soil layer in 2016 with increasing irrigation amount and fertilization rate soil no3 n will move downwards with water and move more no3 n into deep soils 3 5 economic benefit over the two years the gross profit ranged from 15 660 to 25 920 cny ha 1 in 2016 and from 17 762 to 30 391 cny ha 1 in 2017 compared with the minimum value the highest gross profit increased by 65 5 and 71 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively at the same irrigation level the net return first increased and then decreased with the increase of fertilizer rate reaching the maximum of 14 086 cny ha 1 under i120f180 90 90 in 2016 and 18 303 cny ha 1 under i90f300 150 150 in 2017 respectively the differences in net return were up to 7 814 cny ha 1 in 2016 and 10 805 cny ha 1 in 2017 table 3 the result indicates that inappropriate irrigation amount and fertilizer rate significantly reduced gross profit and net return of spring maize 3 6 optimization of water and fertilizer management based on yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit the data collected over the two years were comprehensively analyzed by considering the effects of different fertilization rates and irrigation amounts irrigation amount and fertilization rate were treated as independent variables and grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit were considered as the response variables based on the least squares method the data were analyzed using mathematica 9 0 wang et al 2018b and a binary quadratic regression equation was determined and used to calculate the amounts of irrigation and fertilization needed to maximize grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit table 4 the fitting results showed that the maximum yield of 15 009 kg ha 1 was achieved when 463 mm of irrigation water and 303 152 152 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 were applied the grain nitrogen accumulation was maximized at 176 59 kg n ha 1 with the application of 545 mm of irrigation water and 505 253 253 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 the economic benefit was maximized at 14 409 cny ha 1 with the application of 452 mm of irrigation water and 278 139 139 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 table 4 it was difficult to obtain the maximum grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit simultaneously therefore it is acceptable to consider the 95 confidence intervals for maximum grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit fig 7 when irrigation ranged from 447 to 542 mm and the fertilization rate ranged from 290 to 360 kg n ha 1 with a n p2o5 k2o ratio of 1 0 0 5 0 5 grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefits reached 95 of their maximum values simultaneously however fig 6 indicated that inappropriate irrigation amount and fertilization rate can cause no3 n leaching into deep soil layers and increase the risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater we were concerned about conserving both water and fertilizer so the optimal irrigation amount ranged from 447 452 mm and optimal fertilization rate ranged from 290 145 145 to 303 152 152 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation amount and fertilization rate on leaf area index aboveground biomass grain yield harvest index and nitrogen uptake and utilization of spring maize fertilizers are necessary for crop growth min et al 2016 wang et al 2017a zhang et al 2015 the amount of fertilizer available for uptake directly affects the growth and development of crops thereby affecting crop yields srivastava et al 2018 in this study we found that lai and aboveground biomass in 2017 were generally higher than those in 2016 under the same irrigation amount the reason may be that the rainfall and range of fertilization rates in 2016 were smaller than those in 2017 which could not effectively meet the growth requirements of spring maize in this region data from the two years showed that lai under i120f240 120 120 in 2016 and under i120f375 180 180 in 2017 were greatest which were significantly greater than lai in the f120 60 60 treatment in 2016 except for i120f120 60 60 and in the f150 70 70 treatment in 2017 indicating that maize lai did not increase linearly with increased fertilization rate guo et al 2015 reported that suitable irrigation and nitrogen rate can significantly increase maize aboveground biomass grain yield and harvest index and nitrogen uptake by maize increased with increasing irrigation amount and nitrogen they reported a parabolic response of maize yield to nitrogen rate yang and wang 2011 concluded that maize yield and nitrogen accumulation increased with nitrogen application rate but under the 12 000 m3 ha irrigation amount there was no significant increase in grain yield when the nitrogen rate were over 225 kg n ha 1 wang et al 2018a reported that nitrogen rates of 240 kg n ha 1 and 290 kg n ha 1 produced maize yields that were not significantly different from each other and nitrogen uptake by plants initially increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen rate such that the nitrogen rate of 240 kg n ha 1 maximized grain yield our results showed that maximum harvest index was obtained in the i120f60 30 30 treatment in 2016 and in the i90f150 70 70 treatment in 2017 however the yields of these two treatments were 26 32 and 21 21 lower than the maximum yields respectively therefore considering the higher target yield expected for this region low fertilization treatments are not suitable for maize production here in addition this study showed that the yield and grain nitrogen accumulation in the i90 irrigation treatment and f300 150 150 fertilization treatment were highest in 2017 the study also showed that f375 180 180 increased the crop total nitrogen uptake but grain nitrogen uptake and grain yield did not increase and it reduced the nitrogen harvest index in 2016 and 2017 nitrogen harvest index ranged from 0 52 to 0 73 and from 0 50 to 0 66 which further indicated that the nutrients absorbed by maize were mainly used to form seeds and to increase yield the grain nitrogen accumulation and yield under i90f300 150 150 were greatest and were significantly greater than those under i90f375 180 180 i105f300 150 150 and i120f300 150 150 the data demonstrated that excessive irrigation and fertilization would reduce grain nitrogen uptake and grain yield therefore a reasonable irrigation amount and fertilization rate plays an important role in increasing nitrogen uptake and crop yield 4 2 effects of irrigation amount and fertilization rate on soil no3 n content and distribution of spring maize roots in the soil profile as the main form of nitrogen for crop absorption and utilization soil no3 n concentrations can affect water and nutrient uptake of plants nie et al 2012 gorska et al 2008 its distribution and residual in the soil profile are affected by crop nitrogen absorption irrigation method and nitrogen fertilization rate sun et al 2012 excessive fertilization will significantly increase soil no3 n residual xu et al 2020 in this current study irrigation amount and fertilization rate had prominent effects on soil no3 n distribution and residual increasing fertilization rate increased the soil no3 n content while increasing irrigation amount reduced the soil no3 n content as irrigation amount and fertilization rate increased the deep soil no3 n content tended to increase gradually in the i105 and i120 irrigation treatments the soil no3 n accumulation area appeared between 40 cm and 60 cm below the drip line and the no3 n accumulation area was increasingly obvious as the fertilization rate increased which is similar to the finding of li et al 2004 badr et al 2010 also showed that no3 n migrated with water and accumulated near the wetting front this is because no3 n is very soluble in water and moves with water water uptake by roots causes water to move horizontally after entering the soil with no3 n accumulating at the edge of the wetting front however the greater water content in the soil below the drip line hinders the vertical movement of no3 n and the higher soil water content that remains below the drip line over longer time can result in poor soil aeration producing a condition that is conducive to denitrification weier et al 1993 in addition the present study indicated that the proportion of soil no3 n accumulation in the 60 100 cm soil layer gradually increased with increasing irrigation amount for example the soil no3 n accumulation in the i120 irrigation treatment was on average 30 80 and 16 39 greater than those in the i75 and i90 treatments in 2017 respectively this results indicated that excessive irrigation will produce seepage of water by gravity that causes no3 n to leach into deep soil layers and can increase the risk of groundwater pollution liang and mackenzie 1994 therefore application of reasonable irrigation amount and fertilization rate can slow no3 n migration into deep soil and thus reduce the risk of groundwater pollution 4 3 the combined effects of irrigation amount and fertilization rate many researchers have established the relationships between irrigation amount fertilizer inputs and crop yield through a combination of multivariate regression and spatial analyses wang et al 2018b a b zou et al 2020 in this study we further analyzed the relationships between water fertilizer inputs and crop yield nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit by considering the 95 confidence interval for the maximum values of those parameters from fig 6 we know that appropriate irrigation amount and fertilization rate can cause no3 n to leach into deep soil layers and increase the risk of nitrate leaching an irrigation range of 447 452 mm and a fertilization range of 290 145 145 to 303 152 152 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 resulted in 95 of the maximum values of grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefits 13 688 cny ha 1 which is recommended as the optimal irrigation and fertilization strategy for sustainable spring maize production in the study region 5 conclusions for a given irrigation amount grain yield initially increased and then decreased as fertilization rate increased in 2017 and reached the maximum value of 16 884 kg ha 1 under i90f300 150 150 the total nitrogen accumulation of spring maize increased with increasing fertilization rate in both years the soil no3 n readily moved with water and the no3 n content in the spring maize root zone was proportional to fertilization rate and inversely proportional to irrigation amount considering the goal of conserving both water and fertilizer as well as decreasing the risk of groundwater pollution while maintaining high maize yield an irrigation range of 447 452 mm combined with a fertilization rate of 290 145 145 and 303 152 152 kg n p2o5 k2o ha 1 was recommended to maintain 95 maximum values of maize grain yield grain nitrogen accumulation and economic benefit 13 688 cny ha 1 simultaneously the results of this study are of great significance for the scientific management of drip irrigation and fertilization of spring maize in ningxia of china and maybe similar arid and semi arid maize production areas acknowldgement this study was jointly sponsored by the national key research and development program of china no 2017yfc0403303 the
