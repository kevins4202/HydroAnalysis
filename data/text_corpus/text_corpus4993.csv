24965,post fire assessment is made after a wildfire incident to provide details about damage level and its distribution over burned areas such assessments inform restoration plans and future monitoring of ecosystem recovery due to the high cost and time to conduct fieldwork remote sensing is an appealing alternative to assess post fire condition over larger areas than can be surveyed practically in the field the aim of this study is to use remote sensing data to characterize post fire severity at tree level in a mixed conifer forest following the cascade and east zone megafires of 2007 in central idaho usa we used remote sensing metrics derived from airborne laser scanning als data 2008 and high resolution quickbird qb multispectral satellite imagery 2007 2009 for calibrating and validating predictive models with field data 2008 we compared fire effects on trees in open canopies within recent fuel treatments to similar trees in closed canopies on adjacent untreated sites we observed more trees with charred crowns in high fire severity sites mostly untreated whereas we observed more trees with live crowns in low fire severity sites independent of the treatment individual trees were more accurately detected from als data in treated sites with open canopies than untreated sites with closed canopies for detected trees the response variables predicted from als and qb metrics were total height ht crown base height cbh total basal area bat live basal area bal scorched basal area bas charred basal area bac and crown severity cs none of the selected qb metrics were strongly correlated with the selected als metrics which justified combining both data types into the predictive models random forest regression models combining als qb metrics or using als metrics alone performed similarly but clearly better than models using only qb metrics this study shows the superiority of als data to high resolution multispectral qb imagery for mapping fire severity at tree level managers with limited resources to plan for restoration of fire affected forests are advised to prioritize spending for data collection on als data and a modest number of field inventory plots rather than qb or other broadband satellite imagery keywords crown fire severity fire effects fuel treatment effectiveness individual tree attributes random forest 1 introduction wildfires suppression in the western u s costs billions of dollars annually and places firefighters and the public at risk nifc 2019 many advocate an increase in fuel treatment implementation to alter fire behavior and effects and promote successful fire suppression at a lower cost e g cohen 2000 lentile et al 2006 ellison et al 2015 hudak et al 2011a swetnam et al 2015 over the last 20 years efforts to alter hazardous fuels have been ongoing with emphasis on treating areas where people and their property reside often referred to as the wildland urban interface wui it is assumed that these fuel treatments will alter fire behavior and severity to allow for fire suppression opportunities and produce post fire outcomes that are socially acceptable fuel treatments are designed to reduce hazardous fuels focus on four forest structural and compositional characteristics that include altering surface fuels ladder fuels crown fuels and shifting species composition agee and carl 2005 but in some cases are not sociable acceptable in all conditions molina terrén et al 2016 surface fuels typically are treated either through prescribed fire grapple piling or mastication thinning tree crowns and thinning from below are applied to separate crowns and remove ladder fuels fire resistant species are often favored over non fire resistant species graham et al 2004 hurteau and north 2010 these treatments are designed to reduce fire behavior and mitigate fire severity in case a wildfire occurs however there are mixed results indicating as to whether fuel treatments alter fire effects when a wildfire does burn through these treatments hudak et al 2011a another reason is that research on fuel treatment effectiveness is still needed because the frequency that a wildfire will test a fuel treatment is low as a percentage of the fuel treatments implemented most large wildfires have a post fire assessment to inform managers on where and how much the fire affected the soils and vegetation fire severity can be either defined to the loss or decomposition of organic matter aboveground and belowground keeley 2009 as the first order fire effects such as how much of the duff logs and other dense organic matter on the soil surface is consumed ice et al 2004 for trees as suggested by hudak et al 2007 sites may be classified as low severity when live green crowns are predominate as moderate severity when scorched brown crowns are predominant and as high severity when charred black crowns predominate the spatial distribution of fire severity and consequently the identification of the tree crown severity class live scorched or charred are key factors that may be used to quantify the impact of fires and vegetation response and consequently guide post fire management responses montealegre et al 2014 knowledge about the crown severity of each tree helps to predict future site conditions given that mapped tree crowns capture the spatial distribution of trees tree crown severity maps could be used to develop more precise site specific forest and fire management plans kim et al 2009 remote sensing tools have potential to assess post fire impacts on vegetation structure and physiology which is important to understand the fire severity effects on post fire ecosystem processes in small areas i e plots and pixels or at the tree level using high resolution data kokaly et al 2007 the use of remote sensing data to understand fire effects over large areas has been well studied at the landscape level using moderate resolution e g landsat satellite imagery e g miller and yool 2002 miller and thode 2007 hudak et al 2007 french et al 2008 verbyla and lord 2008 veraverbeke et al 2011 prior studies typically involved identification of unique spectral signatures associated with burn areas holden et al 2010 or snags pasher and king 2009 or the use of combined spectral and texture features to identify forest gaps barton et al 2017 although satellite remote sensing has been shown to be an essential technology for studying post fire consequences the traditional and older generation sensors such as landsat and spot have a number of limitations with regard to spectral spatial and temporal resolution steininger 2000 these limitations might be overcome using a newer generation of sensors with higher spatial resolution such as quickbird qb to more accurately resolve smaller landscape features including trees spectral vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 and red green index rgi coops et al 2006 can be used to differentiate live trees from dead trees high resolution imagery also has been used to detect burn severity from wildfire holden et al 2010 holden et al 2012 recognition of fire affected tree attributes such as percent of live scorched or charred crown may facilitate the selection of which trees to salvage or to leave as potential seed sources lentile et al 2006 in addition wildlife habitat relationships can be mapped validated and improved when habitat components such as live scorched and charred crown trees are spatially mapped which is a valuable step for management and conservation applications vogeler et al 2016 the combined use of high resolution passive optical multispectral imagery with active sensors could provide more accurate post fire information than either sensor type alone fire severity estimations from active sensors are more sensitive to disturbance effects on forest structure than passive satellite sensors mccarley et al 2017 examples of active sensors include radio detection and ranging radar and light detection and ranging lidar tanase et al 2010 2011 kane et al 2013 airborne lidar also known as airborne laser scanning als is an example of an active remote sensing technology capable of simultaneously characterizing terrain and vegetation structure across large spatial extents hudak et al 2009 als has increased the accuracy and efficiency of large scale forest inventories and wildlife habitat studies næsset 2002 maltamo et al 2006 martinuzzi et al 2009 als data have been used in fire studies to estimate fuel parameters to use as input into fire behavior models such as crown bulk density or height to live crown andersen et al 2005 agca et al 2011 skowronski et al 2011 as well as to assess changes in forest structure wulder et al 2009 mccarley et al 2017 although als data are limited in spatial and temporal coverage and come at a relatively high cost to project managers vogeler et al 2016 their rich 3 d information of forest structure make them relevant for a variety of natural resource management applications hudak et al 2009 numerous studies have explored combining multiple remote sensing datasets and corresponding field data for modeling forest attributes e g hudak et al 2006 dalponte 2018 goetz et al 2010 bright et al 2012 bright et al 2014 however few studies have tested this combination in the post fire environment and at the individual tree level wulder et al 2009 swetnam et al 2015 casas et al 2016 between treated and untreated stands the objective of this study was to characterize post fire total crown height ht crown base height cbh total basal area bat live basal area bal scorched basal area bas charred basal area bac and crown severity cs classes at tree level in a mixed conifer forest from one year post fire als and either immediate one year or two year post fire high resolution multispectral qb images 2 methods 2 1 study area the study focuses on secesh meadows and warm lake two forested communities in the wildland urban interface wui of central idaho that had been protected with wui and firewise fuel treatments prior to the cascade and east zone megafires of 2007 graham et al 2009 hudak et al 2011a b the wui treatments were implemented from 2000 to 2006 on national forest lands on the outskirts of both communities fig 1 whereas firewise treatments not shown were implemented on the private lands pile and burn fuel treatments were implemented at secesh meadows while at warm lake there was a mix of pile and burn mastication and underburn treatments hudak et al 2011a 2 2 field data collection trees n 880 were tallied in august 2008 using 20 paired plots designed to assess effectiveness of mechanical fuel treatments for mitigating severe wildfire effects hudak et al 2011a the treated plot of each pair was randomly located inside the treatment unit whereas the untreated plot was situated in a random location with a similar slope and aspect just outside the treatment unit fig 1 thirteen paired plots i e n 26 were situated in the secesh meadows study area while seven paired plots i e n 14 were situated in the warm lake study area each plot was 0 04 ha in area 11 3 m radius all trees 12 cm were tallied for diameter at breast height dbh species and live dead status from dbh total basal area was calculated bat on a subsample of trees comprised of the largest and smallest tree of each species in each plot quadrant the ht and cbh was measured while percentages of live scorched and charred tree crown were visually estimated and recorded with 5 precision under the constraint that they sum to 100 hudak et al 2011a 2 3 tree attribute imputation we applied k nearest neighbor k nn imputation a nonparametric modeling technique to infer missing values of the subsampled tree attributes ht cbh and percentages of live scorched and charred crowns using the yaimpute package crookston and finley 2008 in the r statistical software r core team 2019 for this study we used random forest based k nn rf k nn imputation to infer the missing tree attributes from predictor variables known for all trees tallied in the field plots tree dbh species study area secesh meadows or warm lake site condition treated or untreated and site fire severity as called on the ground for the site low moderate or high the number of neighbors was set to one k 1 to maintain the original variance in the data hudak et al 2008 2 4 quickbird imagery acquisition and pre processing quickbird images were acquired immediately after the wildfire on 22 october secesh meadows and 27 october warm lake 2007 and again on 18 august 2008 warm lake and on 16 july 2009 secesh meadows the 2007 images capturing immediate fire effects and collected only 5 days apart were considered for the main analysis of this study whereas the later images also considered are detailed in the supplementary material the four 2 4 m multispectral bands were fused with the 0 6 m panchromatic band into a 4 band product of 0 6 m resolution delivered by the vendor digitalglobe longmont co several vegetation indices with potential sensitivity to fire effects were calculated from the 0 6 m fused 4 band qb imagery table 1 2 5 airborne laser scanning acquisition and pre processing airborne laser scanning als data were collected over the two study areas secesh meadows and warm lake one year after the wildfire on 1 3 september 2008 table 2 the als vendor watershed sciences now quantum spatial inc portland or post processed and delivered the data as las files returns were classified using the lasground function in lastools isenburg 2018 and a 1 m resolution digital terrain model dtm was interpolated from the ground returns using the gridsurfacecreate function in fusion software mcgaughey 2018 the point clouds were height normalized by subtracting the elevation of the dtm at each point and the canopy height model chm was created from the normalized heights at 0 5 m resolution 2 6 individual tree detection individual tree detection and crown metrics computation were performed using the rlidar package silva et al 2015 2016 in r r core team 2019 in four steps first the 0 5 m chm was smoothed by a 3 3 mean filter to remove spurious local maxima caused by tree branches second individual trees were detected from the smoothed chm using a local maxima algorithm implemented in the findtreeschm function the findtreeschm searched for treetops in the chm via a moving window with a fixed treetop window size tws a tws of 5 5 was found to be most effective for individual tree detection according to preliminary tests third each individual tree crown was delineated based on voronoi tessellation aurenhammer 1991 implemented in the forestcas function the crown area carea m2 was defined from the circle calculated as πr2 with the radius r being half the diameter of the delineated tree crown 2 7 qb and als derived crown metrics the mean and standard deviation of each qb band and spectral index table 1 table s1 at crown level were calculated as candidate variables for the predictive models for crown metrics derived from als data all returns of the normalized heights within simplified crown polygons were extracted and crown height metrics e g maximum height mean height etc table 3 were computed using the crownmetrics function in rlidar silva et al 2015 2016 for each tree detected based on vertical profiles of the heights within the crown polygon the normalmixem function from the mixtools package benaglia et al 2009 in r was fitted to compute crown base height cbh m from lidar crown volume cv m3 and crown surface area csa m2 were calculated as the volume and surface area of 3d convex hulls derived from all als returns within the crown segments table 3 also intensity metrics were calculated as candidate variables for predictive modeling as for the effects of the incidence angle on the intensity several studies have shown that for small angles up to 15 this effect can be neglected coren and sterzai 2006 kukko et al 2008 the variables described above were then used to predict the post fire tree attributes measured in the field i e ht and cbh or calculated from the field data i e by multiplying bat by the live scorched and charred crown percentages to calculate weighted estimates of bal bas bac also the live scorched and charred percentages were used to classify individual tree crown severity into classes table 4 2 8 predictive modeling and assessment tree stems were not mapped in the field plots but were sorted beginning north of plot center and proceeding clockwise therefore tree lists tallied in the field or from tree level als metrics were matched based on their total tree height in a process similar to imputation first both the field and als individual tree lists for each plot were sorted by total tree height and combined into a single table second if the number of als detected trees was higher than in the field extra trees were randomly pulled from the als detected tree list within the same plot or if the number of als detected trees was lower than in the field trees were randomly added from the als detected tree list within the same plot thus the same number of als derived crown attributes were obtained as trees tallied in the field this ensured that there were no missing values in the dataset to interfere with the subsequent modeling and that the tree tally reflected actual tree density on the ground as this greatly influences fire behavior and severity 2 8 1 variable selection and regression modeling model improvement ratio mir e g evans and cushman 2009 evans et al 2010 evans 2018 silva et al 2017 was applied to identify the most important als and qb metrics for predicting ht cbh bat bal bas and bac to create parsimonious models we reserved only the metrics that exhibited mirs 0 35 for modeling we split the data into training 75 n 660 and validation 25 n 220 datasets and the attributes of interest ht cbh bat bal bas bac and cs classes 1 4 were predicted at the tree level using the training dataset and again the random forest package breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2015 in r as in the predictor variable selection procedure ntree was set to 1000 and mtry was set to 2 for random forest regression the accuracy of estimates for each model was evaluated in terms of adj r2 absolute and relative root mean square error rmse and bias based on the linear relationship between predicted and observed values 1 r m s e m m 2 i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 n 2 b i a s m m 2 1 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i where n is the number of observations y i is the observed value for tree properties i and y ˆ i is the predicted value for tree properties i moreover relative rmse and bias were calculated by dividing the absolute values eqs 1 and 2 by the mean of the observed values the adj r2 absolute and relative rmse and bias statistics were computed based on the linear relationship between predicted and observed variables using the validation dataset withheld from training we used the two sided wilcoxon mann whitney rank sum w hollander and wolfe 1973 bauer 1972 in r to assess if the mean of predicted and the observed crown attributes i e ht cbh bat bal bas and bac differed at a significance level of 5 2 8 2 classification modeling and assessment we ran random forest in classification mode to predict the categorical response variable of cs class to assess the accuracy and precision of the cs classification models cohen s kappa coefficient and accuracy sensitivity and specificity values were calculated cohen s kappa coefficient table 5 classifies the model according to the level of agreement and the percentage of data that are reliable classification accuracy shows how often the classifier is correct by equation tp tn total where tp is true positive cases in which yes was predicted and it was true and tn is true negative cases in which no was predicted and it was true sensitivity is defined as the proportion of positive results out of the number of samples which were actually positive specificity is defined as the proportion of negative results out of the number of samples which were actually negative 3 results 3 1 evaluation of fuel treatment effectiveness field measurements affirmed that the treated sites had fewer trees per hectare number than the untreated sites number on sites classified as high severity untreated plots were dominated by charred trees both in total number and percent of trees while treated plots had similar abundance in trees with scorched crowns and charred crowns although the moderate severity class in treated stands were dominated by trees with scorched needles there were a few trees of mixed crown severity in contrast very few trees had a mixed crown severity in the untreated stands the low severity class in untreated stands was dominated by live trees versus in treated stands where there tended to be a diversity of crown damage fig 2 3 2 imputation of tree attributes individual tree ht was imputed with comparable precision between treated and untreated sites although accuracy was higher at treated sites table 6 while cbh was imputed with clearly higher precision and accuracy at treated sites than untreated sites table 6 percent live and charred crowns were more precisely and accurately imputed at untreated sites than treated sites but in general percent scorched crown was imputed with less precision but more accuracy whether or not the site was treated table 6 3 3 individual tree detection using als data individual tree detection performed highly better in treated plots with open canopy structure than untreated plots with typically closed canopies even though the untreated plots had higher tree density than treated plots when considering two untreated plots as outliers the comparison of observed and detected tree density resulted in an increased r2 of 0 41 fig 3 3 4 crown metrics and variable selection a total of 15 of the 30 candidate als metrics hmax hmean hsd hkur hqr hrange h25th imean isd iqr i25th cdens cl cbh cratio and 6 of the 24 candidate qb metrics ndvimean ndvisd evimean baimean rgimean redmean were not highly correlated i e r 0 9 with at least one other metric within each sensor type group and therefore were considered further in the mir analyses when comparing als to qb metrics the correlations were weak for instance ndvimean produced weak and positive correlations with the intensity metrics from als as did i25th isd imean and iqr fig 4 3 5 random forest modeling and assessment 3 5 1 regression model random forest models explained 12 66 of variation in predicting ht based on the full dataset table 8 however the models based on the training dataset 75 performed differently between treated and untreated plots figs 5 7 when assessed with the withheld data 25 the hmax and hmean metrics were important predictors of ht in the als and als qb models six indices baimean evimean ndvimean ndvisd redmean rgimean were important predictors in the qb model table 7 hmax exhibited the highest mir in ht models using als metrics or als qb metrics while the red band exhibited the highest mir in the ht model using only qb metrics table 7 als intensity metrics were not important predictors of ht in als or als qb models qb metrics were not important as explanatory variables of ht in als qb models table 8 the accuracy of cbh prediction when higher at the open canopy treated plots than at the closed canopy untreated plots figs 5 7 with explained variation in cbh ranging from 5 to 25 table 8 als derived height and intensity metrics were important in predicting cbh tables 7 and 8 while ndvimean and evimean were also important predictors of cbh in the qb model when als and qb derived metrics were combined the percent variance explained in cbh models increased from 5 to 24 but none of qb derived metrics were retained in the model table 7 and 8 the most important predictor metrics to explain the variation in bat from als and als qb models were height metrics such as hmax and hmean tables 7 and 8 baimean and red were the most important predictors of bat in the qb model but the als and als qb models performed better in untreated plots whereas the qb model performed better in treated plots figs 5 7 random forest models predicting bal bas and bac from qb metrics alone were poor and qb metrics did little to improve als qb models the selected predictors were similar for all the ba models weighted by crown color classes where in general als intensity metrics were more important than qb metrics table 7 bas is predicted more poorly than bal or bac table 8 bal and bac models performed better in untreated plots than treated plots table 8 height and intensity metrics consistently exhibited high mirs in all models als qb and als qb models and all study plots treated and untreated in the qb models bai evi ndvi and red were better predictors of crown severity expressed in terms of weighted basal area bal bas and bac or as a class cs 1 4 table 7 however all models fitted to explain bal bas and bac had a rmse higher than 100 the qb metrics did not improve the predictive models when included with als metrics table 8 we developed additional random forest models for the two study areas to further investigate the potential of qb imagery collected either one or two years post fire 2008 and 2009 at warm lake and secesh meadows respectively see supplementary material tables s2 and s4 in the case of warm lake the 2008 qb image was a better temporal match to the 2008 als and field data collection thus providing a fairer comparison between the two sensor types table s2 on the other hand for secesh meadows 2009 qb model accuracies were relatively poorer which matched expectations given the one year difference with the als and field measures collected in 2008 one year post fire table s4 3 5 2 crown severity cs classification model moderate als and als qb to weak qb classification accuracies were observed to model cs classes 1 to 4 based on the full dataset as expected noticeably higher accuracies were observed when using qb from 2008 the same year that the field and als data were collected table s3 similarly to using qb from 2007 table 9 we observed weaker classification accuracy when using qb from 2009 table s5 in general classification model accuracies were better in untreated than treated areas table 9 finally cs 4 and cs 3 produced higher sensitivity values while cs 1 and cs 2 produced the higher specificity values within the random forest classification models fig 8 4 discussion post fire assessment is an essential activity for developing a management plan remote sensing adds value to field assessments as a way to expand information on damage level and its distribution over larger burned areas than can be practically surveyed in the field however most prior studies are not precisely characterizing fire effects because they only consider the three broad post fire severity classes of low moderate or high fire severity at the plot or stand level at a moderate spatial resolution of 30 m e g hudak et al 2011b our study presents a novel approach for mapping post fire charred scorched and live crowns at the tree level and may be the first to test both als and qb imagery at the tree level spatial heterogeneity in fire severities of variable patch size mixed with unburned canopies are characteristic of large wildfires christensen 1993 turner et al 1994 broncano and retana 2004 the vast majority of which are much smaller than the east zone and cascade complex mega fires that impacted our local study areas hudak et al 2011a the methodology presented herein based on als and qb data for individual tree detection crown structure and crown fire severity characterization in post fire sites provides an alternative to the traditional area based approach using moderate resolution landsat satellite data more resolute predictions of crown attributes e g basal area height crown fire severity can be aggregated into larger grid cells across the landscape for use in habitat models casas et al 2016 whereas area based predictions if rescaled may bias the habitat models garabedian et al 2014 moreover burned severity patches are not homogeneously comprised of only low moderate or high burn severity but represent a mixture individual tree approach may also minimize aggregation errors and allow land managers to more accurately identify severely burned areas montealegre et al 2014 however as fire severity increases canopy fragmentation may occur increasing the number of tree clumps montealegre et al 2014 and making tree detection more difficult also noise may be introduced into the tree detection by broken or partially consumed snags casas et al 2016 immediately following high severity burns overstory canopy is largely removed but considerable overstory canopy remains after moderate or low severity burns lentile et al 2006 by design pre fire fuel treatments dramatically reduce the tree density creating open canopy conditions from what was previously closed canopy not surprisingly we found better detection of individual trees in treated sites due to low canopy cover in closed canopy conditions without a prior pre fire treatment individual tree detection was more difficult because of overlapping tree crowns of variable sizes both live and dead wing et al 2015 previous studies also found higher tree detection accuracy in open canopy conditions casas et al 2016 falkowski et al 2008 silva et al 2016 in two untreated plots that were the strongest outliers i e highest numbers of trees detected seen in close proximity in fig 3a about three times as many trees were found from the als data as were tallied in the field high fire severity occurred at these plots resulting in charred tree tops devoid of needles that offered very little surface area from which to reflect returns we speculate that false detections may have been caused by larger branches than would be detected in an unburned dense closed canopy stand that still retained its needles especially considering the lidar point density of 5 points m 2 was quite sparse by current standards additionally leaning trees i e trees bent at an angle 45 due to snow or other agents probably contributed to false detections wing et al 2015 the main advantage of using r and mir statistics for selecting the most important als and qb metrics was to achieve parsimonious models silva et al 2017 2017b in this way highly correlated metrics were removed and the most important metrics were clearly identified herein the chosen als height related metrics hmax hmean hsd hrange and h25th were informative for characterizing forest structure attributes such as ht cbh and ba a notable result was that the chosen als intensity metrics despite not having been normalized were more informative for crown severity characterization see table 7 than the qb metrics these intensity metrics include imean isd iqr and i25th the contribution of als intensity metrics to describe forest structure and distinguish fire severity classes found in this study agrees with other studies e g kim et al 2009 lim et al 2003 casas et al 2016 random forest regression and classification models produced better predictions of ht cbh batl bal bas bac and cs classes on untreated sites than treated sites also in treated sites the residual trees were more broadly and evenly spaced whereas broken or partially consumed snags were common in untreated sites casas et al 2016 it is important to note that our study area had both treated and untreated sites that captured a broader fire severity gradient than would have either treatment condition alone we observed differences in accuracy between als and qb models both in treated and untreated areas for instance the prediction of ht and cbh relied primarily on height related metrics mainly the hmax and hmean respectively other studies have attempted to predict cbh scott and reinhardt 2001 because it is one of the most important forest structure attributes used in crown fire behavior models rothermel and rinehart 1983 and it is associated with tree fire severity because tree crown characteristics varied so dramatically due to their fire severity condition cbh predicted in our study had a larger rmse than previous studies for instance vauhkonen 2010 using als data estimated cbh with a rmse varying between 1 54 3 88 m while jung et al 2011 had a lower rmse of 1 87 in both studies the study areas were unburned forests whereas our case study area had both treatment and wildfire effects contributing to the variation other studies have shown that bat as well as live ba and dead ba bright et al 2013 2014 may be reasonably predicted from height related metrics hudak et al 2006 estimated bat of an actively managed mixed forest in idaho usa using als and advanced land imager ali multispectral satellite data they also explained more variance ranging from r2 0 71 to r2 0 89 using als data alone or in combination with ali spectral indices than using ali metrics alone in this study vegetation index derived from qb derived suite of metrics e g ndvimean baimean and redmean produced the highest mir for predicting basal area weighted by crown severity live scorched and charred and the cs classes ndvi is a useful indicator of photosynthetic capacity willis 2015 but also is affected by understory and soil properties that contribute to background reflectance escuin et al 2008 which varies greatly between burn severity classes a reasonable and significant correlation between ndvi and fire severity was found by diaz delgado et al 2003 on the other hand oliveras et al 2009 and hammill and bradstock 2006 found low correspondence between ndvi and percentage of charred or live canopies while height related metrics from als may be most useful for predicting and mapping forest structural attributes e g ht cbh and bat increased availability of high resolution imagery and or als intensity metrics are improving post fire cs classification kim et al 2009 intensity and spectral information about post fire disturbance were the most important predictors for all the response variables related to crown condition live scorched and charred in this study see table 7 we can highlight all selected intensity metrics and the qb indices derived from the red and nir bands ndvi evi bai and red which had relatively higher importance in the predicted models als intensity metrics alone were selected to predict bal and bac and cs classes tables 7 9 this may be attributable to higher near infrared return intensity reflected from green rather than non photosynthetic vegetation components moreover als intensity can be used to estimate and distinguish between live and dead biomass kim et al 2009 which our results support fig s1 when both als and qb metrics were combined ndvimean was the most important explanatory variable to predict bal the same was not observed for predicting bac where none of the qb derived indices was important using only als data hmax was the most important explanatory variable for both bal and bac as well as bat a second explanatory variable for predicting bal and bac according to mir was iqr and i25th respectively higher als intensities are associated with green foliage while lower als intensities are associated with black vegetation fig s1 kim et al 2009 used als data to distinguish between live and dead standing tree biomass in grand canyon national park usa and bright et al 2013 considered als intensity metrics to predict both live and dead ba in western coniferous forests impacted by bark beetles these studies associated low intensity returns with dead biomass finding that the low intensity als returns were sensitive to the proportion of echoes from non photosynthetic woody material including dead trees the accuracy of bas models was improved 12 when als and qb metrics were combined table 8 the brown color of dead or dying needles may be associated with pests and diseases as well as needles scorched by fire coops et al 2006 used qb imagery to detect red attack damage due to mountain pine beetle infestation and they found rgi to be a good index to discriminate red attack crowns from non attack unlike coops et al 2006 among the qb metrics in our study bai ndvi and red were selected as having higher importance than rgi to predict bas more generally however als metrics were more important than qb metrics as explanatory variables to predict bas part of the issue is that as the post fire scene changes so will its reflectance properties scorched needles falling from the trees in the days weeks and months following a fire would explain our generally poorer ability to predict bas compared to bal and bac table 8 and crown severity class 3 compared to crown severity classes 1 2 or 4 table 9 random forest models for classifying cs produced satisfactory accuracy als intensity metrics were important to predict cs class in the absence of qb metrics the 2 year post fire qb at secesh meadows diminished the utility of qb data for postfire tree crown assessment tables s3 s4 relative to the 1 year post fire qb at warm lake tables s1 s2 the post fire scene changes quickly during the first post fire year and then the rate of change as site recovery slows over time lewis et al 2017 among the als intensity metrics iqr hrange and i25th where the most important to predict bal bas bac respectively complex associations between wildfire effects and fuel conditions can cause for instance mixed live and charred crowns while scorched crowns necessarily fall within the gradient from unburned or low to high severity conditions jain and graham 2007 few studies have attempted to map crown severity class at fine scales in a post fire forest using field or remote sensing e g jain and graham 2007 and most existing studies using either als or qb are focused on snag detection e g jain and graham 2007 casas et al 2016 vogeler et al 2016 instead of crown condition fuel treatments produced a diverse set of tree severity outcomes compared to the untreated stands it is not surprising that the treated sites tended to have more scorched trees crowns compared to the untreated sites fig 2 however there were fewer fully consumed crowns charred crowns in the treated sites approximately 60 compared to the untreated stands that contained close to 100 of some trees totally charred thus the treatments did diminish the amount of crown fire graham et al 2009 noted that in the warm lake wildfire complex there were multiple head fires that burned into and around the treated sites 5 conclusion in this study we used tree measurements collected in 40 field plots to characterize fire effects on individual tree crowns and then summarized at the plot level our study shows the greater utility of als data compared to high resolution qb imagery for estimating post fire scorched and charred tree crowns basal area tree height and crown base height in a mixed conifer forest from one year post fire als and either immediate one year or two year post fire multispectral qb images of high resolution als derived models performed better than qb imagery for characterizing both tree structure attributes and crown severity but the combination of als and qb derived metrics slightly improved the accuracy of only a few models we hope that the promising results for characterizing post fire crown attributes in this study will stimulate further research and applications worldwide future research and development could attempt to automate and apply such models across broader spatial extents to generate stem maps across burned landscapes to greatly assist forest managers in the preparation of conservation and

24965,post fire assessment is made after a wildfire incident to provide details about damage level and its distribution over burned areas such assessments inform restoration plans and future monitoring of ecosystem recovery due to the high cost and time to conduct fieldwork remote sensing is an appealing alternative to assess post fire condition over larger areas than can be surveyed practically in the field the aim of this study is to use remote sensing data to characterize post fire severity at tree level in a mixed conifer forest following the cascade and east zone megafires of 2007 in central idaho usa we used remote sensing metrics derived from airborne laser scanning als data 2008 and high resolution quickbird qb multispectral satellite imagery 2007 2009 for calibrating and validating predictive models with field data 2008 we compared fire effects on trees in open canopies within recent fuel treatments to similar trees in closed canopies on adjacent untreated sites we observed more trees with charred crowns in high fire severity sites mostly untreated whereas we observed more trees with live crowns in low fire severity sites independent of the treatment individual trees were more accurately detected from als data in treated sites with open canopies than untreated sites with closed canopies for detected trees the response variables predicted from als and qb metrics were total height ht crown base height cbh total basal area bat live basal area bal scorched basal area bas charred basal area bac and crown severity cs none of the selected qb metrics were strongly correlated with the selected als metrics which justified combining both data types into the predictive models random forest regression models combining als qb metrics or using als metrics alone performed similarly but clearly better than models using only qb metrics this study shows the superiority of als data to high resolution multispectral qb imagery for mapping fire severity at tree level managers with limited resources to plan for restoration of fire affected forests are advised to prioritize spending for data collection on als data and a modest number of field inventory plots rather than qb or other broadband satellite imagery keywords crown fire severity fire effects fuel treatment effectiveness individual tree attributes random forest 1 introduction wildfires suppression in the western u s costs billions of dollars annually and places firefighters and the public at risk nifc 2019 many advocate an increase in fuel treatment implementation to alter fire behavior and effects and promote successful fire suppression at a lower cost e g cohen 2000 lentile et al 2006 ellison et al 2015 hudak et al 2011a swetnam et al 2015 over the last 20 years efforts to alter hazardous fuels have been ongoing with emphasis on treating areas where people and their property reside often referred to as the wildland urban interface wui it is assumed that these fuel treatments will alter fire behavior and severity to allow for fire suppression opportunities and produce post fire outcomes that are socially acceptable fuel treatments are designed to reduce hazardous fuels focus on four forest structural and compositional characteristics that include altering surface fuels ladder fuels crown fuels and shifting species composition agee and carl 2005 but in some cases are not sociable acceptable in all conditions molina terrén et al 2016 surface fuels typically are treated either through prescribed fire grapple piling or mastication thinning tree crowns and thinning from below are applied to separate crowns and remove ladder fuels fire resistant species are often favored over non fire resistant species graham et al 2004 hurteau and north 2010 these treatments are designed to reduce fire behavior and mitigate fire severity in case a wildfire occurs however there are mixed results indicating as to whether fuel treatments alter fire effects when a wildfire does burn through these treatments hudak et al 2011a another reason is that research on fuel treatment effectiveness is still needed because the frequency that a wildfire will test a fuel treatment is low as a percentage of the fuel treatments implemented most large wildfires have a post fire assessment to inform managers on where and how much the fire affected the soils and vegetation fire severity can be either defined to the loss or decomposition of organic matter aboveground and belowground keeley 2009 as the first order fire effects such as how much of the duff logs and other dense organic matter on the soil surface is consumed ice et al 2004 for trees as suggested by hudak et al 2007 sites may be classified as low severity when live green crowns are predominate as moderate severity when scorched brown crowns are predominant and as high severity when charred black crowns predominate the spatial distribution of fire severity and consequently the identification of the tree crown severity class live scorched or charred are key factors that may be used to quantify the impact of fires and vegetation response and consequently guide post fire management responses montealegre et al 2014 knowledge about the crown severity of each tree helps to predict future site conditions given that mapped tree crowns capture the spatial distribution of trees tree crown severity maps could be used to develop more precise site specific forest and fire management plans kim et al 2009 remote sensing tools have potential to assess post fire impacts on vegetation structure and physiology which is important to understand the fire severity effects on post fire ecosystem processes in small areas i e plots and pixels or at the tree level using high resolution data kokaly et al 2007 the use of remote sensing data to understand fire effects over large areas has been well studied at the landscape level using moderate resolution e g landsat satellite imagery e g miller and yool 2002 miller and thode 2007 hudak et al 2007 french et al 2008 verbyla and lord 2008 veraverbeke et al 2011 prior studies typically involved identification of unique spectral signatures associated with burn areas holden et al 2010 or snags pasher and king 2009 or the use of combined spectral and texture features to identify forest gaps barton et al 2017 although satellite remote sensing has been shown to be an essential technology for studying post fire consequences the traditional and older generation sensors such as landsat and spot have a number of limitations with regard to spectral spatial and temporal resolution steininger 2000 these limitations might be overcome using a newer generation of sensors with higher spatial resolution such as quickbird qb to more accurately resolve smaller landscape features including trees spectral vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 and red green index rgi coops et al 2006 can be used to differentiate live trees from dead trees high resolution imagery also has been used to detect burn severity from wildfire holden et al 2010 holden et al 2012 recognition of fire affected tree attributes such as percent of live scorched or charred crown may facilitate the selection of which trees to salvage or to leave as potential seed sources lentile et al 2006 in addition wildlife habitat relationships can be mapped validated and improved when habitat components such as live scorched and charred crown trees are spatially mapped which is a valuable step for management and conservation applications vogeler et al 2016 the combined use of high resolution passive optical multispectral imagery with active sensors could provide more accurate post fire information than either sensor type alone fire severity estimations from active sensors are more sensitive to disturbance effects on forest structure than passive satellite sensors mccarley et al 2017 examples of active sensors include radio detection and ranging radar and light detection and ranging lidar tanase et al 2010 2011 kane et al 2013 airborne lidar also known as airborne laser scanning als is an example of an active remote sensing technology capable of simultaneously characterizing terrain and vegetation structure across large spatial extents hudak et al 2009 als has increased the accuracy and efficiency of large scale forest inventories and wildlife habitat studies næsset 2002 maltamo et al 2006 martinuzzi et al 2009 als data have been used in fire studies to estimate fuel parameters to use as input into fire behavior models such as crown bulk density or height to live crown andersen et al 2005 agca et al 2011 skowronski et al 2011 as well as to assess changes in forest structure wulder et al 2009 mccarley et al 2017 although als data are limited in spatial and temporal coverage and come at a relatively high cost to project managers vogeler et al 2016 their rich 3 d information of forest structure make them relevant for a variety of natural resource management applications hudak et al 2009 numerous studies have explored combining multiple remote sensing datasets and corresponding field data for modeling forest attributes e g hudak et al 2006 dalponte 2018 goetz et al 2010 bright et al 2012 bright et al 2014 however few studies have tested this combination in the post fire environment and at the individual tree level wulder et al 2009 swetnam et al 2015 casas et al 2016 between treated and untreated stands the objective of this study was to characterize post fire total crown height ht crown base height cbh total basal area bat live basal area bal scorched basal area bas charred basal area bac and crown severity cs classes at tree level in a mixed conifer forest from one year post fire als and either immediate one year or two year post fire high resolution multispectral qb images 2 methods 2 1 study area the study focuses on secesh meadows and warm lake two forested communities in the wildland urban interface wui of central idaho that had been protected with wui and firewise fuel treatments prior to the cascade and east zone megafires of 2007 graham et al 2009 hudak et al 2011a b the wui treatments were implemented from 2000 to 2006 on national forest lands on the outskirts of both communities fig 1 whereas firewise treatments not shown were implemented on the private lands pile and burn fuel treatments were implemented at secesh meadows while at warm lake there was a mix of pile and burn mastication and underburn treatments hudak et al 2011a 2 2 field data collection trees n 880 were tallied in august 2008 using 20 paired plots designed to assess effectiveness of mechanical fuel treatments for mitigating severe wildfire effects hudak et al 2011a the treated plot of each pair was randomly located inside the treatment unit whereas the untreated plot was situated in a random location with a similar slope and aspect just outside the treatment unit fig 1 thirteen paired plots i e n 26 were situated in the secesh meadows study area while seven paired plots i e n 14 were situated in the warm lake study area each plot was 0 04 ha in area 11 3 m radius all trees 12 cm were tallied for diameter at breast height dbh species and live dead status from dbh total basal area was calculated bat on a subsample of trees comprised of the largest and smallest tree of each species in each plot quadrant the ht and cbh was measured while percentages of live scorched and charred tree crown were visually estimated and recorded with 5 precision under the constraint that they sum to 100 hudak et al 2011a 2 3 tree attribute imputation we applied k nearest neighbor k nn imputation a nonparametric modeling technique to infer missing values of the subsampled tree attributes ht cbh and percentages of live scorched and charred crowns using the yaimpute package crookston and finley 2008 in the r statistical software r core team 2019 for this study we used random forest based k nn rf k nn imputation to infer the missing tree attributes from predictor variables known for all trees tallied in the field plots tree dbh species study area secesh meadows or warm lake site condition treated or untreated and site fire severity as called on the ground for the site low moderate or high the number of neighbors was set to one k 1 to maintain the original variance in the data hudak et al 2008 2 4 quickbird imagery acquisition and pre processing quickbird images were acquired immediately after the wildfire on 22 october secesh meadows and 27 october warm lake 2007 and again on 18 august 2008 warm lake and on 16 july 2009 secesh meadows the 2007 images capturing immediate fire effects and collected only 5 days apart were considered for the main analysis of this study whereas the later images also considered are detailed in the supplementary material the four 2 4 m multispectral bands were fused with the 0 6 m panchromatic band into a 4 band product of 0 6 m resolution delivered by the vendor digitalglobe longmont co several vegetation indices with potential sensitivity to fire effects were calculated from the 0 6 m fused 4 band qb imagery table 1 2 5 airborne laser scanning acquisition and pre processing airborne laser scanning als data were collected over the two study areas secesh meadows and warm lake one year after the wildfire on 1 3 september 2008 table 2 the als vendor watershed sciences now quantum spatial inc portland or post processed and delivered the data as las files returns were classified using the lasground function in lastools isenburg 2018 and a 1 m resolution digital terrain model dtm was interpolated from the ground returns using the gridsurfacecreate function in fusion software mcgaughey 2018 the point clouds were height normalized by subtracting the elevation of the dtm at each point and the canopy height model chm was created from the normalized heights at 0 5 m resolution 2 6 individual tree detection individual tree detection and crown metrics computation were performed using the rlidar package silva et al 2015 2016 in r r core team 2019 in four steps first the 0 5 m chm was smoothed by a 3 3 mean filter to remove spurious local maxima caused by tree branches second individual trees were detected from the smoothed chm using a local maxima algorithm implemented in the findtreeschm function the findtreeschm searched for treetops in the chm via a moving window with a fixed treetop window size tws a tws of 5 5 was found to be most effective for individual tree detection according to preliminary tests third each individual tree crown was delineated based on voronoi tessellation aurenhammer 1991 implemented in the forestcas function the crown area carea m2 was defined from the circle calculated as πr2 with the radius r being half the diameter of the delineated tree crown 2 7 qb and als derived crown metrics the mean and standard deviation of each qb band and spectral index table 1 table s1 at crown level were calculated as candidate variables for the predictive models for crown metrics derived from als data all returns of the normalized heights within simplified crown polygons were extracted and crown height metrics e g maximum height mean height etc table 3 were computed using the crownmetrics function in rlidar silva et al 2015 2016 for each tree detected based on vertical profiles of the heights within the crown polygon the normalmixem function from the mixtools package benaglia et al 2009 in r was fitted to compute crown base height cbh m from lidar crown volume cv m3 and crown surface area csa m2 were calculated as the volume and surface area of 3d convex hulls derived from all als returns within the crown segments table 3 also intensity metrics were calculated as candidate variables for predictive modeling as for the effects of the incidence angle on the intensity several studies have shown that for small angles up to 15 this effect can be neglected coren and sterzai 2006 kukko et al 2008 the variables described above were then used to predict the post fire tree attributes measured in the field i e ht and cbh or calculated from the field data i e by multiplying bat by the live scorched and charred crown percentages to calculate weighted estimates of bal bas bac also the live scorched and charred percentages were used to classify individual tree crown severity into classes table 4 2 8 predictive modeling and assessment tree stems were not mapped in the field plots but were sorted beginning north of plot center and proceeding clockwise therefore tree lists tallied in the field or from tree level als metrics were matched based on their total tree height in a process similar to imputation first both the field and als individual tree lists for each plot were sorted by total tree height and combined into a single table second if the number of als detected trees was higher than in the field extra trees were randomly pulled from the als detected tree list within the same plot or if the number of als detected trees was lower than in the field trees were randomly added from the als detected tree list within the same plot thus the same number of als derived crown attributes were obtained as trees tallied in the field this ensured that there were no missing values in the dataset to interfere with the subsequent modeling and that the tree tally reflected actual tree density on the ground as this greatly influences fire behavior and severity 2 8 1 variable selection and regression modeling model improvement ratio mir e g evans and cushman 2009 evans et al 2010 evans 2018 silva et al 2017 was applied to identify the most important als and qb metrics for predicting ht cbh bat bal bas and bac to create parsimonious models we reserved only the metrics that exhibited mirs 0 35 for modeling we split the data into training 75 n 660 and validation 25 n 220 datasets and the attributes of interest ht cbh bat bal bas bac and cs classes 1 4 were predicted at the tree level using the training dataset and again the random forest package breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2015 in r as in the predictor variable selection procedure ntree was set to 1000 and mtry was set to 2 for random forest regression the accuracy of estimates for each model was evaluated in terms of adj r2 absolute and relative root mean square error rmse and bias based on the linear relationship between predicted and observed values 1 r m s e m m 2 i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 n 2 b i a s m m 2 1 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i where n is the number of observations y i is the observed value for tree properties i and y ˆ i is the predicted value for tree properties i moreover relative rmse and bias were calculated by dividing the absolute values eqs 1 and 2 by the mean of the observed values the adj r2 absolute and relative rmse and bias statistics were computed based on the linear relationship between predicted and observed variables using the validation dataset withheld from training we used the two sided wilcoxon mann whitney rank sum w hollander and wolfe 1973 bauer 1972 in r to assess if the mean of predicted and the observed crown attributes i e ht cbh bat bal bas and bac differed at a significance level of 5 2 8 2 classification modeling and assessment we ran random forest in classification mode to predict the categorical response variable of cs class to assess the accuracy and precision of the cs classification models cohen s kappa coefficient and accuracy sensitivity and specificity values were calculated cohen s kappa coefficient table 5 classifies the model according to the level of agreement and the percentage of data that are reliable classification accuracy shows how often the classifier is correct by equation tp tn total where tp is true positive cases in which yes was predicted and it was true and tn is true negative cases in which no was predicted and it was true sensitivity is defined as the proportion of positive results out of the number of samples which were actually positive specificity is defined as the proportion of negative results out of the number of samples which were actually negative 3 results 3 1 evaluation of fuel treatment effectiveness field measurements affirmed that the treated sites had fewer trees per hectare number than the untreated sites number on sites classified as high severity untreated plots were dominated by charred trees both in total number and percent of trees while treated plots had similar abundance in trees with scorched crowns and charred crowns although the moderate severity class in treated stands were dominated by trees with scorched needles there were a few trees of mixed crown severity in contrast very few trees had a mixed crown severity in the untreated stands the low severity class in untreated stands was dominated by live trees versus in treated stands where there tended to be a diversity of crown damage fig 2 3 2 imputation of tree attributes individual tree ht was imputed with comparable precision between treated and untreated sites although accuracy was higher at treated sites table 6 while cbh was imputed with clearly higher precision and accuracy at treated sites than untreated sites table 6 percent live and charred crowns were more precisely and accurately imputed at untreated sites than treated sites but in general percent scorched crown was imputed with less precision but more accuracy whether or not the site was treated table 6 3 3 individual tree detection using als data individual tree detection performed highly better in treated plots with open canopy structure than untreated plots with typically closed canopies even though the untreated plots had higher tree density than treated plots when considering two untreated plots as outliers the comparison of observed and detected tree density resulted in an increased r2 of 0 41 fig 3 3 4 crown metrics and variable selection a total of 15 of the 30 candidate als metrics hmax hmean hsd hkur hqr hrange h25th imean isd iqr i25th cdens cl cbh cratio and 6 of the 24 candidate qb metrics ndvimean ndvisd evimean baimean rgimean redmean were not highly correlated i e r 0 9 with at least one other metric within each sensor type group and therefore were considered further in the mir analyses when comparing als to qb metrics the correlations were weak for instance ndvimean produced weak and positive correlations with the intensity metrics from als as did i25th isd imean and iqr fig 4 3 5 random forest modeling and assessment 3 5 1 regression model random forest models explained 12 66 of variation in predicting ht based on the full dataset table 8 however the models based on the training dataset 75 performed differently between treated and untreated plots figs 5 7 when assessed with the withheld data 25 the hmax and hmean metrics were important predictors of ht in the als and als qb models six indices baimean evimean ndvimean ndvisd redmean rgimean were important predictors in the qb model table 7 hmax exhibited the highest mir in ht models using als metrics or als qb metrics while the red band exhibited the highest mir in the ht model using only qb metrics table 7 als intensity metrics were not important predictors of ht in als or als qb models qb metrics were not important as explanatory variables of ht in als qb models table 8 the accuracy of cbh prediction when higher at the open canopy treated plots than at the closed canopy untreated plots figs 5 7 with explained variation in cbh ranging from 5 to 25 table 8 als derived height and intensity metrics were important in predicting cbh tables 7 and 8 while ndvimean and evimean were also important predictors of cbh in the qb model when als and qb derived metrics were combined the percent variance explained in cbh models increased from 5 to 24 but none of qb derived metrics were retained in the model table 7 and 8 the most important predictor metrics to explain the variation in bat from als and als qb models were height metrics such as hmax and hmean tables 7 and 8 baimean and red were the most important predictors of bat in the qb model but the als and als qb models performed better in untreated plots whereas the qb model performed better in treated plots figs 5 7 random forest models predicting bal bas and bac from qb metrics alone were poor and qb metrics did little to improve als qb models the selected predictors were similar for all the ba models weighted by crown color classes where in general als intensity metrics were more important than qb metrics table 7 bas is predicted more poorly than bal or bac table 8 bal and bac models performed better in untreated plots than treated plots table 8 height and intensity metrics consistently exhibited high mirs in all models als qb and als qb models and all study plots treated and untreated in the qb models bai evi ndvi and red were better predictors of crown severity expressed in terms of weighted basal area bal bas and bac or as a class cs 1 4 table 7 however all models fitted to explain bal bas and bac had a rmse higher than 100 the qb metrics did not improve the predictive models when included with als metrics table 8 we developed additional random forest models for the two study areas to further investigate the potential of qb imagery collected either one or two years post fire 2008 and 2009 at warm lake and secesh meadows respectively see supplementary material tables s2 and s4 in the case of warm lake the 2008 qb image was a better temporal match to the 2008 als and field data collection thus providing a fairer comparison between the two sensor types table s2 on the other hand for secesh meadows 2009 qb model accuracies were relatively poorer which matched expectations given the one year difference with the als and field measures collected in 2008 one year post fire table s4 3 5 2 crown severity cs classification model moderate als and als qb to weak qb classification accuracies were observed to model cs classes 1 to 4 based on the full dataset as expected noticeably higher accuracies were observed when using qb from 2008 the same year that the field and als data were collected table s3 similarly to using qb from 2007 table 9 we observed weaker classification accuracy when using qb from 2009 table s5 in general classification model accuracies were better in untreated than treated areas table 9 finally cs 4 and cs 3 produced higher sensitivity values while cs 1 and cs 2 produced the higher specificity values within the random forest classification models fig 8 4 discussion post fire assessment is an essential activity for developing a management plan remote sensing adds value to field assessments as a way to expand information on damage level and its distribution over larger burned areas than can be practically surveyed in the field however most prior studies are not precisely characterizing fire effects because they only consider the three broad post fire severity classes of low moderate or high fire severity at the plot or stand level at a moderate spatial resolution of 30 m e g hudak et al 2011b our study presents a novel approach for mapping post fire charred scorched and live crowns at the tree level and may be the first to test both als and qb imagery at the tree level spatial heterogeneity in fire severities of variable patch size mixed with unburned canopies are characteristic of large wildfires christensen 1993 turner et al 1994 broncano and retana 2004 the vast majority of which are much smaller than the east zone and cascade complex mega fires that impacted our local study areas hudak et al 2011a the methodology presented herein based on als and qb data for individual tree detection crown structure and crown fire severity characterization in post fire sites provides an alternative to the traditional area based approach using moderate resolution landsat satellite data more resolute predictions of crown attributes e g basal area height crown fire severity can be aggregated into larger grid cells across the landscape for use in habitat models casas et al 2016 whereas area based predictions if rescaled may bias the habitat models garabedian et al 2014 moreover burned severity patches are not homogeneously comprised of only low moderate or high burn severity but represent a mixture individual tree approach may also minimize aggregation errors and allow land managers to more accurately identify severely burned areas montealegre et al 2014 however as fire severity increases canopy fragmentation may occur increasing the number of tree clumps montealegre et al 2014 and making tree detection more difficult also noise may be introduced into the tree detection by broken or partially consumed snags casas et al 2016 immediately following high severity burns overstory canopy is largely removed but considerable overstory canopy remains after moderate or low severity burns lentile et al 2006 by design pre fire fuel treatments dramatically reduce the tree density creating open canopy conditions from what was previously closed canopy not surprisingly we found better detection of individual trees in treated sites due to low canopy cover in closed canopy conditions without a prior pre fire treatment individual tree detection was more difficult because of overlapping tree crowns of variable sizes both live and dead wing et al 2015 previous studies also found higher tree detection accuracy in open canopy conditions casas et al 2016 falkowski et al 2008 silva et al 2016 in two untreated plots that were the strongest outliers i e highest numbers of trees detected seen in close proximity in fig 3a about three times as many trees were found from the als data as were tallied in the field high fire severity occurred at these plots resulting in charred tree tops devoid of needles that offered very little surface area from which to reflect returns we speculate that false detections may have been caused by larger branches than would be detected in an unburned dense closed canopy stand that still retained its needles especially considering the lidar point density of 5 points m 2 was quite sparse by current standards additionally leaning trees i e trees bent at an angle 45 due to snow or other agents probably contributed to false detections wing et al 2015 the main advantage of using r and mir statistics for selecting the most important als and qb metrics was to achieve parsimonious models silva et al 2017 2017b in this way highly correlated metrics were removed and the most important metrics were clearly identified herein the chosen als height related metrics hmax hmean hsd hrange and h25th were informative for characterizing forest structure attributes such as ht cbh and ba a notable result was that the chosen als intensity metrics despite not having been normalized were more informative for crown severity characterization see table 7 than the qb metrics these intensity metrics include imean isd iqr and i25th the contribution of als intensity metrics to describe forest structure and distinguish fire severity classes found in this study agrees with other studies e g kim et al 2009 lim et al 2003 casas et al 2016 random forest regression and classification models produced better predictions of ht cbh batl bal bas bac and cs classes on untreated sites than treated sites also in treated sites the residual trees were more broadly and evenly spaced whereas broken or partially consumed snags were common in untreated sites casas et al 2016 it is important to note that our study area had both treated and untreated sites that captured a broader fire severity gradient than would have either treatment condition alone we observed differences in accuracy between als and qb models both in treated and untreated areas for instance the prediction of ht and cbh relied primarily on height related metrics mainly the hmax and hmean respectively other studies have attempted to predict cbh scott and reinhardt 2001 because it is one of the most important forest structure attributes used in crown fire behavior models rothermel and rinehart 1983 and it is associated with tree fire severity because tree crown characteristics varied so dramatically due to their fire severity condition cbh predicted in our study had a larger rmse than previous studies for instance vauhkonen 2010 using als data estimated cbh with a rmse varying between 1 54 3 88 m while jung et al 2011 had a lower rmse of 1 87 in both studies the study areas were unburned forests whereas our case study area had both treatment and wildfire effects contributing to the variation other studies have shown that bat as well as live ba and dead ba bright et al 2013 2014 may be reasonably predicted from height related metrics hudak et al 2006 estimated bat of an actively managed mixed forest in idaho usa using als and advanced land imager ali multispectral satellite data they also explained more variance ranging from r2 0 71 to r2 0 89 using als data alone or in combination with ali spectral indices than using ali metrics alone in this study vegetation index derived from qb derived suite of metrics e g ndvimean baimean and redmean produced the highest mir for predicting basal area weighted by crown severity live scorched and charred and the cs classes ndvi is a useful indicator of photosynthetic capacity willis 2015 but also is affected by understory and soil properties that contribute to background reflectance escuin et al 2008 which varies greatly between burn severity classes a reasonable and significant correlation between ndvi and fire severity was found by diaz delgado et al 2003 on the other hand oliveras et al 2009 and hammill and bradstock 2006 found low correspondence between ndvi and percentage of charred or live canopies while height related metrics from als may be most useful for predicting and mapping forest structural attributes e g ht cbh and bat increased availability of high resolution imagery and or als intensity metrics are improving post fire cs classification kim et al 2009 intensity and spectral information about post fire disturbance were the most important predictors for all the response variables related to crown condition live scorched and charred in this study see table 7 we can highlight all selected intensity metrics and the qb indices derived from the red and nir bands ndvi evi bai and red which had relatively higher importance in the predicted models als intensity metrics alone were selected to predict bal and bac and cs classes tables 7 9 this may be attributable to higher near infrared return intensity reflected from green rather than non photosynthetic vegetation components moreover als intensity can be used to estimate and distinguish between live and dead biomass kim et al 2009 which our results support fig s1 when both als and qb metrics were combined ndvimean was the most important explanatory variable to predict bal the same was not observed for predicting bac where none of the qb derived indices was important using only als data hmax was the most important explanatory variable for both bal and bac as well as bat a second explanatory variable for predicting bal and bac according to mir was iqr and i25th respectively higher als intensities are associated with green foliage while lower als intensities are associated with black vegetation fig s1 kim et al 2009 used als data to distinguish between live and dead standing tree biomass in grand canyon national park usa and bright et al 2013 considered als intensity metrics to predict both live and dead ba in western coniferous forests impacted by bark beetles these studies associated low intensity returns with dead biomass finding that the low intensity als returns were sensitive to the proportion of echoes from non photosynthetic woody material including dead trees the accuracy of bas models was improved 12 when als and qb metrics were combined table 8 the brown color of dead or dying needles may be associated with pests and diseases as well as needles scorched by fire coops et al 2006 used qb imagery to detect red attack damage due to mountain pine beetle infestation and they found rgi to be a good index to discriminate red attack crowns from non attack unlike coops et al 2006 among the qb metrics in our study bai ndvi and red were selected as having higher importance than rgi to predict bas more generally however als metrics were more important than qb metrics as explanatory variables to predict bas part of the issue is that as the post fire scene changes so will its reflectance properties scorched needles falling from the trees in the days weeks and months following a fire would explain our generally poorer ability to predict bas compared to bal and bac table 8 and crown severity class 3 compared to crown severity classes 1 2 or 4 table 9 random forest models for classifying cs produced satisfactory accuracy als intensity metrics were important to predict cs class in the absence of qb metrics the 2 year post fire qb at secesh meadows diminished the utility of qb data for postfire tree crown assessment tables s3 s4 relative to the 1 year post fire qb at warm lake tables s1 s2 the post fire scene changes quickly during the first post fire year and then the rate of change as site recovery slows over time lewis et al 2017 among the als intensity metrics iqr hrange and i25th where the most important to predict bal bas bac respectively complex associations between wildfire effects and fuel conditions can cause for instance mixed live and charred crowns while scorched crowns necessarily fall within the gradient from unburned or low to high severity conditions jain and graham 2007 few studies have attempted to map crown severity class at fine scales in a post fire forest using field or remote sensing e g jain and graham 2007 and most existing studies using either als or qb are focused on snag detection e g jain and graham 2007 casas et al 2016 vogeler et al 2016 instead of crown condition fuel treatments produced a diverse set of tree severity outcomes compared to the untreated stands it is not surprising that the treated sites tended to have more scorched trees crowns compared to the untreated sites fig 2 however there were fewer fully consumed crowns charred crowns in the treated sites approximately 60 compared to the untreated stands that contained close to 100 of some trees totally charred thus the treatments did diminish the amount of crown fire graham et al 2009 noted that in the warm lake wildfire complex there were multiple head fires that burned into and around the treated sites 5 conclusion in this study we used tree measurements collected in 40 field plots to characterize fire effects on individual tree crowns and then summarized at the plot level our study shows the greater utility of als data compared to high resolution qb imagery for estimating post fire scorched and charred tree crowns basal area tree height and crown base height in a mixed conifer forest from one year post fire als and either immediate one year or two year post fire multispectral qb images of high resolution als derived models performed better than qb imagery for characterizing both tree structure attributes and crown severity but the combination of als and qb derived metrics slightly improved the accuracy of only a few models we hope that the promising results for characterizing post fire crown attributes in this study will stimulate further research and applications worldwide future research and development could attempt to automate and apply such models across broader spatial extents to generate stem maps across burned landscapes to greatly assist forest managers in the preparation of conservation and

24966,energy and emergy methods were applied to assess two groups of agricultural farms in the kujawsko pomorskie province north central poland the first group consisted of 11 farms operating in 2002 2003 i e before the accession of poland to the european union eu occurred in 2004 the second group consisted of 8 farms operating in 2009 2012 i e after the accession of poland to the eu the objective of the study was to assess the effect of accession to the eu on agriculture in terms of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability all the investigated farms used conventional production methods for crop and livestock farming the size of farms ranged from 8 to about 98 ha the agricultural activities were conducted in agricultural holdings with similar physiographic soil and climatic conditions despite similar values of the total energy input to agricultural production farms after accession to the eu showed higher yields and energy efficiency while significant differences were found between energy based indicators energy efficiency and production output calculated before and after accession to eu the emergy based indicators did not show significant differences the access to eu subsidies and new regulations determined a massive replacement of agricultural machinery with more modern and efficient ones while improving the use of chemical inputs future studies might focus on assessing the environmental performance and sustainability of polish agriculture taking into account a larger set of farms located in different regions keywords agriculture polish farms energy analysis energy efficiency emergy analysis 1 introduction the agricultural sector strives mainly to increase crop yields and improve the economic efficiency of individual and regional farming systems rydberg and haden 2006 agriculture is an important sector of the economy at both regional and national level the economic sustainability of farms and the entire agricultural sector is usually considered in terms of production costs and the ability to maintain economic income under changing environmental social and economic conditions from biophysical and ecological perspectives agriculture is based on complex ecological conditions including climate fertilization soil type the use of pesticides and many others the development of agricultural technology entails increasing number of farming techniques used including numerous procedures performed with the use of mechanical equipment wang et al 2014 this creates a risk of further increases in energy consumption and a growing dependence of the agricultural sector on non renewable energy sources fossil fuels it may also accelerate climate change through the emission of co2 and other greenhouse gases camargo et al 2013 according to dalgaard et al 2001 the environmental sustainability of agriculture implies the efficient use of non renewable resources and the progressive substitution of non renewable with renewable resources the efficient use of resources is one of the major benefits of eco efficient and sustainable production especially in agriculture meul et al 2007 the problems of agriculture and rural development in poland were among the most important subjects of the negotiations preceding poland s accession to the european union eu according to godlewska 2002 integration into eu was the most important challenge for polish society and its economy at the turn of the 21 st century the most important benefits in the agricultural sector which poland expected from eu accession included market expansion easier importation of new technologies and improved economic conditions of agricultural production through eu support for polish farmers before poland s accession to the eu the problems faced by polish rural areas were complex they primarily consisted in the fragmented structure of farmlands the quality of agricultural products being incompatible with customers expectations the inadequate organization of the agricultural market the low level of investments in farms and farmers low income and insufficient expertise in production technology marketing and management frenkel 1997 after eu accession participation in a broad exchange of products as well as new ideas in management technology and know how has had a strong impact on the functioning of individual farms and the entire agricultural sector the number of market oriented large farms has started to grow while small family and traditional farms are decreasing in number this is due to the market economy where many decisions taken at the farm level are cost driven and economies of scale mean that larger farms have more available funds to select more efficient production technologies ministry of agriculture and rural development 2012 the recognition of economic aspects needs to be coupled with several aspects dealing with the environmental sustainability of agricultural systems among which the use of energy from renewable sources and the dependence on imported resources kocjančič et al 2018 the assessment of agricultural systems requires the use of methods capable of evaluating their overall environmental performance and sustainability brown et al 2012 among several methods the energy method is capable of identifying raw materials means of production and energy flows supporting the functioning of agroecosystems determining the energy equivalents for all these flows and the total energy support to the investigated systems pimentel et al 1973 the emergy method odum 1996 can help in describing agricultural systems taking into account both natural and economic flows invested in generating agricultural products it is an evaluation method capable of assessing natural human manufactured and economic inputs to a system in terms of work of nature invested for their generation the objective of this study was to assess the effect of poland accession to the eu on agriculture in terms of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability through the parallel use of the energy and emergy methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area a number of 19 farms were investigated in this study they were located in five communes in the kujawsko pomorskie province in the central northern part of poland fig 1 two sets of farms were identified the first one consisted of 11 farms for which the study covered the period before the poland s accession to the european union 2002 2003 the second set of farms was investigated in the period after accession 2009 2012 and included 8 farms an identification number was assigned to each farm for the group of farms investigated before 2004 each farm was identified by a number and the letter b whereas for the farms researched after 2004 the letter a was added to the identification number all the investigated farms used conventional agricultural production methods with a mixed crop and animal profile and meat as the main animal product sold the total area and land use of these farms are presented in tables 1 and 2 in the group of farms investigated before eu accession the smallest farm had a total area of 8 00 ha while the largest farm covered an area of 81 0 ha all the farms had arable lands ranging from 4 00 ha for farm b 1 to 81 0 ha for farm b 11 as well as meadows and pastures with an area ranging from 0 00 to 16 5 ha in addition farms b 2 b 4 b 5 b 7 b 8 b 9 had orchards and gardens only one farm b 7 exploited its own forest and farms b 2 b 3 b 6 b 9 had wastelands with areas of around 1 50 ha cereals both winter and spring crops were grown at all farms including winter triticale root vegetables were represented by sugar beets and fodder beets other arable crops included maize and potatoes and oil plants by winter rape the farms in the group a investigated after eu accession were also highly diverse in their total areas from 14 3 ha to 98 1 ha their land use structure was dominated by arable lands from 74 4 98 6 table 2 moreover five farms a 1 a 4 a 5 a 6 a 8 had meadows and pastures and only one farm a 3 had orchards and gardens farms a 1 and a 5 had wastelands with an area of 0 350 ha and 0 500 table 2 cereals were cultivated on all farms including both winter and spring crops in addition root crops sugar beet fodder beet as well as corn and potatoes and oilseeds rapeseed rape were grown on each farm the researched group of farms is homogeneous in terms of soil conditions with the dominance of sands and loamy sands one farm located in the valley of the notec river has peat soil alluvial muck soil on peat subsoil and muck peat soil in addition typical brown soils occur in some farms the farms are mainly characterized by the presence of loamy sand but also sand peat and black earth built of sandy loam 2 2 data collection face to face interview was the main method used to obtain information about the farms the information related to the variables and characteristics of each farm was recorded through standardized forms the following characteristics of the farms were asked to farmers age and education of the farmer method of management size and specializations of farm production geographical location the characteristics of the farms were asked once but constant contact was maintained with owners by collecting information about natural and economic conditions the production process agricultural techniques the purchasing and selling of products mass and energy inputs supporting farming activities since irrigation is not applied in polish agriculture water input was not accounted for in this study as it was mentioned above all the investigated farms used conventional agricultural production methods with mixed profiles and animal production 2 3 energy analysis the classic ecological interpretation of agricultural production systems steinborn and svirezhev 2000 defined agroecosystems as a converter of the input flow i e artificial anthropogenic energy into the output flow i e biomass of agricultural products pimentel et al 1973 in this context energy analysis is a method capable of identifying raw materials means of production and energy flows essential for the functioning of agroecosystems and determining the energy equivalents for all these flows according to hülsbergen et al 2001 and pervanchon et al 2002 on the farm level energy consumption can be assessed in a direct and indirect way direct energy expressed in gj ha 1 year 1 includes the input of fuels and electricity directly used in the investigated farm the consumption of fuels and electricity implies the use of non renewable sources and plays an important role in determining the dependence of the farm on this type of energy sources indirect energy also expressed in gj ha 1 year 1 is the sum of energy indirectly used elsewhere for the production of seeds mineral fertilizers farmyard manure pesticides concentrates forages and machines seed and natural fertilizers belong to renewable energy sources while mineral fertilizers and plant protection chemicals are non renewable sources hülsbergen et al 2001 fadavi et al 2011 baheshti et al 2010 fan et al 2018 to calculate the energy value of the input flows energy intensity factors energy equivalent per unit of input were used the energy equivalent factors for the different inputs were taken from the scientific literature hülsbergen et al 2001 doering and mcdowell 1980 van der werf et al 2005 dalgaard et al 2001 among others output products such as total annual milk production amount of produced meat and total amount of crop yields were considered in this study crop yields were divided into crop residues crop for own purposes fodder and crop for market sale for each type of output the energy value was calculated by multiplying the mass amount by the respective energy content in addition the energy efficiency energy output energy input was calculated by the ratio of outputs expressed in energy units to inputs also expressed into energy units in general better energy efficiency relates to using less energy to produce the same amount or more useful output meul et al 2007 patterson 1996 2 4 emergy analysis odum 1971 1994 1996 introduced the term energy hierarchy to indicate that in any system more low quality energy must be dissipated to generate a product that contains less energy but of higher quality dividing the energy previously directly and indirectly consumed in generating a product by the energy of the product gives the product s transformity odum 1996 when it is expressed in solar emergy joules sej per unit of product it is defined solar transformity in simpler terms the more energy transformations involved in producing a product the higher is the transformity according to brown and ulgiati 1999 2004 and brown et al 2016a 2016b transformities represent a measure of emergy efficiency and energy quality in that they account for the total amount of work of biosphere invested per unit of output as summarized by martinez alier 1987 emergy evaluations can complement the long history of energy analysis of agricultural systems emergy analysis can help in describing agricultural systems taking into account both natural and economic flows invested in generating agricultural products franzese et al 2009 rydberg and haden 2006 compared to other evaluation methods emergy analysis accounts for a fuller range of inputs supporting a process including natural resources human driven flows labor and services in the last decades emergy accounting has been widely used to assess agricultural systems cavalett and ortega 2009 ghaley and porter 2013 ghisellini et al 2014 giannetti et al 2011 jiang et al 2007 kocjančič et al 2018 la rosa et al 2008 martin et al 2006 zucaro et al 2013 buller et al 2015 among agricultural production systems grain production has been often investigated by using emergy accounting fan et al 2018 lefroy and rydberg 2003 liu and chen 2007 lu et al 2010 ortega et al 2005 ulgiati et al 1994 odum 1996 introduced the energy systems language to draw diagrams showing system components and interactions within a system in particular the diagrams show the main internal components the external forces driving the investigated system and interactions among them ortega and bacic 2015 in this study a diagram of the agricultural system was drawn following ulgiati et al 2011 the diagram of a typical farm after 2004 is presented in fig 2 the main difference in the diagram drawn for farms before 2004 would be the lack of eu subsidies and human labor from outside according to odum 1996 emergy analysis are usually performed through the main following steps a definition of system boundaries and drawing of an energy system diagram fig 2 b identification of the main components flows and interactions and calculation of flows in physical units c conversion of physical flows into solar emergy flows expressed in solar emergy joules sej d calculation of emergy indicators renewable energy flows supporting the agricultural production sunlight wind kinetic energy rain chemical potential rain geopotential and geothermal heat were estimated according to methods presented in odum 1996 ulgiati et al 1994 panzeri et al 2000 2002 bastianoni et al 2001 and brown et al 2016b the net topsoil loss was calculated by using the local average erosion rate taken from józefaciuk et al 2014 human labor was calculated as performed in bastianoni et al 2001 la rosa et al 2008 and brown et al 2012 agricultural machinery was accounted considering a lifetime of 15 years and amortized at 8 the transformity of the main materials of agricultural machinery iron and steel was obtained from odum et al 2000 the flows of n p and k in fertilizers were calculated by using coefficients from dovring and mcdowell 1980 transformities for fertilizers pesticides and industrial fodder were derived from odum et al 2000 and bastianoni et al 2001 the energy value of fuel used in the agricultural production process was assessed using coefficients taken from rydberg and jansén 2002 services including veterinary care transportation repair of equipment purchase of machines among others were calculated in pln and were converted into us dollars according to the average exchange rate of nbp the national bank of poland for the year of analysis eu subsidies were calculated in pln according to the rates of direct payments for the area and number of animals per farm provided on the website of the ministry of agriculture www agrimr gov pl the services flow was converted into emergy units by using the emergy to money ratio emr value of 4 74e 12 sej calculated from poland and taken from the nead database all the transformities used in this study were updated to the 1 20 e25 sej yr 1 biosphere emergy baseline calculated by brown et al 2016a b the following indicators brown and ulgiati 1997 brown 1998 ulgiati and brown 1998 were used to assess the environmental performance and sustainability of the investigated agricultural systems a renewability r calculated as the percentage of renewable emergy used by the system b environmental loading ratio elr defined as the ratio of the total emergy of external inputs received from the economy f plus local non renewable inputs n to the emergy of renewable inputs r i e elr f n r c the emergy yield ratio eyr defined as the ratio of the total emergy supporting the system u r n f to the emergy of inputs received from the economy f i e eyr u f r n f f d emergy sustainability indicator esi calculated as the ratio between the eyr and elr indicators i e esi eyr elr these indicators are interpreted as follows a a high percentage of renewable emergy r reflects a production system being more sustainable than a similar one using a higher proportion of non renewable emergy cavalett et al 2006 brown and ulgiati 2004 brown et al 2016b lefroy and rydberg 2003 b elr 2 suggests a relatively low environmental load elr 10 is indicative of a concentrated environmental load while in case of 3 elr 10 the environmental load can be considered moderate brown and ulgiati 2004 c processes with eyr 1 are based on non renewable and imported resources they only transform resources that are already available from previous processes eyr from 2 to 5 is typical of a primary materials production e g cement and steel while eyr 5 are typical of primary energy source production processes e g crude oil coal natural gas brown and ulgiati 2004 d esi 1 shows that the investigated process is not sustainable in the long run medium term sustainable process are usually characterized by 1 esi 5 while processes and products with long term sustainability have higher esi brown and ulgiati 2004 2 5 statistical comparisons we evaluated inputs outputs energy efficiency r f n and u and the emergy indices for both the b and a farm groups by using statistical analysis since we use set of farms characterized by a similar production structure but different ones before and after accession to eu the statistical comparison dedicated to two random groups of samples was applied zahr 1999 in particular the non parametric man whitney test was applied because we did not expect the normal distribution of the parameters man whitney test compares two groups of random samples based on ranks of measures this decreases the probability of ii type error acceptance of false h1 hypothesis zahr 1999 rosner 2011 all calculations were performed through the use of past program hammer et al 2001 3 results 3 1 energy analysis analyzing the energy inputs supporting individual farms it can be observed that the highest amount of all inputs resulted for farm b 10 in the former subset and for farm a 3 in the latter subset the total energy supporting farm b 10 was the highest value in the whole set of 19 farms furthermore it was found that the farms of group a were distinguished by a higher autarky compared to the farms of group b in group b internal inputs accounted for about 68 of the total energy input while in group a they accounted for about 70 of the total energy input the indirect energy use of the farming systems was similar before and after accession to eu and resulted about 83 of the total energy use table 3 shows the total direct and indirect energy inputs supporting the farms the average total energy input direct and indirect resulted higher for the farms of group b 42 86 year 1 ha 1 compared to the farms of group a 36 55 year 1 ha 1 on the other hand the average total value of the outputs was higher in the period after accession to the eu 59 25 year 1 ha 1 in fact the output input ratio was nearly three times higher for the farms of group a compared to the farms of group b table 3 3 2 emergy analysis table 4 shows the main emergy based indicators calculated for both the groups of investigated farms the average value per unit area of imported inputs resulted 4 90e 15 sej year 1 for the b group and 4 47e 15 sej year 1in the a group the total emergy used u was 8 44e 15 sej year 1 and 8 01e 15 sej year 1 in b and a groups respectively the differences did not result statistically significant the elr eyr and esi indicators also did not differ significantly before and after 2004 table 4 the elr value for farms investigated after eu accession resulted in 6 15 while for farms investigated before 2004 it was 6 53 the eyr value was 1 86 after accession and 1 81 in the pre accession time the average value of the esi in the group of farms studied after eu accession was 0 32 while for the farms surveyed before accession the mean esi value was 0 30 therefore significant differences in emergy based indicators calculated before and after accession to eu were not found 4 discussion energy analysis allows the assessment of direct and indirect energy use supporting agricultural processes alluvione et al 2011 the analysis of energy input and output confirmed a high degree of variability between the two groups of investigated farms the higher energy efficiency of agricultural production for farms investigated after 2004 showed that the eu accession improved the overall energy performance of agricultural systems in poland in fact the average output input ratio for the farms before 2004 was 0 59 ranging from 0 10 to 1 47 although the farms of group a achieved higher values ranging from 0 24 to 3 17 with a mean of 1 73 other energy studies on agricultural systems showed energy efficiency values ranging from 0 7 to 16 2 depending on crop rotation production methods and fertilization rates hülsbergen et al 2001 helander and delin 2004 ozkan et al 2004 moreover as found in other studies like fumagalli et al 2011 and meul et al 2007 this study showed that the indirect energy input was about 80 of the total energy use for both the investigated groups of farms confirming the importance of hidden indirect energy input flows in agricultural production while we found significant differences between energy based indicators energy efficiency and production output the emergy based indicators before and after accession to eu did not show significant differences this is mainly due to the fact that the emergy method accounts for a larger set of input resources among them it is noteworthy the money input in terms of eu subsidies supporting the group of farms investigated after 2004 these eu subsidies allowed for a massive replacement of agricultural machinery with more modern and efficient ones powered by a lower amount of fossil energy in addition accession to eu also improved the use of fertilizers and pesticides due to the adoption of new regulations the eyr values calculated for the farms before and after eu accession did not show significant differences and fall in the range of values calculated by bastianoni et al 2001 ortega et al 2002 and panzieri et al 2000 the calculated eyr values are low compared to organic agricultural systems which are more efficient in exploiting local resources by applying outside non renewable input resources ortega et al 2005 the obtained eyr values are also slightly higher than those reported in ghisellini et al 2014 and zucaro et al 2013 for agricultural systems in italy the elr of the farms before 2004 6 53 was slightly higher than after accession to the eu 6 15 indicating a moderate environmental impact the esi values did not show significant differences and fall in a range of values reported in several studies on agricultural production systems among which cavalett et al 2006 khalaf et al 2003 ulgiati et al 1994 and zucaro et al 2013 all calculated emergy based indicators are in line with those calculated by zucaro et al 2013 and ghisellini et al 2014 investigating the italian agriculture in the period 1985 2010 5 concluding remarks this study presents the results of the first energy and emergy assessment of polish agriculture at national level over the last 10 years the outcomes of the study showed that the accession to eu has determined an improvement of the agricultural production both in terms of energy efficiency and harvest the energy and emergy based methods highlighted that performance and sustainability indicators depend on several variables among which the type of investigated crop the agricultural practices and the specific region and related environmental conditions in which the agricultural process takes place future studies might focus on assessing the environmental performance and sustainability of polish agriculture taking into account a larger set of farms located in different regions acknowledgements we thank tim brombley for essential language

and oil plants by winter rape the farms in the group a investigated after eu accession were also highly diverse in their total areas from 14 3 ha to 98 1 ha their land use structure was dominated by arable lands from 74 4 98 6 table 2 moreover five farms a 1 a 4 a 5 a 6 a 8 had meadows and pastures and only one farm a 3 had orchards and gardens farms a 1 and a 5 had wastelands with an area of 0 350 ha and 0 500 table 2 cereals were cultivated on all farms including both winter and spring crops in addition root crops sugar beet fodder beet as well as corn and potatoes and oilseeds rapeseed rape were grown on each farm the researched group of farms is homogeneous in terms of soil conditions with the dominance of sands and loamy sands one farm located in the valley of the notec river has peat soil alluvial muck soil on peat subsoil and muck peat soil in addition typical brown soils occur in some farms the farms are mainly characterized by the presence of loamy sand but also sand peat and black earth built of sandy loam 2 2 data collection face to face interview was the main method used to obtain information about the farms the information related to the variables and characteristics of each farm was recorded through standardized forms the following characteristics of the farms were asked to farmers age and education of the farmer method of management size and specializations of farm production geographical location the characteristics of the farms were asked once but constant contact was maintained with owners by collecting information about natural and economic conditions the production process agricultural techniques the purchasing and selling of products mass and energy inputs supporting farming activities since irrigation is not applied in polish agriculture water input was not accounted for in this study as it was mentioned above all the investigated farms used conventional agricultural production methods with mixed profiles and animal production 2 3 energy analysis the classic ecological interpretation of agricultural production systems steinborn and svirezhev 2000 defined agroecosystems as a converter of the input flow i e artificial anthropogenic energy into the output flow i e biomass of agricultural products pimentel et al 1973 in this context energy analysis is a method capable of identifying raw materials means of production and energy flows essential for the functioning of agroecosystems and determining the energy equivalents for all these flows according to hülsbergen et al 2001 and pervanchon et al 2002 on the farm level energy consumption can be assessed in a direct and indirect way direct energy expressed in gj ha 1 year 1 includes the input of fuels and electricity directly used in the investigated farm the consumption of fuels and electricity implies the use of non renewable sources and plays an important role in determining the dependence of the farm on this type of energy sources indirect energy also expressed in gj ha 1 year 1 is the sum of energy indirectly used elsewhere for the production of seeds mineral fertilizers farmyard manure pesticides concentrates forages and machines seed and natural fertilizers belong to renewable energy sources while mineral fertilizers and plant protection chemicals are non renewable sources hülsbergen et al 2001 fadavi et al 2011 baheshti et al 2010 fan et al 2018 to calculate the energy value of the input flows energy intensity factors energy equivalent per unit of input were used the energy equivalent factors for the different inputs were taken from the scientific literature hülsbergen et al 2001 doering and mcdowell 1980 van der werf et al 2005 dalgaard et al 2001 among others output products such as total annual milk production amount of produced meat and total amount of crop yields were considered in this study crop yields were divided into crop residues crop for own purposes fodder and crop for market sale for each type of output the energy value was calculated by multiplying the mass amount by the respective energy content in addition the energy efficiency energy output energy input was calculated by the ratio of outputs expressed in energy units to inputs also expressed into energy units in general better energy efficiency relates to using less energy to produce the same amount or more useful output meul et al 2007 patterson 1996 2 4 emergy analysis odum 1971 1994 1996 introduced the term energy hierarchy to indicate that in any system more low quality energy must be dissipated to generate a product that contains less energy but of higher quality dividing the energy previously directly and indirectly consumed in generating a product by the energy of the product gives the product s transformity odum 1996 when it is expressed in solar emergy joules sej per unit of product it is defined solar transformity in simpler terms the more energy transformations involved in producing a product the higher is the transformity according to brown and ulgiati 1999 2004 and brown et al 2016a 2016b transformities represent a measure of emergy efficiency and energy quality in that they account for the total amount of work of biosphere invested per unit of output as summarized by martinez alier 1987 emergy evaluations can complement the long history of energy analysis of agricultural systems emergy analysis can help in describing agricultural systems taking into account both natural and economic flows invested in generating agricultural products franzese et al 2009 rydberg and haden 2006 compared to other evaluation methods emergy analysis accounts for a fuller range of inputs supporting a process including natural resources human driven flows labor and services in the last decades emergy accounting has been widely used to assess agricultural systems cavalett and ortega 2009 ghaley and porter 2013 ghisellini et al 2014 giannetti et al 2011 jiang et al 2007 kocjančič et al 2018 la rosa et al 2008 martin et al 2006 zucaro et al 2013 buller et al 2015 among agricultural production systems grain production has been often investigated by using emergy accounting fan et al 2018 lefroy and rydberg 2003 liu and chen 2007 lu et al 2010 ortega et al 2005 ulgiati et al 1994 odum 1996 introduced the energy systems language to draw diagrams showing system components and interactions within a system in particular the diagrams show the main internal components the external forces driving the investigated system and interactions among them ortega and bacic 2015 in this study a diagram of the agricultural system was drawn following ulgiati et al 2011 the diagram of a typical farm after 2004 is presented in fig 2 the main difference in the diagram drawn for farms before 2004 would be the lack of eu subsidies and human labor from outside according to odum 1996 emergy analysis are usually performed through the main following steps a definition of system boundaries and drawing of an energy system diagram fig 2 b identification of the main components flows and interactions and calculation of flows in physical units c conversion of physical flows into solar emergy flows expressed in solar emergy joules sej d calculation of emergy indicators renewable energy flows supporting the agricultural production sunlight wind kinetic energy rain chemical potential rain geopotential and geothermal heat were estimated according to methods presented in odum 1996 ulgiati et al 1994 panzeri et al 2000 2002 bastianoni et al 2001 and brown et al 2016b the net topsoil loss was calculated by using the local average erosion rate taken from józefaciuk et al 2014 human labor was calculated as performed in bastianoni et al 2001 la rosa et al 2008 and brown et al 2012 agricultural machinery was accounted considering a lifetime of 15 years and amortized at 8 the transformity of the main materials of agricultural machinery iron and steel was obtained from odum et al 2000 the flows of n p and k in fertilizers were calculated by using coefficients from dovring and mcdowell 1980 transformities for fertilizers pesticides and industrial fodder were derived from odum et al 2000 and bastianoni et al 2001 the energy value of fuel used in the agricultural production process was assessed using coefficients taken from rydberg and jansén 2002 services including veterinary care transportation repair of equipment purchase of machines among others were calculated in pln and were converted into us dollars according to the average exchange rate of nbp the national bank of poland for the year of analysis eu subsidies were calculated in pln according to the rates of direct payments for the area and number of animals per farm provided on the website of the ministry of agriculture www agrimr gov pl the services flow was converted into emergy units by using the emergy to money ratio emr value of 4 74e 12 sej calculated from poland and taken from the nead database all the transformities used in this study were updated to the 1 20 e25 sej yr 1 biosphere emergy baseline calculated by brown et al 2016a b the following indicators brown and ulgiati 1997 brown 1998 ulgiati and brown 1998 were used to assess the environmental performance and sustainability of the investigated agricultural systems a renewability r calculated as the percentage of renewable emergy used by the system b environmental loading ratio elr defined as the ratio of the total emergy of external inputs received from the economy f plus local non renewable inputs n to the emergy of renewable inputs r i e elr f n r c the emergy yield ratio eyr defined as the ratio of the total emergy supporting the system u r n f to the emergy of inputs received from the economy f i e eyr u f r n f f d emergy sustainability indicator esi calculated as the ratio between the eyr and elr indicators i e esi eyr elr these indicators are interpreted as follows a a high percentage of renewable emergy r reflects a production system being more sustainable than a similar one using a higher proportion of non renewable emergy cavalett et al 2006 brown and ulgiati 2004 brown et al 2016b lefroy and rydberg 2003 b elr 2 suggests a relatively low environmental load elr 10 is indicative of a concentrated environmental load while in case of 3 elr 10 the environmental load can be considered moderate brown and ulgiati 2004 c processes with eyr 1 are based on non renewable and imported resources they only transform resources that are already available from previous processes eyr from 2 to 5 is typical of a primary materials production e g cement and steel while eyr 5 are typical of primary energy source production processes e g crude oil coal natural gas brown and ulgiati 2004 d esi 1 shows that the investigated process is not sustainable in the long run medium term sustainable process are usually characterized by 1 esi 5 while processes and products with long term sustainability have higher esi brown and ulgiati 2004 2 5 statistical comparisons we evaluated inputs outputs energy efficiency r f n and u and the emergy indices for both the b and a farm groups by using statistical analysis since we use set of farms characterized by a similar production structure but different ones before and after accession to eu the statistical comparison dedicated to two random groups of samples was applied zahr 1999 in particular the non parametric man whitney test was applied because we did not expect the normal distribution of the parameters man whitney test compares two groups of random samples based on ranks of measures this decreases the probability of ii type error acceptance of false h1 hypothesis zahr 1999 rosner 2011 all calculations were performed through the use of past program hammer et al 2001 3 results 3 1 energy analysis analyzing the energy inputs supporting individual farms it can be observed that the highest amount of all inputs resulted for farm b 10 in the former subset and for farm a 3 in the latter subset the total energy supporting farm b 10 was the highest value in the whole set of 19 farms furthermore it was found that the farms of group a were distinguished by a higher autarky compared to the farms of group b in group b internal inputs accounted for about 68 of the total energy input while in group a they accounted for about 70 of the total energy input the indirect energy use of the farming systems was similar before and after accession to eu and resulted about 83 of the total energy use table 3 shows the total direct and indirect energy inputs supporting the farms the average total energy input direct and indirect resulted higher for the farms of group b 42 86 year 1 ha 1 compared to the farms of group a 36 55 year 1 ha 1 on the other hand the average total value of the outputs was higher in the period after accession to the eu 59 25 year 1 ha 1 in fact the output input ratio was nearly three times higher for the farms of group a compared to the farms of group b table 3 3 2 emergy analysis table 4 shows the main emergy based indicators calculated for both the groups of investigated farms the average value per unit area of imported inputs resulted 4 90e 15 sej year 1 for the b group and 4 47e 15 sej year 1in the a group the total emergy used u was 8 44e 15 sej year 1 and 8 01e 15 sej year 1 in b and a groups respectively the differences did not result statistically significant the elr eyr and esi indicators also did not differ significantly before and after 2004 table 4 the elr value for farms investigated after eu accession resulted in 6 15 while for farms investigated before 2004 it was 6 53 the eyr value was 1 86 after accession and 1 81 in the pre accession time the average value of the esi in the group of farms studied after eu accession was 0 32 while for the farms surveyed before accession the mean esi value was 0 30 therefore significant differences in emergy based indicators calculated before and after accession to eu were not found 4 discussion energy analysis allows the assessment of direct and indirect energy use supporting agricultural processes alluvione et al 2011 the analysis of energy input and output confirmed a high degree of variability between the two groups of investigated farms the higher energy efficiency of agricultural production for farms investigated after 2004 showed that the eu accession improved the overall energy performance of agricultural systems in poland in fact the average output input ratio for the farms before 2004 was 0 59 ranging from 0 10 to 1 47 although the farms of group a achieved higher values ranging from 0 24 to 3 17 with a mean of 1 73 other energy studies on agricultural systems showed energy efficiency values ranging from 0 7 to 16 2 depending on crop rotation production methods and fertilization rates hülsbergen et al 2001 helander and delin 2004 ozkan et al 2004 moreover as found in other studies like fumagalli et al 2011 and meul et al 2007 this study showed that the indirect energy input was about 80 of the total energy use for both the investigated groups of farms confirming the importance of hidden indirect energy input flows in agricultural production while we found significant differences between energy based indicators energy efficiency and production output the emergy based indicators before and after accession to eu did not show significant differences this is mainly due to the fact that the emergy method accounts for a larger set of input resources among them it is noteworthy the money input in terms of eu subsidies supporting the group of farms investigated after 2004 these eu subsidies allowed for a massive replacement of agricultural machinery with more modern and efficient ones powered by a lower amount of fossil energy in addition accession to eu also improved the use of fertilizers and pesticides due to the adoption of new regulations the eyr values calculated for the farms before and after eu accession did not show significant differences and fall in the range of values calculated by bastianoni et al 2001 ortega et al 2002 and panzieri et al 2000 the calculated eyr values are low compared to organic agricultural systems which are more efficient in exploiting local resources by applying outside non renewable input resources ortega et al 2005 the obtained eyr values are also slightly higher than those reported in ghisellini et al 2014 and zucaro et al 2013 for agricultural systems in italy the elr of the farms before 2004 6 53 was slightly higher than after accession to the eu 6 15 indicating a moderate environmental impact the esi values did not show significant differences and fall in a range of values reported in several studies on agricultural production systems among which cavalett et al 2006 khalaf et al 2003 ulgiati et al 1994 and zucaro et al 2013 all calculated emergy based indicators are in line with those calculated by zucaro et al 2013 and ghisellini et al 2014 investigating the italian agriculture in the period 1985 2010 5 concluding remarks this study presents the results of the first energy and emergy assessment of polish agriculture at national level over the last 10 years the outcomes of the study showed that the accession to eu has determined an improvement of the agricultural production both in terms of energy efficiency and harvest the energy and emergy based methods highlighted that performance and sustainability indicators depend on several variables among which the type of investigated crop the agricultural practices and the specific region and related environmental conditions in which the agricultural process takes place future studies might focus on assessing the environmental performance and sustainability of polish agriculture taking into account a larger set of farms located in different regions acknowledgements we thank tim brombley for essential language

24967,calibration of complex process based ecosystem models is a timely task with modellers challenged by many parameters multiple outputs of interest and often a scarcity of empirical data incorrect calibration can lead to unrealistic ecological and socio economic predictions with the modeller s experience and available knowledge of the modelled system largely determining the success of model calibration here we provide an overview of best practices when calibrating an atlantis marine ecosystem model a widely adopted framework that includes the parameters and processes comprised in many different ecosystem models we highlight the importance of understanding the model structure and data sources of the modelled system we then focus on several model outputs biomass trajectories age distributions condition at age realised diet proportions and spatial maps and describe diagnostic routines that can assist modellers to identify likely erroneous parameter values we detail strategies to fine tune values of four groups of core parameters growth predator prey interactions recruitment and mortality additionally we provide a pedigree routine to evaluate the uncertainty of an atlantis ecosystem model based on data sources used describing best and current practices will better equip future modellers of complex processed based ecosystem models to provide a more reliable means of explaining and predicting the dynamics of marine ecosystems moreover it promotes greater transparency between modellers and end users including resource managers keywords best practices model diagnostics food web pedigree parameter estimation 1 introduction complex process based or conceptual marine ecosystem models are increasingly used as strategic tools when considering how populations communities and ecosystems respond to management or environmental changes larkin 1996 garcia et al 2003 pikitch et al 2004 collie et al 2016 contrary to statistical models that seek to find associations between a minimum number of parameters to maximise fit to data the goal of process based models is to describe general functional relationships among several components of an ecosystem thus providing greater mechanistic understanding of the complex ecosystem dynamics white and marshall 2019 many different process based ecosystem models exist that are based on a range of theories and assumptions that vary from accepted to controversial fer et al 2018 the breadth of this information and uncertainty has fostered large structural discrepancies between different ecosystem modelling frameworks that each balance complexity realism and accuracy and are further categorised into species based size based or agent or individual based models pethybridge et al 2018 among the process based ecosystem model types there are a number of commonalities between the grounding theories and principles used e g stoichiometry food web life history individual or population growth and thermodynamics meaning that they share similar data requirements these data requirements are often unavailable for many components of the system of interest introducing bias from imprecise observation values observation error poor or oversimplified inclusion of processes structural error or inappropriate parameter values parametric error hill et al 2007 link et al 2012 unrealistic and biased model predictions can result from these uncertainties making model calibration a fundamental process in ensuring appropriate parameter values are attained so that model outputs agree with observed trends and most importantly have predictive power in relatively simple ecosystem models automated optimization algorithms and statistical inferencing bayesian or frequentist methods are routinely used during the calibration or parameter estimation phase to quantify uncertainty in model inputs and outputs based on probability distributions bolker et al 2009 subbey 2018 krapu and borsuk 2019 for complex process based models such analytical methods are often too computationally demanding meaning that initial parameter values are estimated before model simulation and that more labour intensive manual methods are required to determine which sets of parameters need tuning and what magnitude of change might be required the main reason is that these models have more complex structural elements such as nonlinearities and multiple discontinuities and have multiple outputs which lead to complex correlation structures of error often an iterative process called pattern oriented modelling is needed to calibrate such models adjusting parameter values to reproduce more ecologically reasonable dynamics and to fit historical observations grimm and railsback 2012 kramer schadt et al 2007 travers trolet et al 2014 the calibration process varies amongst process based ecosystem models and primarily depends on the model s representation of the food web components and contributing biological and physical processes collie et al 2016 species based ecosystem models typically aggregate species into functional groups primarily based on similarities in diet body size life history characteristics habitat dependencies spatial patterns e g depth distributions and commercial or social significance size based models characterize the food web based on body size relationships and group together individuals regardless of species by size age or life stage agent based models track populations representing individual traits size at age life history metabolism and spatial distribution each functional size or agent group represented in a model requires parameterization so the more groups included the more intricate the calibration strategy relatively simple ecosystem models that represent just a few groups 2 12 such as many size spectrum models blanchard et al 2014 andersen et al 2015 and models of intermediate complexity mice plagányi et al 2014 have few parameters typically no more than 20 that are either adjusted during calibration using standard statistical methods or fitted to data the species based model framework ecopath with ecosim ewe polovina 1984 christensen and walters 2004 requires the calibration of 4 10 parameters per functional group after a balanced model has been achieved general thermodynamics and ecological principles can then be applied to assist in the checking of ewe parameter values link 2010 at the most complex end of the ecosystem modelling spectrum are those models that seek to represent the entire trophic range separated by aggregated functional species groups and have multiple trait formulations and a number of coupled biophysical processes ecological oceanography biogeochemistry and those related to human activities such models include agent based models e g fiechter et al 2015 shin and cury 2004 grüss et al 2016 and hybrid species and size based models e g melbourne thomas et al 2011a b fulton et al 2004a 2007 2011 blanchard et al 2014 the number of parameters needing tuning in these models can be huge from 6 to over 50 per functional group reflecting an increase in the number of equations and time steps required to emulate a large number of processes the heightened complexity also increases the need for observational sources and theoretical understanding and as such models are often poorly constrained by available data which may result in potentially high degrees of uncertainty over specific parameter values collie et al 2016 weijerman et al 2015a while recent efforts have seen a number of best practice and review papers on how to calibrate an ewe mass balanced model essington 2007 ainsworth and walters 2015 heymans et al 2016 there is limited guidance available on calibration strategies for complex processed based ecosystem or whole of system models performance metrics for atlantis ecosystem models have been reported kaplan and marshall 2016 olsen et al 2016 mcgregor et al 2019 but primarily from the perspective of reviewing and validating finalized models this paper provides some pointers on how to best calibrate a complex process based ecosystem model using the atlantis framework as an example models in the atlantis framework typically include age structured and biomass pool functional groups species in a spatially explicit framework and therefore include many parameters and processes used in other processed based ecosystem models first we detail the actions required to obtain an understanding of how the study ecosystem was conceptualised and what data were used for initial parameter estimations second we outline the types of model outputs needed to diagnose which parameter groups are most likely in need of adjusting we describe how core parameters are commonly estimated and what magnitude of change could be expected lastly we provide a simple set of guidelines for ecosystem modellers to assess uncertainty based on a performance criterion we focussed on aspects most commonly involved in model calibration rather than the model development or construction as such we are not addressing issues of structural model uncertainty i e processes included and the way they are represented but only the parameter uncertainty we think that ecosystem model developers will find the assumptions and methods used to estimate values for core parameters highly useful as will model end users similarly we primarily focussed on the biological parameters rather than the parameters required by the physics hydrodynamics or fisheries and assessment modules of atlantis the growing interests in process based ecosystem models such as atlantis and their use in considering ecosystem based management options plagányi 2007 grüss et al 2017 makes this paper a timely and important contribution 2 conceptualization of the ecosystem in atlantis atlantis https research csiro au atlantis is a species based and age structured spatially explicit biophysical model that covers the full trophic spectrum including ocean biogeochemistry and human interactions fulton et al 2004a audzijonyte et al 2019 fig 1 the framework has been applied from polar to tropical systems weijerman et al 2016 and is a commonly used tool to evaluate management strategies and to explore how ecological groups may respond to changes in the environment or human use fulton et al 2011 full details on the entire atlantis framework can be found in the user manuals audzijonyte et al 2017a b one of the key features of atlantis is that it allows users to select from a range of functional responses stock recruitment relationships habitat effects and species interactions see audzijonyte et al 2019 yet the core processes and groups of parameters that govern changes in the biomass of a particular functional group are not dissimilar to other physiologically structured models and can be broadly calculated as biomass n growth recruitment predation additional mortality where biomass is tracked as nitrogen n and can be converted from carbon or dry weight using an assumed redfield ratio redfield 1958 descriptions and details of how to estimate these four groups of parameters are summarised in table 1 and discussed in detail in section 5 while not a strict requirement lower trophic levels are generally treated as aggregate biomass pool groups or with juvenile and adult stages while high trophic invertebrate and vertebrate groups are age structured with a user defined number of stages and cohorts recruitment is only explicitly tracked in the age structured groups and determines new arrivals to the habitat model domain as eggs and larval stages are not explicitly modelled like in other two pool models e g de roos and persson 2001 age structured groups in atlantis are tracked through two nitrogen pools structural sn representing irreversible mass skeleton and organs and reserve rn representing sufficient energy stores adipose tissue gonads and body fat this offers a powerful approach to model properties dependent on the condition and reserve dynamics kooijman 2000 many specific additional processes such as overwintering symbiotic growth e g zooxanthellae host mixotrophy eddy strength bleaching and bioerosion are also available audzijonyte et al 2017a but not discussed further here 3 transitioning from model development to calibration the first place to start when calibrating any complex process based ecosystem model is to understand how the ecosystem has been conceptualised during model development and what main data sources and approaches were used to estimate the core parameters of the model table 1 and the initial conditions starting biomass and weights environmental preferences and spatial distributions table s1 this would include first obtaining clear descriptions of the biological components of the model e g the taxonomic composition of the groups number of stages migration habitat preference and what functional response or relationship equations have been selected for temperature feeding and life history atlantis offers a range of options for users to select from and it is important to understand the assumptions and data requirement for each of these options the second step involves looking at how the functional groups interact through food web interactions due to a coarse spatial and temporal resolution atlantis does not aim to simulate more than the gross dynamics of the lowest trophic groups therefore it is recommended to pool these groups into several larger e g size based categories and to ensure simple food web linkages fig 2 thirdly it is crucial to look at the environmental factors temperature salinity ph included in the model and their ranges throughout the model domain e g maximum and minimum values and how they compare to the known tolerances or distribution ranges of functional groups recruitment mortality and growth can be dependent on environmental conditions in the modelled spatial areas which allows dynamically emergent responses of growth and distributions to environmental change however if not well represented these factors can restrict a group s recruitment and spatial distribution or modify predator feeding rates and prey availability lastly because atlantis allows both horizontal and vertical spatial structure effort should be made to check the assumptions and parameters behind the spatial distributions and movements horizontal and vertical of functional groups as they affect predator prey interactions and density dependent processes fulton et al 2004b grüss et al 2016 a good practice is to clearly document and reference all the data sources used to estimate initial parameter values during the model development phase and the time series data that will be used to assess model performance this would ensure model transparency and transferability of information to other modellers and model end users this process also assists in creating a pedigree of the model as we propose below and outline in table 2 that provides a first approximation of model uncertainty several approaches can be taken to source information for the various parameters table 1 and s1 with seeking guidance advice and data from field experts an obvious first point of call as new data are acquired one should keep in mind potential caveats such as using data for a depleted or heavily fished stock since very different relative biomass trajectories may be expected when conducting model projections for these groups compared to lightly or non fished groups lastly the user should have a clear idea of how the many different model outputs will be assessed using available tools and how changes to parameters will be tracked over the course of the calibration process the core atlantis code does not have model output plotting functions and instead provides outputs in a range of different file formats netcdf plain text files many different tools and scripts to explore these outputs have been contributed by the atlantis community over the last decade and are available on the public repository github https github com atlantis ecosystem model new modellers should also note that getting to the heart of anomalous behaviour in a complex process based model may mean delving into the code atlantis is an open source package and its code is written in c c helpful tips to diagnosing problems can be accessed through the atlantis github page while these tools are tailored to atlantis the specific approaches to query and diagnose model behaviour might be of interest to a broader modelling community the essential outputs to focus the assessment of any ecosystem model should include i the biomass trends at ecosystem level ii box specific biomass and ii trophic structure at the ecosystem and box level followed by age and size structure 3 1 phases and goals of calibration setting clear objectives and performance criteria is crucial for the overall calibration strategy there are typically three broad phases of calibration 1 unfished system 2 constant fishing and 3 historical fishing and environmental drivers horne et al 2010 kaplan et al 2010 weijerman et al 2015b it is highly advisable to add complexity progressively for all functionalities not just fishing for example it is advisable to initially turn off density dependent movement and set quadratic mortality parameters to zero or a very low value in this paper we discuss the calibration methods for the first phase but the techniques should be revisited in the latter two calibration phases in the absence of fishing phase one the primary goal of the simulations is to produce stable biomass through time under stable environmental forcing that is i keep all groups from becoming extinct and ii obtain stable biomasses that are not oscillating more than a certain percentage from their initial values if they are set based on the observed ecosystem variables abundance biomass what this percentage is depends on the system context and the degree of data uncertainty for example if initial model conditions reflect an unfished system then in this unfished calibration phase the objective would be to keep all groups and age classes with 20 50 of their initial values for those who have good data or for better known properties such as size at age the aim would be to use the more restrictive 20 target output band those with less data or for more uncertain properties such as abundance of a poorly monitored group would use a wider band 30 50 or potentially even higher for the most uncertain properties such as the biomass of meiofauna in contrast if the model was started with initial conditions of a fished state and run forward in an unfished state the changes in realised biomass levels should reflect understanding of the level of depletion hence in the absence of fishing all groups should reach carrying capacity with a biomass level similar to their virgin unfished biomass so for depleted groups abundance levels may be many times higher than the initial biomass ideally these target virgin biomass values would be taken from historical observations but on occasion must be drawn from stock assessments in such a case there should be close discussion with the assessment authors so all caveats and uncertainties pertaining to that assessment are understood in the second phase of calibration the goal is to reproduce realistic responses to a range of fishing pressures with an increase in fishing pressure biomass should change in most cases decrease and do so more rapidly for species with low growth rates than for species with a high turn over however the multispecies nature of these models means that counter intuitive outcomes are possible and may indicate incorrect assumptions about competitive cannibalistic or predatory species interactions if for example fishing decreases the abundance of a predator and the abundance of its prey increases even if the latter is also fished this may suggest a realistic response other responses to fishing may however be clearly unjustified e g a small pelagic species going extinct when fished at low mortality levels for the third calibration phase the goal is to reproduce historical trends in biomass when forcing the model with historical fishing and environmental drivers time series data should be compared with model trajectories and the trends and approximate magnitudes should be the same and where possible the gross levels of variation modellers should also think beyond gross biomass age size or stage distributions should be in line with observations or at least be plausible to field experts realised diets in the model are crucial for assessing the adequacy of species interactions because it is possible to achieve correct biomasses based on completely incorrect diets e g a top predator diet consisting of detritus and plankton seasonal patterns of production or movement should also be assessed and for spatial models the biomass distribution of all groups should be comparable to available species distribution or habitat maps once the model is performing well and producing biomasses and size at age in the correct ballpark then the constraining assumptions around density dependent movement and additional mortality can be relaxed and desired options put in place instead followed by calibration refinement 3 2 model time steps and periodicity the periodicity in which model fluxes are calculated and various model outputs are saved is often variable based on user needs and the processes being modelled or diagnosed for many ecosystem models including ewe and size spectrum models the time step is rather coarse seasonal or annual similar to other biogeochemical based models in atlantis fluxes are calculated every 12 h to incorporate diurnal processes such as vertical migration although shorter 3 h or 6 h time steps can be advised when interested in incorporating shorter time frame e g tidal processes longer time steps of a day or even longer can be used but usually this is not done due to the importance of diurnal processes in most ecosystems this along with fine scale spatial structure makes atlantis model runs much more computationally demanding than many other ecosystem models adjusting output reporting should balance the collection of information needed for calibration and the generation of output files as longer files slow down model run times for instance daily output may be needed to explore the effect of finer scale temporal dynamics e g day of recruitment and is commonly needed in the initial stages of model testing once the model is calibrated output frequency is usually lowered such as monthly quarterly seasonal or even annual annual output is often a useful setting for overall system metrics such as gross biomass levels per group with monthly or quarterly recommended for full spatial snapshots to ensure patterns for both short and long lived taxa are well captured every model run should have a sufficient burn in or spin up period to allow most groups to stabilise and to replace overly homogenous initial conditions with the true internal dynamics of the system as a rule of thumb the burn in period should be long enough for the life cycles of all functional groups to be completed where longer 10 20 year burn in periods are needed outputs from a long run simulation can be used to create new initial conditions so that the model effectively has a stable state that captures age structures and 3d spatial distributions appropriate for the internal dynamics of the model 4 key ecosystem model outputs and diagnostic routines after running an ecosystem model a large and customizable range of outputs is available to assist in determining how the model is performing and which functional group parametrizations need further attention for atlantis output files can be produced for different purposes with the main files including i overall system wide biomass tonnes by functional group ii spatial snapshots of biomass tonnes numbers and sn and rn mg n by functional group and age class iii realised diet proportion for each age class of each functional group and each model box iv annual predation and fishing mortality for each functional and age group per year and v warnings checks and customised calibration messages other atlantis output files are useful in reporting debug options to specifically look at the trends and patterns in stock structure migration movement spawning recruitment aging and fishing audzijonyte et al 2017a significant calibration time can be saved by thoughtful pre balance prebal diagnostics link et al 2010 essentially this includes checking if core model outputs span reasonable orders of magnitude or are trending in agreement with well accepted ecological principles such as a 5 10 decline of biomass on l o g 10 scale with each increasing trophic level atlantis can output a number of integrative ecological indicators that can be used to check ecosystem condition fulton et al 2005 these indicators are primarily intended for use in production runs to consider the implications of harvest strategies olsen et al 2018 or to check the utility of the indicator themselves fulton et al 2005 shin et al 2018 however they can be also used to identify issues of model structure and data quality in accordance to prebal diagnostics that are regularly used in other ecological network models such as ewe link 2010 for an atlantis model the prebal diagnostic could include comparing biomass ratios of pelagic and demersal groups piscivores and planktivores and infauna and epifauna as indices of food web structure and integrity diversity kempton s q and proportional habitat cover could also be considered along with the size and compositional indicators from the prebal checks and visualisation of temporal and spatial trends in the model outputs the modeller can compile a list of groups that are not performing well initial effort should go to adjusting parameters to improve the dynamics of troubled primary producer and consumer biomass groups as they influence the bottom up ecosystem trophic dynamics that ultimately determine the production of higher trophic functional groups a good place to start is to ensure a simple lower food web structure that includes linkages to detritus fig 2 gross phytoplankton or zooplankton groups rarely work when attempting to capture nutrient cycling and is best done by explicitly including both the microbial loop and the classic diatom copepod pathways next the modeller should carefully assess the degree of predation mortality through assessing realised diets of dominant predators a very effective way of stopping a group from declining is to reduce the predation pressure including degrees of cannibalism on the juveniles similarly if the biomass of a group is increasing unrealistically then one can increase the contribution of that group to the diet of corresponding predators by modifying the predator prey matrix see below unlike other ecosystem models such as ewe but similar to size spectrum models realised diets emerge dynamically in atlantis as a function of prey availability relative biomass and sizes when confident on the food web structure one should look to adjust the growth parameters as observational uncertainty of size age data is likely to be large given the inherent variability of growth and the fact that functional groups often include a diverse set of species once primary producer and consumer biomass groups are performing well effort should go to diagnosing which parameters table 1 and detailed below to adjust if higher order groups are crashing or increasing rapidly slightly different diagnostic routines are used for groups represented as a single biomass pool and those that are age structured though both heavily rely on model outputs that reflect realised predation and consumption levels fig 3 this is because predation is typically the main source of mortality in atlantis as growth is not set by a growth function but is based on realised consumption explained more in section 5 1 for biomass pools biomass can only be assessed through observing trends in total biomass because their reproduction is not specifically parameterized for age structured groups in atlantis a larger number of model outputs sn rn and numbers at age are produced giving much greater assistance in model assessment and diagnosis testing for age structured groups the shape of the condition rn and numbers at age trajectories is a rapid way of determining what combination of parameters likely needs to be changed to produce stable size at age and abundance structures table s2 for many trajectories a first place to start is to look at and adjust the parameters related to recruitment particularly if age 1 numbers are crashing within the first few years in the model run indicating that adults may not have high enough reserves to support recruitment or that the number of recruits is far too low once these have been checked a similar sequence of parameter checking to biomass groups is routinely followed fig 3 importantly visualisation of spatial trends can further assist in diagnosing which parameters most likely need adjusting for example if age 1 numbers decline in only some boxes it is unlikely that the recruitment parameters will be the main cause but rather that parameters of predator prey interactions need adjusting 5 core atlantis parameters similar to other process based ecosystem models that have a large number of parameters in atlantis many parameters should not need changing after the model development period for example it would be rare to change system level parameters related to bioturbation bioirrigation detrital breakdown nitrification light penetration or the redfield ratio particularly if the model has been developed in consultation with expert biogeochemists or experienced atlantis modellers depending on the level of model confidence for a particular functional group often no or limited changes are needed for parameters reflecting general life history and growth patterns typically available on fishbase or sealifebase number and biomass at age groups spatial distributions and environmental preferences table s1 then there are a number of parameters that are central to model sensitivity pantus 2007 that are related to growth predator prey interactions recruitment and additional mortality table 1 related to many of these parameters is that we still do not have a clear understanding of which biological mechanisms and drivers explain the variability that is observed in existing empirical databases here we describe best currently accepted practices in setting and adjusting these sets of parameters and in some cases provide parameter boundaries for broad ecological groups from existing semi validated atlantis ecosystem models many of these parameters are also core to other ecosystem models so best practices identified here should be transferrable between models conversely efforts to estimate parameter values for other ecosystem modelling frameworks including web applications that use data derived from two global information systems fishbase and sealifebase grüss et al 2019 should be utilised by atlantis and other ecosystem modellers for all the parameters detailed here single parameter sensitivity simulations are the most common way of trying to test effects and determine the magnitude of change in a parameter value that is needed fulton et al 2007 ortega cisneros et al 2017 hansen et al 2019 for the estimation of all core parameters of an ecosystem model it is essential to clearly establish how biomass measurements typically obtained in empirical studies can be converted to match the currency of the model parameters in atlantis the redfield ratio is used to convert carbon to nitrogen while a wet weight ww to ash free dry weight afdw ratio of 3 6 is commonly used where possible species and regional specific conversion factors should be used as values are considered to change between different vertebrates and invertebrates and over space and time the afdw of a healthy individual is considered to be 3 65 times the structural weight sn mg n 5 1 growth and the feeding functional response functional feeding responses are included in ecosystem models to describe how prey availability affects consumer feeding rates and how food is then assimilated and converted to growth several different functional response models exist but they all include parameters that represent food acquisition and processing such as prey assimilation efficiency prey handling time and predator clearance or ingestion rates direct measurements of these species specific feeding and growth parameters are often poorly described and thus ecosystem models use allometric assumptions in addition to more readily available observations such as size at age tagging or stomach content data to get a better feel for curve shape and bounds of parameter values table 1 even the most meticulously estimated initial values for these parameters will likely need some adjustment as they represent the mean of several species in a functional group which dynamically change in space and time in addition prey selectivity and clearance and ingestion rates are often influenced by water temperature and the size morphology chemical composition and behaviour of the prey atlantis currently has twelve different options for modelling the feeding functional responses of predators but most existing models default to using a modified holling type ii murray and parslow 1997 fulton et al 2003 table s3 type ii functional responses assume that the consumer is limited by its capacity to process food unless food is scarce in which case the searching rate parameter becomes more influential originally used for filter feeders the modified version has been reformulated to minimise the number of parameters with a maximum growth or feeding rate substituting the per biomass handling time ht parameter in biomass pool and age structured groups the feeding response model generates under constant prey biomass different growth rates that are primarily determined by the maximum growth rate mum in addition to the clearance rate c both of which are specified for all age cohorts growth can also be restricted by several other factors including light nutrients and spatial constraints both c and mum will limit a consumer s growth at low food densities if values are too low thus if prey densities are perceived to be reasonable the modeller should make efforts to test which parameter is limiting growth and for which age classes noting that both parameters may need some adjustment the clearance rate c defines the water volume filtered by a filter feeder or search volume of an active predator there are different approaches to calculating initial values of c for vertebrates including using consumption rate estimates based on allometric relationships data on the metabolic rate and dietary information table 1 as the type ii functional response dictates that c increases with prey concentration body size relationship laws can be used to assume that for age structured vertebrate groups values of c will increase with age with rates asymptotically approaching a maximum value in adults kooijman 2010 a quick analysis of existing atlantis ecosystem models suggest that values of c can be obtained by multiplying structural mass sn by a factor of 0 01 0 06 table s4 the maximum growth rate mum of a predator can be related to the maximum ingestion rate gmax as mum gmax e where e is the assimilation efficiency murray and parslow 1997 the maximum ingestion rate is the inverse of the more familiar handling time ht parameter in the traditional holling type ii relationship so that mum e ht estimates of the maximum ingestion rates asymptotes with increased food density and are given by bioenergetics or ecophysiology models and can be described empirically through experimentation table 1 assimilation efficiency is applied as a proportion for four different prey groups live plants labile detritus and refractory detritus and is used to convert food into assimilated energy assimilation efficiencies can be obtained from the experimental studies or from bioenergetics models with values typically higher in live primary prey than in other plant and detritus food types table s4 with age values of mum increase similarly to the von bertalanffy growth function which is based on a bioenergetic expression of fish growth therefore size at age data can theoretically be used to estimate fish consumption rates essington et al 2001 in addition tagging data stomach content analysis and contaminant concentration can be used to refine parameters related to consumption based on existing empirical data marine species have been shown to consume between 1 10 of their body mass per day when adult and up to 30 when juvenile essington et al 2001 this typically corresponds to values of mum that are obtained when multiplying adult sn by a factor of 0 05 0 1 table s4 for most functional groups we find that mum is higher than c although for other groups such as seabirds we find that values for c and mum are similar or that c is slightly higher than mum 5 2 predator prey interactions parameterization of the predator prey matrix does have a major influence on the biomass trends of all functional groups in atlantis these interactions are modelled in a similar way for both biomass pool and age structured groups with the available biomass of the prey availbprey to a predator given with the equation a v a i l b p r e y p p r e y δ o v e r l a p δ h a b i t a t δ s i z e b p r e y p p r e y is the stage structured juveniles and adults predator prey matrix to indicate the maximum proportion of prey biomass available to a consumer at a given point in space and time table 1 δ o v e r l a p is the proportion of available prey based on the predator prey spatial overlap δ h a b i t a t is the proportion of available prey based on the habitat refuge for prey δ s i z e is the proportion of available prey based on the gape limitation of the predator section 5 2 1 and b p r e y is the biomass of the prey the concept is similar to the vulnerabilities used in the feeding arena theory walters and kitchell 2001 the available food for each age class in each spatial box is then applied to a predator functional feeding response to determine the realised consumption or grazing of that prey table s3 if pprey is set to 0 predation will never occur but a value of 1 does not guarantee that a prey will be present in the diet as it will also depend on the spatial temporal habitat and size overlap once the gross volume grazed is determined by the functional feeding response the consumption is pro rated over the available prey biomasses for example if after accounting for all predator prey matrix space and size limitations the available prey includes 1000 mg of clams and 1 mg of fish and the functional response determines that 10 of all available biomass can be grazed in that time step the predator will ingest 100 mg of clams and 0 1 mg of fish this has important implications for optimising the maximum available biomass of prey groups to predators for example one predator group can completely deplete the prey resource checking the realized diet is therefore a very important part of the tuning process because of the large uncertainty typically associated with trophic interactions the food web availability matrix is one of the most adjusted parameters when parameterizing ecosystem models including atlantis realized diet values should wherever possible be compared to available dietary data from the study system within an appropriate time scale and if needed values in the predator prey matrix should be adjusted table 1 typically pprey values 0 1 represent a strong interaction while values 0 001 signify weak interactions lower values are more common for vertebrate predation on biomass pool groups as there is no prey size limitation in these cases and these groups can be very abundant high values can be common for predation on cephalopods mesopelagic fishes and other fast growing prey groups the availability of biomass pool groups should be low for predators that prefer to eat fish otherwise a predator such as a seal might entirely fill up on invertebrate prey and impose no top down control on fishes this can happen even if the availability of invertebrates to seals is as low as 0 001 as the final proportion in the diet is determined by availability and the biomass in the box it is important to keep consumption of detritus to a minimum for all but true detritus specialists and where it is included to make sure the associated assimilation efficiencies reflect how nutritious those food sources are to predators this is because detritus pools can be quite extensive particularly in the sediments and artificially support groups that should not feed on them in the worst case a feedback can develop between the growth of a group particularly a biomass pool consuming detritus and production of detritus as waste by that group which grows the pool of the consumers food source allowing further growth 5 2 1 gape size the gape size parameters determine the size selectivity feeding window and availability of age structured prey to a predator prey outside the range have a refuge narrowing the potential impact of a predator on prey abundances in general most predators consume prey that are relatively small typically 10 20 of body size scharf et al 2000 compared with their own body and gape size however exceptions do exist e g gelatinous zooplankton and cephalopods in atlantis the upper and lower gape limit parameters are applied to the structural size to look at the relative sizes of predators and prey they do not consider mouth allometry in most consumers mouth characteristics are strongly related to body length and feeding habits karachle and stergiou 2011 while prey size is thought to be a linear function of a consumer s body length nilsson and bronmark 2000 based on these assumptions a range of values can be considered for different ecological groups table s4 5 3 recruitment recruitment is the number of individuals that enter the system in the youngest age class and is only explicitly modelled in age structured groups and stage structured biomass pools stock recruitment relationships are often essential to achieve co existence in multi species models but are also among the most uncertain and hotly debated parameters to determine the number of recruits atlantis determines the amount of spawn produced depending on the condition at age of the spawner biomass the motivation for pulling apart structure and reserve weight baretta et al 1995 the proportion of weight for spawn represents the investment in reproductive structures fsp kspa used to translate available reserve weight per individual rn into the spawn they produce table 1 fewer recruits are produced when the adults are underweight once the biomass pool of spawn has been determined atlantis calculates the number of recruits that will enter the model domain after a larval or gestation period there are several functional forms relating the number of recruits to the existing population that can be applied in atlantis including but not limited to constant recruitment linear recruitment and beverton holt 1957 and ricker 1954 stock recruitment models as well as simple relationships relating recruits to planktonic or environmental conditions these functional forms are supported by different parameters and equations table s5 commonly stock recruitment models are only used for fish groups or in groups that stock assessments have been undertaken with a constant or linear recruitment set for invertebrates and vertebrate groups that have fixed offspring eggs or pups including sharks marine mammals sea turtles and seabirds as atlantis often does not include larval processes many models use a density dependent recruitment form consisting of a modified version of the beverton holt spawning stock recruit relationship that includes the condition of adults in the population atlantis requires knowledge of the three parameters used in the beverton holt equation most commonly used in stock assessments number of recruits a l p h a s b e t a s where alpha is the asymptote for the number of recruits beta is the spawning stock biomass ssbo mg ww expected to produce recruitment of ½ alpha the relationship is often specified with respect to steepness the proportion of virgin recruits produced by 20 of the virgin spawning stock where high values indicative of a resilient population which is robust to harvesting mace and doonan 1988 francis 1992 haddon 2001 lee et al 2012 virgin recruitment r 0 and virgin spawning stock biomass s s b 0 the initial values of the atlantis bhalpha and bhbeta parameters can be estimated based on steepness virgin spawning stock biomass and virgin recruitment see example spreadsheet on the atlantiswiki https confluence csiro au pages viewpage action pageid 238256130 but likely need additional tuning to get ecological realistic values due to the modifications to the beverton holt spawning stock recruitment relationship that take into consideration the condition of potentially spawning adults checking the realised ssr relationship is necessary during calibration there may be remaining differences between the atlantis version of the spawning stock recruitment curves and those from corresponding stock assessments in part this may be due to recruits in atlantis entering the model at younger ages than recruits in some stock assessments i e the assessments may only track those recruiting into a fishery which could be after many years post settlement within the ecosystem thus they will have been subjective to mortality in the intervening years hence stock assessment estimates must be scaled to provide atlantis numbers of recruits further the dynamic nature of the ecosystem model will bring in fluctuations to the spawning stock recruitment relationship through adult condition that are not explicitly captured in stock assessment models 5 4 additional mortality there are two main types of additional natural mortality terms ml the daily background linear mortality rate from sources not explicitly represented in the model and mq the daily quadratic density dependent mortality rate mortality m is calculated as m m s m l m q q u a n t i t y q u a n t i t y where ms represents special mortality based on environmental conditions such as the local levels of oxygen and quantity represents the metric for quantifying the functional group for biomass pooled groups this is biomass and for age structured groups this is abundance for age structured groups m is computed per age class where ml and mq are stage specific juvenile and adult setting appropriate levels of the non predation mortality parameters is extremely important as their use especially when ml or mq is set to higher values such as 1 e5 can make the model insensitive to predator prey interactions effectively turning a model into a set of single species models it is for this reason that additional mortality settings should be used as an alternative after checking recruitment predation pressure and growth parameters fig 3 in general ml relates to the natural mortality term in population biology as daily maximum value and should be kept as low as possible ideally zero unless there is compelling evidence to the contrary to ensure that predation really is the dominant mortality source being represented this should be used to fine tune the model or to represent not explicitly included processes such as senescence parasite loads or other stress factors walters and christensen 2019 the values for mq should also be kept low though there is frequently the need to apply it to the largest top predators e g mammals sea birds that have low natural predation levels once they are adults in these cases the mq may be compensating for a lack of representation of behaviour or other ecological mechanisms that introduce density dependent controls on these populations e g fine scale competition for breeding sites additional special mortality terms can be used to characterize starvation for age structured groups smothering bottom stress loss due to hypoxia disease contaminant spills fishing removals or extreme events these forms of mortality are potentially influential but often rarely adjusted during calibration smothering of macrophytes being an exception and the use of oxygen dependent mortality is growing starvation mortality is particularly underutilised typically starvation mortality is set to 0 0001 for most vertebrate groups one should investigate higher values of starvation induced mortality as well as testing a model run where all diets are set to 0 with starvation expected to result an atlantis model typically allows for approximately 70 decrease in rn reserve fat before an organism is deemed to be starving which is in line with reported ranges of 60 80 broekhuizen et al 1994 6 evaluating model confidence and data quality uncertainty and variability are inherent with ecosystem modelling and should be appropriately explored and reported model development including calibration is a very data intensive task making it difficult to track where exactly there is high degree of uncertainty while those involved with model development will know which functional groups or parameters are most data limited these are rarely reported consistently at the end stages of model development and calibration modellers should seek to relay details that reflect the complexity and quality of the model in a transparent manner standardizing the approaches taken to assessing model confidence will further allow for future ensemble model comparisons standardized ways of categorizing data sources in the development of ewe models has assisted their usage and uptake by allowing end users scientists and fisheries managers to assess model confidence in a similar way indicating the rigor of different aspects of the parameterisation in complex ecosystem models will greatly assist the calibration process we propose a data quality approach similar to the pedigree index used in ewe christensen et al 2005 in which input and output parameters for modelled functional groups or a modelled system can be indexed or ranked table 2 efforts should be made to combine this approach with detailed documentation of the main data source based on the individual values for each functional group and group of parameters a pedigree index for the overall model can be calculated where the average is obtained across all the functional groups similarly to ewe or size spectrum models confidence intervals could also be assigned and then used as weightings or prior probability distributions when applying bayesian approaches to parameter estimation aydin et al 2005 spence et al 2015 or using other optimization algorithms at least for a set of core model parameter some particularly promising techniques include approximate bayesian computation van der vaart et al 2015 and bayesian model emulation fer et al 2018 sensitivity analysis can then be targeted to the most uncertain influential parameters when evaluating the robustness of model predictions to small variations in input data more recently model skill assessment metrics have become a standard way of objectively assessing model performance in terms of how well it captures observed trends and variations on observed time series olsen et al 2016 7 conclusions complex process based ecosystem models are becoming more numerous and more accepted as a modelling approach to support strategic management of natural resources consequently as the approach matures so does the need for transparency in reporting the data sources and diagnostic approaches used to justify adjusting a potentially large number of parameter values during calibration in this study we detailed the key steps and practices currently used to calibrate complex process based ecosystem models with atlantis used as an exemplar given its complexity and application across multiple system types we recommend the following as best practices 1 take steps to understand how the system of interest is conceptualized in the model and ascertain what data sources and types have been used 2 use available diagnostic routines to identify and report likely erroneous parameter values associated with recruitment predator prey interactions growth and additional mortality and 3 create a pedigree based on data quality to define and document model confidence for each functional group the core parameters discussed are similar to those used in other process based ecosystem models thus knowledge created here could assist other ecosystem modellers while also increasing understanding of the functionality of atlantis ecosystem models the paper

24967,calibration of complex process based ecosystem models is a timely task with modellers challenged by many parameters multiple outputs of interest and often a scarcity of empirical data incorrect calibration can lead to unrealistic ecological and socio economic predictions with the modeller s experience and available knowledge of the modelled system largely determining the success of model calibration here we provide an overview of best practices when calibrating an atlantis marine ecosystem model a widely adopted framework that includes the parameters and processes comprised in many different ecosystem models we highlight the importance of understanding the model structure and data sources of the modelled system we then focus on several model outputs biomass trajectories age distributions condition at age realised diet proportions and spatial maps and describe diagnostic routines that can assist modellers to identify likely erroneous parameter values we detail strategies to fine tune values of four groups of core parameters growth predator prey interactions recruitment and mortality additionally we provide a pedigree routine to evaluate the uncertainty of an atlantis ecosystem model based on data sources used describing best and current practices will better equip future modellers of complex processed based ecosystem models to provide a more reliable means of explaining and predicting the dynamics of marine ecosystems moreover it promotes greater transparency between modellers and end users including resource managers keywords best practices model diagnostics food web pedigree parameter estimation 1 introduction complex process based or conceptual marine ecosystem models are increasingly used as strategic tools when considering how populations communities and ecosystems respond to management or environmental changes larkin 1996 garcia et al 2003 pikitch et al 2004 collie et al 2016 contrary to statistical models that seek to find associations between a minimum number of parameters to maximise fit to data the goal of process based models is to describe general functional relationships among several components of an ecosystem thus providing greater mechanistic understanding of the complex ecosystem dynamics white and marshall 2019 many different process based ecosystem models exist that are based on a range of theories and assumptions that vary from accepted to controversial fer et al 2018 the breadth of this information and uncertainty has fostered large structural discrepancies between different ecosystem modelling frameworks that each balance complexity realism and accuracy and are further categorised into species based size based or agent or individual based models pethybridge et al 2018 among the process based ecosystem model types there are a number of commonalities between the grounding theories and principles used e g stoichiometry food web life history individual or population growth and thermodynamics meaning that they share similar data requirements these data requirements are often unavailable for many components of the system of interest introducing bias from imprecise observation values observation error poor or oversimplified inclusion of processes structural error or inappropriate parameter values parametric error hill et al 2007 link et al 2012 unrealistic and biased model predictions can result from these uncertainties making model calibration a fundamental process in ensuring appropriate parameter values are attained so that model outputs agree with observed trends and most importantly have predictive power in relatively simple ecosystem models automated optimization algorithms and statistical inferencing bayesian or frequentist methods are routinely used during the calibration or parameter estimation phase to quantify uncertainty in model inputs and outputs based on probability distributions bolker et al 2009 subbey 2018 krapu and borsuk 2019 for complex process based models such analytical methods are often too computationally demanding meaning that initial parameter values are estimated before model simulation and that more labour intensive manual methods are required to determine which sets of parameters need tuning and what magnitude of change might be required the main reason is that these models have more complex structural elements such as nonlinearities and multiple discontinuities and have multiple outputs which lead to complex correlation structures of error often an iterative process called pattern oriented modelling is needed to calibrate such models adjusting parameter values to reproduce more ecologically reasonable dynamics and to fit historical observations grimm and railsback 2012 kramer schadt et al 2007 travers trolet et al 2014 the calibration process varies amongst process based ecosystem models and primarily depends on the model s representation of the food web components and contributing biological and physical processes collie et al 2016 species based ecosystem models typically aggregate species into functional groups primarily based on similarities in diet body size life history characteristics habitat dependencies spatial patterns e g depth distributions and commercial or social significance size based models characterize the food web based on body size relationships and group together individuals regardless of species by size age or life stage agent based models track populations representing individual traits size at age life history metabolism and spatial distribution each functional size or agent group represented in a model requires parameterization so the more groups included the more intricate the calibration strategy relatively simple ecosystem models that represent just a few groups 2 12 such as many size spectrum models blanchard et al 2014 andersen et al 2015 and models of intermediate complexity mice plagányi et al 2014 have few parameters typically no more than 20 that are either adjusted during calibration using standard statistical methods or fitted to data the species based model framework ecopath with ecosim ewe polovina 1984 christensen and walters 2004 requires the calibration of 4 10 parameters per functional group after a balanced model has been achieved general thermodynamics and ecological principles can then be applied to assist in the checking of ewe parameter values link 2010 at the most complex end of the ecosystem modelling spectrum are those models that seek to represent the entire trophic range separated by aggregated functional species groups and have multiple trait formulations and a number of coupled biophysical processes ecological oceanography biogeochemistry and those related to human activities such models include agent based models e g fiechter et al 2015 shin and cury 2004 grüss et al 2016 and hybrid species and size based models e g melbourne thomas et al 2011a b fulton et al 2004a 2007 2011 blanchard et al 2014 the number of parameters needing tuning in these models can be huge from 6 to over 50 per functional group reflecting an increase in the number of equations and time steps required to emulate a large number of processes the heightened complexity also increases the need for observational sources and theoretical understanding and as such models are often poorly constrained by available data which may result in potentially high degrees of uncertainty over specific parameter values collie et al 2016 weijerman et al 2015a while recent efforts have seen a number of best practice and review papers on how to calibrate an ewe mass balanced model essington 2007 ainsworth and walters 2015 heymans et al 2016 there is limited guidance available on calibration strategies for complex processed based ecosystem or whole of system models performance metrics for atlantis ecosystem models have been reported kaplan and marshall 2016 olsen et al 2016 mcgregor et al 2019 but primarily from the perspective of reviewing and validating finalized models this paper provides some pointers on how to best calibrate a complex process based ecosystem model using the atlantis framework as an example models in the atlantis framework typically include age structured and biomass pool functional groups species in a spatially explicit framework and therefore include many parameters and processes used in other processed based ecosystem models first we detail the actions required to obtain an understanding of how the study ecosystem was conceptualised and what data were used for initial parameter estimations second we outline the types of model outputs needed to diagnose which parameter groups are most likely in need of adjusting we describe how core parameters are commonly estimated and what magnitude of change could be expected lastly we provide a simple set of guidelines for ecosystem modellers to assess uncertainty based on a performance criterion we focussed on aspects most commonly involved in model calibration rather than the model development or construction as such we are not addressing issues of structural model uncertainty i e processes included and the way they are represented but only the parameter uncertainty we think that ecosystem model developers will find the assumptions and methods used to estimate values for core parameters highly useful as will model end users similarly we primarily focussed on the biological parameters rather than the parameters required by the physics hydrodynamics or fisheries and assessment modules of atlantis the growing interests in process based ecosystem models such as atlantis and their use in considering ecosystem based management options plagányi 2007 grüss et al 2017 makes this paper a timely and important

entire atlantis framework can be found in the user manuals audzijonyte et al 2017a b one of the key features of atlantis is that it allows users to select from a range of functional responses stock recruitment relationships habitat effects and species interactions see audzijonyte et al 2019 yet the core processes and groups of parameters that govern changes in the biomass of a particular functional group are not dissimilar to other physiologically structured models and can be broadly calculated as biomass n growth recruitment predation additional mortality where biomass is tracked as nitrogen n and can be converted from carbon or dry weight using an assumed redfield ratio redfield 1958 descriptions and details of how to estimate these four groups of parameters are summarised in table 1 and discussed in detail in section 5 while not a strict requirement lower trophic levels are generally treated as aggregate biomass pool groups or with juvenile and adult stages while high trophic invertebrate and vertebrate groups are age structured with a user defined number of stages and cohorts recruitment is only explicitly tracked in the age structured groups and determines new arrivals to the habitat model domain as eggs and larval stages are not explicitly modelled like in other two pool models e g de roos and persson 2001 age structured groups in atlantis are tracked through two nitrogen pools structural sn representing irreversible mass skeleton and organs and reserve rn representing sufficient energy stores adipose tissue gonads and body fat this offers a powerful approach to model properties dependent on the condition and reserve dynamics kooijman 2000 many specific additional processes such as overwintering symbiotic growth e g zooxanthellae host mixotrophy eddy strength bleaching and bioerosion are also available audzijonyte et al 2017a but not discussed further here 3 transitioning from model development to calibration the first place to start when calibrating any complex process based ecosystem model is to understand how the ecosystem has been conceptualised during model development and what main data sources and approaches were used to estimate the core parameters of the model table 1 and the initial conditions starting biomass and weights environmental preferences and spatial distributions table s1 this would include first obtaining clear descriptions of the biological components of the model e g the taxonomic composition of the groups number of stages migration habitat preference and what functional response or relationship equations have been selected for temperature feeding and life history atlantis offers a range of options for users to select from and it is important to understand the assumptions and data requirement for each of these options the second step involves looking at how the functional groups interact through food web interactions due to a coarse spatial and temporal resolution atlantis does not aim to simulate more than the gross dynamics of the lowest trophic groups therefore it is recommended to pool these groups into several larger e g size based categories and to ensure simple food web linkages fig 2 thirdly it is crucial to look at the environmental factors temperature salinity ph included in the model and their ranges throughout the model domain e g maximum and minimum values and how they compare to the known tolerances or distribution ranges of functional groups recruitment mortality and growth can be dependent on environmental conditions in the modelled spatial areas which allows dynamically emergent responses of growth and distributions to environmental change however if not well represented these factors can restrict a group s recruitment and spatial distribution or modify predator feeding rates and prey availability lastly because atlantis allows both horizontal and vertical spatial structure effort should be made to check the assumptions and parameters behind the spatial distributions and movements horizontal and vertical of functional groups as they affect predator prey interactions and density dependent processes fulton et al 2004b grüss et al 2016 a good practice is to clearly document and reference all the data sources used to estimate initial parameter values during the model development phase and the time series data that will be used to assess model performance this would ensure model transparency and transferability of information to other modellers and model end users this process also assists in creating a pedigree of the model as we propose below and outline in table 2 that provides a first approximation of model uncertainty several approaches can be taken to source information for the various parameters table 1 and s1 with seeking guidance advice and data from field experts an obvious first point of call as new data are acquired one should keep in mind potential caveats such as using data for a depleted or heavily fished stock since very different relative biomass trajectories may be expected when conducting model projections for these groups compared to lightly or non fished groups lastly the user should have a clear idea of how the many different model outputs will be assessed using available tools and how changes to parameters will be tracked over the course of the calibration process the core atlantis code does not have model output plotting functions and instead provides outputs in a range of different file formats netcdf plain text files many different tools and scripts to explore these outputs have been contributed by the atlantis community over the last decade and are available on the public repository github https github com atlantis ecosystem model new modellers should also note that getting to the heart of anomalous behaviour in a complex process based model may mean delving into the code atlantis is an open source package and its code is written in c c helpful tips to diagnosing problems can be accessed through the atlantis github page while these tools are tailored to atlantis the specific approaches to query and diagnose model behaviour might be of interest to a broader modelling community the essential outputs to focus the assessment of any ecosystem model should include i the biomass trends at ecosystem level ii box specific biomass and ii trophic structure at the ecosystem and box level followed by age and size structure 3 1 phases and goals of calibration setting clear objectives and performance criteria is crucial for the overall calibration strategy there are typically three broad phases of calibration 1 unfished system 2 constant fishing and 3 historical fishing and environmental drivers horne et al 2010 kaplan et al 2010 weijerman et al 2015b it is highly advisable to add complexity progressively for all functionalities not just fishing for example it is advisable to initially turn off density dependent movement and set quadratic mortality parameters to zero or a very low value in this paper we discuss the calibration methods for the first phase but the techniques should be revisited in the latter two calibration phases in the absence of fishing phase one the primary goal of the simulations is to produce stable biomass through time under stable environmental forcing that is i keep all groups from becoming extinct and ii obtain stable biomasses that are not oscillating more than a certain percentage from their initial values if they are set based on the observed ecosystem variables abundance biomass what this percentage is depends on the system context and the degree of data uncertainty for example if initial model conditions reflect an unfished system then in this unfished calibration phase the objective would be to keep all groups and age classes with 20 50 of their initial values for those who have good data or for better known properties such as size at age the aim would be to use the more restrictive 20 target output band those with less data or for more uncertain properties such as abundance of a poorly monitored group would use a wider band 30 50 or potentially even higher for the most uncertain properties such as the biomass of meiofauna in contrast if the model was started with initial conditions of a fished state and run forward in an unfished state the changes in realised biomass levels should reflect understanding of the level of depletion hence in the absence of fishing all groups should reach carrying capacity with a biomass level similar to their virgin unfished biomass so for depleted groups abundance levels may be many times higher than the initial biomass ideally these target virgin biomass values would be taken from historical observations but on occasion must be drawn from stock assessments in such a case there should be close discussion with the assessment authors so all caveats and uncertainties pertaining to that assessment are understood in the second phase of calibration the goal is to reproduce realistic responses to a range of fishing pressures with an increase in fishing pressure biomass should change in most cases decrease and do so more rapidly for species with low growth rates than for species with a high turn over however the multispecies nature of these models means that counter intuitive outcomes are possible and may indicate incorrect assumptions about competitive cannibalistic or predatory species interactions if for example fishing decreases the abundance of a predator and the abundance of its prey increases even if the latter is also fished this may suggest a realistic response other responses to fishing may however be clearly unjustified e g a small pelagic species going extinct when fished at low mortality levels for the third calibration phase the goal is to reproduce historical trends in biomass when forcing the model with historical fishing and environmental drivers time series data should be compared with model trajectories and the trends and approximate magnitudes should be the same and where possible the gross levels of variation modellers should also think beyond gross biomass age size or stage distributions should be in line with observations or at least be plausible to field experts realised diets in the model are crucial for assessing the adequacy of species interactions because it is possible to achieve correct biomasses based on completely incorrect diets e g a top predator diet consisting of detritus and plankton seasonal patterns of production or movement should also be assessed and for spatial models the biomass distribution of all groups should be comparable to available species distribution or habitat maps once the model is performing well and producing biomasses and size at age in the correct ballpark then the constraining assumptions around density dependent movement and additional mortality can be relaxed and desired options put in place instead followed by calibration refinement 3 2 model time steps and periodicity the periodicity in which model fluxes are calculated and various model outputs are saved is often variable based on user needs and the processes being modelled or diagnosed for many ecosystem models including ewe and size spectrum models the time step is rather coarse seasonal or annual similar to other biogeochemical based models in atlantis fluxes are calculated every 12 h to incorporate diurnal processes such as vertical migration although shorter 3 h or 6 h time steps can be advised when interested in incorporating shorter time frame e g tidal processes longer time steps of a day or even longer can be used but usually this is not done due to the importance of diurnal processes in most ecosystems this along with fine scale spatial structure makes atlantis model runs much more computationally demanding than many other ecosystem models adjusting output reporting should balance the collection of information needed for calibration and the generation of output files as longer files slow down model run times for instance daily output may be needed to explore the effect of finer scale temporal dynamics e g day of recruitment and is commonly needed in the initial stages of model testing once the model is calibrated output frequency is usually lowered such as monthly quarterly seasonal or even annual annual output is often a useful setting for overall system metrics such as gross biomass levels per group with monthly or quarterly recommended for full spatial snapshots to ensure patterns for both short and long lived taxa are well captured every model run should have a sufficient burn in or spin up period to allow most groups to stabilise and to replace overly homogenous initial conditions with the true internal dynamics of the system as a rule of thumb the burn in period should be long enough for the life cycles of all functional groups to be completed where longer 10 20 year burn in periods are needed outputs from a long run simulation can be used to create new initial conditions so that the model effectively has a stable state that captures age structures and 3d spatial distributions appropriate for the internal dynamics of the model 4 key ecosystem model outputs and diagnostic routines after running an ecosystem model a large and customizable range of outputs is available to assist in determining how the model is performing and which functional group parametrizations need further attention for atlantis output files can be produced for different purposes with the main files including i overall system wide biomass tonnes by functional group ii spatial snapshots of biomass tonnes numbers and sn and rn mg n by functional group and age class iii realised diet proportion for each age class of each functional group and each model box iv annual predation and fishing mortality for each functional and age group per year and v warnings checks and customised calibration messages other atlantis output files are useful in reporting debug options to specifically look at the trends and patterns in stock structure migration movement spawning recruitment aging and fishing audzijonyte et al 2017a significant calibration time can be saved by thoughtful pre balance prebal diagnostics link et al 2010 essentially this includes checking if core model outputs span reasonable orders of magnitude or are trending in agreement with well accepted ecological principles such as a 5 10 decline of biomass on l o g 10 scale with each increasing trophic level atlantis can output a number of integrative ecological indicators that can be used to check ecosystem condition fulton et al 2005 these indicators are primarily intended for use in production runs to consider the implications of harvest strategies olsen et al 2018 or to check the utility of the indicator themselves fulton et al 2005 shin et al 2018 however they can be also used to identify issues of model structure and data quality in accordance to prebal diagnostics that are regularly used in other ecological network models such as ewe link 2010 for an atlantis model the prebal diagnostic could include comparing biomass ratios of pelagic and demersal groups piscivores and planktivores and infauna and epifauna as indices of food web structure and integrity diversity kempton s q and proportional habitat cover could also be considered along with the size and compositional indicators from the prebal checks and visualisation of temporal and spatial trends in the model outputs the modeller can compile a list of groups that are not performing well initial effort should go to adjusting parameters to improve the dynamics of troubled primary producer and consumer biomass groups as they influence the bottom up ecosystem trophic dynamics that ultimately determine the production of higher trophic functional groups a good place to start is to ensure a simple lower food web structure that includes linkages to detritus fig 2 gross phytoplankton or zooplankton groups rarely work when attempting to capture nutrient cycling and is best done by explicitly including both the microbial loop and the classic diatom copepod pathways next the modeller should carefully assess the degree of predation mortality through assessing realised diets of dominant predators a very effective way of stopping a group from declining is to reduce the predation pressure including degrees of cannibalism on the juveniles similarly if the biomass of a group is increasing unrealistically then one can increase the contribution of that group to the diet of corresponding predators by modifying the predator prey matrix see below unlike other ecosystem models such as ewe but similar to size spectrum models realised diets emerge dynamically in atlantis as a function of prey availability relative biomass and sizes when confident on the food web structure one should look to adjust the growth parameters as observational uncertainty of size age data is likely to be large given the inherent variability of growth and the fact that functional groups often include a diverse set of species once primary producer and consumer biomass groups are performing well effort should go to diagnosing which parameters table 1 and detailed below to adjust if higher order groups are crashing or increasing rapidly slightly different diagnostic routines are used for groups represented as a single biomass pool and those that are age structured though both heavily rely on model outputs that reflect realised predation and consumption levels fig 3 this is because predation is typically the main source of mortality in atlantis as growth is not set by a growth function but is based on realised consumption explained more in section 5 1 for biomass pools biomass can only be assessed through observing trends in total biomass because their reproduction is not specifically parameterized for age structured groups in atlantis a larger number of model outputs sn rn and numbers at age are produced giving much greater assistance in model assessment and diagnosis testing for age structured groups the shape of the condition rn and numbers at age trajectories is a rapid way of determining what combination of parameters likely needs to be changed to produce stable size at age and abundance structures table s2 for many trajectories a first place to start is to look at and adjust the parameters related to recruitment particularly if age 1 numbers are crashing within the first few years in the model run indicating that adults may not have high enough reserves to support recruitment or that the number of recruits is far too low once these have been checked a similar sequence of parameter checking to biomass groups is routinely followed fig 3 importantly visualisation of spatial trends can further assist in diagnosing which parameters most likely need adjusting for example if age 1 numbers decline in only some boxes it is unlikely that the recruitment parameters will be the main cause but rather that parameters of predator prey interactions need adjusting 5 core atlantis parameters similar to other process based ecosystem models that have a large number of parameters in atlantis many parameters should not need changing after the model development period for example it would be rare to change system level parameters related to bioturbation bioirrigation detrital breakdown nitrification light penetration or the redfield ratio particularly if the model has been developed in consultation with expert biogeochemists or experienced atlantis modellers depending on the level of model confidence for a particular functional group often no or limited changes are needed for parameters reflecting general life history and growth patterns typically available on fishbase or sealifebase number and biomass at age groups spatial distributions and environmental preferences table s1 then there are a number of parameters that are central to model sensitivity pantus 2007 that are related to growth predator prey interactions recruitment and additional mortality table 1 related to many of these parameters is that we still do not have a clear understanding of which biological mechanisms and drivers explain the variability that is observed in existing empirical databases here we describe best currently accepted practices in setting and adjusting these sets of parameters and in some cases provide parameter boundaries for broad ecological groups from existing semi validated atlantis ecosystem models many of these parameters are also core to other ecosystem models so best practices identified here should be transferrable between models conversely efforts to estimate parameter values for other ecosystem modelling frameworks including web applications that use data derived from two global information systems fishbase and sealifebase grüss et al 2019 should be utilised by atlantis and other ecosystem modellers for all the parameters detailed here single parameter sensitivity simulations are the most common way of trying to test effects and determine the magnitude of change in a parameter value that is needed fulton et al 2007 ortega cisneros et al 2017 hansen et al 2019 for the estimation of all core parameters of an ecosystem model it is essential to clearly establish how biomass measurements typically obtained in empirical studies can be converted to match the currency of the model parameters in atlantis the redfield ratio is used to convert carbon to nitrogen while a wet weight ww to ash free dry weight afdw ratio of 3 6 is commonly used where possible species and regional specific conversion factors should be used as values are considered to change between different vertebrates and invertebrates and over space and time the afdw of a healthy individual is considered to be 3 65 times the structural weight sn mg n 5 1 growth and the feeding functional response functional feeding responses are included in ecosystem models to describe how prey availability affects consumer feeding rates and how food is then assimilated and converted to growth several different functional response models exist but they all include parameters that represent food acquisition and processing such as prey assimilation efficiency prey handling time and predator clearance or ingestion rates direct measurements of these species specific feeding and growth parameters are often poorly described and thus ecosystem models use allometric assumptions in addition to more readily available observations such as size at age tagging or stomach content data to get a better feel for curve shape and bounds of parameter values table 1 even the most meticulously estimated initial values for these parameters will likely need some adjustment as they represent the mean of several species in a functional group which dynamically change in space and time in addition prey selectivity and clearance and ingestion rates are often influenced by water temperature and the size morphology chemical composition and behaviour of the prey atlantis currently has twelve different options for modelling the feeding functional responses of predators but most existing models default to using a modified holling type ii murray and parslow 1997 fulton et al 2003 table s3 type ii functional responses assume that the consumer is limited by its capacity to process food unless food is scarce in which case the searching rate parameter becomes more influential originally used for filter feeders the modified version has been reformulated to minimise the number of parameters with a maximum growth or feeding rate substituting the per biomass handling time ht parameter in biomass pool and age structured groups the feeding response model generates under constant prey biomass different growth rates that are primarily determined by the maximum growth rate mum in addition to the clearance rate c both of which are specified for all age cohorts growth can also be restricted by several other factors including light nutrients and spatial constraints both c and mum will limit a consumer s growth at low food densities if values are too low thus if prey densities are perceived to be reasonable the modeller should make efforts to test which parameter is limiting growth and for which age classes noting that both parameters may need some adjustment the clearance rate c defines the water volume filtered by a filter feeder or search volume of an active predator there are different approaches to calculating initial values of c for vertebrates including using consumption rate estimates based on allometric relationships data on the metabolic rate and dietary information table 1 as the type ii functional response dictates that c increases with prey concentration body size relationship laws can be used to assume that for age structured vertebrate groups values of c will increase with age with rates asymptotically approaching a maximum value in adults kooijman 2010 a quick analysis of existing atlantis ecosystem models suggest that values of c can be obtained by multiplying structural mass sn by a factor of 0 01 0 06 table s4 the maximum growth rate mum of a predator can be related to the maximum ingestion rate gmax as mum gmax e where e is the assimilation efficiency murray and parslow 1997 the maximum ingestion rate is the inverse of the more familiar handling time ht parameter in the traditional holling type ii relationship so that mum e ht estimates of the maximum ingestion rates asymptotes with increased food density and are given by bioenergetics or ecophysiology models and can be described empirically through experimentation table 1 assimilation efficiency is applied as a proportion for four different prey groups live plants labile detritus and refractory detritus and is used to convert food into assimilated energy assimilation efficiencies can be obtained from the experimental studies or from bioenergetics models with values typically higher in live primary prey than in other plant and detritus food types table s4 with age values of mum increase similarly to the von bertalanffy growth function which is based on a bioenergetic expression of fish growth therefore size at age data can theoretically be used to estimate fish consumption rates essington et al 2001 in addition tagging data stomach content analysis and contaminant concentration can be used to refine parameters related to consumption based on existing empirical data marine species have been shown to consume between 1 10 of their body mass per day when adult and up to 30 when juvenile essington et al 2001 this typically corresponds to values of mum that are obtained when multiplying adult sn by a factor of 0 05 0 1 table s4 for most functional groups we find that mum is higher than c although for other groups such as seabirds we find that values for c and mum are similar or that c is slightly higher than mum 5 2 predator prey interactions parameterization of the predator prey matrix does have a major influence on the biomass trends of all functional groups in atlantis these interactions are modelled in a similar way for both biomass pool and age structured groups with the available biomass of the prey availbprey to a predator given with the equation a v a i l b p r e y p p r e y δ o v e r l a p δ h a b i t a t δ s i z e b p r e y p p r e y is the stage structured juveniles and adults predator prey matrix to indicate the maximum proportion of prey biomass available to a consumer at a given point in space and time table 1 δ o v e r l a p is the proportion of available prey based on the predator prey spatial overlap δ h a b i t a t is the proportion of available prey based on the habitat refuge for prey δ s i z e is the proportion of available prey based on the gape limitation of the predator section 5 2 1 and b p r e y is the biomass of the prey the concept is similar to the vulnerabilities used in the feeding arena theory walters and kitchell 2001 the available food for each age class in each spatial box is then applied to a predator functional feeding response to determine the realised consumption or grazing of that prey table s3 if pprey is set to 0 predation will never occur but a value of 1 does not guarantee that a prey will be present in the diet as it will also depend on the spatial temporal habitat and size overlap once the gross volume grazed is determined by the functional feeding response the consumption is pro rated over the available prey biomasses for example if after accounting for all predator prey matrix space and size limitations the available prey includes 1000 mg of clams and 1 mg of fish and the functional response determines that 10 of all available biomass can be grazed in that time step the predator will ingest 100 mg of clams and 0 1 mg of fish this has important implications for optimising the maximum available biomass of prey groups to predators for example one predator group can completely deplete the prey resource checking the realized diet is therefore a very important part of the tuning process because of the large uncertainty typically associated with trophic interactions the food web availability matrix is one of the most adjusted parameters when parameterizing ecosystem models including atlantis realized diet values should wherever possible be compared to available dietary data from the study system within an appropriate time scale and if needed values in the predator prey matrix should be adjusted table 1 typically pprey values 0 1 represent a strong interaction while values 0 001 signify weak interactions lower values are more common for vertebrate predation on biomass pool groups as there is no prey size limitation in these cases and these groups can be very abundant high values can be common for predation on cephalopods mesopelagic fishes and other fast growing prey groups the availability of biomass pool groups should be low for predators that prefer to eat fish otherwise a predator such as a seal might entirely fill up on invertebrate prey and impose no top down control on fishes this can happen even if the availability of invertebrates to seals is as low as 0 001 as the final proportion in the diet is determined by availability and the biomass in the box it is important to keep consumption of detritus to a minimum for all but true detritus specialists and where it is included to make sure the associated assimilation efficiencies reflect how nutritious those food sources are to predators this is because detritus pools can be quite extensive particularly in the sediments and artificially support groups that should not feed on them in the worst case a feedback can develop between the growth of a group particularly a biomass pool consuming detritus and production of detritus as waste by that group which grows the pool of the consumers food source allowing further growth 5 2 1 gape size the gape size parameters determine the size selectivity feeding window and availability of age structured prey to a predator prey outside the range have a refuge narrowing the potential impact of a predator on prey abundances in general most predators consume prey that are relatively small typically 10 20 of body size scharf et al 2000 compared with their own body and gape size however exceptions do exist e g gelatinous zooplankton and cephalopods in atlantis the upper and lower gape limit parameters are applied to the structural size to look at the relative sizes of predators and prey they do not consider mouth allometry in most consumers mouth characteristics are strongly related to body length and feeding habits karachle and stergiou 2011 while prey size is thought to be a linear function of a consumer s body length nilsson and bronmark 2000 based on these assumptions a range of values can be considered for different ecological groups table s4 5 3 recruitment recruitment is the number of individuals that enter the system in the youngest age class and is only explicitly modelled in age structured groups and stage structured biomass pools stock recruitment relationships are often essential to achieve co existence in multi species models but are also among the most uncertain and hotly debated parameters to determine the number of recruits atlantis determines the amount of spawn produced depending on the condition at age of the spawner biomass the motivation for pulling apart structure and reserve weight baretta et al 1995 the proportion of weight for spawn represents the investment in reproductive structures fsp kspa used to translate available reserve weight per individual rn into the spawn they produce table 1 fewer recruits are produced when the adults are underweight once the biomass pool of spawn has been determined atlantis calculates the number of recruits that will enter the model domain after a larval or gestation period there are several functional forms relating the number of recruits to the existing population that can be applied in atlantis including but not limited to constant recruitment linear recruitment and beverton holt 1957 and ricker 1954 stock recruitment models as well as simple relationships relating recruits to planktonic or environmental conditions these functional forms are supported by different parameters and equations table s5 commonly stock recruitment models are only used for fish groups or in groups that stock assessments have been undertaken with a constant or linear recruitment set for invertebrates and vertebrate groups that have fixed offspring eggs or pups including sharks marine mammals sea turtles and seabirds as atlantis often does not include larval processes many models use a density dependent recruitment form consisting of a modified version of the beverton holt spawning stock recruit relationship that includes the condition of adults in the population atlantis requires knowledge of the three parameters used in the beverton holt equation most commonly used in stock assessments number of recruits a l p h a s b e t a s where alpha is the asymptote for the number of recruits beta is the spawning stock biomass ssbo mg ww expected to produce recruitment of ½ alpha the relationship is often specified with respect to steepness the proportion of virgin recruits produced by 20 of the virgin spawning stock where high values indicative of a resilient population which is robust to harvesting mace and doonan 1988 francis 1992 haddon 2001 lee et al 2012 virgin recruitment r 0 and virgin spawning stock biomass s s b 0 the initial values of the atlantis bhalpha and bhbeta parameters can be estimated based on steepness virgin spawning stock biomass and virgin recruitment see example spreadsheet on the atlantiswiki https confluence csiro au pages viewpage action pageid 238256130 but likely need additional tuning to get ecological realistic values due to the modifications to the beverton holt spawning stock recruitment relationship that take into consideration the condition of potentially spawning adults checking the realised ssr relationship is necessary during calibration there may be remaining differences between the atlantis version of the spawning stock recruitment curves and those from corresponding stock assessments in part this may be due to recruits in atlantis entering the model at younger ages than recruits in some stock assessments i e the assessments may only track those recruiting into a fishery which could be after many years post settlement within the ecosystem thus they will have been subjective to mortality in the intervening years hence stock assessment estimates must be scaled to provide atlantis numbers of recruits further the dynamic nature of the ecosystem model will bring in fluctuations to the spawning stock recruitment relationship through adult condition that are not explicitly captured in stock assessment models 5 4 additional mortality there are two main types of additional natural mortality terms ml the daily background linear mortality rate from sources not explicitly represented in the model and mq the daily quadratic density dependent mortality rate mortality m is calculated as m m s m l m q q u a n t i t y q u a n t i t y where ms represents special mortality based on environmental conditions such as the local levels of oxygen and quantity represents the metric for quantifying the functional group for biomass pooled groups this is biomass and for age structured groups this is abundance for age structured groups m is computed per age class where ml and mq are stage specific juvenile and adult setting appropriate levels of the non predation mortality parameters is extremely important as their use especially when ml or mq is set to higher values such as 1 e5 can make the model insensitive to predator prey interactions effectively turning a model into a set of single species models it is for this reason that additional mortality settings should be used as an alternative after checking recruitment predation pressure and growth parameters fig 3 in general ml relates to the natural mortality term in population biology as daily maximum value and should be kept as low as possible ideally zero unless there is compelling evidence to the contrary to ensure that predation really is the dominant mortality source being represented this should be used to fine tune the model or to represent not explicitly included processes such as senescence parasite loads or other stress factors walters and christensen 2019 the values for mq should also be kept low though there is frequently the need to apply it to the largest top predators e g mammals sea birds that have low natural predation levels once they are adults in these cases the mq may be compensating for a lack of representation of behaviour or other ecological mechanisms that introduce density dependent controls on these populations e g fine scale competition for breeding sites additional special mortality terms can be used to characterize starvation for age structured groups smothering bottom stress loss due to hypoxia disease contaminant spills fishing removals or extreme events these forms of mortality are potentially influential but often rarely adjusted during calibration smothering of macrophytes being an exception and the use of oxygen dependent mortality is growing starvation mortality is particularly underutilised typically starvation mortality is set to 0 0001 for most vertebrate groups one should investigate higher values of starvation induced mortality as well as testing a model run where all diets are set to 0 with starvation expected to result an atlantis model typically allows for approximately 70 decrease in rn reserve fat before an organism is deemed to be starving which is in line with reported ranges of 60 80 broekhuizen et al 1994 6 evaluating model confidence and data quality uncertainty and variability are inherent with ecosystem modelling and should be appropriately explored and reported model development including calibration is a very data intensive task making it difficult to track where exactly there is high degree of uncertainty while those involved with model development will know which functional groups or parameters are most data limited these are rarely reported consistently at the end stages of model development and calibration modellers should seek to relay details that reflect the complexity and quality of the model in a transparent manner standardizing the approaches taken to assessing model confidence will further allow for future ensemble model comparisons standardized ways of categorizing data sources in the development of ewe models has assisted their usage and uptake by allowing end users scientists and fisheries managers to assess model confidence in a similar way indicating the rigor of different aspects of the parameterisation in complex ecosystem models will greatly assist the calibration process we propose a data quality approach similar to the pedigree index used in ewe christensen et al 2005 in which input and output parameters for modelled functional groups or a modelled system can be indexed or ranked table 2 efforts should be made to combine this approach with detailed documentation of the main data source based on the individual values for each functional group and group of parameters a pedigree index for the overall model can be calculated where the average is obtained across all the functional groups similarly to ewe or size spectrum models confidence intervals could also be assigned and then used as weightings or prior probability distributions when applying bayesian approaches to parameter estimation aydin et al 2005 spence et al 2015 or using other optimization algorithms at least for a set of core model parameter some particularly promising techniques include approximate bayesian computation van der vaart et al 2015 and bayesian model emulation fer et al 2018 sensitivity analysis can then be targeted to the most uncertain influential parameters when evaluating the robustness of model predictions to small variations in input data more recently model skill assessment metrics have become a standard way of objectively assessing model performance in terms of how well it captures observed trends and variations on observed time series olsen et al 2016 7 conclusions complex process based ecosystem models are becoming more numerous and more accepted as a modelling approach to support strategic management of natural resources consequently as the approach matures so does the need for transparency in reporting the data sources and diagnostic approaches used to justify adjusting a potentially large number of parameter values during calibration in this study we detailed the key steps and practices currently used to calibrate complex process based ecosystem models with atlantis used as an exemplar given its complexity and application across multiple system types we recommend the following as best practices 1 take steps to understand how the system of interest is conceptualized in the model and ascertain what data sources and types have been used 2 use available diagnostic routines to identify and report likely erroneous parameter values associated with recruitment predator prey interactions growth and additional mortality and 3 create a pedigree based on data quality to define and document model confidence for each functional group the core parameters discussed are similar to those used in other process based ecosystem models thus knowledge created here could assist other ecosystem modellers while also increasing understanding of the functionality of atlantis ecosystem models the paper provides model end users an overview of the thoroughness taken by modellers to ensure that the model is producing the most trustworthy outputs fitted to the most current and available data sources

24968,active subsidies are animal transported consumption e g predators pathogens parasites and resources e g prey detritus nutrients moved between ecosystems animal movement behavior has the potential to mediate the extent and intensity of active subsidies and corresponding ecosystem responses animal movement behaviors could interact with mortality risk to affect active subsidy distributions and ecosystem impacts but have rarely been examined in existing ecosystem models of spatial subsidies movement ecologists typically simulate animal dispersal and foraging movements using stochastic random walk models such as correlated random walk crw and lévy walk lw models movement models generally implement mortality as an instantaneous mortality rate i e probability of death per

producers minerals and nutrients in feces and detritus and consumers e g predators pathogens and parasites between ecosystems as ecological subsidies polis et al 1997 active subsidies are resources or consumers displaced by animal movement between a donor and a recipient ecosystem earl and zollner 2017 mcinturf et al 2019 and are different from passive subsidies which are moved by wind and water knight et al 2005 leroux and loreau 2008 subsidies can change trophic relationships alter ecosystem structure and function and modify material and energetic balances in recipient ecosystems with

mechanisms that might be important for spatial subsidies include movement patterns and mortality risk i e mortality rate and change in mortality rate as a function of space distance and or time earl and zollner 2014 2017 despite the significance of active subsidies for ecosystem processes limited ecological research examines how animal movement behavior and mortality risk influence active subsidy distribution mcinturf et al 2019 current reviews in spatial subsidy research document the need for systematic studies to develop general insights into the influence of spatially explicit animal movements on corresponding spatial subsidy patterns and impacts e g cross ecosystem contaminant transfer and nutrient export earl and zollner 2017 mcinturf et al 2019 while there are examples of empirical studies that address active subsidies for single taxa in specific ecosystems moon and silva 2013 schindler and smits 2017 there are no systematic models that elucidate general principles of how spatially explicit animal movements influence active subsidy distributions but see earl and zollner 2014 further existing ecosystem models are generally inadequate for investigating active subsidy systems because they treat movement and or space implicitly scharf et al 2018 however animal movement and space use behavior can differ among ecological processes like foraging dispersal and migration jeltsch et al 2013 generating corresponding variations in spatial subsidy patterns and impacts modeling frameworks that do not systematically account for how spatial subsidy patterns emerge from animal movements limit the development of predictive models of corresponding impacts for a broad range of taxa and ecosystems spatial subsidy research can improve by integrating individual based and movement ecology to generate modeling tools suitable for examining connections between individual animal behavior and emergent ecosystem impacts individual based models ibms can be developed as virtual simulation laboratories that allow iterative testing for a variety of ecological scenarios grimm and railsback 2012 in contrast to classical ecological models ibms can connect individual heterogeneity sensing and interaction to emergent patterns at higher levels of biological organization complimentarily movement ecology provides a methodological basis for modeling spatially explicit animal movements in ecological landscapes nathan et al 2008 smouse et al 2010 for instance stochastic movement models have been used to model characteristic animal movement patterns in many taxa by representing animal trajectories as discrete transitions between points in space using statistical distributions of step lengths and turning angles codling et al 2008 moorcroft 2012 correlated random walks crw and lévy walks lw kareiva and shigesada 1983 viswanathan et al 1996 are two dominant stochastic animal movement models that have been used to model animal dispersal search and foraging movements respectively the movement ecology literature is replete with scholarly contention about the relative efficacy of crw and lw models as evolutionarily successful animal dispersal and foraging movement strategies for many species benhamou 2007 reynolds 2015 2008 however spatial subsidy researchers have not examined how active subsidy distributions and corresponding ecosystem effects respond to variation in crw and lw given mortality risk dynamics using ibms with broad parameter spaces to quantify the effects of variation in crw and lw scaling on active subsidy distributions can generate general insights into their relevance for systematically modeling spatial subsidy patterns that emerge from spatially explicit animal dispersal and foraging movements for a variety of taxa and ecosystems developing models to study the relative and interactive influence of movement behavior and mortality on subsidy distributions across a range of dispersal and foraging scenarios can provide a systematic understanding of corresponding ecosystem effects mortality costs during animal dispersal or foraging movements can change with spatiotemporal variation in the distribution of predation risk as well as climatic and environmental conditions fahrig 2007 bastille rousseau et al 2017 predators and prey movements and mortality alter the amount and spatial distribution of consumers and nutrients in recipient ecosystems miller et al 2014 schmitz 2008 vizzini et al 2016 prey can experience spatial variations in predation risk as a function of the distance between refuges in inhospitable landscapes and the degree of antipredator vigilance kristan and boarman 2003 yoder et al 2004 distance dependent and time dependent mortality costs can influence animal foraging and dispersal movements differently zollner and lima 2005 which would subsequently affect active subsidy distribution patterns animals that cover larger areas foraging or dispersing can encounter more predators and inhospitable habitat conditions decesare 2012 similarly high activity levels can increase the risk of detection by predators and energy expenditure in unfavorable habitat conditions schtickzelle et al 2006 martin et al 2015 animals that disperse faster through inhospitable areas can therefore reduce time dependent predation mortality rate with extended activity times but increase distance dependent predation mortality rate by covering more ground in less time yoder et al 2004 depending on the degree of step length variability foraging animals that move using lw can therefore be more or less susceptible to distance dependent than time dependent mortality risks compared to animals with crw dispersal search behavior considering the relative effects of time dependent and distance dependent scenarios of variation in mortality risk with different degrees of step length variability in model constructions can therefore generate valuable insights into connections between animal movement behavior dynamics and active subsidy distribution accounting for living subsidy distributions separately from dead subsidy patterns in ecosystem models of active subsidy distribution could generate valuable insights into corresponding differences in ecosystem impacts e g cross ecosystem transport of amphibian nutrient versus consumption capps et al 2015 living and dead subsidies represent animal transported consumers e g predators parasites and nutrients e g feces carcasses across ecosystem boundaries the relative extent and intensity of animal transported living and dead subsidy distributions refer to the respective displacement and density of corresponding subsidy deposition patterns the extent e g range and intensity e g spread of the spatial deposition patterns in recipient ecosystems could vary between living and dead subsidies as a function of differences in generative animal movement behaviors and mortality risks for instance socially influenced movement behaviors in colonial seabirds could drive subsidy e g feces rich in marine nutrients aggregation and dense local impacts e g high primary productivity at breeding sites garthe et al 2016 similarly territorial aggression among black bears could drive avoidance movements from foraging sites at streams that result in highly displaced marine derived salmon subsidies e g carcasses deep into riparian forests quinn et al 2009 understanding if and how different animal movement and mortality scenarios in landscapes influence the extent and intensity of spatial subsidies could be consequential for enhancing ecosystem models this could improve decision support tools for spatial impact assessments and mitigation strategies in a variety of cross ecosystem management scenarios e g amphibian contaminants and disease transfer zollner and earl 2017 our main goal is to quantify the relative importance and interaction between variation in movement pattern and mortality risk for active subsidy distributions we construct a theoretical ibm with stochastic movement models to investigate how living and dead subsidy distributions change with different animal movement dynamics and mortality scenarios our model simulates and quantifies emergent spatial extents and intensities of active subsidy distributions from a broad parameter space of crw and lw patterns for animal dispersal and foraging movement behaviors with changes in mortality rate the overarching hypothesis is that the range and spread of active consumer and nutrient subsidy distributions change with variations in animal movement patterns and mortality rate and function i e distance dependent versus time dependent crw is used to model dispersal search movement as uniform distributions of successive discrete movements sequentially linked by correlated turning angles and lw is used to model foraging movement with random turning angles scaled by variable step lengths from a heavy tailed power law distribution we examine the interactive effects between movements with different degrees of lw step length variability and mortality assessed as a function of space versus time given the scale invariance of lw patterns movements with more variable step lengths lw will likely deposit subsidies farther and at lower densities than straighter movements crw with stronger effects on living than dead subsidies at higher mortalities we expect higher mortality probabilities to limit subsidy displacement and increase subsidy densities closer to the ecosystem boundary with greater impact for dead subsidies and subsidies from crw compared to living and subsidies from lw respectively 2 methods 2 1 background we built a simulation model to investigate how variations in animal movement patterns and mortality costs impact the distribution of active living and dead subsidies we constructed a simple binary world in which animals initiate movement from a donor ecosystem natal habitat and disperse into a recipient ecosystem adult habitat with a probability of death during movement earl and zollner 2014 this theoretical model applies to many ecological systems including spatial subsidies from amphibian and aquatic insect dispersal and foraging movements in terrestrial landscapes adjacent to source ponds and streams capps et al 2015 dead individuals provide nutrients energy and or prey to the recipient ecosystems possibly influencing bottom up trophic interactions while living individuals provide a consumer subsidy that have potential impacts on top down trophic dynamics in our model individuals could not return to the donor ecosystem after moving into the recipient ecosystem as they undergo ontogenetic or behavioral shifts that are only compatible with the latter habitat this applies to many species that undergo cross ecosystem natal and breeding dispersal e g aquatic insects and amphibians and develop morphological attributes that constrain survival or breeding success in the donor ecosystem bishir et al 2018 blais et al 2005 we made some simplifying assumptions to constrain the modeling process to suit available computer processing speed and storage as well as for conceptual clarity we did not consider life history and demographic processes in our model we assumed that movement and mortality occur at a small enough time scale that we did not have to consider other demographic and life history processes we did not account for direct interaction effects between movement behavior and landscape heterogeneity by assuming that animals move and die in a binary world from a donor to a recipient ecosystem we also assumed that dead individuals represent nutrient energy or contaminant subsidies confined to the location of deposition within the recipient ecosystem to allow us to perform and compare separate analyses of dead and living subsidy distributions another assumption we made is that animals have a constant chance of randomly occurring death with each move and that discrete time is denoted by a single step navigated in the landscape regardless of the rate of movement or distance moved for movement with variable step lengths lw in distance dependent mortality scenarios we assumed that mortality can interact with space as a function of the distance covered per step our spatially explicit individual based model simulation was designed in netlogo version 6 0 4 software tisue and wilensky 2004 and we analyzed data in program r version 3 3 code is available in the online supplementary material section v 2 2 design we simulated a binary universe donor recipient ecosystem with 1000 individuals moving outward from the donor ecosystem into an adjacent recipient ecosystem the simulation environment was a two dimensional 1000 vertical by 2000 horizontal patch i e default unit of square space in netlogo world with the donor ecosystem i e single 1 by 1 patch centered at the west boundary of the world the world is north south wrapped such that dispersers that leave the world at either the north or south boundaries reenter the world at the opposite boundary to replace dispersers that leave the world and maintain a constant population size for comparing resulting subsidy patterns dispersers bounce off the west boundary representing the border between the donor and recipient ecosystem back into the world and the east boundary is far enough from the west that dispersers are unable to travel to the edge during a model run simulation runs were initialized with all individuals randomly distributed at the edge of the donor ecosystem to avoid boundary effects on model behavior we scaled the extent of the simulated world with the rate of disperser movements by allowing individuals moved in the recipient ecosystem over 1000 timesteps we conducted fully factorial simulations of movement and mortality parameter combinations table 1 with ten replicate runs per parameter set mortality can occur for any individual moving in the recipient ecosystem at any timestep we quantified and collected population distribution metrics of living and dead individuals on a per timestep basis but used data values at the 1000th timestep to assess spatial subsidy patterns we assumed that 1000 timesteps marked the end of the dispersal phase into the recipient ecosystem we modeled animal movement behavior as crw and lw using representative statistical distributions of step lengths and turning angle orientations at each timestep individuals select a random step length and turning angle from respective characteristic distributions to navigate from the donor ecosystem outward and rightward through the adjacent recipient ecosystem each individual initiates the first movement at the first timestep to move from the donor ecosystem into the recipient ecosystem without return for duration of the simulation we implemented crw using a constant one unit step length and a wrapped cauchy distribution of degree turning angles θ t in degrees for any given timestep t as θ t θ t 1 2 tan 1 1 α 1 α tan π φ w h e r e 0 α 1 a n d 0 5 φ 0 5 for a previous turning angle of θ t 1 with φ drawn from a delta distribution renshaw and henderson 1981 in 0 5 0 5 to curb orientational bias in disperser movements we simulated a comprehensive range of crw patterns from sinuous to straight movement by varying the correlation coefficient α table 1 crw movement is straighter as α 1 and more sinuous as α 0 we implemented lw using a circular normal turning angle distribution over a range of π π and a truncated inverse power law distribution for the relationship between randomly drawn step lengths p s and the minimum step length s as p s β s 1 u w h e r e 1 μ 3 a n d 0 β 1 using a minimum step length of 1 we modeled an inclusive range of lw patterns from high to low step length variability by changing the scaling exponent μ table 1 lw resembles a purely random walk with near uniform step lengths as μ 3 and simulates scale invariant movement as μ 1 with more variable step lengths we varied the frequency of occurrence of longer step lengths for lw using a normalization constant β where β ε 0 25 0 5 1 with increasing frequency as β 3 we varied the per timestep likelihood of death using three levels of mortality rate m from low to high table 1 individuals draw a random number from a uniform distribution in 0 1 at each timestep and die and stop moving if the number drawn is lower than the assigned simulation mortality level for the simulation run we implemented time dependent mortality for crw and lw as death regardless of step length in distance dependent mortality scenarios we implemented stochastic mortality as a function of lw step length we modeled distance dependent mortality per unit of space i e 1 by 1 patch travelled with each step such that chances of stochastic death increase with step length 2 3 analysis we collected displacement and density metrics of living and dead subsidy distribution patterns for each simulation run to assess the effect of variation in movement behavior and mortality table 1 these response variables included the number of dead subsidies the maximum subsidy deposition distance and range as well as the peak subsidy deposition density and the distance to peak deposition density the maximum deposition distance is the distance to the furthest displaced subsidy from the donor recipient ecosystem boundary the maximum deposition range is the distance between the furthest and least displaced subsidies from the donor ecosystem boundary the peak deposition density is the maximum number of subsidies per density area demarcated by a radius a around each subsidy where ε 25 50 100 the distance to peak density is the distance between the focal subsidy at the location of peak deposition density and the donor recipient ecosystem boundary the density area did not affect the outcomes for subsidy distribution metrics we used classification and regression trees carts breiman et al 2017 and random forest archer and kimes 2008 breiman 2001 analyses to compare the effect of variation in movement patterns and mortality models on spatial subsidy distribution metrics general linear models and other frequentist statistical approaches that require significance testing do not perform well for datasets from individual based model simulation datasets with large sample sizes white et al 2014 high power invariably results in high significance in ibm post hoc analyses machine learning based neural network algorithms like carts and random forests are more useful for examining predictor importance and interaction effects in multivariate datasets from ibm simulations white et al 2014 we used random forest analyses to determine the relative importance of predictors for response variables based on the increase in mean square error and split purity residual sum of squares from a sample of 2000 random forest fits we developed random forest models with random sampling and permutation with bootstrapping and bagging on predictor levels fit to response observations we supported random forest analyses with carts to determine natural breaks splits and likely outcomes in dependent variable observations in response to interactions in movement and mortality predictor level combinations the minimum number of dependent variable observations required for a conditional cart split in response to predictor level combinations was 600 greater than 10 of the total number of observations the minimum number of dependent variable observations required for a conditional cart outcome in response to predictor level combinations was 200 we assigned a complexity parameter cp value of 0 001 to select and retain cart fits with response variable splits on predictor combinations that improve the coefficients of determination for cart models by more than 0 1 we conducted separate analyses on emergent subsidy distributions from variation in crw and lw movement patterns with mortality rate and distance dependent versus time dependent mortality with lw step length variability we synthesized cart trends into charts to do this we grouped carts related to subsidy deposition distance and density metrics into respective displacement and density categories to develop synthesis charts we extracted elements of carts that differentiated between outcomes by a minimum of 10 n 2700 of the total number of observations n 27 000 based on comparable predictor combinations across subsidy distribution metrics in the resulting charts bold lines indicate trends observed in all representative cart figures for each subsidy distribution metric category thin lines indicate trends featured in more than one but not all representative cart figures for each subsidy distribution metric category see supplementary materials for more detailed cart figures figs s2 s4 s6 and s8 3 results living subsidies were generally deposited farther in more spread out distributions than dead subsidies across scenarios of movement pattern and scaling as well as mortality level and function lw movements with more variable step lengths displaced subsidies farther from the ecosystem boundary at lower densities than straighter crw movements and high mortality attenuated displacement effects with more obvious outcomes for dead than living subsidies more sinuous crw movements displaced living subsidies closer to the ecosystem boundary at higher densities than lw movements with less variable step lengths and high mortality further enhanced concentration effects with more pronounced outcomes for dead than living subsidies moderately straight crw resulted in moderate displacement and densities for both living and dead subsidies but generated greater subsidy displacements and densities than lw with intermediate step length variability compared to time dependent mortality high distance dependent mortality interacted with lw movements with more variable step lengths to enhance dead subsidy displacement and density but limit the displacement and density of living subsidies scale coefficient and mortality rate were the most important determinants of subsidy displacement and density respectively fig 1 scale coefficient α v e r s u s μ and overall movement pattern crw versus lw strongly predicted maximum subsidy deposition distance range and peak density distances for living and dead subsidies the relative influence of overall movement pattern and scale coefficient on subsidy displacement varied with mortality rate and function mortality rate and function strongly predicted the peak deposition densities for both living and dead subsidies but the effect of mortality on subsidy densities varied with scale coefficient resulting in different outcomes for living and dead subsidies scale coefficient was more important than mortality for predicting the peak deposition density and distance to peak deposition density for living subsidies mortality was more important than scale coefficient for determining the peak deposition densities but scale coefficient was more important for predicting corresponding distances to peak deposition density for dead subsidies lw scale coefficient strongly predicted the subsidy displacement in both distance dependent and time dependent mortality scenarios but mortality model i e distance dependent versus time dependent was as important as scale coefficient for predicting the peak deposition density for both living and dead subsidies fig 2 dead subsidies were generally deposited closer to the shared ecosystem boundary than living subsidies with stronger effects for lw than crw supplementary information fig s1 lw step length variability had a greater effect on the extent of subsidy displacement than the straightness of crw fig 3 lw with more variable step lengths μ ε 1 0 1 5 displaced living and dead subsidies farther from the donor

ecosystem boundary generating lower maximum deposition distances and ranges than more sinuous crw α ε 0 5 0 8 the locations at which peak density occurred were closer to the ecosystem boundary for dead subsidies than living subsidies lw with more variable step lengths generated greater distances to peak deposition density than straighter crw for living subsidies lw with less variable step lengths resulted in lower distances to peak density for living subsidies than more sinuous crw for dead subsidies straighter crw resulted in greater distances to peak deposition density than lw with more variable step lengths lw with less variable step lengths generated lower overall distances to peak deposition density for dead subsidies than for living subsidies dead subsidies were generally deposited at lower densities closer to the shared ecosystem boundary than living subsidies with stronger effects for lw than crw fig s3 compared to more sinuous crw lw with less variable step lengths resulted in higher subsidy densities that increased with mortality fig 4 lw with less variable step lengths also deposited living subsidies at higher peak densities than more sinuous crw fig s4 given high mortality lw with more variable step lengths deposited living subsidies at lower peak densities than straighter crw in high mortality scenarios more sinuous crw deposited dead subsidies at greater peak deposition densities than lw with less variable step lengths for both living and dead subsidies lw with more variable step lengths and straighter crw generated lower peak deposition densities that further attenuated in low mortality scenarios for living subsidies moderate peak deposition densities resulted from straighter crw compared to intermediate step length variability distance dependent mortality interacted with lw with more variable step lengths to displace subsidies closer to the shared ecosystem boundary than time dependent mortality fig 5 increasing distance dependent mortality however enhanced dead subsidy displacement and attenuated living subsidy displacement fig s5 compared to time dependent mortality distance dependent mortality interacted with lw with more variable step lengths to deposit subsidies at higher densities farther from the ecosystem boundary fig 6 lw with less variable step lengths resulted in lower maximum subsidy deposition distances for both living and dead subsidies fig s6 high mortality in distance dependent scenarios generated lower maximum deposition distances and ranges for living subsidies than time dependent mortality scenarios for lw with more variable step lengths distance dependent mortality resulted in greater maximum subsidy deposition distances and ranges for dead subsidies than time dependent mortality lw with more variable step lengths also deposited living subsidies at greater distances to peak density in distance dependent than time dependent mortality scenarios lw with less variable step lengths generated lower distances to peak deposition density for living subsidies regardless of mortality model dead subsidies were deposited at greater distances to peak density in time dependent compared to distance dependent mortality compared to time dependent mortality distance dependent mortality generally resulted in greater peak subsidy deposition densities fig s7 increasing distance dependent mortality enhanced peak deposition densities for dead subsidies but attenuated peak deposition densities for living subsidies for living subsidies from lw with less variable step lengths distance dependent mortality generated higher peak deposition densities than time dependent mortality fig s8 lw with more variable step lengths resulted in lower peak deposition densities for dead subsidies given high mortality in distance dependent compared to time dependent scenarios lw with more variable step lengths generally resulted in more dead subsidies in distance dependent than time dependent mortality scenarios fig s9 4 discussion we observed differences in the role of movement pattern and mortality on displacement and density of consumer and nutrient subsidies subsidy displacement was most strongly influenced by movement behavior while subsidy concentration was most strongly impacted by mortality this underscores the importance of addressing animal dispersal and foraging movement behavior relative to variation in mortality risk in developing tools to predict animal transported subsidy distributions and corresponding ecosystem impacts earl and zollner 2017 nathan et al 2008 our work models how spatial subsidies might change with a broad parameter space of ecologically plausible movement and mortality scenarios serving as a reference for hypothesis testing in empirical studies future research examining animal transported subsidy deposition extents and ranges can use results from our model to anticipate the relative importance of movement behavior and the nature of mortality risk for a wide variety of case studies callaway and hastings 2002 mortality may be more important than movement for modeling nutrient subsidy patterns of relatively small bodied r selected species with high mortality rates and low movement capacities however movement may take precedence over mortality for modeling spatial subsidy patterns of larger bodied k selected species with relatively low mortality rates and long range movements more specifically our work also provides important insights into the distribution of dead subsidies it may be intuitive that straighter movements and movements with more variable step lengths displace and spread consumer subsidies more than sinuous movements and movements in recipient ecosystems however the effect of mortality rate and function on corresponding nutrient subsidy displacement and density patterns are less obvious our findings demonstrate the importance of understanding how active subsidy distribution patterns and ecosystem impacts can respond to interactions between movement behavior dynamics and variation in mortality rate as a function of the distance or time animals move in a landscape our work underscores potential opportunities for using both lw and crw appropriately within a common simulation framework to model and predict emergent animal transported subsidy distribution patterns the established debate regarding the use of lw and crw models for simulating different animal movement strategies like foraging and dispersal reinforces the importance of examining how the underlying mechanisms benhamou 2007 reynolds 2008 might influence spatial subsidy distributions we show that the relative value of simulating animal movement using patterns driven by step length variability lw or the degree of sinuosity crw in spatial subsidy modeling applications can vary between animal activities like foraging and dispersal movement patterns with variable step lengths can be used to model animal subsidy distributions of animal movements from behavioral intermittence bartumeus 2009 humphries et al 2016 such as intermittent foraging during dispersal given animal uncertainty about habitat quality and resource distributions as our model shows we can modulate the degree of step length variability to model different scales of active subsidy distributions emerging from long range dispersal search movements with more variable step lengths with intermittent foraging and habitat selection movements with less variable step lengths given animal uncertainty about resources distributions and patchy habitat quality kölzsch et al 2015 de jager et al 2011 our work shows that using movement patterns with correlation between step angles to model directional search given animal cognition of the distribution of resources and habitat quality in landscapes could be advantageous for instance we can vary the degree of correlation between steps to simulate variations in the scale of active subsidy distributions emanating from migration to known refugia straighter paths and eventual home range establishment or expansion after habitat prospecting and selection more sinuous paths fagan and calabrese 2014 roshier et al 2008 crw has been used to approximate animal space use and dispersal movement for a variety of species smouse et al 2010 atwood et al 2016 lw has also been used to describe variations in animal movement behavior in various species specific case studies in movement ecology research auger méthé et al 2015 avgar et al 2013 implementing crw and lw in a shared modeling framework to compare and contrast them can identify the most appropriate model for describing different animal movement behaviors in empirical and theoretical studies of active subsidy distribution we found that more sinuous movements interacted with increasing mortality to increase corresponding nutrient subsidy densities over smaller areas closer to the ecosystem boundary our results also show that increased mortality rates can constrain the displacement and spread of corresponding nutrient subsidies with more pronounced effects on straighter dispersal movements than foraging movement patterns with highly variable step lengths our results also provide a starting point for simulating the effect of animal movement on subsidy distributions across the range of parameter space we investigated the systematic approach we used can serve as a template for spatial subsidy researchers who wish to develop case specific simulations of active subsidy distributions across taxa and ecosystems for example seabird and sea turtle prospecting movements in terrestrial breeding habitats for suitable nesting sites have been simulated using crw hart et al 2013 garthe et al 2016 seabird and sea turtle nesting colonies deposit many eggs that can be significant nutrient subsidies for plants and animals in terrestrial breeding habitats vander zanden et al 2012 it might therefore be useful to conceptualize spatial egg deposition patterns at terrestrial breeding sites as outcomes of more sinuous seabird and sea turtle prospecting movement patterns similarly seabird and sea turtle hatchlings disperse from terrestrial breeding and nesting sites across the ocean foraging at variable distances over vast ranges seabirds act as significant consumer subsidies for prey these movements have been approximated with power law distributions sims et al 2008 spatial subsidy researchers could therefore investigate spatial distributions of emergent seabird and sea turtle neonate distributions as consumer subsidies from terrestrial nesting sites to adjacent oceans based on movement patterns with more variable step lengths animals that move with more variable step lengths displace and spread consumer subsidies over greater areas with reduced local impacts on recipient ecosystems compared to straighter movements telemetry derived bear home range prospecting and foraging movement data has been approximated with lévy like patterns and modeled as a mixed random walk gautestad et al 1995 salmon derived nutrient subsidies to forest ecosystems in bear feces and salmon carcasses supplement scavenger and detritivore consumption with considerable consequences for plant nitrogen uptake at widespread deposition locations helfield and naiman 2006 bears deposit salmon carcasses at higher concentrations in riparian forest zones quinn et al 2009 bears also track spatial variation in salmon phenology at variable distances at the watershed scale deacy et al 2016 it would be appropriate to consider corresponding dynamic nutrient subsidy distributions of bear transported salmon carcasses in riparian forests based on sinuous bear movement patterns with less variable step lengths empirical isotope analysis data indicates that bears also deposit feces rich in salmon nutrients at differential distances augmenting plant nitrogen uptake deep into forests swain and reynolds 2015 predicting corresponding nutrient subsidy distributions and scales of ecosystem impact may require using movement patterns with more variable step lengths to simulate bear foraging movements in case studies on the spatial scale and impact of bear derived salmon nutrient subsidies our results also demonstrated that movements with more variable step lengths deposited more nutrient subsidies at lower densities in distance dependent compared to time dependent mortality scenarios given high mortality in distance dependent instead of time dependent mortality scenarios we observed that consumer subsidy impact increased with step length variability increasing step length variability however enhanced the number of nutrient subsidies while attenuating corresponding impact compared to time dependent mortality distance dependent mortality enhanced the displacement extents of nutrient subsidies while constraining the displacement of consumer subsidies with higher step length variability in distance dependent but not time dependent mortality scenarios movement patterns with more variable step lengths displaced the location of greatest impact farther from the ecosystem boundary for consumer than for nutrient subsidies these results are consistent with other observations of sporadic high intensity mortality events occurring at exposed locations of high predation risks across landscapes kittle et al 2015 rees et al 2015 it is important to distinguish between distance dependent and time dependent mortality in spatially explicit active subsidy distribution models to improve the prediction accuracy of resulting spatial subsidy impact patterns in response to mortality events and corresponding ecosystem effects in landscape management settings variations in the impact of nutrient resources between spatial distributions of distance dependent and time dependent mortality events can provide ecological cues that affect the distribution of predators and prey resources distance dependent mortality can occur when animals move through landscapes with limited information or high uncertainty about predation risk or inhospitable habitat conditions wildebeest and other ungulate herbivores are substantial and expansive consumer subsidies across serengeti ecosystems but also contribute significant nutrient subsidies for apex predators with significant top down trophic benefits for mesopredators and scavengers wildebeest collectively migrate and forage along variable spatiotemporal precipitation regimes and patchy grass and forbs resource gradients in the serengeti holdo et al 2009 this results in movements of high step length variability and corresponding sporadic distance dependent mortality rates from starvation or predation by apex predators like lions and crocodiles over vast distances along migration routes and around pond refugia in the serengeti landscape palmer et al 2017 it would be appropriate for subsidy researchers to think of spatial variation in grass cover depressions as outcomes of consumer subsidies and carrion from mortality events as nutrient subsidies for scavengers and plants as wildebeest forage during migration along variable precipitation and grass cover regimes in the serengeti we developed a minimalist theoretical model ibm to quantify active subsidy distribution dynamics in response to variation in movement and mortality but future work could increase realism with features like landscape heterogeneity and variation in environmental factors wallentin 2017 species specific attributes that can be added to active subsidy distribution models to enhance realism include alternative search strategies e g foray loops archimedean spirals zollner and lima 1999 and other factors that influence animal movement like perceptual range grant et al 2018 antipredator vigilance as well as conspecific and interspecific interactions fletcher 2006 another advancement could be to model the role of movement modality e g flying slithering and the quality of subsidy deposition as function of animal body size the distribution of consumer and nutrient subsidies can differ greatly for the same species with consequences for top down versus bottom up effects relative to the body size and navigation mode some big animals with large movements can deposit larger amounts of both consumer and nutrient subsidies over more expansive areas than smaller animals doughty et al 2016 ecosystem models of spatial subsides can provide more refined insights in nutrient subsidy distribution dynamics by accounting for spatial transience of mortality events like the secondary movement and relocation of dead prey by predators or scavengers feces and secondary displacements could occur more frequently than direct mortality events potentially resulting in different spatiotemporal scales of corresponding nutrient subsidy distributions it would be interesting to examine the differences between distance dependent and time dependent mortality effects on active subsidy distributions by comparing nutrient subsidy deposition patterns from direct mortality to those from fecal matter or carcasses dragged and relocated by scavenger movements our model could be further developed and parameterized with empirical research grimm et al 2012 on emergent amphibian and aquatic insect consumer and nutrient subsidies from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems however parameterization efforts will require careful consideration of differences in species and context specific e g foraging dispersal homing movement patterns from animal interactions e g sociality versus territoriality and spatial heterogeneity in landscape structure e g primary resource and mortality risk distributions 5 conclusion predicting the location and impact of active subsidies is useful for making critical decisions to preserve ecosystem integrity enhance species and biodiversity conservation efforts and implement effective landscape management practices across spatiotemporal scales raikow et al 2011 subsidies have significant implications for determining the structure and function of ecological communities and thus ecosystem services including nutrient cycling metapopulation persistence and connectivity as factors in species conservation as well as biodiversity maintenance allen et al 2012 our model results underscore the importance of movement ecology for predicting the spatial distribution and impact of active subsidies we show that changing animal movement behavior and scaling patterns as well as the mortality rate and function can lead to variations in active subsidy distribution and impact our

24968,active subsidies are animal transported consumption e g predators pathogens parasites and resources e g prey detritus nutrients moved between ecosystems animal movement behavior has the potential to mediate the extent and intensity of active subsidies and corresponding ecosystem responses animal movement behaviors could interact with mortality risk to affect active subsidy distributions and ecosystem impacts but have rarely been examined in existing ecosystem models of spatial subsidies movement ecologists typically simulate animal dispersal and foraging movements using stochastic random walk models such as correlated random walk crw and lévy walk lw models movement models generally implement mortality as an instantaneous mortality rate i e probability of death per step variation in crw and lw movement patterns in combination with mortality rate level and model can likely change emergent subsidy distributions and impact using a spatially explicit individual

between animal movement behavior and mortality conditions will enhance insights into active subsidy distributions keywords active subsidies animal movement mortality individual based models 1

producers minerals and nutrients in feces and detritus and consumers e g predators pathogens and parasites between ecosystems as ecological subsidies polis et al 1997 active subsidies are resources or consumers displaced by animal movement between a donor and a recipient ecosystem earl and zollner 2017 mcinturf et al 2019 and are different from passive subsidies which are moved by wind and water

movements on corresponding spatial subsidy patterns and impacts e g cross ecosystem contaminant transfer and nutrient export earl and zollner 2017 mcinturf et al 2019 while there are examples of empirical studies that address active subsidies for single taxa in specific ecosystems moon and silva 2013 schindler and smits 2017 there are no systematic models that elucidate general principles of how spatially explicit animal movements influence active subsidy distributions but see earl and zollner 2014 further existing ecosystem models are generally inadequate for investigating active subsidy systems because they treat movement and or space implicitly scharf et al 2018 however animal movement and space use behavior can differ among ecological processes like foraging dispersal and migration jeltsch et al 2013 generating corresponding variations in spatial subsidy patterns and impacts modeling frameworks that do not systematically account for how spatial subsidy patterns emerge from animal movements limit the development of predictive models of corresponding impacts for a broad range of taxa and ecosystems spatial subsidy research can improve by integrating individual based and movement ecology to generate modeling tools suitable for examining connections between individual animal behavior and emergent ecosystem impacts individual based models ibms can be developed as virtual simulation laboratories that allow iterative testing for a variety of ecological scenarios grimm and railsback 2012 in contrast to classical ecological models ibms can connect individual heterogeneity sensing and interaction to emergent patterns at higher levels of biological organization complimentarily movement ecology provides a methodological basis for modeling spatially explicit animal movements in ecological landscapes nathan et al 2008 smouse et al 2010 for instance stochastic movement models have been used to model characteristic animal movement patterns in many taxa by representing animal trajectories as discrete transitions between points in space using statistical distributions of step lengths and turning angles codling et al 2008 moorcroft 2012 correlated random walks crw and lévy walks lw kareiva and shigesada 1983 viswanathan et al 1996 are two dominant stochastic animal movement models that have been used to model animal dispersal search and foraging movements respectively the movement ecology literature is replete with scholarly contention about the relative efficacy of crw and lw models as evolutionarily successful animal dispersal and foraging movement strategies for many species benhamou 2007 reynolds 2015 2008 however spatial subsidy researchers have not examined how active subsidy distributions and corresponding ecosystem effects respond to variation in crw and lw given mortality risk dynamics using ibms with broad parameter spaces to quantify the effects of variation in crw and lw scaling on active subsidy distributions can generate general insights into their relevance for systematically modeling spatial subsidy patterns that emerge from spatially explicit animal dispersal and foraging movements for a variety of taxa and ecosystems developing models to study the relative and interactive influence of movement behavior and mortality on subsidy distributions across a range of dispersal and foraging scenarios can provide a systematic understanding of corresponding ecosystem effects mortality costs during animal dispersal or foraging movements can change with spatiotemporal variation in the distribution of predation risk as well as climatic and environmental conditions fahrig 2007 bastille rousseau et al 2017 predators and prey movements and mortality alter the amount and spatial distribution of consumers and nutrients in recipient ecosystems miller et al 2014 schmitz 2008 vizzini et al 2016 prey can experience spatial variations in predation risk as a function of the distance between refuges in inhospitable landscapes and the degree of antipredator vigilance kristan and boarman 2003 yoder et al 2004 distance dependent and time dependent mortality costs can influence animal foraging and dispersal movements differently zollner and lima 2005 which would subsequently affect active subsidy distribution patterns animals that cover larger areas foraging or dispersing can encounter more predators and inhospitable habitat conditions decesare 2012 similarly high activity levels can increase the risk of detection by predators and energy expenditure in unfavorable habitat conditions schtickzelle et al 2006 martin et al 2015 animals that disperse faster through inhospitable areas can therefore reduce time dependent predation mortality rate with extended activity times but increase distance dependent predation mortality rate by covering more ground in less time yoder et al 2004 depending on the degree of step length variability foraging animals that move using lw can therefore be more or less susceptible to distance dependent than time dependent mortality risks compared to animals with crw dispersal search behavior considering the relative effects of time dependent and distance dependent scenarios of variation in mortality risk with different degrees of step length variability in model constructions can therefore generate valuable insights into connections between animal movement behavior dynamics and active subsidy distribution accounting for living subsidy distributions separately from dead subsidy patterns in ecosystem models of active subsidy distribution could generate valuable insights into corresponding differences in ecosystem impacts e g cross ecosystem transport of amphibian nutrient versus consumption capps et al 2015 living and dead subsidies represent animal transported consumers e g predators parasites and nutrients e g feces carcasses across ecosystem boundaries the relative extent and intensity of animal transported living and dead subsidy distributions refer to the respective displacement and density of corresponding subsidy deposition patterns the extent e g range and intensity e g spread of the spatial deposition patterns in recipient ecosystems could vary between living and dead subsidies as a function of differences in generative animal movement behaviors and mortality risks for instance socially influenced movement behaviors in colonial seabirds could drive subsidy e g feces rich in marine nutrients aggregation and dense local impacts e g high primary productivity at breeding sites garthe et al 2016 similarly territorial aggression among black bears could drive avoidance movements from foraging sites at streams that result in highly displaced marine derived salmon subsidies e g carcasses deep into riparian forests quinn et al 2009 understanding if and how different animal movement and mortality scenarios in landscapes influence the extent and intensity of spatial subsidies could be consequential for enhancing ecosystem models this could improve decision support tools for spatial impact assessments and mitigation strategies in a variety of cross ecosystem management scenarios e g amphibian contaminants and disease transfer zollner and earl 2017 our main goal is to quantify the relative importance and interaction between variation in movement pattern and mortality risk for active subsidy distributions we construct a theoretical ibm with stochastic movement models to investigate how living and dead subsidy distributions change with different animal movement dynamics and mortality scenarios our model simulates and quantifies emergent spatial extents and intensities of active subsidy distributions from a broad parameter space of crw and lw patterns for animal dispersal and foraging movement behaviors with changes in mortality rate the overarching hypothesis is that the range and spread of active consumer and nutrient subsidy distributions change with variations in animal movement patterns and mortality rate and function i e distance dependent versus time dependent crw is used to model dispersal search movement as uniform distributions of successive discrete movements sequentially linked by correlated turning angles and lw is used to model foraging movement with random turning angles scaled by variable step lengths from a heavy tailed power law distribution we examine the interactive effects between movements with different degrees of lw step length variability and mortality assessed as a function of space versus time given the scale invariance of lw patterns movements with more variable step lengths lw will likely deposit subsidies farther and at lower densities than straighter movements crw with stronger effects on living than dead subsidies at higher mortalities we expect higher mortality probabilities to limit subsidy displacement and increase subsidy densities closer to the ecosystem boundary with greater impact for dead subsidies and subsidies from crw compared to living and subsidies from lw respectively 2 methods 2 1 background we built a simulation model to investigate how variations in animal movement patterns and mortality costs impact the distribution of active living and dead subsidies we constructed a simple binary world in which animals initiate movement from a donor ecosystem natal habitat and disperse into a recipient ecosystem adult habitat with a probability of death during movement earl and zollner 2014 this theoretical model applies to many ecological systems including spatial subsidies from amphibian and aquatic insect dispersal and foraging movements in terrestrial landscapes adjacent to source ponds and streams capps et al 2015 dead individuals provide nutrients energy and or prey to the recipient ecosystems possibly influencing bottom up trophic interactions while living individuals provide a consumer subsidy that have potential impacts on top down trophic dynamics in our model individuals could not return to the donor ecosystem after moving into the recipient ecosystem as they undergo ontogenetic or behavioral shifts that are only compatible with the latter habitat this applies to many species that undergo cross ecosystem natal and breeding dispersal e g aquatic insects and amphibians and develop morphological attributes that constrain survival or breeding success in the donor ecosystem bishir et al 2018 blais et al 2005 we made some simplifying assumptions to constrain the modeling process to suit available computer processing speed and storage as well as for conceptual clarity we did not consider life history and demographic processes in our model we assumed that movement and mortality occur at a small enough time scale that we did not have to consider other demographic and life history processes we did not account for direct interaction effects between movement behavior and landscape heterogeneity by assuming that animals move and die in a binary world from a donor to a recipient ecosystem we also assumed that dead individuals represent nutrient energy or contaminant subsidies confined to the location of deposition within the recipient ecosystem to allow us to perform and compare separate analyses of dead and living subsidy distributions another assumption we made is that animals have a constant chance of randomly occurring death with each move and that discrete time is denoted by a single step navigated in the landscape regardless of the rate of movement or distance moved for movement with variable step lengths lw in distance dependent mortality scenarios we assumed that mortality can interact with space as a function of the distance covered per step our spatially explicit individual based model simulation was designed in netlogo version 6 0 4 software tisue and wilensky 2004 and we analyzed data in program r version 3 3 code is available in the online supplementary material section v 2 2 design we simulated a binary universe donor recipient ecosystem with 1000 individuals moving outward from the donor ecosystem into an adjacent recipient ecosystem the simulation environment was a two dimensional 1000 vertical by 2000 horizontal patch i e default unit of square space in netlogo world with the donor ecosystem i e single 1 by 1 patch centered at the west boundary of the world the world is north south wrapped such that dispersers that leave the world at either the north or south boundaries reenter the world at the opposite boundary to replace dispersers that leave the world and maintain a constant population size for comparing resulting subsidy patterns dispersers bounce off the west boundary representing the border between the donor and recipient ecosystem back into the world and the east boundary is far enough from the west that dispersers are unable to travel to the edge during a model run simulation runs were initialized with all individuals randomly distributed at the edge of the donor ecosystem to avoid boundary effects on model behavior we scaled the extent of the simulated world with the rate of disperser movements by allowing individuals moved in the recipient ecosystem over 1000 timesteps we conducted fully factorial simulations of movement and mortality parameter combinations table 1 with ten replicate runs per parameter set mortality can occur for any individual moving in the recipient ecosystem at any timestep we quantified and collected population distribution metrics of living and dead individuals on a per timestep basis but used data values at the 1000th timestep to assess spatial subsidy patterns we assumed that 1000 timesteps marked the end of the dispersal phase into the recipient ecosystem we modeled animal movement behavior as crw and lw using representative statistical distributions of step lengths and turning angle orientations at each timestep individuals select a random step length and turning angle from respective characteristic distributions to navigate from the donor ecosystem outward and rightward through the adjacent recipient ecosystem each individual initiates the first movement at the first timestep to move from the donor ecosystem into the recipient ecosystem without return for duration of the simulation we implemented crw using a constant one unit step length and a wrapped cauchy distribution of degree turning angles θ t in degrees for any given timestep t as θ t θ t 1 2 tan 1 1 α 1 α tan π φ w h e r e 0 α 1 a n d 0 5 φ 0 5 for a previous turning angle of θ t 1 with φ drawn from a delta distribution renshaw and henderson 1981 in 0 5 0 5 to curb orientational bias in disperser movements we simulated a comprehensive range of crw patterns from sinuous to straight movement by varying the correlation coefficient α table 1 crw movement is straighter as α 1 and more sinuous as α 0 we implemented lw using a circular normal turning angle distribution over a range of π π and a truncated inverse power law distribution for the relationship between randomly drawn step lengths p s and the minimum step length s as p s β s 1 u w h e r e 1 μ 3 a n d 0 β 1 using a minimum step length of 1 we modeled an inclusive range of lw patterns from high to low step length variability by changing the scaling exponent μ table 1 lw resembles a purely random walk with near uniform step lengths as μ 3 and simulates scale invariant movement as μ 1 with more variable step lengths we varied the frequency of occurrence of longer step lengths for lw using a normalization constant β where β ε 0 25 0 5 1 with increasing frequency as β 3 we varied the per timestep likelihood of death using three levels of mortality rate m from low to high table 1 individuals draw a random number from a uniform distribution in 0 1 at each timestep and die and stop moving if the number drawn is lower than the assigned simulation mortality level for the simulation run we implemented time dependent mortality for crw and lw as death regardless of step length in distance dependent mortality scenarios we implemented stochastic mortality as a function of lw step length we modeled distance dependent mortality per unit of space i e 1 by 1 patch travelled with each step such that chances of stochastic death increase with step length 2 3 analysis we collected displacement and density metrics of living and dead subsidy distribution patterns for each simulation run to assess the effect of variation in movement behavior and mortality table 1 these response variables included the number of dead subsidies the maximum subsidy deposition distance and range as well as the peak subsidy deposition density and the distance to peak deposition density the maximum deposition distance is the distance to the furthest displaced subsidy from the donor recipient ecosystem boundary the maximum deposition range is the distance between the furthest and least displaced subsidies from the donor ecosystem boundary the peak deposition density is the maximum number of subsidies per density area demarcated by a radius a around each subsidy where ε 25 50 100 the distance to peak density is the distance between the focal subsidy at the location of peak deposition density and the donor recipient ecosystem boundary the density area did not affect the outcomes for subsidy distribution metrics we used classification and regression trees carts breiman et al 2017 and random forest archer and kimes 2008 breiman 2001 analyses to compare the effect of variation in movement patterns and mortality models on spatial subsidy distribution metrics general linear models and other frequentist statistical approaches that require significance testing do not perform well for datasets from individual based model simulation datasets with large sample sizes white et al 2014 high power invariably results in high significance in ibm post hoc analyses machine learning based neural network algorithms like carts and random forests are more useful for examining predictor importance and interaction effects in multivariate datasets from ibm simulations white et al 2014 we used random forest analyses to determine the relative importance of predictors for response variables based on the increase in mean square error and split purity residual sum of squares from a sample of 2000 random forest fits we developed random forest models with random sampling and permutation with bootstrapping and bagging on predictor levels fit to response observations we supported random forest analyses with carts to determine natural breaks splits and likely outcomes in dependent variable observations in response to interactions in movement and mortality predictor level combinations the minimum number of dependent variable observations required for a conditional cart split in response to predictor level combinations was 600 greater than 10 of the total number of observations the minimum number of dependent variable observations required for a conditional cart outcome in response to predictor level combinations was 200 we assigned a complexity parameter cp value of 0 001 to select and retain cart fits with response variable splits on predictor combinations that improve the coefficients of determination for cart models by more than 0 1 we conducted separate analyses on emergent subsidy distributions from variation in crw and lw movement patterns with mortality rate and distance dependent versus time dependent mortality with lw step length variability we synthesized cart trends into charts to do this we grouped carts related to subsidy deposition distance and density metrics into respective displacement and density categories to develop synthesis charts we extracted elements of carts that differentiated between outcomes by a minimum of 10 n 2700 of the total number of observations n 27 000 based on comparable predictor combinations across subsidy distribution metrics in the resulting charts bold lines indicate trends observed in all representative cart figures for each subsidy distribution metric category thin lines indicate trends featured in more than one but not all representative cart figures for each subsidy distribution metric category see supplementary materials for more detailed cart figures figs s2 s4 s6 and s8 3 results living subsidies were generally deposited farther in more spread out distributions than dead subsidies across scenarios of movement pattern and scaling as well as mortality level and function lw movements with more variable step lengths displaced subsidies farther from the ecosystem boundary at lower densities than straighter crw movements and high mortality attenuated displacement effects with more obvious outcomes for dead than living subsidies more sinuous crw movements displaced living subsidies closer to the ecosystem boundary at higher densities than lw movements with less variable step lengths and high mortality further enhanced concentration effects with more pronounced outcomes for dead than living subsidies moderately straight crw resulted in moderate displacement and densities for both living and dead subsidies but generated greater subsidy displacements and densities than lw with intermediate step length variability compared to time dependent mortality high distance dependent mortality interacted with lw movements with more variable step lengths to enhance dead subsidy displacement and density but limit the displacement and density of living subsidies scale coefficient and mortality rate were the most important determinants of subsidy displacement and density respectively fig 1 scale coefficient α v e r s u s μ and overall movement pattern crw versus lw strongly predicted maximum subsidy deposition distance range and peak density distances for living and dead subsidies the relative influence of overall movement pattern and scale coefficient on subsidy displacement varied with mortality rate and function mortality rate and function strongly predicted the peak deposition densities for both living and dead subsidies but the effect of mortality on subsidy densities varied with scale coefficient resulting in different outcomes for living and dead subsidies scale coefficient was more important than mortality for predicting the peak deposition density and distance to peak deposition density for living subsidies mortality was more important than scale coefficient for determining the peak deposition densities but scale coefficient was more important for predicting corresponding distances to peak deposition density for dead subsidies lw scale coefficient strongly predicted the subsidy displacement in both distance dependent and time dependent mortality scenarios but mortality model i e distance dependent versus time dependent was as important as scale coefficient for predicting the peak deposition density for both living and dead subsidies fig 2 dead subsidies were generally deposited closer to the shared ecosystem boundary than living subsidies with stronger effects for lw than crw supplementary information fig s1 lw step length variability had a

more variable step lengths lw with less variable step lengths generated lower overall distances to peak deposition density for dead subsidies than for living subsidies dead subsidies were generally deposited at lower densities closer to the shared ecosystem boundary than living subsidies with stronger effects for lw than crw fig s3 compared to more sinuous crw lw with less variable step lengths resulted in higher subsidy densities that increased with mortality fig 4 lw with less variable step lengths also deposited living subsidies at higher peak densities than more sinuous crw fig s4 given high mortality lw with more variable step lengths deposited living subsidies at lower peak densities than straighter crw in high mortality scenarios more sinuous crw deposited dead subsidies at greater peak deposition densities than lw with less variable step lengths for both living and dead subsidies lw with more variable step lengths and straighter crw generated lower peak deposition densities that further attenuated in low mortality scenarios for living subsidies moderate peak deposition densities resulted from straighter crw compared to intermediate step length variability distance dependent mortality interacted with lw with more variable step lengths to displace subsidies closer to the shared ecosystem boundary than time dependent mortality fig 5 increasing distance dependent mortality however enhanced dead subsidy displacement and attenuated living subsidy displacement fig s5 compared to time dependent mortality distance dependent mortality interacted with lw with more variable step lengths to deposit subsidies at higher densities farther from the ecosystem boundary fig 6 lw with less variable step lengths resulted in lower maximum subsidy deposition distances for both living and dead subsidies fig s6 high mortality in distance dependent scenarios generated lower maximum deposition distances and ranges for living subsidies than time dependent mortality scenarios for lw with more variable step lengths distance dependent mortality resulted in greater maximum subsidy deposition distances and ranges for dead subsidies than time dependent mortality lw with more variable step lengths also deposited living subsidies at greater distances to peak density in distance dependent than time dependent mortality scenarios lw with less variable step lengths generated lower distances to peak deposition density for living subsidies regardless of mortality model dead subsidies were deposited at greater distances to peak density in time dependent compared to distance dependent mortality compared to time dependent mortality distance dependent mortality generally resulted in greater peak subsidy deposition densities fig s7 increasing distance dependent mortality enhanced peak deposition densities for dead subsidies but attenuated peak deposition densities for living subsidies for living subsidies from lw with less variable step lengths distance dependent mortality generated higher peak deposition densities than time dependent mortality fig s8 lw with more variable step lengths resulted in lower peak deposition densities for dead subsidies given high mortality in distance dependent compared to time dependent scenarios lw with more variable step lengths generally resulted in more dead subsidies in distance dependent than time dependent mortality scenarios fig s9 4 discussion we observed differences in the role of movement pattern and mortality on displacement and density of consumer and nutrient subsidies subsidy displacement was most strongly influenced by movement behavior while subsidy concentration was most strongly impacted by mortality this underscores the importance of addressing animal dispersal and foraging movement behavior relative to variation in mortality risk in developing tools to predict animal transported subsidy distributions and corresponding ecosystem impacts earl and zollner 2017 nathan et al 2008 our work models how spatial subsidies might change with a broad parameter space of ecologically plausible movement and mortality scenarios serving as a reference for hypothesis testing in empirical studies future research examining animal transported subsidy deposition extents and ranges can use results from our model to anticipate the relative importance of movement behavior and the nature of mortality risk for a wide variety of case studies callaway and hastings 2002 mortality may be more important than movement for modeling nutrient subsidy patterns of relatively small bodied r selected species with high mortality rates and low movement capacities however movement may take precedence over mortality for modeling spatial subsidy patterns of larger bodied k selected species with relatively low mortality rates and long range movements more specifically our work also provides important insights into the distribution of dead subsidies it may be intuitive that straighter movements and movements with more variable step lengths displace and spread consumer subsidies more than sinuous movements and movements in recipient ecosystems however the effect of mortality rate and function on corresponding nutrient subsidy displacement and density patterns are less obvious our findings demonstrate the importance of understanding how active subsidy distribution patterns and ecosystem impacts can respond to interactions between movement behavior dynamics and variation in mortality rate as a function of the distance or time animals move in a landscape our work underscores potential opportunities for using both lw and crw appropriately within a common simulation framework to model and predict emergent animal transported subsidy distribution patterns the established debate regarding the use of lw and crw models for simulating different animal movement strategies like foraging and dispersal reinforces the importance of examining how the underlying mechanisms benhamou 2007 reynolds 2008 might influence spatial subsidy distributions we show that the relative value of simulating animal movement using patterns driven by step length variability lw or the degree of sinuosity crw in spatial subsidy modeling applications can vary between animal activities like foraging and dispersal movement patterns with variable step lengths can be used to model animal subsidy distributions of animal movements from behavioral intermittence bartumeus 2009 humphries et al 2016 such as intermittent foraging during dispersal given animal uncertainty about habitat quality and resource distributions as our model shows we can modulate the degree of step length variability to model different scales of active subsidy distributions emerging from long range dispersal search movements with more variable step lengths with intermittent foraging and habitat selection movements with less variable step lengths given animal uncertainty about resources distributions and patchy habitat quality kölzsch et al 2015 de jager et al 2011 our work shows that using movement patterns with correlation between step angles to model directional search given animal cognition of the distribution of resources and habitat quality in landscapes could be advantageous for instance we can vary the degree of correlation between steps to simulate variations in the scale of active subsidy distributions emanating from migration to known refugia straighter paths and eventual home range establishment or expansion after habitat prospecting and selection more sinuous paths fagan and calabrese 2014 roshier et al 2008 crw has been used to approximate animal space use and dispersal movement for a variety of species smouse et al 2010 atwood et al 2016 lw has also been used to describe variations in animal movement behavior in various species specific case studies in movement ecology research auger méthé et al 2015 avgar et al 2013 implementing crw and lw in a shared modeling framework to compare and contrast them can identify the most appropriate model for describing different animal movement behaviors in empirical and theoretical studies of active subsidy distribution we found that more sinuous movements interacted with increasing mortality to increase corresponding nutrient subsidy densities over smaller areas closer to the ecosystem boundary our results also show that increased mortality rates can constrain the displacement and spread of corresponding nutrient subsidies with more pronounced effects on straighter dispersal movements than foraging movement patterns with highly variable step lengths our results also provide a starting point for simulating the effect of animal movement on subsidy distributions across the range of parameter space we investigated the systematic approach we used can serve as a template for spatial subsidy researchers who wish to develop case specific simulations of active subsidy distributions across taxa and ecosystems for example seabird and sea turtle prospecting movements in terrestrial breeding habitats for suitable nesting sites have been simulated using crw hart et al 2013 garthe et al 2016 seabird and sea turtle nesting colonies deposit many eggs that can be significant nutrient subsidies for plants and animals in terrestrial breeding habitats vander zanden et al 2012 it might therefore be useful to conceptualize spatial egg deposition patterns at terrestrial breeding sites as outcomes of more sinuous seabird and sea turtle prospecting movement patterns similarly seabird and sea turtle hatchlings disperse from terrestrial breeding and nesting sites across the ocean foraging at variable distances over vast ranges seabirds act as significant consumer subsidies for prey these movements have been approximated with power law distributions sims et al 2008 spatial subsidy researchers could therefore investigate spatial distributions of emergent seabird and sea turtle neonate distributions as consumer subsidies from terrestrial nesting sites to adjacent oceans based on movement patterns with more variable step lengths animals that move with more variable step lengths displace and spread consumer subsidies over greater areas with reduced local impacts on recipient ecosystems compared to straighter movements telemetry derived bear home range prospecting and foraging movement data has been approximated with lévy like patterns and modeled as a mixed random walk gautestad et al 1995 salmon derived nutrient subsidies to forest ecosystems in bear feces and salmon carcasses supplement scavenger and detritivore consumption with considerable consequences for plant nitrogen uptake at widespread deposition locations helfield and naiman 2006 bears deposit salmon carcasses at higher concentrations in riparian forest zones quinn et al 2009 bears also track spatial variation in salmon phenology at variable distances at the watershed scale deacy et al 2016 it would be appropriate to consider corresponding dynamic nutrient subsidy distributions of bear transported salmon carcasses in riparian forests based on sinuous bear movement patterns with less variable step lengths empirical isotope analysis data indicates that bears also deposit feces rich in salmon nutrients at differential distances augmenting plant nitrogen uptake deep into forests swain and reynolds 2015 predicting corresponding nutrient subsidy distributions and scales of ecosystem impact may require using movement patterns with more variable step lengths to simulate bear foraging movements in case studies on the spatial scale and impact of bear derived salmon nutrient subsidies our results also demonstrated that movements with more variable step lengths deposited more nutrient subsidies at lower densities in distance dependent compared to time dependent mortality scenarios given high mortality in distance dependent instead of time dependent mortality scenarios we observed that consumer subsidy impact increased with step length variability increasing step length variability however enhanced the number of nutrient subsidies while attenuating corresponding impact compared to time dependent mortality distance dependent mortality enhanced the displacement extents of nutrient subsidies while constraining the displacement of consumer subsidies with higher step length variability in distance dependent but not time dependent mortality scenarios movement patterns with more variable step lengths displaced the location of greatest impact farther from the ecosystem boundary for consumer than for nutrient subsidies these results are consistent with other observations of sporadic high intensity mortality events occurring at exposed locations of high predation risks across landscapes kittle et al 2015 rees et al 2015 it is important to distinguish between distance dependent and time dependent mortality in spatially explicit active subsidy distribution models to improve the prediction accuracy of resulting spatial subsidy impact patterns in response to mortality events and corresponding ecosystem effects in landscape management settings variations in the impact of nutrient resources between spatial distributions of distance dependent and time dependent mortality events can provide ecological cues that affect the distribution of predators and prey resources distance dependent mortality can occur when animals move through landscapes with limited information or high uncertainty about predation risk or inhospitable habitat conditions wildebeest and other ungulate herbivores are substantial and expansive consumer subsidies across serengeti ecosystems but also contribute significant nutrient subsidies for apex predators with significant top down trophic benefits for mesopredators and scavengers wildebeest collectively migrate and forage along variable spatiotemporal precipitation regimes and patchy grass and forbs resource gradients in the serengeti holdo et al 2009 this results in movements of high step length variability and corresponding sporadic distance dependent mortality rates from starvation or predation by apex predators like lions and crocodiles over vast distances along migration routes and around pond refugia in the serengeti landscape palmer et al 2017 it would be appropriate for subsidy researchers to think of spatial variation in grass cover depressions as outcomes of consumer subsidies and carrion from mortality events as nutrient subsidies for scavengers and plants as wildebeest forage during migration along variable precipitation and grass cover regimes in the serengeti we developed a minimalist theoretical model ibm to quantify active subsidy distribution dynamics in response to variation in movement and mortality but future work could increase realism with features like landscape heterogeneity and variation in environmental factors wallentin 2017 species specific attributes that can be added to active subsidy distribution models to enhance realism include alternative search strategies e g foray loops archimedean spirals zollner and lima 1999 and other factors that influence animal movement like perceptual range grant et al 2018 antipredator vigilance as well as conspecific and interspecific interactions fletcher 2006 another advancement could be to model the role of movement modality e g flying slithering and the quality of subsidy deposition as function of animal body size the distribution of consumer and nutrient subsidies can differ greatly for the same species with consequences for top down versus bottom up effects relative to the body size and navigation mode some big animals with large movements can deposit larger amounts of both consumer and nutrient subsidies over more expansive areas than smaller animals doughty et al 2016 ecosystem models of spatial subsides can provide more refined insights in nutrient subsidy distribution dynamics by accounting for spatial transience of mortality events like the secondary movement and relocation of dead prey by predators or scavengers feces and secondary displacements could occur more frequently than direct mortality events potentially resulting in different spatiotemporal scales of corresponding nutrient subsidy distributions it would be interesting to examine the differences between distance dependent and time dependent mortality effects on active subsidy distributions by comparing nutrient subsidy deposition patterns from direct mortality to those from fecal matter or carcasses dragged and relocated by scavenger movements our model could be further developed and parameterized with empirical research grimm et al 2012 on emergent amphibian and aquatic insect consumer and nutrient subsidies from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems however parameterization efforts will require careful consideration of differences in species and context specific e g foraging dispersal homing movement patterns from animal interactions e g sociality versus territoriality and spatial heterogeneity in landscape structure e g primary resource and mortality risk distributions 5 conclusion predicting the location and impact of active subsidies is useful for making critical decisions to preserve ecosystem integrity enhance species and biodiversity conservation efforts and implement effective landscape management practices across spatiotemporal scales raikow et al 2011 subsidies have significant implications for determining the structure and function of ecological communities and thus ecosystem services including nutrient cycling metapopulation persistence and connectivity as factors in species conservation as well as biodiversity maintenance allen et al 2012 our model results underscore the importance of movement ecology for predicting the spatial distribution and impact of active subsidies we show that changing animal movement behavior and scaling patterns as well as the mortality rate and function can lead to variations in active subsidy distribution and impact our

24969,possibility of a coexistence of different species is one of the important issues in ecology various mechanism and methods have been proposed to describe biodiversity in this paper we present and discuss a new model describing the tolerance fecundity trade off on a homogeneous habitat as a mechanisms for sustaining biodiversity the model is investigated using two techniques difference equations operating on globally defined functions and computer simulations dealing with individual plants we show that while the first approach excludes the possibility of a coexistence of species the second method allows it we argue that it is the individual treatment of each plant life history which allows for coexistence while operating on a whole population denies such a possibility keywords tolerance fecundity trade off coexistence of species individual based models monte carlo simulations 1 introduction coexistence of species having similar ecologies and biodiversity are one of the main questions in ecology chesson 2000 stein et al 2014 it has been studied since many years however no definite solution has been found the results are often even contradictory hence further studies also theoretical are necessary one of the most widely accepted point of view is that some kind of a trade off mechanism is required for maintaining biodiversity of these the colonization competition trade off has long been heralded as the most probable mechanism for promoting the competitive coexistence of species levins and culver 1971 tilman 1994 holmes and wilson 1998 yu and wilson 2001 jeltsch et al 2008 here one type of species produces more seeds which could colonize a territory even far away from the mother plant while another species produces seeds which locally out compete the former species sometimes kinzig et al 1999 turnbull et al 1999 2004 it is related to the size or weight of the seeds larger seeds are better competitors while smaller seeds produced in larger numbers and dispersed farther are better colonizers there is experimental evidence that in spatially homogeneous habitat and non optimal conditions heavier seeds are better competitors gross 1984 this approach has however been criticized coomes and grubb 2003 d andrea et al 2013 yu and wilson 2001 claimed that simple colonization competition trade off is insufficient for maintaining biodiversity in spatially homogeneous systems in the papers dealing with colonization competition trade off it is generally assumed that better competitors like larger plants have an impact on worse ones but not vice versa and this absolute asymmetry is often considered a necessary condition for explaining coexistence of species adler and mosquera 2000 likewise it is often assumed wilson and nisbet 1997 that the better colonizer is spreading its seeds over distances greatly exceeding those of the poor colonizer turnbull et al 2004 and miller et al 2012 showed that also smaller plants have some influence on the larger ones and the problem of estimating the distance over which seeds are dispersed is difficult nathan and muller landau 2000 according to yu and wilson 2001 a seedling may either out compete an adult plant living on the same site displacement competition or it may not be able to do it replacement competition recently another trade off mechanism has been proposed by muller landau 2010 namely the tolerance fecundity trade off in which a better competitor produces less seeds which are more tolerant to stress while a better colonizer produces more seeds less tolerant in her model plants fill up the habitat however at every time step a certain fraction of them is eliminated liberating sites for propagules which compete for the empty space species are ordered by their fecundity with the most fecund ones being the less tolerant to the stress and vice versa seeds with tolerance higher than the stress germinate with probability 1 while those with tolerance lower than the stress cannot germinate hence a part of the habitat is inaccessible for species with tolerance lower than the stress there this step like character of the tolerance function has been criticized in d andrea et al 2013 who replaced it in their model by a smooth function and exchanged also discrete spacing on the trait axis fecundity by a continuum the model of muller landau was also reconsidered in haegeman et al 2014 who however studied a slightly different problem namely annual plants not perennials as in the papers of muller landau 2010 and d andrea et al 2013 the dynamics of any system can be described on several levels the models of muller landau 2010 and d andrea et al 2013 as well as in general the models quoted above operate on global or macroscopic level for which the variables are the abundance or fractions of species and of empty space available for germination this macroscopic level of description ignores the fact that part of the dynamics of the system is taking place at the level of individual plants i e a microscopic level where difference in the living conditions of each plant influence its life history in statistical mechanics the macroscopic approach is called mean field approximation mfa stanley 1971 while the microscopic one is called the individual based model ibm gardner and engelhardt 2008 berger et al 2008 grimm and railsback 2006 knowing the results of the micro dynamics the macroscopic variables could be computed by averaging over the micro variables this process of averaging is a big challenge which cannot in general be performed analytically due partly to the non linearities of the micro dynamics the generic result of this averaging process is that the resulting effective macro dynamics is of stochastic nature this stochasticity expressing the role of the fluctuations present at the microscopic level and neglected at the mean field one droz and pękalski 2016 as a result the predictions given for a problem by the mfa and ibm approaches could be qualitatively different as noticed by grimm and railsback 2006 the differences could be even greater in biology than in physics since in ecology the objects described by the models plants are changing their characteristics in time whereas in physics e g electrons do not change an ibm approach in ecology means a discrete representation of individuals local interactions and explicit representation of how individuals and their environment affect each other it was noticed by watkinson 1990 that several properties of the plants were affected by local fractions of the population already a long time ago tilman 1994 wrote that there is increasingly strong evidence that spatial subdivision is an essential factor controlling the species dynamics and biodiversity of many communities as have been shown in several cases see e g uchmański 2000 description via ibm is a better tool in ecology it should be however noticed that mfa allows for an analytic description of the model there are also attempts to combine the two approaches 2 mm via differential equations and computer simulations for a comprehensive review see wallentin and neuwirth 2017 our work is motivated by the papers of muller landau 2010 and d andrea et al 2013 who studied the fecundity tolerance trade off of perennial plants using a mfa on a heterogeneous habitats the question whether this mechanism can sustain coexistence in a homogeneous habitat remained open and is investigated in this paper we shall also address here another important problem and not receiving much attention hitherto namely how different are the results obtained for the mfa and ibm for a given problem we will demonstrate that even qualitatively the results are not the same which indicates that great care should be taken when choosing a method to describe a new problem 2 model our model like the models of muller landau 2010 and d andrea et al 2013 belongs to the class of strategic models wilson and nisbet 1997 in the sense that the goal is not a description of any particular ecosystem but clarifying general principles we consider here a homogeneous in all aspects habitat including stress on which live 5 species of perennial plants differing in their tolerance τ i to stress s and fecundity f i there are many ways to give values to τ i and f i for the species from the papers of muller landau 2010 and d andrea et al 2013 we take that species with highest fecundity are the less tolerant and vice versa we restrict the values of the stress to the interval 0 1 and similarly for the tolerances this is of course an arbitrary choice but without loosing generality in our work like in muller landau 2010 d andrea et al 2013 we assume replacement competition we consider here the system of just 5 types of plants but extension to a larger number is straightforward for the definitions of the fecundities and tolerances we have chosen simple forms for the fecundity we have 1 f i f m f s i 1 i 1 5 where f m is the minimal fecundity and f s is the step in increasing its value for the tolerances we have 2 τ i τ m τ s i 1 i 1 5 where τ m is the maximum value of the tolerance and τ s is the step in decreasing this value this agrees with the conjecture made by turnbull et al 1999 that there exists a simple relation between seed productivity and seed mass adult plants are eliminated with a constant mortality rate α in our model seeds with tolerance smaller than the stress have some chance to germinate and it depends on the difference between the tolerance of the species and the stress 3 δ i τ i s such a form seems quite natural since our plants are characterised by just two factors fecundity and tolerance germination should depend on how well a seed is fit with respect to external conditions represented here by the stress shirley 1929 hence the probability of germination has the form also chosen to be simple 4 π i 1 if δ i 0 1 δ i if δ i 0 we have the following control parameters which do not change in time f m lowest fecundity f s step in increasing fecundity τ m maximum tolerance τ s step in decreasing tolerance s stress α mortality rate 2 1 mfa let us describe first the mfa approach in our model n i t 0 1 is the fraction of species i defined as the ratio of the abundance of the species to the carrying capacity of the system at a discrete time moment t initial fractions are always n i 0 0 1 to allow for large space for germination at each time step the value of n i t is changed due to two processes elimination of adult plants and germination of seeds of this species 5 n i t 1 n i t 1 α ψ i t i 1 5 the first term represents the lost of species i due to the elimination of adults plants while the second term represents the gain due to germination since the seeds may germinate only on empty without adult plants space we have to know the fraction of space available for germination it is defined as 6 m t 1 i 1 5 n i t it may happen that the total over all species fraction of seeds ready for germination is larger than the empty space m t therefore these fractions have to be reduced and we have to account for that in calculating the fractions of seeds which do germinate for a given species i the fraction of seeds nominally ready to germinate ng i t is a product of the species density fecundity and germination chance 7 ng i t n i t π i f i with this definition the fraction of seeds of the species i which can germinate after taking into account the available space is 8 ψ i t m t ng i t j 1 5 ng j t thus the final dynamical equations read 9 n i t 1 n i t 1 α π i f i m t j 1 5 ng j t i 1 5 from this set of equations we calculate the time evolution of the fractions of species the model has several free parameters and their role must be estimated the most interesting is the dependence on the mortality rate α and the stress s in the following for both mfa and ibm the canonical set of the parameters with which others values will be compared looks as follows f i 10 20 30 40 50 τ i 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 the stress will be changed in the range 0 1 0 9 and for α we take α 0 5 and 0 1 for large values of α approaching 1 all species vanish 2 2 ibm now we turn to the ibm description of our model following in general the odd protocol as defined in grimm et al 2010 a spatial unit the habitat is a square lattice of size 200 200 sites with hard boundary conditions meaning that the plants on the borders have less neighbours since however there are no interactions among the plants on different sites this is of no consequence sites are characterised by the stress summarising difficult living conditions for the plants the stress is the same on all sites hence we have a system homogeneous in space and time b agents our agents are sessile perennial plants of 5 types which are characterised by their localisation on the lattice fecundity and tolerance to the stress different for each species but the same within the species and defined in the same way as for the mfa on one site there might be at most one plant but unlimited number of seeds germination of seeds defined by eq 4 is possible only on sites which do not contain an adult plant plants are eliminated with a constant mortality rate α c process overview the algorithm is as follows d initially equal number of plants of each type is put on random positions with n i 0 0 1 for all i for each type of plants their δ i π i are determined as those factors do not change in time e at each time step a plant i is randomly chosen and then its survival probability is checked by taking a random number r 0 1 from a uniform distribution if r α the plant survived and it produces seeds according to its fecundity seeds are dispersed to random positions over the whole lattice once we have visited all plants the elimination seeds production phase is over f germination phase we check all sites which do not contain adult plants from the seeds present on the site one is randomly chosen and then put to the germination test if passed it becomes an adult plant if not next site with seeds but not adult plant is inspected after checking all sites not containing plants the germination phase is terminated and all seeds are removed from the system no seed bank fractions of each type of plants are recorded at this time and a new year starts maximum time of simulations t max 500 life cycles of plants when a stationary state is well established for both mfa and ibm in our approach randomness ågren and fagerström 1984 is introduced via the random dispersal of seeds random distribution of empty sites allowing germination and random choice of a seed for germination 3 results 3 1 mfa the dependence of the final fractions of species on the stress s and mortality rate α for the mfa approach is shown in the first figures the values of the fecundity are f i 10 20 30 40 50 and for the tolerances τ i 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 fig 1 clearly there is no coexistence neither for a weak mortality rate nor for a stronger one and likewise for weak or strong stress general conclusion is therefore that in a habitat homogeneous with respect to stress coexistence of species is impossible within the mfa approach other sets of fecundities tolerances and values of α also do not allow coexistence 3 2 ibm in the figures obtained from the ibm method averaging was over 10 independent runs starting with the same values of the parameters but different random spatial arrangement of plants all runs lead to very similar results hence the error bars are quite small about twice the thickness of the lines on the figures as for the case of mfa we start with showing the role of the two basic parameters stress and mortality rate the values of the tolerances and fecundities are the same as for the mfa approach fig 2 increasing the mortality rate influences most the species with the lowest fecundity even if the stress is very large with a weak mortality rate α 0 1 the fractions of all 5 species do not differ much as could be expected species with the lowest tolerance to stress are most affected when the stress is large when the mortality rate is high fecundity counts more and the species with the lowest fecundity are most vulnerable also if the stress is high let us have a look now how our community depends on the choice of the tolerances apart from the canonical value τ i 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 marked in fig 3 as 2 we consider the case of smaller differences τ i 0 6 0 55 0 5 0 45 0 4 marked as 1 in fig 3 and finally larger differences τ i 0 8 0 65 0 5 0 35 0 2 denoted as 3 for the species with medium values of the tolerances and fecundities there are practically no differences between the different sets of fecundities and they are always best off again the most vulnerable are the species with the lowest fecundity which may even be eliminated if the stress is large and their fecundities are low in this case case 1 the difference in the tolerances is quite small and the species with a bit lower tolerance 0 55 are much more fecund 20 as opposed to 10 of the first species hence they out compete the first species finally we investigate the role of the assumed sequence of the fecundities as for the case of tolerances we will consider three cases the canonical one f i 10 20 30 40 50 marked as 2 in fig 4 f i 6 8 10 12 14 marked 1 in fig 4 and f i 10 15 20 25 30 denoted as 3 in fig 4 fecundities larger than the sequence 2 lead to almost the same results as for the case of different tolerances plants with medium values of the tolerances and fecundities are most stable i e less affected by changes of either stress or mortality rate the species with the lowest fecundity could be eliminated again when the stress is not very high hence the asset of high tolerance is not very useful in the competition with more fecund species what is quite interesting is the fact that almost always the fractions are higher if the fecundities are lower and less different which reduces the competitive differences among species our results here agree with the findings of ågren and fagerström 1984 that species with similar characteristics do not necessarily out compete each other although in our model as in the models of muller landau 2010 and d andrea et al 2013 all species implicitly feed on the same resource hence we do not have resource partitioning which generally chesson 2000 acts as a stabilising mechanism yet the trade off including fecundity plays this role the equalising mechanism shows itself when species with similar and medium values of the tolerance and fecundity have a better chance to survive than species with more differing characteristics 4 discussion we have shown in our model that in a homogeneous spatially and temporarily habitat the fecundity 0 1 mm tolerance trade off is a sufficient mechanism for establishing biodiversity if we use the ibm approach the mfa method neglecting all local subtleties eliminates possibility of coexistence of species within the ibm approach individual sites are inspected and germination depends on the stochastic nature of two processes 0 1 mm choice of a seed and its passing of the germination test each process depends on another feature of the seeds and the interplay of the two processes makes coexistence possible it is clear that in nature there are many mechanisms determining the dynamics of plants life many of them have a local character watkinson 1990 tilman 1994 and as such could be investigated only via an ibm approach as a general remark we may state that within the ibm approach coexistence of species on a homogeneous with respect to stress habitat is possible mechanism responsible for sustaining coexistence of species via the fecundity tolerance trade off could be explained in the following way on a site without an adult plant there might be several seeds of different types more of the fecund ones and such seeds have a better chance to be chosen for the germination test however the seeds of less fecund species when chosen have a better chance to pass the germination test the interplay of those two mechanisms 0 1 mm random choice of the seeds for germination favouring fecundity and randomness in the germination test favouring tolerant seeds leads to coexistence of different species in a homogeneous habitat it is clear that the two mechanisms could be described fully only within the ibm approach hence the qualitative difference of the results coming from the mfa and ibm is not surprising another answer to the problem of the differences between mfa and ibm is the way the seeds are eliminated although germination success is defined in the same way for the mfa and ibm processes yet as stated above in the case of mfa a failure or success is global and in the ibm it is local suppose that τ i s then δ i 0 eq 3 and therefore π i 1 eq 4 when a random number r π i then in the mfa all seeds of species i cannot germinate while in the ibm it is just one particular seed of species i which will not germinate such fluctuations of the germination success present only in the ibm are the source of different results in the both methods this local character leads to heterogeneity of the density of species with empty areas open to colonisation here we have an analogue of the classical colonisation competition trade off mechanism now seeds with larger tolerance are better competitors and those of species with higher fecundity are better colonisers the analogue is however not complete since in the classical colonization competition trade off generally a better adapted seedling can out compete an adults plant wedin and tilman 1993 which is not the case in the models of the tolerance fecundity trade off in our approach better competitor plants with larger tolerance have no effect on the poorer competitor which is generally assumes in colonisation competition trade off moreover in our model seeds of all species are spread over the whole system while in the colonisation competition trade off models better coloniser disperses its seeds farther another factor within our ibm approach which promotes coexistence is the equalising process slowing down the exclusion dynamics barot 2004 in the form of competitive lottery for seeds and demographic stochasticity our findings difference of the mfa and ibm results support the remark by tilman 1994 that local interactions are very important in ecology of plants our model is deliberately omitting many features which could be included into a more sophisticated versions the seeds of all species are dispersed over the whole system while with different distribution range for different species some clustering of alike plants would be observed the mortality rate acts on all plants with the same value fecundity does not depend on the relation between tolerance and stress the habitat is spatially and temporarily homogeneous plants do not interact among themselves most of the features stated above like heterogeneity of the habitat different dispersion of seeds mortality rate and effective fecundity depending on the relation between stress tolerance and stress act in favour of the biodiversity in our model we wanted to show that even in a very simple model without any help from the above listed factors the fecundity tolerance trade off is able to sustain biodiversity simplicity of our model and clear presentation of all assumptions allows for introduction of other mechanisms considered important in maintaining biodiversity like niches non homogeneous habitat speciation immigrants or other forms of the trade off mechanisms as mentioned by many authors it is very unlikely that biodiversity is preserved in nature by a single mechanism including different mechanisms into our model is in principle straightforward it may therefore serve also as a convenient starting point for construction of more sophisticated models maybe closer to reality acknowledgements we would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for providing constructive comments on this manuscript the manuscript is greatly improved as a results of their

α ψ i t i 1 5 the first term represents the lost of species i due to the elimination of adults plants while the second term represents the gain due to germination since the seeds may germinate only on empty without adult plants space we have to know the fraction of space available for germination it is defined as 6 m t 1 i 1 5 n i t it may happen that the total over all species fraction of seeds ready for germination is larger than the empty space m t therefore these fractions have to be reduced and we have to account for that in calculating the fractions of seeds which do germinate for a given species i the fraction of seeds nominally ready to germinate ng i t is a product of the species density fecundity and germination chance 7 ng i t n i t π i f i with this definition the fraction of seeds of the species i which can germinate after taking into account the available space is 8 ψ i t m t ng i t j 1 5 ng j t thus the final dynamical equations read 9 n i t 1 n i t 1 α π i f i m t j 1 5 ng j t i 1 5 from this set of equations we calculate the time evolution of the fractions of species the model has several free parameters and their role must be estimated the most interesting is the dependence on the mortality rate α and the stress s in the following for both mfa and ibm the canonical set of the parameters with which others values will be compared looks as follows f i 10 20 30 40 50 τ i 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 the stress will be changed in the range 0 1 0 9 and for α we take α 0 5 and 0 1 for large values of α approaching 1 all species vanish 2 2 ibm now we turn to the ibm description of our model following in general the odd protocol as defined in grimm et al 2010 a spatial unit the habitat is a square lattice of size 200 200 sites with hard boundary conditions meaning that the plants on the borders have less neighbours since however there are no interactions among the plants on different sites this is of no consequence sites are characterised by the stress summarising difficult living conditions for the plants the stress is the same on all sites hence we have a system homogeneous in space and time b agents our agents are sessile perennial plants of 5 types which are characterised by their localisation on the lattice fecundity and tolerance to the stress different for each species but the same within the species and defined in the same way as for the mfa on one site there might be at most one plant but unlimited number of seeds germination of seeds defined by eq 4 is possible only on sites which do not contain an adult plant plants are eliminated with a constant mortality rate α c process overview the algorithm is as follows d initially equal number of plants of each type is put on random positions with n i 0 0 1 for all i for each type of plants their δ i π i are determined as those factors do not change in time e at each time step a plant i is randomly chosen and then its survival probability is checked by taking a random number r 0 1 from a uniform distribution if r α the plant survived and it produces seeds according to its fecundity seeds are dispersed to random positions over the whole lattice once we have visited all plants the elimination seeds production phase is over f germination phase we check all sites which do not contain adult plants from the seeds present on the site one is randomly chosen and then put to the germination test if passed it becomes an adult plant if not next site with seeds but not adult plant is inspected after checking all sites not containing plants the germination phase is terminated and all seeds are removed from the system no seed bank fractions of each type of plants are recorded at this time and a new year starts maximum time of simulations t max 500 life cycles of plants when a stationary state is well established for both mfa and ibm in our approach randomness ågren and fagerström 1984 is introduced via the random dispersal of seeds random distribution of empty sites allowing germination and random choice of a seed for germination 3 results 3 1 mfa the dependence of the final fractions of species on the stress s and mortality rate α for the mfa approach is shown in the first figures the values of the fecundity are f i 10 20 30 40 50 and for the tolerances τ i 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 fig 1 clearly there is no coexistence neither for a weak mortality rate nor for a stronger one and likewise for weak or strong stress general conclusion is therefore that in a habitat homogeneous with respect to stress coexistence of species is impossible within the mfa approach other sets of fecundities tolerances and values of α also do not allow coexistence 3 2 ibm in the figures obtained from the ibm method averaging was over 10 independent runs starting with the same values of the parameters but different random spatial arrangement of plants all runs lead to very similar results hence the error bars are quite small about twice the thickness of the lines on the figures as for the case of mfa we start with showing the role of the two basic parameters stress and mortality rate the values of the tolerances and fecundities are the same as for the mfa approach fig 2 increasing the mortality rate influences most the species with the lowest fecundity even if the stress is very large with a weak mortality rate α 0 1 the fractions of all 5 species do not differ much as could be expected species with the lowest tolerance to stress are most affected when the stress is large when the mortality rate is high fecundity counts more and the species with the lowest fecundity are most vulnerable also if the stress is high let us have a look now how our community depends on the choice of the tolerances apart from the canonical value τ i 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 marked in fig 3 as 2 we consider the case of smaller differences τ i 0 6 0 55 0 5 0 45 0 4 marked as 1 in fig 3 and finally larger differences τ i 0 8 0 65 0 5 0 35 0 2 denoted as 3 for the species with medium values of the tolerances and fecundities there are practically no differences between the different sets of fecundities and they are always best off again the most vulnerable are the species with the lowest fecundity which may even be eliminated if the stress is large and their fecundities are low in this case case 1 the difference in the tolerances is quite small and the species with a bit lower tolerance 0 55 are much more fecund 20 as opposed to 10 of the first species hence they out compete the first species finally we investigate the role of the assumed sequence of the fecundities as for the case of tolerances we will consider three cases the canonical one f i 10 20 30 40 50 marked as 2 in fig 4 f i 6 8 10 12 14 marked 1 in fig 4 and f i 10 15 20 25 30 denoted as 3 in fig 4 fecundities larger than the sequence 2 lead to almost the same results as for the case of different tolerances plants with medium values of the tolerances and fecundities are most stable i e less affected by changes of either stress or mortality rate the species with the lowest fecundity could be eliminated again when the stress is not very high hence the asset of high tolerance is not very useful in the competition with more fecund species what is quite interesting is the fact that almost always the fractions are higher if the fecundities are lower and less different which reduces the competitive differences among species our results here agree with the findings of ågren and fagerström 1984 that species with similar characteristics do not necessarily out compete each other although in our model as in the models of muller landau 2010 and d andrea et al 2013 all species implicitly feed on the same resource hence we do not have resource partitioning which generally chesson 2000 acts as a stabilising mechanism yet the trade off including fecundity plays this role the equalising mechanism shows itself when species with similar and medium values of the tolerance and fecundity have a better chance to survive than species with more differing characteristics 4 discussion we have shown in our model that in a homogeneous spatially and temporarily habitat the fecundity 0 1 mm tolerance trade off is a sufficient mechanism for establishing biodiversity if we use the ibm approach the mfa method neglecting all local subtleties eliminates possibility of coexistence of species within the ibm approach individual sites are inspected and germination depends on the stochastic nature of two processes 0 1 mm choice of a seed and its passing of the germination test each process depends on another feature of the seeds and the interplay of the two processes makes coexistence possible it is clear that in nature there are many mechanisms determining the dynamics of plants life many of them have a local character watkinson 1990 tilman 1994 and as such could be investigated only via an ibm approach as a general remark we may state that within the ibm approach coexistence of species on a homogeneous with respect to stress habitat is possible mechanism responsible for sustaining coexistence of species via the fecundity tolerance trade off could be explained in the following way on a site without an adult plant there might be several seeds of different types more of the fecund ones and such seeds have a better chance to be chosen for the germination test however the seeds of less fecund species when chosen have a better chance to pass the germination test the interplay of those two mechanisms 0 1 mm random choice of the seeds for germination favouring fecundity and randomness in the germination test favouring tolerant seeds leads to coexistence of different species in a homogeneous habitat it is clear that the two mechanisms could be described fully only within the ibm approach hence the qualitative difference of the results coming from the mfa and ibm is not surprising another answer to the problem of the differences between mfa and ibm is the way the seeds are eliminated although germination success is defined in the same way for the mfa and ibm processes yet as stated above in the case of mfa a failure or success is global and in the ibm it is local suppose that τ i s then δ i 0 eq 3 and therefore π i 1 eq 4 when a random number r π i then in the mfa all seeds of species i cannot germinate while in the ibm it is just one particular seed of species i which will not germinate such fluctuations of the germination success present only in the ibm are the source of different results in the both methods this local character leads to heterogeneity of the density of species with empty areas open to colonisation here we have an analogue of the classical colonisation competition trade off mechanism now seeds with larger tolerance are better competitors and those of species with higher fecundity are better colonisers the analogue is however not complete since in the classical colonization competition trade off generally a better adapted seedling can out compete an adults plant wedin and tilman 1993 which is not the case in the models of the tolerance fecundity trade off in our approach better competitor plants with larger tolerance have no effect on the poorer competitor which is generally assumes in colonisation competition trade off moreover in our model seeds of all species are spread over the whole system while in the colonisation competition trade off models better coloniser disperses its seeds farther another factor within our ibm approach which promotes coexistence is the equalising process slowing down the exclusion dynamics barot 2004 in the form of competitive lottery for seeds and demographic stochasticity our findings difference of the mfa and ibm results support the remark by tilman 1994 that local interactions are very important in ecology of plants our model is deliberately omitting many features which could be included into a more sophisticated versions the seeds of all species are dispersed over the whole system while with different distribution range for different species some clustering of alike plants would be observed the mortality rate acts on all plants with the same value fecundity does not depend on the relation between tolerance and stress the habitat is spatially and temporarily homogeneous plants do not interact among themselves most of the features stated above like heterogeneity of the habitat different dispersion of seeds mortality rate and effective fecundity depending on the relation between stress tolerance and stress act in favour of the biodiversity in our model we wanted to show that even in a very simple model without any help from the above listed factors the fecundity tolerance trade off is able to sustain biodiversity simplicity of our model and clear presentation of all assumptions allows for introduction of other mechanisms considered important in maintaining biodiversity like niches non homogeneous habitat speciation immigrants or other forms of the trade off mechanisms as mentioned by many authors it is very unlikely that biodiversity is preserved in nature by a single mechanism including different mechanisms into our model is in principle straightforward it may therefore serve also as a convenient starting point for construction of more sophisticated models maybe
