2615,the travel time distribution ttd is a lumped representation of the age composition of water leaving the system under nonstationary rainfall injection conditions the ttd varies with transient groundwater flow leading to a time variant ttd it reflects water and solute exports responding to rainfall the time variant ttd time variant residence time distribution rtd and storage selection function sas function provide fundamental insights into transport and mixing processes in groundwater flow system this study investigates the control of local scale mixing i e molecular diffusion and pore scale mechanical dispersion on time variant ttd rtd and sas function a solute transport model is constructed to simulate the time variant ttd rtd and sas function under the influence of local scale mixing and a particle tracking model is applied to simulated time variant ttd rtd and sas function without the influence of local scale mixing generally the ttd and cumulative ttd are found to be more sensitive to local scale mixing than rtd and cumulative rtd due to the volume effect the local scale mixing smoothens the sharp fluctuations of backward ttd and sas function the differences of cumulative breakthrough curves and cumulative backward ttds between two models deviate to negative value except the tails of the two functions and this verifies the random velocity theory the differences of cumulative rtds between the two models indicate the hydrodynamic dispersion can result in more young water leaving the system and more old water remaining in the storage meanwhile two rainfall time series one with seasonality and one without seasonality are applied in the two models separately it is found that the hydrodynamic dispersion shapes the 2 dimensional backward ttd by increasing its continuity along the 45 direction finally the spatial distribution of mean groundwater age is used to illustrate the local scale mixing in the aquifer and further explain the controls of local scale mixing on time variant ttd rtd and sas function mechanistically keywords time variant travel time distribution time variant residence time distribution storage selection function hydrodynamic dispersion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction travel time distribution ttd is a probability density function describing the age distribution of water leaving the system it encapsulates hydrodynamics and water and solute transport processes into a lumped mathematical function and provides fundamental information on groundwater circulation and subsurface mixing in aquifers in ttd theory developed in previous studies botter et al 2011 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 travel time is defined as the time interval between injection time and the time of water parcels leaving the system residence time is defined as the time of water parcels remaining in the system after rainfall injection the ttd is further classified into two categories forward ttd fttd and backward ttd bttd the fttd quantifies the distribution of travel time for all the water parcels entering the system from a certain rainfall event and the bttd quantifies the distribution of travel time for all the water parcels leaving the system through a certain process such as stream discharge evapotranspiration etc the residence time distribution rtd is also a lump representation defined as the distribution of residence time of all water remained in the system under nonstationary rainfall input conditions the ttd and rtd vary with time variant groundwater flow leading to the time variant ttd and rtd the relation between the time variant ttd and rtd is described by storage selection sas function which characterizes how the water parcels of different ages are released from storage under different wet conditions of the system the evolution of time variant ttd rtd and sas function is described by the age master equation botter et al 2011 therefore the ttd theory provides a powerful tool to study water and solute transport in a time integrated perspective the ttd and rtd were primarily proposed to quantify the response of groundwater discharge to historical rainfall events kirchner et al 2000 the observed long term signals in groundwater discharge such as solute concentration and the compositions of stable isotopes δ 2 h δ 18 o always show delayed fluctuations with damped amplitudes compared with fluctuations of signals in rainfall hrachowitz et al 2009 kirchner et al 2000 kirchner and neal 2013 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 briefly speaking the mixing of water parcels of different travel time can be one important factor leading to this damped phenomenon botter et al 2010 botter 2012 and the elapsed time from the rainfall recharge location to the groundwater discharge location causes the delayed signals the time variant ttd rtd and sas function are then introduced to describe the mixing processes and explain the damped and delayed fluctuations in summary the three functions describe how water and solute are stored mixed and released in an aquifer the time variant ttd and rtd can also help to study time controlled reaction processes in an aquifer such as the genesis and transport of weathering products ameli et al 2017 benettin et al 2015 and the attenuation of contaminants queloz et al 2015 van der velde et al 2010 as the time variant ttd rtd and sas function are helpful to characterize subsurface transport processes the study of their control factors can improve the understanding of the properties of these functions theoretically speaking all the factors influencing subsurface groundwater flow and solute transport can be potential control factors determining the shapes and variation patterns of time variant ttd rtd and sas function such as the catchment topography mcguire et al 2005 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 permeability architecture ameli et al 2016a b groundwater storage harman 2015 groundwater flow paths kim et al 2016 etc among these control factors local scale mixing process which may modify the groundwater age composition and solute concentration is important to determine the properties of time variant ttd rtd and sas function and hydrodynamic dispersion is the main factor causing this local scale mixing process specifically hydrodynamic dispersion is the combination of molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion scheidegger 1961 molecular diffusion is caused by random thermal motion of water or solute molecules at a micro scale and is manifested as transport from high to low concentration at a macro scale while the mechanical dispersion is mainly determined by the properties of porous media such as heterogeneity hydrodynamic dispersion is such a primary and vital parameter in hydrogeological studies that some latest numerical studies have considered this parameter when simulating ttds ameli et al 2016a b used a semi analytical approach to investigate the properties of steady state ttd considering the random velocity caused by hydrodynamic dispersion yang et al 2018 used the random walk particle tracking model to study the time variant ttd in realistic agricultural catchment gomez and wilson 2013 used the groundwater age distribution model to study the age distribution in topography driven flow system and the governing equation of this model encapsulates dispersivity parameter however the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on the behaviors of time variant ttd rtd and sas function has not been studied systematically yet up to now to the best knowledge of the authors this influence can only be inferred from two studies benettin et al 2013 investigated the determination of pélect number on the properties of sas function using one dimensional advection dispersion models danesh yazdi et al 2018 explored the influences of heterogeneous conductivity with similar effect to mechanical dispersion on steady state ttd when bridging the gap between the lumped model and physically based numerical model of ttd and sas function it can be referred that 1 previous one dimensional model to investigate the time variant ttd only considered the influence of molecule diffusion on local mixing as mechanical dispersion does not exist in one dimensional condition 2 previous two dimensional model to explore the influence of local mixing processes on these function is under steady state rather than time variant condition although the influence of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity is implicated in the model structure the hydrodynamic dispersion has not yet been directly parameterized in the model however what is the mechanism behind the influences of hydrodynamic dispersion on these function under time variant conditions and how the hydrodynamic dispersion shapes these functions remains unclear and requires extensive studies to advance the understanding of the control of local scale mixing on time variant ttd rtd and sas function two numerical models are constructed to investigate the controls of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd rtd and sas function 1 groundwater age distribution model with the consideration of hydrodynamic dispersion 2 particle tracking model without the consideration of random walk the time variant ttd rtd and sas function are calculated in the two models separately and the differences of these functions between the two models are quantified to explore the influence of local scale mixing meanwhile two different rainfall time series are applied in the two models one is the two year repeated rainfall time series from hong kong with significant seasonality the other is the synthetic rainfall time series generated by compound poisson process without seasonality the latter model aims to investigate the influence of rainfall input condition on the transient properties of these functions and to delineate whether the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on ttd rtd and sas are the same under different transient flow conditions furthermore the intrinsic mechanism of the influence is illustrated by the simulation of the spatial distribution of mean groundwater age in a hillslope aquifer 2 methods 2 1 groundwater age distribution model the groundwater age distribution model was first introduced by ginn 1999 as a special case of exposure time distribution model theoretically age distribution at every point in the system can be determined by this model in groundwater age distribution model mass density c x t is defined as the ratio of mass to volume of a substance and is a function of position vector x and time t if the concerned substance is water mass density is the water density and equal to 1 g cm 3 if the concerned substance is a solute mass density is the solute concentration then the age density function ρ x t τ is introduced to quantify the contribution of the mass of a substance of a certain age τ to the mass density c x t at point x and time t if integrating the age density function ρ x t τ along age axis τ axis the mass density c x t can be obtained as follows gomez and wilson 2013 1 c x t 0 ρ x t τ d τ the groundwater age distribution ρ x t τ is the ratio of the age density function to the mass density 2 ρ x t τ ρ x t τ c x t specifically if the concerned substance is water that is c x t in eq 2 is 1 g cm 3 the groundwater age distribution ρ x t τ is equal to the age density function ρ x t τ the groundwater age distribution describes the portion of the substance of a certain age τ at point x and time t the evolution of groundwater age distribution in space and time is controlled by the following governing equation which is first introduced by ginn 1999 and is modified with variable saturation in this study 3 ϕ s w ρ t ϕ s w ρ τ ϕ s w d ρ v ρ where ϕ is porosity s w is water saturation v is darcy velocity d is the hydrodynamic dispersivity including molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion eq 3 is a 5 dimensional equation with 3 spatial dimensions 1 clock time dimension and 1 age dimension the time variant ttd rtd and sas function with the consideration of hydrodynamic dispersion can be obtained based on the solution of eq 3 referring to the study of gomez and wilson 2013 eq 3 will be solved by decomposing it into a series of independent advection diffusion equations ades each ade has a different initial condition rainfall time η is introduced in this approach so the age τ of water in the system can be determined based on the clock time t and rainfall time η that is η t τ therefore the age density function can be expressed as a function of rainfall time η instead of age τ that is 4 ρ x t η ρ x t τ where ρ x t η is the same age density function as ρ x t τ the following relations are derived based on eq 4 5 ρ τ ρ η ρ t ρ t ρ η then eq 3 becomes 6 ϕ s w ρ t ϕ s w d ρ v ρ given a certain rainfall time η i eq 6 is an ade describing the transport of water from the rainfall occurred at rainfall time η i therefore in order to obtain the age density function ρ x t η eq 6 must be solved for each rainfall time separately meanwhile the breakthrough curve btc at the discharge boundary for a certain rainfall time η i can be derived from ρ x t η 7 b t c t η i ω ϕ s w v ρ ϕ s w d ρ n d σ d i s c h a r g e therefore eq 7 quantifies the mass flux of water which enters the system at a certain rainfall time η i at the discharge boundary since ttd can be decomposed into a series of overprinted breakthrough curves induced by different pulse injections harman and kim 2014 the time variant ttds at the outflow boundary can be constructed by assembling these btcs 2 2 particle tracking model the particle tracking model is applied to calculate the btcs without the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion this model has been applied in many previous ttd related studies benson et al 2019 wang et al 2019 wilusz et al 2020 in particle tracking model the particles are released at the rainfall recharge boundary during the rainfall events each particle represents a certain volume of water parcels based on the rainfall volume and infiltration rate as hydrodynamic dispersion is not considered in the system the particles move along the groundwater flow path lines and the velocities of all particles are determined by the local darcy velocities therefore the location of each particle is calculated as follows 8 x n 1 x n v x n t n t n 1 t n where x n 1 and x n are the locations of a particle at time t n 1 and t n respectively v x n t n is the darcy velocity at point x n and time t n the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion on velocity is not included in eq 8 meanwhile all particles are tagged with their injection time i e the corresponding rainfall time η so the residence time or the age of each particle can be tracked and is equal to the time difference between the current clock time t and its injection time η that is τ t η the travel time t t of each particle is then defined as the time interval between its injection time η and its exit time t e that is t t t e η finally the rtd and ttd can be fully determined by counting these particles in the system 2 3 model setup in this study a hypothetical two dimensional hillslope model is established to investigate the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd rtd and sas function as shown in fig 1 the geometry of the model is a quadrangle with 100 m long in the x axis direction the thickness of the model at the left and right boundaries are 8 m and 5 m respectively the bottom of domain represents upper boundary of impermeable bedrock the depth of the fresh bedrock head increases from the toe to the top of the hillslope this model is based on a real hillslope aquifer of igneous rock in hong kong under subtropic climate condition the groundwater at upslope generally has a lower solute concentration and a higher water rock reaction rate compared with the groundwater at the downslope braun et al 2016 rempe and dietrich 2014 this leads to the wedge shaped profile of weathered rock zone to calculate the time variant ttd rtd and sas function in this hillslope groundwater age distribution model and particle tracking model are implemented in the software comsol multiphysics comsol ab 2018 three modules in comsol are employed namely richards equation module transport of dilute species in porous media module and mathematical particle tracing module in richards equation module hydraulic head and darcy velocity are solved to couple with the other two modules variably saturated groundwater flow is considered in the system the left boundary and bottom boundary are no flow boundaries the right boundary is a fix head boundary with hydraulic head equal to 4 5 m the top boundary is a time variant rainfall infiltration boundary fig 2 shows the variation of 2 year nonstationary rainfall rate with total 2728 5 mm rainfall during the first year and total 2678 5 mm during the second year the rainfall input data are retrieved from the real rainfall record of hong kong observatory in 2016 and 2017 the rainfall infiltration rate is set to be 0 2 the modeling period is 10 046 days 25 52 years the 2 year rainfall will be repeated every two years as the goal of this study is to explore the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd and storage selection process in the hillslope the spatial heterogeneity of hydrogeological properties is ignored and only one layer with a constant hydraulic conductivity is considered in this hypothetic model the detailed hydraulic parameters are shown in table 1 theoretically the initial condition for richards equation can be arbitrary but in order to reduce the influence of initial condition on the model results rapidly the initial condition is set to be 9 h x 0 15 x 19 5 where the initial hydraulic gradient is equal to the slope gradient after running a spin up period of 4 years the influence of initial condition on the solution of richards equation becomes insignificant then the solution of this module is coupled with the other two modules through darcy velocity to further solve for the btcs the transport of dilute species in the porous media module or solute transport model for short hereinafter in comsol is used to solve for the groundwater age distribution model in the groundwater age distribution model the age density function ρ x t η will be obtained by solving eq 6 for each rainfall time η i as eq 6 is the ade at a certain rainfall injection time η i this module in comsol should be run for each single rainfall event independently the advection velocity required in this module is the darcy velocity which has been solved in the richards equation module the left and bottom boundaries are no flux boundaries for solute transport the right boundary is a free outflow boundary for solute transport which means that the outflow of water and solute dominated by advection and the diffusion term in this boundary condition is equal to zero this kind of outflow boundary condition is commonly used in the transport problem where no constrain of solute concentration exists at the outflow boundary the top boundary is a given flux boundary dependent on the rainfall intensity since rainfall is the only source in the model the initial condition of the age density function is zero in the whole domain then the btcs are evaluated at the right outflow boundary according to eq 7 based on the solved age density function ρ x t η the mathematical particle tracing module or particle tracking model for short hereinafter in comsol is employed to solve for the btcs without considering hydrodynamic dispersion the particles are released along the hillslope surface uniformly during rainfall the number of particles released at the upper boundary is the same for each rainfall event each particle represents a certain volume of water parcels depending on the rainfall intensity a particle counter is set at the discharge boundary to keep counting the arriving particles to evaluate the btcs finally the simulated btcs in solute transport model and particle tracking model will be used to compute the time variant ttd rtd and sas function fig 3 compares the age density function calculated from solute transport model with the spatial distribution of the particles calculated from particle tracking model these two results displayed in fig 3 are the modeling outputs at day 1050 for the water with rainfall injection time at day 165 the age density function with the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion spreads around particle distribution without the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion 2 4 computing time variant ttd rtd and sas function by btcs referring to the definition of forward ttd fttd each btc can be transformed to a fttd by normalizing it with the total rainfall recharge volume let p t τ η represent the fttd conditional to rainfall event occurred at time η then 10 p t τ η b t c τ η η p η where τ is the age known as travel time at the outflow site p η is the rainfall recharge volume at time η eq 10 displays a one to one mapping between the btc and fttd the fttd quantifies the portion of water which is from the same rainfall event leaving the system at time t to study the time variant behaviors of the storage selection process backward ttd bttd and residence time distribution rtd are evaluated to explore the dynamic storage selection process similar to the evaluation of fttd bttd can be calculated by normalizing the btcs with the discharge rate as follows 11 p t t τ b t c t t τ q t where p t t τ is the bttd given a certain time t in eq 11 the evaluation of bttd requires the btcs before the time t this is because the water in the hillslope discharging at the time t comes from the rainfall occurred before the time t up to now most studies employ the btcs to calculate fttd and bttd directly harman and kim 2014 kim et al 2016 but few studies calculate rtd by the breakthrough curve as the results from the two models are a set of breakthrough curves conditional on each rainfall event it is necessary to put forward a method to calculate rtd using the btcs the cumulative btc is defined as 12 c b t c t η η t b t c t o u t η d t o u t the c b t c t η characterizes the total volume of water or solutes from the same rainfall event at the discharge boundary before the time t therefore the water or solutes that still remains in the system at the time t is equal to p η c b t c t η therefore the rtd p s t τ which describes the age distribution in storage is calculated as follows 13 p s t t η p η c b t c t η η t p η c b t c t η where p η is the total volume of rainfall which is infiltrated at the time η by assembling these cbtcs the denominator in eq 13 represents the total storage volume at time t having calculated the bttd and rtd the storage selection sas function can be quantified according to its definition there are three different forms of sas function as aforementioned to characterize the time variant behaviors of storage selection process conveniently the fractional sas function fsas is calculated based on the results of bttd and rtd van der velde et al 2012 because there is a one to one mapping between the groundwater residence time groundwater age and cumulative rtd fsas function is defined as a function of cumulative rtd and time 14 ω q t p s p t t τ p s p s t τ p s where ω q t p s is the fsas and p s t τ is the cumulative rtd many studies employ beta distribution to quantify this fsas function van der velde et al 2012 danesh yazdi et al 2016 3 results and discussions 3 1 cumulative btc of each rainfall event as is presented in section 2 4 both time variant ttd and rtd are calculated based on btcs or cumulative btcs so the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd and rtd is fundamentally determined by the influences of hydrodynamic dispersion on btcs or cumulative btcs of all historical rainfall events meanwhile the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on water and solute transport is manifested as an additional random velocity with random direction applied on water parcels or solute particles and this random velocity has been described in many previous studies ameli et al 2017 bechtold et al 2011 in this study the influence is illustrated by the differences of cumulative btcs between solute transport model and particle tracking model as shown in fig 4 it should be noted that the cumulative btcs displayed in fig 4 and discussed in this section are the normalized cumulative btcs also named as fttds based on eq 10 in fig 4 a almost all the water parcels leave the system before 2500 days after the rainfall event for the particle tracking model however under the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion there are still some water parcels leaving the system after 2500 days after the rainfall event for solute transport model fig 4 b in fig 4 c the mean difference of cumulative btcs deviates to negative value before day 2000 and deviates to positive value at the tail this implies that the cumulative btcs with the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion are generally bigger than the cumulative btcs without the influence generally except the tails of cumulative btcs because in addition to the advection process the hydrodynamic dispersion not only transports more water and solute from recharge boundary to discharge boundary but also slows down the transport of some water and solute leading to tails of cumulative btcs this is consistent with the random velocity theory the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on cumulative btcs will help to study this influence on time variant ttd rtd and sas function hereinafter 3 2 time variant ttd and rtd with reference to eq 11 and 13 time variant bttd and rtd are obtained based on the btcs figs 5 and 6 present the results of bttd cumulative bttd rtd and cumulative rtd from different models the differences of bttd cumulative bttd rtd and cumulative rtd between solute transport model influenced by hydrodynamic dispersion and particle tracking model not influenced by hydrodynamic dispersion are compared these curves in figs 5 and 6 are colored by storage volume to illustrate how the bttd and rtd change with the system storage it can be seen that the bttd and cumulative ttd calculated by solute transport model are significantly distinctive compared with those calculated by particle tracking model due to the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion the hydrodynamic dispersion smoothens the sharp fluctuation of bttd significantly however the differences of the rtd and cumulative rtd between two models shown in fig 6 are not identifiable in other words the hydrodynamic dispersion has a large impact on ttd at the discharge boundary but has a limited impact on rtd in storage this phenomenon is ascribed to the kinetics of the transport of water parcels and solutes the reason for this different impact could be elaborated as the volume effect that is the large volume of storage buffers the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and the small discharge flux is more sensitive to hydrodynamic dispersion figs 5 a3 5 b3 6 a3 and 6 b3 present the differences of bttd cumulative bttd rtd and cumulative rtd between solute transport model and particle tracking model respectively the differences are calculated by subtracting the results of solute transport model from the results of particle tracking model in figs 5 b3 and 6 b3 the mean differences of cumulative bttd and cumulative rtd deviate from zero obviously meanwhile the mean difference of cumulative bttd deviates to negative value due to the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion this indicates that hydrodynamic dispersion as an additional transport kinetics can transport more water and solute to the discharge boundary at the yearly average perspective moreover the differences of cumulative rtd shown in fig 6 b3 deviate to negative values when the age of water is young and deviates to positive values when the age increases this is because the hydrodynamic dispersion can cause not only an early arrival time of water and solute but also a late leaving time for young water the arriving time controls the volume leaving the storage but for old water the leaving time controls the volume remaining in the storage therefore the hydrodynamic dispersion increases not only the proportion of young water in discharge and but also the proportion of old water in storage in figs 5 a3 and 6 a3 the deviation of mean differences of bttd and rtd are not obvious and these mean differences fluctuate promptly around zero horizontal line depending on the transient hydraulic conditions note that all water parcels entering the system will finally leave the system so the cumulative bttd and cumulative rtd calculated from any model will always approach 1 therefore the cumulative differences of bttd and rtd between the two models are always equal to 0 that is the reason why the differences of bttd and rtd can only fluctuate around the zero line in conclusion the bttd and cumulative bttd are more sensitive to diffusion process than rtd and cumulative rtd due to the volume effect the differences between two models illustrate how the hydrodynamic dispersion affects the groundwater travel time and resident time in the hillslope 3 3 time variant sas function the time variant fsas function is evaluated based on eq 14 fig 7 presents the fsas function calculated from solute transport models and particle tracking model the fsas functions are colored by storage volume to differentiate fsas functions at different clock times and illustrate how the fsas functions change with the wet condition in the system as the rtds calculated from two models have little difference the difference of fsas function is mainly contributed by the large difference of bttd between the models in particle tracking model each single fsas function fluctuates a lot due to the large fluctuation of bttd in time but in solute transport model the hydrodynamic dispersion can smooth the bttd thus reduce the fluctuation of fsas function in other words hydrodynamic dispersion smoothens the fsas function besides the mean difference of fsas function is almost zero fig 7 a3 this indicates that the hydrodynamic dispersion smoothens the fsas function fluctuation but has little impact on the trend of storage selection preference 3 4 influence of transient flow conditions on time variant ttd rtd and sas function in the previous analysis the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd rtd and sas function is investigated based on a specific transient groundwater flow condition i e groundwater flow varies with the two year repeated rainfall input forcing generally this two year rainfall time series presents strong seasonality fig 2 leading to the seasonal variation of ttd rtd and sas function with storage volume figs 5 7 as the study aims to investigate the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd rtd and sas function the pattern of rainfall input time series and the associated transient groundwater flow condition are expected to determine the characteristics of ttd rtd and sas function therefore a synthetic rainfall input condition without significant seasonality is generated and applied in the same hillslope model to explore the possible influence of rainfall input condition so the findings on the influence of hydraulic dispersion are more intrinsic to the system and less impacted by the specific rainfall time series in this study the synthetic rainfall time series is generated by the compound poisson process porporato et al 2004 verma et al 2011 with given rainfall frequency and the daily rainfall amount is drawn from an exponential distribution the main reason using the compound poisson process is that the generated rainfall time series is statically stationary and has no significant seasonality fig 8 in the hillslope model with synthetic rainfall input condition the time variant ttd rtd and sas function are calculated using the method which is the same as the previous hillslope model then the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on ttd rtd and sas function is studied by analyzing the differences of these functions between the models with and without the consideration of hydrodynamic dispersion the three functions and their differences are presented in fig 9 the seasonal pattern of cumulative btcs disappears in the model with synthetic rainfall input figs 9 a1 a2 specifically both the cumulative btcs are smooth figs 9 a1 and 9 a2 comparably the cumulative btcs influenced by the seasonal variation of rainfall input model fig 4 b increase fast in wet season and slow in dry season meanwhile the differences of cumulative btcs show the same pattern for both rainfall input models fig 9 a3 to further illustrate the influence of seasonality of rainfall input on time variant ttd and rtd fig 10 presents the temporal variations of ttd and rtd in different models during the period from day 731 5 to day 731 6 range from time 0 to time 731 at the y axes of fig 10 in the hillslope model with two year repeated rainfall input referred to as model 1 both ttd and rtd show strong seasonality figs 10 a1 a2 c1 and c2 as illustrated by periodically darkening and brightening of the colors along the travel time or residence time axes therefore the temporal variations of ttd and rtd in model 1 is tightly forced by the seasonality of rainfall input however in the hillslope model with synthetic rainfall input generated by compound poisson process referred to as model 2 the seasonality of ttd and rtd disappears figs 10 b1 b2 d1 and d2 because there is no seasonality for the rainfall input even so the variations of these functions also follow the temporal variation of rainfall input i e the color is brightened when the water parcels enter at the time of high rainfall rate and is darkened when the water parcels enter at the time of low rainfall rate in summary by comparing the ttd and rtd between model 1 and model 2 in fig 10 it can be concluded that the temporal evolutions of ttd and rtd follow the temporal variation pattern of rainfall input furthermore the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on the seasonality of bttd and rtd is revealed by analyzing the differences of sub figures between the first and second columns of fig 10 firstly the volume effect still exists under different rainfall input conditions and this is illustrated as the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on rtd is unidentifiable but the influence on bttd is obvious as shown in fig 10 as for how the seasonality of bttd is influenced by the hydrodynamic dispersion it can be found that the bright lines in fig 10 are discontinuous in particle tracking model but continuous in solute transport model it should be noted that the slopes of the bright lines and dark lines shown in fig 10 are all equal to 1 i e the angles of these lines are 45 the 45 direction line has been mentioned in previous study on ttd theories calabrese and porporato 2015 it is the temporal evolution direction along which the increase rate of age travel time residence time is equal to the increase rate of time and the entering time of the water parcels at a line is the same therefore let t i denote the entering time of a certain bright dark line then the temporal evolution of this line is determined by the btc of entering time t i the seasonality of btc is analyzed previously and demonstrated in fig 4 b as such the variable increase rate of cumulative btcs fig 4 b leads to the discontinuous bright lines in particle tracking model fig 10 in other words the hydrodynamic dispersion smoothens the 2 dimensional clock time dimension and travel time dimension in fig 10 time variant bttd by increasing its continuity along the 45 direction bright lines as shown in fig 10 besides according to the differences of bttd cumulative bttd rtd cumulative rtd and sas function between solute transport model and particle model shown in figs 9 b3 f3 it can be concluded that the previous findings on the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on ttd are almost the same regardless of the seasonality of rainfall input in summary the time variant rainfall input condition and the associated transient flow condition determine the temporal variations of ttd and rtd first then the hydrodynamic dispersion which is the intrinsic property of the system further modifies the temporal variation of bttd by increasing the continuity of the 2 dimensional bttd along the 45 direction besides the findings in the previous sections are almost the same even if the pattern of temporal variation of rainfall input condition changes finally the external rainfall input forcing and intrinsic properties of the system synergistically shape the time variant ttd and rtd 3 5 spatial distribution of mean groundwater age previous results illustrate the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on btc time variant ttd rtd and fsas function to explore how hydrodynamic dispersion influences these quantities modeling of spatial distribution of mean groundwater age is conducted for several cases the mean groundwater age τ of a groundwater sample from one point is defined as the weighted average age of all water parcels in the sample 15 τ m i τ i m i where m i is mass of water parcels with age τ i in the sample the evaluation of mean groundwater age has been explored in many studies bethke and johnson 2002 2008 jiang et al 2012 and the governing equation of the evolution of mean groundwater age is 16 ϕ s w τ t ϕ s w d τ v τ ϕ s w 1 the term ϕ s w 1 in eq 16 means that the mean groundwater age increases as clock time t increases in this study three scenarios under steady state condition with the following different parameters are simulated 1 mean groundwater age with no molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion model configuration identical to particle tracking model 2 molecular diffusion coefficient d m 1 1 0 9 m 2 s longitudinal dispersivity a l 0 05 m and transverse dispersivity a t 0 01 m model configuration identical to solute transport model 3 molecular diffusion coefficient d m 1 1 0 9 m 2 s longitudinal dispersivity a l 0 5 m and transverse dispersivity a t 0 1 m to explore the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on mean groundwater age clearly all the other parameters are set to be the same fig 11 shows the modeling results of the three scenarios the black line from left to right in each sub figures is the groundwater level it can be found that the stratification of mean groundwater age is clear in both saturated zone and unsaturated zone in unsaturated zone of the three sub figures the stratification of mean groundwater age is approximately perpendicular to groundwater flow lines but in saturated zone the stratification of mean groundwater age is approximately parallel to groundwater flow line this is because the darcy velocity in unsaturated zone is much smaller than that in saturated zone then the increase of groundwater mean age along flow lines in unsaturated zone is much larger than the increase in saturated zone therefore the mean groundwater age in two adjacent flow lines is similar in unsaturated zone but the mean groundwater age increases from shallow flow line to deep flow line in saturated zone the three sub figures in fig 11 indicate the hydrodynamic dispersion increases the mean groundwater age in shallow unsaturated zone and decrease the mean groundwater age in deep saturated zone the increase of mean groundwater age is due to the mixing of newly injected water with previously injected water and the decrease of mean groundwater age is caused by the mixing of deep old water with the overlain younger water this local scale mixing process leads to the deviated cumulative btc and bttd shown in figs 4 and 5 4 conclusions the ttd provides basic information on water and solute flowing through the system it encapsulates multiple transport processes into a single mathematic function and resolves mixing process by differentiating water exiting the boundary into a series of water parcels of different ages or from different historical input events recent achievements in ttd studies improve the understanding of the control factors of variations in groundwater age composition and solute concentration hydrodynamic dispersion as an additional kinetic for water and solute transport determines the local scale mixing process and alters the groundwater age composition significantly this study illustrates how the time variant ttd rtd and fsas function are influenced by local scale mixing process i e hydrodynamic dispersion in this study the time variant ttd rtd and fsas function with the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion are simulated by solute transport model based on the ade for each rainfall event while the time variant ttd rtd and fsas function without the influence are simulated by particle tracking model the differences between the two models are compared the origins of the differences are discussed based on the physical mechanism meanwhile two kinds of rainfall time series are applied in the two models separately to investigate the influence of transient flow condition on these functions and how the hydrodynamic dispersion shapes these functions the main findings are presented below the differences of cumulative btcs between particle tracking model and solute transport model deviate to negative values for most of the time except the tails of cumulative btcs deviate to positive values this is consistent with the random velocity theory i e the hydrodynamic dispersion not only increases the velocities of some water parcels but also decrease the velocities of the other water parcels the differences of cumulative bttds between particle tracking model and solute transport model also display the similar phenomenon moreover the differences of cumulative rtds between two models deviate to negative value when the age of water is young and deviates to positive value when the age is old the length of positive deviation of rtd is much longer than that of cumulative btc and cumulative bttd these indicate how the hydrodynamic dispersion affects the portion of water and solute remaining in storage the hydrodynamic dispersion results in more young water leaving the storage and more old water remaining in the storage meanwhile the bttd and cumulative bttd are more sensitive to hydrodynamic dispersion than rtd and cumulative rtd due to the volume effect that is the storage volume is much larger than the discharge volume and hydrodynamic dispersion also smoothens the sharp fluctuations of bttd and fsas function then the difference between the results of the models with two year repeated rainfall time series from hong kong and with synthetic rainfall time series is analyzed it is found that the hydrodynamic dispersion increases the continuity of time variant 2 dimensional bttd along the 45 direction and the transient flow condition has minor impact on the previous findings on the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion in summary the transient flow condition and the intrinsic properties such as hydrodynamic dispersion synergistically shape the characteristic of time variant ttd rtd and sas function finally the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on the spatial distribution of mean groundwater age in the system reveals how the local scale mixing process leads to the deviated cumulative btc time variant ttd and rtd this study presents an insight into the hydrodynamic dispersion controls on time variant behaviors of ttd rtd fsas function and advances the understanding of the influence of local scale

2615,the travel time distribution ttd is a lumped representation of the age composition of water leaving the system under nonstationary rainfall injection conditions the ttd varies with transient groundwater flow leading to a time variant ttd it reflects water and solute exports responding to rainfall the time variant ttd time variant residence time distribution rtd and storage selection function sas function provide fundamental insights into transport and mixing processes in groundwater flow system this study investigates the control of local scale mixing i e molecular diffusion and pore scale mechanical dispersion on time variant ttd rtd and sas function a solute transport model is constructed to simulate the time variant ttd rtd and sas function under the influence of local scale mixing and a particle tracking model is applied to simulated time variant ttd rtd and sas function without the influence of local scale mixing generally the ttd and cumulative ttd are found to be more sensitive to local scale mixing than rtd and cumulative rtd due to the volume effect the local scale mixing smoothens the sharp fluctuations of backward ttd and sas function the differences of cumulative breakthrough curves and cumulative backward ttds between two models deviate to negative value except the tails of the two functions and this verifies the random velocity theory the differences of cumulative rtds between the two models indicate the hydrodynamic dispersion can result in more young water leaving the system and more old water remaining in the storage meanwhile two rainfall time series one with seasonality and one without seasonality are applied in the two models separately it is found that the hydrodynamic dispersion shapes the 2 dimensional backward ttd by increasing its continuity along the 45 direction finally the spatial distribution of mean groundwater age is used to illustrate the local scale mixing in the aquifer and further explain the controls of local scale mixing on time variant ttd rtd and sas function mechanistically keywords time variant travel time distribution time variant residence time distribution storage selection function hydrodynamic dispersion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction travel time distribution ttd is a probability density function describing the age distribution of water leaving the system it encapsulates hydrodynamics and water and solute transport processes into a lumped mathematical function and provides fundamental information on groundwater circulation and subsurface mixing in aquifers in ttd theory developed in previous studies botter et al 2011 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 travel time is defined as the time interval between injection time and the time of water parcels leaving the system residence time is defined as the time of water parcels remaining in the system after rainfall injection the ttd is further classified into two categories forward ttd fttd and backward ttd bttd the fttd quantifies the distribution of travel time for all the water parcels entering the system from a certain rainfall event and the bttd quantifies the distribution of travel time for all the water parcels leaving the system through a certain process such as stream discharge evapotranspiration etc the residence time distribution rtd is also a lump representation defined as the distribution of residence time of all water remained in the system under nonstationary rainfall input conditions the ttd and rtd vary with time variant groundwater flow leading to the time variant ttd and rtd the relation between the time variant ttd and rtd is described by storage selection sas function which characterizes how the water parcels of different ages are released from storage under different wet conditions of the system the evolution of time variant ttd rtd and sas function is described by the age master equation botter et al 2011 therefore the ttd theory provides a powerful tool to study water and solute transport in a time integrated perspective the ttd and rtd were primarily proposed to quantify the response of groundwater discharge to historical rainfall events kirchner et al 2000 the observed long term signals in groundwater discharge such as solute concentration and the compositions of stable isotopes δ 2 h δ 18 o always show delayed fluctuations with damped amplitudes compared with fluctuations of signals in rainfall hrachowitz et al 2009 kirchner et al 2000 kirchner and neal 2013 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 briefly speaking the mixing of water parcels of different travel time can be one important factor leading to this damped phenomenon botter et al 2010 botter 2012 and the elapsed time from the rainfall recharge location to the groundwater discharge location causes the delayed signals the time variant ttd rtd and sas function are then introduced to describe the mixing processes and explain the damped and delayed fluctuations in summary the three functions describe how water and solute are stored mixed and released in an aquifer the time variant ttd and rtd can also help to study time controlled reaction processes in an aquifer such as the genesis and transport of weathering products ameli et al 2017 benettin et al 2015 and the attenuation of contaminants queloz et al 2015 van der velde et al 2010 as the time variant ttd rtd and sas function are helpful to characterize subsurface transport processes the study of their control factors can improve the understanding of the properties of these functions theoretically speaking all the factors influencing subsurface groundwater flow and solute transport can be potential control factors determining the shapes and variation patterns of time variant ttd rtd and sas function such as the catchment topography mcguire et al 2005 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 permeability architecture ameli et al 2016a b groundwater storage harman 2015 groundwater flow paths kim et al 2016 etc among these control factors local scale mixing process which may modify the groundwater age composition and solute concentration is important to determine the properties of time variant ttd rtd and sas function and hydrodynamic dispersion is the main factor causing this local scale mixing process specifically hydrodynamic dispersion is the combination of molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion scheidegger 1961 molecular diffusion is caused by random thermal motion of water or solute molecules at a micro scale and is manifested as transport from high to low concentration at a macro scale while the mechanical dispersion is mainly determined by the properties of porous media such as heterogeneity hydrodynamic dispersion is such a primary and vital parameter in hydrogeological studies that some latest numerical studies have considered this parameter when simulating ttds ameli et al 2016a b used a semi analytical approach to investigate the properties of steady state ttd considering the random velocity caused by hydrodynamic dispersion yang et al 2018 used the random walk particle tracking model to study the time variant ttd in realistic agricultural catchment gomez and wilson 2013 used the groundwater age distribution model to study the age distribution in topography driven flow system and the governing equation of this model encapsulates dispersivity parameter however the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on the behaviors of time variant ttd rtd and sas function has not been studied systematically yet up to now to the best knowledge of the authors this influence can only be inferred from two studies benettin et al 2013 investigated the determination of pélect number on the properties of sas function using one dimensional advection dispersion models danesh yazdi et al 2018 explored the influences of heterogeneous conductivity with similar effect to mechanical dispersion on steady state ttd when bridging the gap between the lumped model and physically based numerical model of ttd and sas function it can be referred that 1 previous one dimensional model to investigate the time variant ttd only considered the influence of molecule diffusion on local mixing as mechanical dispersion does not exist in one dimensional condition 2 previous two dimensional model to explore the influence of local mixing processes on these function is under steady state rather than time variant condition although the influence of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity is implicated in the model structure the hydrodynamic dispersion has not yet been directly parameterized in the model however what is the mechanism behind the influences of hydrodynamic dispersion on these function under time variant conditions and how the hydrodynamic dispersion shapes these functions remains unclear and requires extensive studies to advance the understanding of the control of local scale mixing on time variant ttd rtd and sas function two numerical models are constructed to investigate the controls of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd rtd and sas function 1 groundwater age distribution model with the consideration of hydrodynamic dispersion 2 particle tracking model without the consideration of random walk the time variant ttd rtd and sas function are calculated in the two models separately and the differences of these functions between the two models are quantified to explore the influence of local scale mixing meanwhile two different rainfall time series are applied in the two models one is the two year repeated rainfall time series from hong kong with significant seasonality the other is the synthetic rainfall time series generated by compound poisson process without seasonality the latter model aims to investigate the influence of rainfall input condition on the transient properties of these functions and to delineate whether the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on ttd rtd and sas are the same under different transient flow conditions furthermore the intrinsic mechanism of the influence is illustrated by the simulation of the spatial distribution of mean groundwater age in a hillslope aquifer 2 methods 2 1 groundwater age distribution model the groundwater age distribution model was first introduced by ginn 1999 as a special case of exposure time distribution model theoretically age distribution at every point in the system can be determined by this model in groundwater age distribution model mass density c x t is defined as the ratio of mass to volume of a substance and is a function of position vector x and time t if the concerned substance is water mass density is the water density and equal to 1 g cm 3 if the concerned substance is a solute mass density is the solute concentration then the age density function ρ x t τ is introduced to quantify the contribution of the mass of a substance of a certain age τ to the mass density c x t at point x and time t if integrating the age density function ρ x t τ along age axis τ axis the mass density c x t can be obtained as follows gomez and wilson 2013 1 c x t 0 ρ x t τ d τ the groundwater age distribution ρ x t τ is the ratio of the age density function to the mass density 2 ρ x t τ ρ x t τ c x t specifically if the concerned substance is water that is c x t in eq 2 is 1 g cm 3 the groundwater age distribution ρ x t τ is equal to the age density function ρ x t τ the groundwater age distribution describes the portion of the substance of a certain age τ at point x and time t the evolution of groundwater age distribution in space and time is controlled by the following governing equation which is first introduced by ginn 1999 and is modified with variable saturation in this study 3 ϕ s w ρ t ϕ s w ρ τ ϕ s w d ρ v ρ where ϕ is porosity s w is water saturation v is darcy velocity d is the hydrodynamic dispersivity including molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion eq 3 is a 5 dimensional equation with 3 spatial dimensions 1 clock time dimension and 1 age dimension the time variant ttd rtd and sas function with the consideration of hydrodynamic dispersion can be obtained based on the solution of eq 3 referring to the study of gomez and wilson 2013 eq 3 will be solved by decomposing it into a series of independent advection diffusion equations ades each ade has a different initial condition rainfall time η is introduced in this approach so the age τ of water in the system can be determined based on the clock time t and rainfall time η that is η t τ therefore the age density function can be expressed as a function of rainfall time η instead of age τ that is 4 ρ x t η ρ x t τ where ρ x t η is the same age density function as ρ x t τ the following relations are derived based on eq 4 5 ρ τ ρ η ρ t ρ t ρ η then eq 3 becomes 6 ϕ s w ρ t ϕ s w d ρ v ρ given a certain rainfall time η i eq 6 is an ade describing the transport of water from the rainfall occurred at rainfall time η i therefore in order to obtain the age density function ρ x t η eq 6 must be solved for each rainfall time separately meanwhile the breakthrough curve btc at the discharge boundary for a certain rainfall time η i can be derived from ρ x t η 7 b t c t η i ω ϕ s w v ρ ϕ s w d ρ n d σ d i s c h a r g e therefore eq 7 quantifies the mass flux of water which enters the system at a certain rainfall time η i at the discharge boundary since ttd can be decomposed into a series of overprinted breakthrough curves induced by different pulse injections harman and kim 2014 the time variant ttds at the outflow boundary can be constructed by assembling these btcs 2 2 particle tracking model the particle tracking model is applied to calculate the btcs without the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion this model has been applied in many previous ttd related studies benson et al 2019 wang et al 2019 wilusz et al 2020 in particle tracking model the particles are released at the rainfall recharge boundary during the rainfall events each particle represents a certain volume of water parcels based on the rainfall volume and infiltration rate as hydrodynamic dispersion is not considered in the system the particles move along the groundwater flow path lines and the velocities of all particles are determined by the local darcy velocities therefore the location of each particle is calculated as follows 8 x n 1 x n v x n t n t n 1 t n where x n 1 and x n are the locations of a particle at time t n 1 and t n respectively v x n t n is the darcy velocity at point x n and time t n the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion on velocity is not included in eq 8 meanwhile all particles are tagged with their injection time i e the corresponding rainfall time η so the residence time or the age of each particle can be tracked and is equal to the time difference between the current clock time t and its injection time η that is τ t η the travel time t t of each particle is then defined as the time interval between its injection time η and its exit time t e that is t t t e η finally the rtd and ttd can be fully determined by counting these particles in the system 2 3 model setup in this study a hypothetical two dimensional hillslope model is established to investigate the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd rtd and sas function as shown in fig 1 the geometry of the model is a quadrangle with 100 m long in the x axis direction the thickness of the model at the left and right boundaries are 8 m and 5 m respectively the bottom of domain represents upper boundary of impermeable bedrock the depth of the fresh bedrock head increases from the toe to the top of the hillslope this model is based on a real hillslope aquifer of igneous rock in hong kong under subtropic climate condition the groundwater at upslope generally has a lower solute concentration and a higher water rock reaction rate compared with the groundwater at the downslope braun et al 2016 rempe and dietrich 2014 this leads to the wedge shaped profile of weathered rock zone to calculate the time variant ttd rtd and sas function in this hillslope groundwater age distribution model and particle tracking model are implemented in the software comsol multiphysics comsol ab 2018 three modules in comsol are employed namely richards equation module transport of dilute species in porous media module and mathematical particle tracing module in richards equation module hydraulic head and darcy velocity are solved to couple with the other two modules variably saturated groundwater flow is considered in the system the left boundary and bottom boundary are no flow boundaries the right boundary is a fix head boundary with hydraulic head equal to 4 5 m the top boundary is a time variant rainfall infiltration boundary fig 2 shows the variation of 2 year nonstationary rainfall rate with total 2728 5 mm rainfall during the first year and total 2678 5 mm during the second year the rainfall input data are retrieved from the real rainfall record of hong kong observatory in 2016 and 2017 the rainfall infiltration rate is set to be 0 2 the modeling period is 10 046 days 25 52 years the 2 year rainfall will be repeated every two years as the goal of this study is to explore the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd and storage selection process in the hillslope the spatial heterogeneity of hydrogeological properties is ignored and only one layer with a constant hydraulic conductivity is considered in this hypothetic model the detailed hydraulic parameters are shown in table 1 theoretically the initial condition for richards equation can be arbitrary but in order to reduce the influence of initial condition on the model results rapidly the initial condition is set to be 9 h x 0 15 x 19 5 where the initial hydraulic gradient is equal to the slope gradient after running a spin up period of 4 years the influence of initial condition on the solution of richards equation becomes insignificant then the solution of this module is coupled with the other two modules through darcy velocity to further solve for the btcs the transport of dilute species in the porous media module or solute transport model for short hereinafter in comsol is used to solve for the groundwater age distribution model in the groundwater age distribution model the age density function ρ x t η will be obtained by solving eq 6 for each rainfall time η i as eq 6 is the ade at a certain rainfall injection time η i this module in comsol should be run for each single rainfall event independently the advection velocity required in this module is the darcy velocity which has been solved in the richards equation module the left and bottom boundaries are no flux boundaries for solute transport the right boundary is a free outflow boundary for solute transport which means that the outflow of water and solute dominated by advection and the diffusion term in this boundary condition is equal to zero this kind of outflow boundary condition is commonly used in the transport problem where no constrain of solute concentration exists at the outflow boundary the top boundary is a given flux boundary dependent on the rainfall intensity since rainfall is the only source in the model the initial condition of the age density function is zero in the whole domain then the btcs are evaluated at the right outflow boundary according to eq 7 based on the solved age density function ρ x t η the mathematical particle tracing module or particle tracking model for short hereinafter in comsol is employed to solve for the btcs without considering hydrodynamic dispersion the particles are released along the hillslope surface uniformly during rainfall the number of particles released at the upper boundary is the same for each rainfall event each particle represents a certain volume of water parcels depending on the rainfall intensity a particle counter is set at the discharge boundary to keep counting the arriving particles to evaluate the btcs finally the simulated btcs in solute transport model and particle tracking model will be used to compute the time variant ttd rtd and sas function fig 3 compares the age density function calculated from solute transport model with the spatial distribution of the particles calculated from particle tracking model these two results displayed in fig 3 are the modeling outputs at day 1050 for the water with rainfall injection time at day 165 the age density function with the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion spreads around particle distribution without the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion 2 4 computing time variant ttd rtd and sas function by btcs referring to the definition of forward ttd fttd each btc can be transformed to a fttd by normalizing it with the total rainfall recharge volume let p t τ η represent the fttd conditional to rainfall event occurred at time η then 10 p t τ η b t c τ η η p η where τ is the age known as travel time at the outflow site p η is the rainfall recharge volume at time η eq 10 displays a one to one mapping between the btc and fttd the fttd quantifies the portion of water which is from the same rainfall event leaving the system at time t to study the time variant behaviors of the storage selection process backward ttd bttd and residence time distribution rtd are evaluated to explore the dynamic storage selection process similar to the evaluation of fttd bttd can be calculated by normalizing the btcs with the discharge rate as follows 11 p t t τ b t c t t τ q t where p t t τ is the bttd given a certain time t in eq 11 the evaluation of bttd requires the btcs before the time t this is because the water in the hillslope discharging at the time t comes from the rainfall occurred before the time t up to now most studies employ the btcs to calculate fttd and bttd directly harman and kim 2014 kim et al 2016 but few studies calculate rtd by the breakthrough curve as the results from the two models are a set of breakthrough curves conditional on each rainfall event it is necessary to put forward a method to calculate rtd using the btcs the cumulative btc is defined as 12 c b t c t η η t b t c t o u t η d t o u t the c b t c t η characterizes the total volume of water or solutes from the same rainfall event at the discharge boundary before the time t therefore the water or solutes that still remains in the system at the time t is equal to p η c b t c t η therefore the rtd p s t τ which describes the age distribution in storage is calculated as follows 13 p s t t η p η c b t c t η η t p η c b t c t η where p η is the total volume of rainfall which is infiltrated at the time η by assembling these cbtcs the denominator in eq 13 represents the total storage volume at time t having calculated the bttd and rtd the storage selection sas function can be quantified according to its definition there are three different forms of sas function as aforementioned to characterize the time variant behaviors of storage selection process conveniently the fractional sas function fsas is calculated based on the results of bttd and rtd van der velde et al 2012 because there is a one to one mapping between the groundwater residence time groundwater age and cumulative rtd fsas function is defined as a function of cumulative rtd and time 14 ω q t p s p t t τ p s p s t τ p s where ω q t p s is the fsas and p s t τ is the cumulative rtd many studies employ beta distribution to quantify this fsas function van der velde et al 2012 danesh yazdi et al 2016 3 results and discussions 3 1 cumulative btc of each rainfall event as is presented in section 2 4 both time variant ttd and rtd are calculated based on btcs or cumulative btcs so the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd and rtd is fundamentally determined by the influences of hydrodynamic dispersion on btcs or cumulative btcs of all historical rainfall events meanwhile the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on water and solute transport is manifested as an additional random velocity with random direction applied on water parcels or solute particles and this random velocity has been described in many previous studies ameli et al 2017 bechtold et al 2011 in this study the influence is illustrated by the differences of cumulative btcs between solute transport model and particle tracking model as shown in fig 4 it should be noted that the cumulative btcs displayed in fig 4 and discussed in this section are the normalized cumulative btcs also named as fttds based on eq 10 in fig 4 a almost all the water parcels leave the system before 2500 days after the rainfall event for the particle tracking model however under the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion there are still some water parcels leaving the system after 2500 days after the rainfall event for solute transport model fig 4 b in fig 4 c the mean difference of cumulative btcs deviates to negative value before day 2000 and deviates to positive value at the tail this implies that the cumulative btcs with the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion are generally bigger than the cumulative btcs without the influence generally except the tails of cumulative btcs because in addition to the advection process the hydrodynamic dispersion not only transports more water and solute from recharge boundary to discharge boundary but also slows down the transport of some water and solute leading to tails of cumulative btcs this is consistent with the random velocity theory the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on cumulative btcs will help to study this influence on time variant ttd rtd and sas function hereinafter 3 2 time variant ttd and rtd with reference to eq 11 and 13 time variant bttd and rtd are obtained based on the btcs figs 5 and 6 present the results of bttd cumulative bttd rtd and cumulative rtd from different models the differences of bttd cumulative bttd rtd and cumulative rtd between solute transport model influenced by hydrodynamic dispersion and particle tracking model not influenced by hydrodynamic dispersion are compared these curves in figs 5 and 6 are colored by storage volume to illustrate how the bttd and rtd change with the system storage it can be seen that the bttd and cumulative ttd calculated by solute transport model are significantly distinctive compared with those calculated by particle tracking model due to the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion the hydrodynamic dispersion smoothens the sharp fluctuation of bttd significantly however the differences of the rtd and cumulative rtd between two models shown in fig 6 are not identifiable in other words the hydrodynamic dispersion has a large impact on ttd at the discharge boundary but has a limited impact on rtd in storage this phenomenon is ascribed to the kinetics of the transport of water parcels and solutes the reason for this different impact could be elaborated as the volume effect that is the large volume of storage buffers the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and the small discharge flux is more sensitive to hydrodynamic dispersion figs 5 a3 5 b3 6 a3 and 6 b3 present the differences of bttd cumulative bttd rtd and cumulative rtd between solute transport model and particle tracking model respectively the differences are calculated by subtracting the results of solute transport model from the results of particle tracking model in figs 5 b3 and 6 b3 the mean differences of cumulative bttd and cumulative rtd deviate from zero obviously meanwhile the mean difference of cumulative bttd deviates to negative value due to the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion this indicates that hydrodynamic dispersion as an additional transport kinetics can transport more water and solute to the discharge boundary at the yearly average perspective moreover the differences of cumulative rtd shown in fig 6 b3 deviate to negative values when the age of water is young and deviates to positive values when the age increases this is because the hydrodynamic dispersion can cause not only an early arrival time of water and solute but also a late leaving time for young water the arriving time controls the volume leaving the storage but for old water the leaving time controls the volume remaining in the storage therefore the hydrodynamic dispersion increases not only the proportion of young water in discharge and but also the proportion of old water in storage in figs 5 a3 and 6 a3 the deviation of mean differences of bttd and rtd are not obvious and these mean differences fluctuate promptly around zero horizontal line depending on the transient hydraulic conditions note that all water parcels entering the system will finally leave the system so the cumulative bttd and cumulative rtd calculated from any model will always approach 1 therefore the cumulative differences of bttd and rtd between the two models are always equal to 0 that is the reason why the differences of bttd and rtd can only fluctuate around the zero line in conclusion the bttd and cumulative bttd are more sensitive to diffusion process than rtd and cumulative rtd due to the volume effect the differences between two models illustrate how the hydrodynamic dispersion affects the groundwater travel time and resident time in the hillslope 3 3 time variant sas function the time variant fsas function is evaluated based on eq 14 fig 7 presents the fsas function calculated from solute transport models and particle tracking model the fsas functions are colored by storage volume to differentiate fsas functions at different clock times and illustrate how the fsas functions change with the wet condition in the system as the rtds calculated from two models have little difference the difference of fsas function is mainly contributed by the large difference of bttd between the models in particle tracking model each single fsas function fluctuates a lot due to the large fluctuation of bttd in time but in solute transport model the hydrodynamic dispersion can smooth the bttd thus reduce the fluctuation of fsas function in other words hydrodynamic dispersion smoothens the fsas function besides the mean difference of fsas function is almost zero fig 7 a3 this indicates that the hydrodynamic dispersion smoothens the fsas function fluctuation but has little impact on the trend of storage selection preference 3 4 influence of transient flow conditions on time variant ttd rtd and sas function in the previous analysis the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd rtd and sas function is investigated based on a specific transient groundwater flow condition i e groundwater flow varies with the two year repeated rainfall input forcing generally this two year rainfall time series presents strong seasonality fig 2 leading to the seasonal variation of ttd rtd and sas function with storage volume figs 5 7 as the study aims to investigate the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on time variant ttd rtd and sas function the pattern of rainfall input time series and the associated transient groundwater flow condition are expected to determine the characteristics of ttd rtd and sas function therefore a synthetic rainfall input condition without significant seasonality is generated and applied in the same hillslope model to explore the possible influence of rainfall input condition so the findings on the influence of hydraulic dispersion are more intrinsic to the system and less impacted by the specific rainfall time series in this study the synthetic rainfall time series is generated by the compound poisson process porporato et al 2004 verma et al 2011 with given rainfall frequency and the daily rainfall amount is drawn from an exponential distribution the main reason using the compound poisson process is that the generated rainfall time series is statically stationary and has no significant seasonality fig 8 in the hillslope model with synthetic rainfall input condition the time variant ttd rtd and sas function are calculated using the method which is the same as the previous hillslope model then the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on ttd rtd and sas function is studied by analyzing the differences of these functions between the models with and without the consideration of hydrodynamic dispersion the three functions and their differences are presented in fig 9 the seasonal pattern of cumulative btcs disappears in the model with synthetic rainfall input figs 9 a1 a2 specifically both the cumulative btcs are smooth figs 9 a1 and 9 a2 comparably the cumulative btcs influenced by the seasonal variation of rainfall input model fig 4 b increase fast in wet season and slow in dry season meanwhile the differences of cumulative btcs show the same pattern for both rainfall input models fig 9 a3 to further illustrate the influence of seasonality of rainfall input on time variant ttd and rtd fig 10 presents the temporal variations of ttd and rtd in different models during the period from day 731 5 to day 731 6 range from time 0 to time 731 at the y axes of fig 10 in the hillslope model with two year repeated rainfall input referred to as model 1 both ttd and rtd show strong seasonality figs 10 a1 a2 c1 and c2 as illustrated by periodically darkening and brightening of the colors along the travel time or residence time axes therefore the temporal variations of ttd and rtd in model 1 is tightly forced by the seasonality of rainfall input however in the hillslope model with synthetic rainfall input generated by compound poisson process referred to as model 2 the seasonality of ttd and rtd disappears figs 10 b1 b2 d1 and d2 because there is no seasonality for the rainfall input even so the variations of these functions also follow the temporal variation of rainfall input i e the color is brightened when the water parcels enter at the time of high rainfall rate and is darkened when the water parcels enter at the time of low rainfall rate in summary by comparing the ttd and rtd between model 1 and model 2 in fig 10 it can be concluded that the temporal evolutions of ttd and rtd follow the temporal variation pattern of rainfall input furthermore the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on the seasonality of bttd and rtd is revealed by analyzing the differences of sub figures between the first and second columns of fig 10 firstly the volume effect still exists under different rainfall input conditions and this is illustrated as the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on rtd is unidentifiable but the influence on bttd is obvious as shown in fig 10 as for how the seasonality of bttd is influenced by the hydrodynamic dispersion it can be found that the bright lines in fig 10 are discontinuous in particle tracking model but continuous in solute transport model it should be noted that the slopes of the bright lines and dark lines shown in fig 10 are all equal to 1 i e the angles of these lines are 45 the 45 direction line has been mentioned in previous study on ttd theories calabrese and porporato 2015 it is the temporal evolution direction along which the increase rate of age travel time residence time is equal to the increase rate of time and the entering time of the water parcels at a line is the same therefore let t i denote the entering time of a certain bright dark line then the temporal evolution of this line is determined by the btc of entering time t i the seasonality of btc is analyzed previously and demonstrated in fig 4 b as such the variable increase rate of cumulative btcs fig 4 b leads to the discontinuous bright lines in particle tracking model fig 10 in other words the hydrodynamic dispersion smoothens the 2 dimensional clock time dimension and travel time dimension in fig 10 time variant bttd by increasing its continuity along the 45 direction bright lines as shown in fig 10 besides according to the differences of bttd cumulative bttd rtd cumulative rtd and sas function between solute transport model and particle model shown in figs 9 b3 f3 it can be concluded that the previous findings on the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on ttd are almost the same regardless of the seasonality of rainfall input in summary the time variant rainfall input condition and the associated transient flow condition determine the temporal variations of ttd and rtd first then the hydrodynamic dispersion which is the intrinsic property of the system further modifies the temporal variation of bttd by increasing the continuity of the 2 dimensional bttd along the 45 direction besides the findings in the previous sections are almost the same even if the pattern of temporal variation of rainfall input condition changes finally the external rainfall input forcing and intrinsic properties of the system synergistically shape the time variant ttd and rtd 3 5 spatial distribution of mean groundwater age previous results illustrate the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on btc time variant ttd rtd and fsas function to explore how hydrodynamic dispersion influences these quantities modeling of spatial distribution of mean groundwater age is conducted for several cases the mean groundwater age τ of a groundwater sample from one point is defined as the weighted average age of all water parcels in the sample 15 τ m i τ i m i where m i is mass of water parcels with age τ i in the sample the evaluation of mean groundwater age has been explored in many studies bethke and johnson 2002 2008 jiang et al 2012 and the governing equation of the evolution of mean groundwater age is 16 ϕ s w τ t ϕ s w d τ v τ ϕ s w 1 the term ϕ s w 1 in eq 16 means that the mean groundwater age increases as clock time t increases in this study three scenarios under steady state condition with the following different parameters are simulated 1 mean groundwater age with no molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion model configuration identical to particle tracking model 2 molecular diffusion coefficient d m 1 1 0 9 m 2 s longitudinal dispersivity a l 0 05 m and transverse dispersivity a t 0 01 m model configuration identical to solute transport model 3 molecular diffusion coefficient d m 1 1 0 9 m 2 s longitudinal dispersivity a l 0 5 m and transverse dispersivity a t 0 1 m to explore the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on mean groundwater age clearly all the other parameters are set to be the same fig 11 shows the modeling results of the three scenarios the black line from left to right in each sub figures is the groundwater level it can be found that the stratification of mean groundwater age is clear in both saturated zone and unsaturated zone in unsaturated zone of the three sub figures the stratification of mean groundwater age is approximately perpendicular to groundwater flow lines but in saturated zone the stratification of mean groundwater age is approximately parallel to groundwater flow line this is because the darcy velocity in unsaturated zone is much smaller than that in saturated zone then the increase of groundwater mean age along flow lines in unsaturated zone is much larger than the increase in saturated zone therefore the mean groundwater age in two adjacent flow lines is similar in unsaturated zone but the mean groundwater age increases from shallow flow line to deep flow line in saturated zone the three sub figures in fig 11 indicate the hydrodynamic dispersion increases the mean groundwater age in shallow unsaturated zone and decrease the mean groundwater age in deep saturated zone the increase of mean groundwater age is due to the mixing of newly injected water with previously injected water and the decrease of mean groundwater age is caused by the mixing of deep old water with the overlain younger water this local scale mixing process leads to the deviated cumulative btc and bttd shown in figs 4 and 5 4 conclusions the ttd provides basic information on water and solute flowing through the system it encapsulates multiple transport processes into a single mathematic function and resolves mixing process by differentiating water exiting the boundary into a series of water parcels of different ages or from different historical input events recent achievements in ttd studies improve the understanding of the control factors of variations in groundwater age composition and solute concentration hydrodynamic dispersion as an additional kinetic for water and solute transport determines the local scale mixing process and alters the groundwater age composition significantly this study illustrates how the time variant ttd rtd and fsas function are influenced by local scale mixing process i e hydrodynamic dispersion in this study the time variant ttd rtd and fsas function with the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion are simulated by solute transport model based on the ade for each rainfall event while the time variant ttd rtd and fsas function without the influence are simulated by particle tracking model the differences between the two models are compared the origins of the differences are discussed based on the physical mechanism meanwhile two kinds of rainfall time series are applied in the two models separately to investigate the influence of transient flow condition on these functions and how the hydrodynamic dispersion shapes these functions the main findings are presented below the differences of cumulative btcs between particle tracking model and solute transport model deviate to negative values for most of the time except the tails of cumulative btcs deviate to positive values this is consistent with the random velocity theory i e the hydrodynamic dispersion not only increases the velocities of some water parcels but also decrease the velocities of the other water parcels the differences of cumulative bttds between particle tracking model and solute transport model also display the similar phenomenon moreover the differences of cumulative rtds between two models deviate to negative value when the age of water is young and deviates to positive value when the age is old the length of positive deviation of rtd is much longer than that of cumulative btc and cumulative bttd these indicate how the hydrodynamic dispersion affects the portion of water and solute remaining in storage the hydrodynamic dispersion results in more young water leaving the storage and more old water remaining in the storage meanwhile the bttd and cumulative bttd are more sensitive to hydrodynamic dispersion than rtd and cumulative rtd due to the volume effect that is the storage volume is much larger than the discharge volume and hydrodynamic dispersion also smoothens the sharp fluctuations of bttd and fsas function then the difference between the results of the models with two year repeated rainfall time series from hong kong and with synthetic rainfall time series is analyzed it is found that the hydrodynamic dispersion increases the continuity of time variant 2 dimensional bttd along the 45 direction and the transient flow condition has minor impact on the previous findings on the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion in summary the transient flow condition and the intrinsic properties such as hydrodynamic dispersion synergistically shape the characteristic of time variant ttd rtd and sas function finally the influence of hydrodynamic dispersion on the spatial distribution of mean groundwater age in the system reveals how the local scale mixing process leads to the deviated cumulative btc time variant ttd and rtd this study presents an insight into the hydrodynamic dispersion controls on time variant behaviors of ttd rtd fsas function and advances the understanding of the influence of local scale mixing process on groundwater age composition and solute concentration in both storage and discharge in the system credit authorship contribution statement rong mao conceptualization methodology

2616,the hydrology and aquatic ecology of arid environments has long been understudied relative to temperate regions yet spatially and temporally intermittent and ephemeral waters characterized by flashy hydrographs typify arid regions that comprise a substantial proportion of the earth additionally drought intense storms and human modification of landscapes increasingly affect many temperate regions resulting in hydrologic regimes more similar to aridlands here we review the contributions of dr nancy grimm to aridland hydrology and ecology and applications of these insights to urban ecosystems and resilience of social ecological technological systems grimm catalyzed study of nitrogen cycling in streams and characterized feedbacks between surface water groundwater exchange nitrogen transformations and aquatic biota in aridlands outcomes of these interactions depend on short and long term variation in the hydrologic regime grimm and colleagues applied hydrological and biogeochemical insights gained from study of aridland streams to urban ecosystems integrating engineering social and behavioral sciences and geography these studies evolved from characterizing the spatial heterogeneity of urban systems i e watersheds novel aquatic systems and its influence on nutrient dynamics to an approach that evaluated human decision making as a driver of disturbance regimes and changes in ecosystem function finally grimm and colleagues have applied principles of urban ecology to look toward the future of cities considering scenarios of sustainable and resilient futures we identify cross cutting themes and approaches that have motivated discoveries across grimm s multi decadal career including spatial and temporal heterogeneity hydrologic connectivity and regime disturbance systems thinking and resilience finally we emphasize grimm s broad contributions to science via support of long term research dedication to mentoring and extensive collaborations that facilitated transdisciplinary research data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction hydrology and freshwater ecology developed as scientific disciplines based primarily on observations of perennial water bodies yet spatially and temporally intermittent and ephemeral waters characterized by flashy hydrographs typify arid and semiarid regions which occupy 41 of the earth s terrestrial surface and support 2 5 billion people including some of the largest and fastest growing urban centers fang and jawitz 2019 gaur and squires 2018 further climate warming and water use have reduced groundwater recharge rates cuthbert et al 2019 and surface flows zipper et al 2021 in many regions study of hydrology and aquatic ecology in the frequently disturbed and disconnected ecosystems of aridlands therefore provides opportunities to advance hydrologic and ecological theory yielding insights relevant to sustainable management of water resources in aridlands as well as in drying humid ecosystems scientific discovery in aridland hydrology has progressed rapidly in the last two decades including the broad research portfolio of dr nancy grimm here we review her contributions to hydrology aquatic ecology biogeochemistry and sustainability science fig 1 grimm s research is rooted in rigorous observation of desert streams in arizona usa and focused on the extreme hydrologic variability of the desert with collaborators grimm s studies of desert streams revealed rapid rates of ecological succession following disturbance by flash floods where hydrologic connectivity and supply of limiting nutrients from the catchment support recovery to pre disturbance conditions fisher et al 1982 valett et al 1994 martí et al 1997 this research brought concepts from landscape ecology to riverscapes finding that the composition and configuration of dynamic hydrologically connected terrestrial and aquatic patches affect the amount and forms of nutrients exported downstream as the footprint of urban areas grew in the american southwest it became impossible to ignore the interactions with and effects of urban ecosystems on regional hydrology and ecology grimm and colleagues established the central arizona phoenix long term ecological research program cap lter and grimm served as its principal investigator for 19 years engaging engineers social and behavioral scientists geographers and ecologists to study urban ecosystems the cap lter has highlighted how human decision making and landscape design drive hydrological and biogeochemical function and resultant ecosystem services subsequently grimm s team has applied principles of urban ecology to scenario analyses used in evaluating strategies for sustainable use of water in cities iwaniec et al 2020b sampson et al 2020 grimm s expansive reach in hydrology and ecology developed from her synthetic approach and engagement as a collaborative scientist fig 2 she cultivates an overall vision of possibilities and interconnected concepts often seeding ideas among cohorts of students postdoctoral researchers and colleagues who grow under her mentorship and collaboration here we review dr grimm s boundary spanning contributions to hydrology focusing on integration across disparate disciplines and highlight how she has envisioned and fulfilled research needs to support a more sustainable and resilient future 2 ecology and biogeochemistry of aridland streams and catchments 2 1 nitrogen dynamics in streams grimm s nitrogen n budgets of a desert stream shaped decades of subsequent stream ecology by documenting rapid exchange among n pools in stream channels e g grimm 1987 quantitative whole ecosystem budgets of energy and materials became a mainstay of aquatic ecology after howard and eugene odum constructed energy budgets of a lagoon and spring fed stream to investigate relationships among steady state standing stocks and productivity odum 1957 odum and odum 1955 subsequent application of the budget approach in streams revealed terrestrial support of stream metabolism fisher and likens 1973 and the role of stream discharge in retention of phosphorus meyer and likens 1979 until the 1980s however budgets for freshwater ecosystems focused on energy and phosphorus owing to the legacy of research in phosphorus limited lakes and temperate streams these budgets typically captured variation on seasonal or annual timescales grimm and colleagues constructed n budgets for an n limited desert stream sycamore creek az usa at diel and successional i e following flash floods timescales that demonstrated widespread n limitation of primary production grimm et al 1981 grimm and fisher 1986 the budget approach quantified mechanisms of n retention finding more rapid exchange among biotic pools of n than in forested streams grimm 1987 in addition to describing rapid uptake of n from the water column by algae grimm s careful estimates of n fluxes and storage established that ingestion of n by macroinvertebrates accounts for a significant fraction of the n retained by the stream 10 thereby reducing the processing length of n particularly late in succession following flash floods grimm 1988 in turn n recycled by macroinvertebrates alleviates limitation of primary production grimm 1988 thus in addition to establishing n as a potentially limiting nutrient in lotic ecosystems the budget approach demonstrated biogeochemical links among biological communities and ecosystem processes that are in turn shaped by hydrologic variation this work now stands as a textbook example by which undergraduate students learn about rapid nutrient recycling as a mechanism for nutrient retention in ecosystems sher and molles 2021 studies at sycamore creek contributed to growing recognition of n limitation in streams e g naiman and melillo 1984 triska et al 1984 that was leveraged to support the lotic intersite nitrogen experiment linx linx generated cross biome insights into n cycling in streams by convening one of the largest collaborative groups funded by the division of environmental biology us national science foundation at its establishment in 1996 linx collaborators 2014 in its first stage the linx project applied a novel stable isotope tracer approach to quantify retention and transformation of ammonium finding high capacity for n retention in headwater streams due to assimilation by algae and microbial heterotrophs peterson et al 2001 webster et al 2003 the tracer approach also demonstrated flow of n from aquatic to terrestrial food webs sanzone et al 2003 a second phase addressed nitrate retention and denitrification across streams draining wildland urban and agricultural land covers a decline in retention efficiency with n concentration and in simplified channels of urban streams implied reduced capacity for n retention by stream networks subject to anthropogenic n loading and channel modification grimm et al 2005 martin et al 2011 mulholland et al 2008 grimm contributed to the vision and momentum of linx while also establishing several mentees as equal collaborators in the project 2 2 floods droughts and temporal dynamics of stream riparian corridors desert streams provide an opportunity and imperative to study temporal variation in n budgets caused by floods and droughts existing theory synthesized by odum 1969 established that succession proceeds toward balanced production and respiration closed material cycles high biodiversity and large body sizes however these predictions were derived largely from studies of terrestrial ecosystems grimm and colleagues developed and tested ecological theory of disturbance and succession in desert streams recovering from flash floods fisher et al 1982 though a desert stream accumulated biomass and recycled inorganic nutrients with increasing efficiency through successional time as predicted by odum production exceeded respiration and biota remained characterized by a similar group of small bodied short lived invertebrate species fisher et al 1982 contrasts in successional dynamics between streams and terrestrial ecosystems resulted because of greater relative rates of material exchange with adjacent ecosystems and more frequent disturbances in streams successional dynamics of limiting nutrients also conformed to expectations from terrestrial ecosystems where n retention defined as the difference between inputs and outputs was hypothesized to increase in early succession due to biotic uptake followed by a decline in late succession as accumulation of biomass approaches a steady state vitousek and reiners 1975 as predicted n uptake in the stream recycling of n by macroinvertebrates and n fixation by cyanobacteria increased rapidly in a desert stream following scouring floods and typically declined due to nutrient limitation in late succession fig 3 grimm 1988 1987 grimm et al 1981 grimm and petrone 1997 martí et al 1997 however succession proceeded more rapidly in the stream than in terrestrial ecosystems weeks vs decades grimm s research capitalized on the opportunity afforded by desert streams to observe multiple floods within each season and to place successional dynamics within the context of longer term variation in hydrologic conditions for example invertebrate communities that reassemble after floods preceded by drought differ from communities that develop when floods occur within wetter periods boulton et al 1992 in another example grimm s research found local extinctions of drought intolerant taxa from sycamore creek have contributed to decadal scale change in invertebrate communities boulton et al 1992 sponseller et al 2010 likewise spatial patterns in the distribution of stream biota result in part from availability of aquatic habitat as stream networks contract heterogeneously during drying stanley et al 1997 water persists in the surface and shallow subsurface at locations where the stream channel is narrow and bedrock is near the streambed surface these locations provide refugia for biota such as macrophytes characteristic of wetlands particularly during dry years dong et al 2016 characterizing the effects of antecedent hydrologic conditions on material export from streams required understanding material processing and transport in hydrologically connected riparian zones and rill networks grimm s group described build up of resources during dry periods followed by rapid transformation and or transport during subsequent precipitation and runoff for example experimental rain events following dry seasons yielded greater emissions of greenhouse gases from riparian soils than during wet seasons harms and grimm 2012 similarly solutes accumulate in upland soils during dry periods followed by flushing transformation and transport to streams during storms at rates proportional to antecedent precipitation and discharge fisher and grimm 1985 harms and grimm 2010 welter et al 2005 accordingly grimm and colleagues developed a conceptual model predicting biogeochemical responses to interactions of antecedent hydrologic conditions with precipitation events by linking the precipitation trigger to downgradient hydrologic transfer followed by pulses of biological activity that may result in gaseous or hydrologic losses of materials or to accumulating material reserves belnap et al 2005 finally studying aridland catchments as a model system exposed potential ecological effects of a hydrologic cycle increasingly altered by climate change and patterns of water use by humans grimm and fisher 1992 2 3 functional role of the hyporheic zone grimm and colleagues extended the focal extent of stream research from surface waters into the hyporheic zone i e the zone of streambed sediments where surface water exchanges with the subsurface water prior studies of the hyporheic zone emphasized its role as habitat or refuge for biota coleman and hynes 1970 tóth 1963 research at sycamore creek confirmed the migration of invertebrates deeper into hyporheic sediments during stream drying clinton et al 1996 however previous studies had not explicitly addressed the biogeochemical contributions of the hyporheic zone grimm fisher 1984 measured rates of respiration and nitrate retention in hyporheic sediments that were comparable to the surface stream these observations catalyzed a paradigm shift in stream ecology to encompass the vertical dimension of streams encompassing the hyporheic zone and surface water groundwater interactions boulton et al 1998 dahm et al 1998 and later horizontal connectivity with parafluvial and riparian zones holmes et al 1998 1994 lewis et al 2007 hydrologists had previously recognized exchange between surface and subsurface water vaux 1962 this exchange was visually apparent at sites of upwelling i e subsurface to surface water exchange and downwelling i e surface to subsurface water exchange in desert streams grimm and fisher s group was among the first to document elevated concentrations of inorganic nutrients downstream of upwellings and subsequent ecological and biogeochemical implications grimm et al 1981 valett 1992 decomposition and mineralization in hyporheic sediments supplied nutrients to the surface channel at locations of groundwater upwelling jones et al 1995 which in turn favored algal growth and more rapid recovery of biota following floods valett et al 1994 the distinctive distribution of algae shaped by the location of upwellings modified water velocity and nutrient availability in surface water at patch scales increasing spatial heterogeneity of algal communities at the reach scale fisher et al 1998a holmes et al 1998 observations of sycamore creek demonstrated that hydrologic and ecological processes occurring as a result of surface water groundwater interactions generate spatial patterns in stream nutrient concentrations spatial patterns associated with upwelling from the hyporheic zone were observed over spatial extents from meters to kilometers dent et al 2001 patchiness in nutrient concentration increased through successional time due to fragmentation of surface flow and a stronger influence of biotic activity and abiotic features in isolated pools later in succession dent et al 2001 dent and grimm 1999 however colonization of the channel by wetland vegetation following removal of cattle from the catchment diminished the effect of surface water groundwater exchange on spatial variation in surface water nutrient concentrations dong et al 2017 2 4 hydrologic connectivity and patch dynamics the characteristics of desert streams with open channels permeable and mobile substrate and nutrient limited biota provided a natural laboratory for addressing central questions in landscape ecology concerned with the role of connectivity following discovery of the dominant role of hydrologic exchange with the hyporheic zone on the ecology and biogeochemistry of desert streams grimm fisher s group examined how hydrologic connections between the wetted stream channel parafluvial and riparian zones interacted with spatial heterogeneity in nutrient stocks and flows to cause spatial and temporal variation in biogeochemical processes fisher et al 1998a their research showed that water chemistry changes as water flows through the fluvial landscape because the physical and biological characteristics of each patch type influence water residence time and bioreactive capacity holmes et al 1996 martí et al 2000 as a consequence the length of flowpaths through each patch influences concentrations of bioreactive elements holmes et al 1994 expansion of studies into adjacent desert floodplains and riparian zones emphasized how the magnitude and direction of hydrologic connectivity interacts with patch specific rates of organic matter water and nutrient accumulation to influence nutrient retention capacity lewis et al 2009 in contrast to surface waters the concentration of dissolved inorganic n in riparian groundwaters is greater less temporally variable and governed by localized n cycling rather than by advection lewis et al 2006 resulting in spatially heterogeneous n availability lewis et al 2007 patchy n availability is due at least in part to spatial heterogeneity in rates of n retaining processes including uptake of n from subsurface flowpaths by n limited riparian plants schade et al 2005 2001 and denitrification fueled by heterogeneous accumulation of organic matter in riparian soils harms and grimm 2008 thus flows from riparian zones to stream channels are typically low in nitrate but high in dissolved organic matter except during floods when inputs of inorganic nutrients can overwhelm capacity for nutrient retention in riparian zones harms and grimm 2008 schade et al 2002 at a broader extent organic rich floodplain soils develop along gaining reaches where water is delivered from riparian zones to streams along shallow flowpaths supporting spatially extensive denitrification whereas sparsely vegetated sandy soils typical of hydrologically losing reaches support denitrification only in small patches harms et al 2009 observations of spatial heterogeneity within stream riparian corridors emphasized that spatial heterogeneity and hydrologic connectivity are dynamic properties of fluvial landscapes this perspective contributed to developing the concepts of hot spots and hot moments defined as locations and times supporting significantly greater biogeochemical activity relative to average rates mcclain et al 2003 hot spots and hot moments often occur due to hydrologic transport or activation of limiting reactants which are facilitated in aridlands by prolonged dry periods followed by intense precipitation e g austin et al 2004 belnap et al 2005 collins et al 2014 overall grimm and colleagues demonstrated how the dynamic mosaics of hydrologically interconnected patches comprising fluvial ecosystems influence population community and ecosystem processes contributing to general ecological theory focused on landscape ecology and connectivity grimm et al 2003 townsend 1989 winemiller et al 2010 in aridlands disturbances such as floods drought and fire modify the distribution of patches and their material stores as well as the magnitude and direction of hydrologic flowpaths dahm et al 1998 jacobs et al 2007 lewis et al 2006 ye and grimm 2013 ecosystem processes such as in stream nutrient retention capacity are sensitive to such disturbances though spatial heterogeneity also supports resilience martí et al 1997 a conceptual and numerical model the telescoping ecosystem model formalized the role of hydrologic connectivity among patch types within stream riparian corridors emphasizing that ecosystem function e g nutrient retention depends on hydrologic connectivity among patches and the relative sensitivity of each patch to perturbations fisher et al 1998b 3 urban ecosystems 3 1 a move into the urban domain in 1997 a new era of grimm s work began with funding of the central arizona phoenix long term ecological research program cap lter one of only two urban focused lter sites at its founding with the baltimore ecosystem study and now the minneapolis st paul metropolitan area this launched more than two decades of research into how urban development shapes ecological biogeochemical and hydrological processes when the cap lter began in 1997 urban ecology was a nascent field dominated by ecologists who were still focused on studying how urban ecosystems were degraded in comparison to natural ecosystems and urban hydrology was largely the domain of engineers the cap lter initially addressed whether ecological theory could be applied to urban ecosystems or whether modified theories were required to accommodate novel processes in urban ecosystems kaye et al 2006 urban ecology emerged as a distinct discipline with the recognition that human activities social systems and policies drive and respond to ecological and hydrological processes collins et al 2000 grimm et al 2000 a framework developed by scientists at the baltimore and phoenix lter sites characterizes ecology in of and for cities pickett et al 2016 this framing describes approaches for studying urban ecology ranging from characterization of urban ecological features as analogs of non urban ecosystems in to a systems approach that incorporates ecological built and social components of to a paradigm of applying ecological principles to advance urban sustainability for pickett et al 2016 research at the cap lter has included all of these approaches and grimm s perspective as an aquatic ecosystem ecologist was critical to early adoption of a more integrative and systems based approach her work in desert streams where the definition of a stream is regularly challenged due to spatially and temporally variable hydrology relative to mesic streams prepared her to think broadly and creatively about cities and their highly engineered hydrobiogeochemistry early work at the cap lter addressed urban ecology from local to regional scales and integrated ecology in the city to test ecological theory with assessment of feedbacks between landscape mosaics and ecological function ecology of the city a major goal of this work was to test whether urban ecosystems conformed to existing ecological frameworks if those frameworks were expanded to include social components these ideas later led to application of social ecological systems ses and more recently social ecological technological systems sets concepts to characterize feedbacks among human decision making and social networks built infrastructure and ecosystem services grimm 2020 mcphearson et al 2022 2016 these increasingly interdisciplinary frameworks were broadened even further by grimm and colleagues particularly those associated with the baltimore ecosystem study to become transdisciplinary efforts that explicitly engaged communities and stakeholders in undertaking ecology for the city cook et al 2021 felson et al 2013 grove et al 2016 helmrich et al 2020 larson et al 2013 pickett et al 2013 3 2 ecohydrology in cities in early urban ecological research of the cap lter grimm and her group contributed to ecohydrology by characterizing how hydrology and land use in urban areas influence the nature and drivers of spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemical processes and by recognizing urban watersheds and wetlands as novel ecosystems with unique hydrology and associated biogeochemistry urban ecosystems often contain hot spots and hot moments of biogeochemical activity because of extreme manipulation of water and material fluxes including pollutant loading and runoff generation kaye et al 2006 for example soil properties across the greater phoenix metropolitan area such as inorganic n concentrations organic matter and soil moisture were all associated with population density latitude impervious surfaces and presence of lawns hope et al 2005 jenerette et al 2006 zhu et al 2006 however decreased spatial heterogeneity in soils of urban areas compared to non urban counterparts suggests homogenizing effects of urbanization jenerette et al 2006 atmospheric deposition of carbon sulfate and nitrogen provide one such mechanism of spatial homogenization in resource availability cook et al 2018 lohse et al 2008 these patterns are important because terrestrial soil moisture and biogeochemistry directly influence runoff generation and pollutant loading hydrologic change in cities occurs via rerouting of flowpaths by engineered structures and introduction of land cover types that change infiltration rates and plant soil interactions grimm et al 2004 the timing and trajectories of urban development determine long term patterns in urban hydrology and introduce non linear changes older urban developments typically contain conveyance focused stormwater infrastructure instead of retention features in turn affecting downstream hydrologic regimes hopkins et al 2015a however urban hydrological patterns in phoenix do not conform to expected patterns of increased flashiness found in most mesic cities hopkins et al 2015b mcphillips et al 2019 rather flashiness declines with urbanization compared to the naturally flashy discharge regime of desert streams likely due to increased retention from artificial surface water bodies and engineered stormwater retention fig 4 mcphillips et al 2019 roach et al 2008 redistribution of water in urban ecosystems results in changes to the locations and timing of carbon and nutrient inputs and transformations impervious surfaces accumulate n which is then flushed during storms lewis and grimm 2007 receiving streams and channels can retain or transform these materials but as in desert streams the attributes of hydrologic flowpaths including connectivity with adjacent patches influence the magnitude of carbon and nutrient transformations within urban streams and channels reduced channel complexity e g straightening concrete lining and increased nutrient loading can result in longer n spiraling length indicating reduced retention compared to wildland counterparts grimm et al 2005 patterns in concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc in urban channels of phoenix exemplify how human altered hydrologic connectivity influences material loads and processing additions of water from wastewater treatment plants and connection of surface waters with aquifers via pumping from deep wells have generated longitudinal patterns in doc concentration and rates of decomposition uv oxidation and sorption along rivers draining phoenix edmonds and grimm 2011 despite diminished nutrient retention in urban streams engineered features such as canals stormwater management infrastructure and constructed lakes comprise biogeochemical hot spots in urban catchments for example lakes and stormwater basins receive high nutrient loads and promote longer water residence time conditions that support n retention processes such as denitrification bettez and groffman 2012 larson and grimm 2012 roach et al 2008 roach and grimm 2011 zhu et al 2004 at larger scales the distribution of stormwater infrastructure such as the density of retention basins designed to detain and infiltrate runoff moderates urban runoff and n dynamics during storms hale et al 2014 indeed the retention of water is associated with the physical retention of nutrients in stormwater even though biogeochemical retention e g through denitrification does not contribute substantially to nutrient retention during storms lewis and grimm 2007 hale et al 2015 in addition to these intentionally engineered hydrological interventions grimm and colleagues documented abundant accidental wetlands in phoenix and other metropolitan regions palta et al 2017 these wetlands are fed by irrigation elsewhere in the catchment infiltration and inflow from sewer lines and outflows from wastewater treatment plants accidental wetlands are novel ecosystems that support water quality habitat and cultural ecosystem services palta et al 2017 thus urban infrastructure and novel urban patch types provide replacements for native watershed elements e g low order streams leading to distinct hydrologic patterns in urban watersheds compared to non urban counterparts novel types of aquatic ecosystems in cities emphasize that maintenance of ecosystem functions in urban ecosystems requires appropriate goals and attention to physio geographic setting booth and jackson 1997 ehrenfeld 2000 grimm et al 2008b 3 3 an integrated systems approach to ecohydrology of cities early studies of the hydrology and biogeochemistry of urban aquatic ecosystems in the city were strongly suggestive of coupling between social and ecological components importantly humans respond to system dynamics in ways that further alter the system such as by adding algaecide to lakes or creating new hydrologic infrastructure collins et al 2000 grimm et al 2005 kaye et al 2006 paul and meyer 2008 walsh et al 2005 studying such feedbacks requires an integrated systems approach to the ecohydrology of cities thus urban ecohydrology in phoenix progressed from characterizing spatial heterogeneity and its influence on nutrient dynamics in studies parallel to those conducted in non urban desert watersheds to an approach that evaluated human decision making as a driver of disturbance regimes and changes in ecosystem function these findings necessitated modified ecological theories that encompass cities grimm et al 2017 4 toward eco hydrology for cities under grimm s leadership findings from cap lter s first 25 years have been integrated into rich conceptual frameworks that redefine our understanding of ecological resilience and disturbance this integration resulted from efforts to bridge the natural and social sciences through collaboration between researchers and practitioners coupling methodologies and frameworks across disciplines including ecology geography civil and environmental engineering sustainability science and anthropology as project co lead grimm s focus on biogeochemistry of urban waterways transitioned to interdisciplinary frameworks that led to a social ecological technological systems sets approach for improving urban resilience grimm et al 2017 kim et al 2021b 4 1 designed ecosystems an ecology for cities approach explicitly recognizes that humans respond to the functioning of a system such as the provisioning of ecosystem services or disservices grimm et al 2005 and disturbances grimm et al 2017 for example socio ecological feedbacks have promoted shifts from gray to green or nature based infrastructure e g protected or restored floodplains rain gardens in response to disturbances such as floods that increase awareness of the limitations of older infrastructure in addition to a desire for the many ancillary benefits beyond stormwater retention that designed ecosystems or nature based infrastructure can provide hobbie and grimm 2020 there has been a shift from a focus on pipe and storage tank based drainage systems to increased integration of vegetated basins swales and roofs for stormwater management mcphillips and matsler 2018 in understanding that cities are fundamentally designed systems grimm s work recognized early on that urban ecological research could and should be used to help design urban ecosystems to maximize potential benefits designed ecosystems generally do not represent complete ecosystem restoration but can provide multiple ecosystem services for example the rio salado project in central arizona created several acres of riparian habitat and returned flows to previously dry sections of the salt river but the naturally flashy hydrological regime was not restored because of the desire to protect the existing built environment larson et al 2013 shifts may also occur through the opening of policy windows by co occurrence of problems solutions and policies for example communities managing combined sewer overflows were more likely to use green infrastructure following guidance on green infrastructure from the us environmental protection agency hopkins et al 2018 these examples demonstrate how urban ecohydrology research can be explicitly directed to inform management and policy considerations 4 2 future scenarios visioning urban ecology can contribute to maximizing potential ecosystem services provided by urban sets such as mitigation of floods and urban heat islands hobbie and grimm 2020 mcphearson et al 2022 grimm and colleagues are contributing to realizing the potential of urban sets by expanding research from understanding social ecological dynamics in cities to include informing scenarios to guide cities toward desirable and sustainable futures grimm et al 2013 specifically grimm and colleagues recognized that urban ecosystems can be re imagined to maximize ecosystem services including flood protection habitat water quality regulation and a sense of place grimm et al 2008a in phoenix grimm convened an interdisciplinary team focused on developing alternative positive and long term scenarios for the city that include strategies for managing projected extremes in precipitation and temperature scenarios are a tool for building shared and innovative ideas to enhance future resilience and decision making in the face of climate change and other uncertainty the series of workshops sought co production of transformative possibilities in that researchers worked side by side with municipal county state federal tribal and community decision makers to generate visions of a more sustainable resilient and socially equitable future iwaniec et al 2020b 2020a the workshops resulted in six regional scenarios https sustainability innovation asu edu future scenarios that proposed and questioned ideas about urban hydrology rewilding water conservation walkable cities drought or heat resilience iwaniec et al 2020b fig 5 importantly the co production process was integrated with creative works multi criteria assessments berbés blázquez et al 2021 urban systems models including hydrological land use and temperature modelling iwaniec et al 2020a sampson et al 2020 and climate policy analyses iwaniec et al 2020b kim et al 2021b sampson et al 2020 applied the scenario outcomes to identify and compare alternative water management and policy pathways by projecting how land use and water related strategies influenced water use demand and conservation for example anticipated decreases in surface water allocations could be adequately managed by changing future land use and associated water demand in addition to policies supporting use of greywater reclaimed water and rainwater harvesting sampson et al 2020 fig 5 grimm expanded application of futures research and participatory methods to nine cities in the united states and latin america with the urban resilience to extremes sustainability research network urex srn iwaniec et al 2021b collaborative groups comprising a total of 200 researchers and practitioners co produced over 50 sustainable visions of 2080 aimed at heat drought and flood adaptation and sustainability transformations berbés blázquez et al 2021 cook et al 2021 hamstead et al 2021 iwaniec et al 2021a a common feature in many of these scenarios was implementation or leveraging of urban ecological infrastructure for managing flood risk as well as other ecosystem services for example the eco wetland city scenario in valdivia chile included protection of wetlands and new ecological infrastructure as strategies for maintaining ecosystem services under changing climate in addition to exploring ecological and hydrological benefits of urban ecological infrastructure urexsrn efforts sought to understand the social benefits of each strategy mcphearson et al 2022 pallathadka et al 2022 4 3 synthesis 4 3 1 core and emergent concepts grounding in key ecological and hydrological principles has motivated grimm s discoveries which integrate the components of her expansive research program foremost grimm applies systems thinking which focuses on interactions among multiple interdependent parts and emphasizes feedbacks among them for example in streams grimm and colleagues pioneered research into surface water groundwater interactions with the hyporheic zone which supported hot spots of biogeochemical reactions biotic diversity and primary production e g boulton et al 1998 clinton et al 1996 holmes et al 1996 jones et al 1995 in the urban domain grimm was instrumental in developing the concept of social ecological technological systems sets and applied a sets perspective to study dynamics of urban and ecohydrological systems chang et al 2021 grimm et al 2017 mcphearson et al 2022 for example the sets concept has aided in understanding how elements of the social ecological and technological domains all contribute to and interact to influence vulnerability to flooding chang et al 2021 study of ecological responses to disturbance particularly those caused by variation in hydrologic regimes organizes grimm s research across wildland to urban domains the obvious role of floods and droughts in structuring the physical template and biological processes of desert streams motivated a research program integrating hydrology and ecology of desert streams the opportunity to study multiple disturbance events in a single year in contrast to terrestrial ecosystems where succession occurs on multi decadal time scales accelerated contributions of this program to general ecological theory fisher et al 1982 grimm 1987 grimm and petrone 1997 sponseller et al 2010 in urban ecosystems grimm and her colleagues considered how disturbances may affect and be amplified by sets dynamics such as exploring how nature based infrastructure can help manage and reduce impacts of hazards in social ecological and technical domains hobbie and grimm 2020 a focus on succession following disturbance led to incorporating concepts of resilience in particular addressing the speed and trajectories of recovery by algal and invertebrate communities and ecosystem processes following floods boulton et al 1992 grimm and fisher 1989 stanley et al 1994 in cities grimm and colleagues promoted planning for transformation of infrastructure toward systems that are resilient to extreme weather events andersson et al 2022 kim et al 2021a in general research into sets has shown that shifting management approaches from flood control such as dams or canals toward safe to fail approaches such as sports fields that also serve as stormwater retention basins supports resilience to floods kim et al 2017 muñoz erickson et al 2021 all domains of grimm s research program have characterized the role of temporal and spatial heterogeneity and hydrologic connectivity among diverse patch types in supporting ecosystem function and resilience to disturbance in desert streams distinct patch types comprising the stream riparian corridor support differential rates of ecosystem processes e g nitrogen retention and hydrologic connections among them facilitate ecosystem recovery from floods fisher et al 1998a grimm et al 1991 valett et al 1994 in urban ecosystems the spatial heterogeneity of land cover land use and infrastructure interacts with patterns of hydrologic connection and disconnection to drive nutrient transformation export and hydrological functioning of urban watersheds hale et al 2014 hopkins et al 2015b larson and grimm 2012 lewis and grimm 2007 redistribution of water in cities forms novel aquatic patch types such as lakes and wetlands that support rates of biogeochemical processes and water retention distinct from wildlands grimm et al 2005 hale et al 2015 handler et al 2022 larson and grimm 2012 palta et al 2017 roach et al 2008 broadly grimm s work is characterized by another form of connectivity that is by bridging between concepts or among traditionally separate scientific disciplines in early work on desert streams for example she pursued interactions between nitrogen cycling and communities of algae and macroinvertebrates e g grimm 1987 1988 which had traditionally been the domains of ecosystem and community ecology respectively further she placed this work within the context of hydrologic variation i e floods and droughts that in turn fostered subsequent studies integrating hydrologic connectivity and spatial heterogeneity e g dent et al 2001 bridging central concepts from landscape ecology with biogeochemistry similarly grimm s work in cities has bridged ecosystem science with social sciences design and sustainability connections that seem natural or essential now were new and challenging in their early days such as including human behaviors to understand urban hydrology e g larson et al 2005 roach et al 2008 collaborations between social scientists and ecologists for example required years to find common language and understand how to collaborate across vastly different epistemologies one of grimm s key contributions to all of these fields has been providing spaces for these conversations and these connections to happen through her brave leadership style and inclusive transdisciplinary mentorship 4 4 practices of a path breaking scientist much has been written about the attributes of productive scientists typically identifying qualities such as persistence and curiosity fortunato et al 2018 gotian 2022 jensen 2018 that are exemplified by grimm beyond these general attributes grimm s boundary spanning career is distinguished by a collaborative interdisciplinary approach with research rooted in observations that have contributed long term perspectives along with a commitment to mentoring the next generation of scientists grimm s contributions to hydrology derive from a hypothetico deductive approach based on observations for example observations of successional and biogeochemical responses to variation in the magnitude and timing of precipitation and floods in desert streams e g fisher et al 1982 grimm and fisher 1984 welter et al 2005 led to mechanistic research on the influence of surface water groundwater interactions and hydrologic connectivity dent and grimm 1999 holmes et al 1994 martí et al 1997 schade et al 2001 valett et al 1994 this empirical research in turn supported conceptual and numerical models applicable beyond aridland catchments that incorporated pulsed dynamics hydrologic transport and hydrologic connectivity within heterogeneous ecosystems belnap et al 2005 collins et al 2014 fisher et al 1998a while grimm s contributions to hydrology expanded across domains she also persisted in supporting long term investigations of key ecosystems for over 40 years she has studied sycamore creek az characterizing relationships between ecology and long term variation in the hydrologic regime caused by climate oscillations long term drought and changing land management dong et al 2017 sponseller et al 2010 the long term record at sycamore creek motivated its inclusion as a core aquatic site in the national ecological observatory network neon ensuring its continuation for 25 years she has led or contributed to efforts at cap lter to support ongoing data collection related to regional water quality biogeochemistry and hydrology in central arizona grimm s collaborative approach has been a keystone of her productive career as she recognized the value of engaging diverse expertise and perspectives to understand complex systems and identify feasible solutions key collaborative efforts include establishment of the fisher grimm group in stream ecology at arizona state university a foundational role in linx the first large cross site collaborative group in stream ecology cross ecosystem synthesis groups at the national center for ecological analysis and synthesis and the national socio environmental synthesis center and leadership of multiple interdisciplinary groups comprised of social scientists engineers and ecologists studying urban sets e g cap lter urex srn natura nature based solutions for urban resilience in the anthropocene innovations from these collaborative groups arose from the synthesis of perspectives drawn from across networks and domains forcing reassessment of existing ideas for example urexsrn championed a sets perspective bringing together large teams of collaborators from ecology hydrology social sciences and engineering with city managers and planners consultants and ngos iwaniec et al 2021b kim et al 2021b muñoz erickson et al 2021 similarly the collaborative natura project brought together practitioners and academics in africa asia pacific europe north america and latin america to synthesize and share knowledge on the use benefits and potential tradeoffs of nature based solutions for mitigating natural hazards and impacts of climate change across global urban contexts by creating a research agenda that supports co production between academic research teams community organizations and municipal and tribal governments grimm embeds social ecological and engineering perspectives into sustainability and amplifies marginalized voices in planning for the future of urban watersheds e g guardaro et al 2020 grimm uses her role in every initiative as an opportunity to advance the practice of higher education and uplift the next generation of leaders within and outside of academia she curates research groups without consideration of traditional disciplinary boundaries provides the space for collaborators including students to pursue their own directions and defends their ability to do so the freedom afforded to these groups has led to surprises and provided opportunities for early career scientists to play leadership roles in addition to sharing resources and opportunities with mentees grimm shares freely of her ideas and approaches to science she leads by example with consistent complete intellectual engagement in the topic at hand whether planning an experiment crafting a proposal or analyzing the literature this skill in finding the most interesting crux of any topic or task provides intellectual guidance and motivation her constant pursuit of connections among seemingly disparate projects ideas and approaches has led her more than 60 graduate and postdoctoral mentees to find careers well beyond the cities desert streams or basic science in which they were trained grimm s mentees many of whom continue to collaborate together e g writing this synthesis have applied their training in collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches to generate new insights in ecohydrology biogeochemistry urban ecology landscape ecology sustainability sciences and beyond in addition to her own research group grimm has led or co led several programs explicitly focused on training and mentoring the nsf supported integrative graduate education and research traineeship igert in urban ecology 2005 2013 for example emphasized leadership and interdisciplinarity grimm and co leaders provided resources and guidance to enable student initiated collaborative research integrating frameworks research questions and methods across disciplinary fields recently grimm co founded a graduate training program in earth systems science for the anthropocene essa at arizona state university which leverages community embedded transdisciplinary research across social biophysical and engineering domains essa provides transdisciplinary training with an emphasis on co production of knowledge networked mentoring diversity of knowledge systems and individual skill development other graduate training initiatives have focused on networking among early career professionals working on nature based solutions including international learning exchanges and fellowships that offer non traditional academic and research experiences 5 conclusions as mentees of dr grimm we are grateful for the many lessons learned both in the office and out over meals or while wading through a stream

2616,the hydrology and aquatic ecology of arid environments has long been understudied relative to temperate regions yet spatially and temporally intermittent and ephemeral waters characterized by flashy hydrographs typify arid regions that comprise a substantial proportion of the earth additionally drought intense storms and human modification of landscapes increasingly affect many temperate regions resulting in hydrologic regimes more similar to aridlands here we review the contributions of dr nancy grimm to aridland hydrology and ecology and applications of these insights to urban ecosystems and resilience of social ecological technological systems grimm catalyzed study of nitrogen cycling in streams and characterized feedbacks between surface water groundwater exchange nitrogen transformations and aquatic biota in aridlands outcomes of these interactions depend on short and long term variation in the hydrologic regime grimm and colleagues applied hydrological and biogeochemical insights gained from study of aridland streams to urban ecosystems integrating engineering social and behavioral sciences and geography these studies evolved from characterizing the spatial heterogeneity of urban systems i e watersheds novel aquatic systems and its influence on nutrient dynamics to an approach that evaluated human decision making as a driver of disturbance regimes and changes in ecosystem function finally grimm and colleagues have applied principles of urban ecology to look toward the future of cities considering scenarios of sustainable and resilient futures we identify cross cutting themes and approaches that have motivated discoveries across grimm s multi decadal career including spatial and temporal heterogeneity hydrologic connectivity and regime disturbance systems thinking and resilience finally we emphasize grimm s broad contributions to science via support of long term research dedication to mentoring and extensive collaborations that facilitated transdisciplinary research data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction hydrology and freshwater ecology developed as scientific disciplines based primarily on observations of perennial water bodies yet spatially and temporally intermittent and ephemeral waters characterized by flashy hydrographs typify arid and semiarid regions which occupy 41 of the earth s terrestrial surface and support 2 5 billion people including some of the largest and fastest growing urban centers fang and jawitz 2019 gaur and squires 2018 further climate warming and water use have reduced groundwater recharge rates cuthbert et al 2019 and surface flows zipper et al 2021 in many regions study of hydrology and aquatic ecology in the frequently disturbed and disconnected ecosystems of aridlands therefore provides opportunities to advance hydrologic and ecological theory yielding insights relevant to sustainable management of water resources in aridlands as well as in drying humid ecosystems scientific discovery in aridland hydrology has progressed rapidly in the last two decades including the broad research portfolio of dr nancy grimm here we review her contributions to hydrology aquatic ecology biogeochemistry and sustainability science fig 1 grimm s research is rooted in rigorous observation of desert streams in arizona usa and focused on the extreme hydrologic variability of the desert with collaborators grimm s studies of desert streams revealed rapid rates of ecological succession following disturbance by flash floods where hydrologic connectivity and supply of limiting nutrients from the catchment support recovery to pre disturbance conditions fisher et al 1982 valett et al 1994 martí et al 1997 this research brought concepts from landscape ecology to riverscapes finding that the composition and configuration of dynamic hydrologically connected terrestrial and aquatic patches affect the amount and forms of nutrients exported downstream as the footprint of urban areas grew in the american southwest it became impossible to ignore the interactions with and effects of urban ecosystems on regional hydrology and ecology grimm and colleagues established the central arizona phoenix long term ecological research program cap lter and grimm served as its principal investigator for 19 years engaging engineers social and behavioral scientists geographers and ecologists to study urban ecosystems the cap lter has highlighted how human decision making and landscape design drive hydrological and biogeochemical function and resultant ecosystem services subsequently grimm s team has applied principles of urban ecology to scenario analyses used in evaluating strategies for sustainable use of water in cities iwaniec et al 2020b sampson et al 2020 grimm s expansive reach in hydrology and ecology developed from her synthetic approach and engagement as a collaborative scientist fig 2 she cultivates an overall vision of possibilities and interconnected concepts often seeding ideas among cohorts of students postdoctoral researchers and colleagues who grow under her mentorship and collaboration here we review dr grimm s boundary spanning contributions to hydrology focusing on integration across disparate disciplines and highlight how she has envisioned and fulfilled research needs to support a more sustainable and resilient future 2 ecology and biogeochemistry of aridland streams and catchments 2 1 nitrogen dynamics in streams grimm s nitrogen n budgets of a desert stream shaped decades of subsequent stream ecology by documenting rapid exchange among n pools in stream channels e g grimm 1987 quantitative whole ecosystem budgets of energy and materials became a mainstay of aquatic ecology after howard and eugene odum constructed energy budgets of a lagoon and spring fed stream to investigate relationships among steady state standing stocks and productivity odum 1957 odum and odum 1955 subsequent application of the budget approach in streams revealed terrestrial support of stream metabolism fisher and likens 1973 and the role of stream discharge in retention of phosphorus meyer and likens 1979 until the 1980s however budgets for freshwater ecosystems focused on energy and phosphorus owing to the legacy of research in phosphorus limited lakes and temperate streams these budgets typically captured variation on seasonal or annual timescales grimm and colleagues constructed n budgets for an n limited desert stream sycamore creek az usa at diel and successional i e following flash floods timescales that demonstrated widespread n limitation of primary production grimm et al 1981 grimm and fisher 1986 the budget approach quantified mechanisms of n retention finding more rapid exchange among biotic pools of n than in forested streams grimm 1987 in addition to describing rapid uptake of n from the water column by algae grimm s careful estimates of n fluxes and storage established that ingestion of n by macroinvertebrates accounts for a significant fraction of the n retained by the stream 10 thereby reducing the processing length of n particularly late in succession following flash floods grimm 1988 in turn n recycled by macroinvertebrates alleviates limitation of primary production grimm 1988 thus in addition to establishing n as a potentially limiting nutrient in lotic ecosystems the budget approach demonstrated biogeochemical links among biological communities and ecosystem processes that are in turn shaped by hydrologic variation this work now stands as a textbook example by which undergraduate students learn about rapid nutrient recycling as a mechanism for nutrient retention in ecosystems sher and molles 2021 studies at sycamore creek contributed to growing recognition of n limitation in streams e g naiman and melillo 1984 triska et al 1984 that was leveraged to support the lotic intersite nitrogen experiment linx linx generated cross biome insights into n cycling in streams by convening one of the largest collaborative groups funded by the division of environmental biology us national science foundation at its establishment in 1996 linx collaborators 2014 in its first stage the linx project applied a novel stable isotope tracer approach to quantify retention and transformation of ammonium finding high capacity for n retention in headwater streams due to assimilation by algae and microbial heterotrophs peterson et al 2001 webster et al 2003 the tracer approach also demonstrated flow of n from aquatic to terrestrial food webs sanzone et al 2003 a second phase addressed nitrate retention and denitrification across streams draining wildland urban and agricultural land covers a decline in retention efficiency with n concentration and in simplified channels of urban streams implied reduced capacity for n retention by stream networks subject to anthropogenic n loading and channel modification grimm et al 2005 martin et al 2011 mulholland et al 2008 grimm contributed to the vision and momentum of linx while also establishing several mentees as equal collaborators in the project 2 2 floods droughts and temporal dynamics of stream riparian corridors desert streams provide an opportunity and imperative to study temporal variation in n budgets caused by floods and droughts existing theory synthesized by odum 1969 established that succession proceeds toward balanced production and respiration closed material cycles high biodiversity and large body sizes however these predictions were derived largely from studies of terrestrial ecosystems grimm and colleagues developed and tested ecological theory of disturbance and succession in desert streams recovering from flash floods fisher et al 1982 though a desert stream accumulated biomass and recycled inorganic nutrients with increasing efficiency through successional time as predicted by odum production exceeded respiration and biota remained characterized by a similar group of small bodied short lived invertebrate species fisher et al 1982 contrasts in successional dynamics between streams and terrestrial ecosystems resulted because of greater relative rates of material exchange with adjacent ecosystems and more frequent disturbances in streams successional dynamics of limiting nutrients also conformed to expectations from terrestrial ecosystems where n retention defined as the difference between inputs and outputs was hypothesized to increase in early succession due to biotic uptake followed by a decline in late succession as accumulation of biomass approaches a steady state vitousek and reiners 1975 as predicted n uptake in the stream recycling of n by macroinvertebrates and n fixation by cyanobacteria increased rapidly in a desert stream following scouring floods and typically declined due to nutrient limitation in late succession fig 3 grimm 1988 1987 grimm et al 1981 grimm and petrone 1997 martí et al 1997 however succession proceeded more rapidly in the stream than in terrestrial ecosystems weeks vs decades grimm s research capitalized on the opportunity afforded by desert streams to observe multiple floods within each season and to place successional dynamics within the context of longer term variation in hydrologic conditions for example invertebrate communities that reassemble after floods preceded by drought differ from communities that develop when floods occur within wetter periods boulton et al 1992 in another example grimm s research found local extinctions of drought intolerant taxa from sycamore creek have contributed to decadal scale change in invertebrate communities boulton et al 1992 sponseller et al 2010 likewise spatial patterns in the distribution of stream biota result in part from availability of aquatic habitat as stream networks contract heterogeneously during drying stanley et al 1997 water persists in the surface and shallow subsurface at locations where the stream channel is narrow and bedrock is near the streambed surface these locations provide refugia for biota such as macrophytes characteristic of wetlands particularly during dry years dong et al 2016 characterizing the effects of antecedent hydrologic conditions on material export from streams required understanding material processing and transport in hydrologically connected riparian zones and rill networks grimm s group described build up of resources during dry periods followed by rapid transformation and or transport during subsequent precipitation and runoff for example experimental rain events following dry seasons yielded greater emissions of greenhouse gases from riparian soils than during wet seasons harms and grimm 2012 similarly solutes accumulate in upland soils during dry periods followed by flushing transformation and transport to streams during storms at rates proportional to antecedent precipitation and discharge fisher and grimm 1985 harms and grimm 2010 welter et al 2005 accordingly grimm and colleagues developed a conceptual model predicting biogeochemical responses to interactions of antecedent hydrologic conditions with precipitation events by linking the precipitation trigger to downgradient hydrologic transfer followed by pulses of biological activity that may result in gaseous or hydrologic losses of materials or to accumulating material reserves belnap et al 2005 finally studying aridland catchments as a model system exposed potential ecological effects of a hydrologic cycle increasingly altered by climate change and patterns of water use by humans grimm and fisher 1992 2 3 functional role of the hyporheic zone grimm and colleagues extended the focal extent of stream research from surface waters into the hyporheic zone i e the zone of streambed sediments where surface water exchanges with the subsurface water prior studies of the hyporheic zone emphasized its role as habitat or refuge for biota coleman and hynes 1970 tóth 1963 research at sycamore creek confirmed the migration of invertebrates deeper into hyporheic sediments during stream drying clinton et al 1996 however previous studies had not explicitly addressed the biogeochemical contributions of the hyporheic zone grimm fisher 1984 measured rates of respiration and nitrate retention in hyporheic sediments that were comparable to the surface stream these observations catalyzed a paradigm shift in stream ecology to encompass the vertical dimension of streams encompassing the hyporheic zone and surface water groundwater interactions boulton et al 1998 dahm et al 1998 and later horizontal connectivity with parafluvial and riparian zones holmes et al 1998 1994 lewis et al 2007 hydrologists had previously recognized exchange between surface and subsurface water vaux 1962 this exchange was visually apparent at sites of upwelling i e subsurface to surface water exchange and downwelling i e surface to subsurface water exchange in desert streams grimm and fisher s group was among the first to document elevated concentrations of inorganic nutrients downstream of upwellings and subsequent ecological and biogeochemical implications grimm et al 1981 valett 1992 decomposition and mineralization in hyporheic sediments supplied nutrients to the surface channel at locations of groundwater upwelling jones et al 1995 which in turn favored algal growth and more rapid recovery of biota following floods valett et al 1994 the distinctive distribution of algae shaped by the location of upwellings modified water velocity and nutrient availability in surface water at patch scales increasing spatial heterogeneity of algal communities at the reach scale fisher et al 1998a holmes et al 1998 observations of sycamore creek demonstrated that hydrologic and ecological processes occurring as a result of surface water groundwater interactions generate spatial patterns in stream nutrient concentrations spatial patterns associated with upwelling from the hyporheic zone were observed over spatial extents from meters to kilometers dent et al 2001 patchiness in nutrient concentration increased through successional time due to fragmentation of surface flow and a stronger influence of biotic activity and abiotic features in isolated pools later in succession dent et al 2001 dent and grimm 1999 however colonization of the channel by wetland vegetation following removal of cattle from the catchment diminished the effect of surface water groundwater exchange on spatial variation in surface water nutrient concentrations dong et al 2017 2 4 hydrologic connectivity and patch dynamics the characteristics of desert streams with open channels permeable and mobile substrate and nutrient limited biota provided a natural laboratory for addressing central questions in landscape ecology concerned with the role of connectivity following discovery of the dominant role of hydrologic exchange with the hyporheic zone on the ecology and biogeochemistry of desert streams grimm fisher s group examined how hydrologic connections between the wetted stream channel parafluvial and riparian zones interacted with spatial heterogeneity in nutrient stocks and flows to cause spatial and temporal variation in biogeochemical processes fisher et al 1998a their research showed that water chemistry changes as water flows through the fluvial landscape because the physical and biological characteristics of each patch type influence water residence time and bioreactive capacity holmes et al 1996 martí et al 2000 as a consequence the length of flowpaths through each patch influences concentrations of bioreactive elements holmes et al 1994 expansion of studies into adjacent desert floodplains and riparian zones emphasized how the magnitude and direction of hydrologic connectivity interacts with patch specific rates of organic matter water and nutrient accumulation to influence nutrient retention capacity lewis et al 2009 in contrast to surface waters the concentration of dissolved inorganic n in riparian groundwaters is greater less temporally variable and governed by localized n cycling rather than by advection lewis et al 2006 resulting in spatially heterogeneous n availability lewis et al 2007 patchy n availability is due at least in part to spatial heterogeneity in rates of n retaining processes including uptake of n from subsurface flowpaths by n limited riparian plants schade et al 2005 2001 and denitrification fueled by heterogeneous accumulation of organic matter in riparian soils harms and grimm 2008 thus flows from riparian zones to stream channels are typically low in nitrate but high in dissolved organic matter except during floods when inputs of inorganic nutrients can overwhelm capacity for nutrient retention in riparian zones harms and grimm 2008 schade et al 2002 at a broader extent organic rich floodplain soils develop along gaining reaches where water is delivered from riparian zones to streams along shallow flowpaths supporting spatially extensive denitrification whereas sparsely vegetated sandy soils typical of hydrologically losing reaches support denitrification only in small patches harms et al 2009 observations of spatial heterogeneity within stream riparian corridors emphasized that spatial heterogeneity and hydrologic connectivity are dynamic properties of fluvial landscapes this perspective contributed to developing the concepts of hot spots and hot moments defined as locations and times supporting significantly greater biogeochemical activity relative to average rates mcclain et al 2003 hot spots and hot moments often occur due to hydrologic transport or activation of limiting reactants which are facilitated in aridlands by prolonged dry periods followed by intense precipitation e g austin et al 2004 belnap et al 2005 collins et al 2014 overall grimm and colleagues demonstrated how the dynamic mosaics of hydrologically interconnected patches comprising fluvial ecosystems influence population community and ecosystem processes contributing to general ecological theory focused on landscape ecology and connectivity grimm et al 2003 townsend 1989 winemiller et al 2010 in aridlands disturbances such as floods drought and fire modify the distribution of patches and their material stores as well as the magnitude and direction of hydrologic flowpaths dahm et al 1998 jacobs et al 2007 lewis et al 2006 ye and grimm 2013 ecosystem processes such as in stream nutrient retention capacity are sensitive to such disturbances though spatial heterogeneity also supports resilience martí et al 1997 a conceptual and numerical model the telescoping ecosystem model formalized the role of hydrologic connectivity among patch types within stream riparian corridors emphasizing that ecosystem function e g nutrient retention depends on hydrologic connectivity among patches and the relative sensitivity of each patch to perturbations fisher et al 1998b 3 urban ecosystems 3 1 a move into the urban domain in 1997 a new era of grimm s work began with funding of the central arizona phoenix long term ecological research program cap lter one of only two urban focused lter sites at its founding with the baltimore ecosystem study and now the minneapolis st paul metropolitan area this launched more than two decades of research into how urban development shapes ecological biogeochemical and hydrological processes when the cap lter began in 1997 urban ecology was a nascent field dominated by ecologists who were still focused on studying how urban ecosystems were degraded in comparison to natural ecosystems and urban hydrology was largely the domain of engineers the cap lter initially addressed whether ecological theory could be applied to urban ecosystems or whether modified theories were required to accommodate novel processes in urban ecosystems kaye et al 2006 urban ecology emerged as a distinct discipline with the recognition that human activities social systems and policies drive and respond to ecological and hydrological processes collins et al 2000 grimm et al 2000 a framework developed by scientists at the baltimore and phoenix lter sites characterizes ecology in of and for cities pickett et al 2016 this framing describes approaches for studying urban ecology ranging from characterization of urban ecological features as analogs of non urban ecosystems in to a systems approach that incorporates ecological built and social components of to a paradigm of applying ecological principles to advance urban sustainability for pickett et al 2016 research at the cap lter has included all of these approaches and grimm s perspective as an aquatic ecosystem ecologist was critical to early adoption of a more integrative and systems based approach her work in desert streams where the definition of a stream is regularly challenged due to spatially and temporally variable hydrology relative to mesic streams prepared her to think broadly and creatively about cities and their highly engineered hydrobiogeochemistry early work at the cap lter addressed urban ecology from local to regional scales and integrated ecology in the city to test ecological theory with assessment of feedbacks between landscape mosaics and ecological function ecology of the city a major goal of this work was to test whether urban ecosystems conformed to existing ecological frameworks if those frameworks were expanded to include social components these ideas later led to application of social ecological systems ses and more recently social ecological technological systems sets concepts to characterize feedbacks among human decision making and social networks built infrastructure and ecosystem services grimm 2020 mcphearson et al 2022 2016 these increasingly interdisciplinary frameworks were broadened even further by grimm and colleagues particularly those associated with the baltimore ecosystem study to become transdisciplinary efforts that explicitly engaged communities and stakeholders in undertaking ecology for the city cook et al 2021 felson et al 2013 grove et al 2016 helmrich et al 2020 larson et al 2013 pickett et al 2013 3 2 ecohydrology in cities in early urban ecological research of the cap lter grimm and her group contributed to ecohydrology by characterizing how hydrology and land use in urban areas influence the nature and drivers of spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemical processes and by recognizing urban watersheds and wetlands as novel ecosystems with unique hydrology and associated biogeochemistry urban ecosystems often contain hot spots and hot moments of biogeochemical activity because of extreme manipulation of water and material fluxes including pollutant loading and runoff generation kaye et al 2006 for example soil properties across the greater phoenix metropolitan area such as inorganic n concentrations organic matter and soil moisture were all associated with population density latitude impervious surfaces and presence of lawns hope et al 2005 jenerette et al 2006 zhu et al 2006 however decreased spatial heterogeneity in soils of urban areas compared to non urban counterparts suggests homogenizing effects of urbanization jenerette et al 2006 atmospheric deposition of carbon sulfate and nitrogen provide one such mechanism of spatial homogenization in resource availability cook et al 2018 lohse et al 2008 these patterns are important because terrestrial soil moisture and biogeochemistry directly influence runoff generation and pollutant loading hydrologic change in cities occurs via rerouting of flowpaths by engineered structures and introduction of land cover types that change infiltration rates and plant soil interactions grimm et al 2004 the timing and trajectories of urban development determine long term patterns in urban hydrology and introduce non linear changes older urban developments typically contain conveyance focused stormwater infrastructure instead of retention features in turn affecting downstream hydrologic regimes hopkins et al 2015a however urban hydrological patterns in phoenix do not conform to expected patterns of increased flashiness found in most mesic cities hopkins et al 2015b mcphillips et al 2019 rather flashiness declines with urbanization compared to the naturally flashy discharge regime of desert streams likely due to increased retention from artificial surface water bodies and engineered stormwater retention fig 4 mcphillips et al 2019 roach et al 2008 redistribution of water in urban ecosystems results in changes to the locations and timing of carbon and nutrient inputs and transformations impervious surfaces accumulate n which is then flushed during storms lewis and grimm 2007 receiving streams and channels can retain or transform these materials but as in desert streams the attributes of hydrologic flowpaths including connectivity with adjacent patches influence the magnitude of carbon and nutrient transformations within urban streams and channels reduced channel complexity e g straightening concrete lining and increased nutrient loading can result in longer n spiraling length indicating reduced retention compared to wildland counterparts grimm et al 2005 patterns in concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc in urban channels of phoenix exemplify how human altered hydrologic connectivity influences material loads and processing additions of water from wastewater treatment plants and connection of surface waters with aquifers via pumping from deep wells have generated longitudinal patterns in doc concentration and rates of decomposition uv oxidation and sorption along rivers draining phoenix edmonds and grimm 2011 despite diminished nutrient retention in urban streams engineered features such as canals stormwater management infrastructure and constructed lakes comprise biogeochemical hot spots in urban catchments for example lakes and stormwater basins receive high nutrient loads and promote longer water residence time conditions that support n retention processes such as denitrification bettez and groffman 2012 larson and grimm 2012 roach et al 2008 roach and grimm 2011 zhu et al 2004 at larger scales the distribution of stormwater infrastructure such as the density of retention basins designed to detain and infiltrate runoff moderates urban runoff and n dynamics during storms hale et al 2014 indeed the retention of water is associated with the physical retention of nutrients in stormwater even though biogeochemical retention e g through denitrification does not contribute substantially to nutrient retention during storms lewis and grimm 2007 hale et al 2015 in addition to these intentionally engineered hydrological interventions grimm and colleagues documented abundant accidental wetlands in phoenix and other metropolitan regions palta et al 2017 these wetlands are fed by irrigation elsewhere in the catchment infiltration and inflow from sewer lines and outflows from wastewater treatment plants accidental wetlands are novel ecosystems that support water quality habitat and cultural ecosystem services palta et al 2017 thus urban infrastructure and novel urban patch types provide replacements for native watershed elements e g low order streams leading to distinct hydrologic patterns in urban watersheds compared to non urban counterparts novel types of aquatic ecosystems in cities emphasize that maintenance of ecosystem functions in urban ecosystems requires appropriate goals and attention to physio geographic setting booth and jackson 1997 ehrenfeld 2000 grimm et al 2008b 3 3 an integrated systems approach to ecohydrology of cities early studies of the hydrology and biogeochemistry of urban aquatic ecosystems in the city were strongly suggestive of coupling between social and ecological components importantly humans respond to system dynamics in ways that further alter the system such as by adding algaecide to lakes or creating new hydrologic infrastructure collins et al 2000 grimm et al 2005 kaye et al 2006 paul and meyer 2008 walsh et al 2005 studying such feedbacks requires an integrated systems approach to the ecohydrology of cities thus urban ecohydrology in phoenix progressed from characterizing spatial heterogeneity and its influence on nutrient dynamics in studies parallel to those conducted in non urban desert watersheds to an approach that evaluated human decision making as a driver of disturbance regimes and changes in ecosystem function these findings necessitated modified ecological theories that encompass cities grimm et al 2017 4 toward eco hydrology for cities under grimm s leadership findings from cap lter s first 25 years have been integrated into rich conceptual frameworks that redefine our understanding of ecological resilience and disturbance this integration resulted from efforts to bridge the natural and social sciences through collaboration between researchers and practitioners coupling methodologies and frameworks across disciplines including ecology geography civil and environmental engineering sustainability science and anthropology as project co lead grimm s focus on biogeochemistry of urban waterways transitioned to interdisciplinary frameworks that led to a social ecological technological systems sets approach for improving urban resilience grimm et al 2017 kim et al 2021b 4 1 designed ecosystems an ecology for cities approach explicitly recognizes that humans respond to the functioning of a system such as the provisioning of ecosystem services or disservices grimm et al 2005 and disturbances grimm et al 2017 for example socio ecological feedbacks have promoted shifts from gray to green or nature based infrastructure e g protected or restored floodplains rain gardens in response to disturbances such as floods that increase awareness of the limitations of older infrastructure in addition to a desire for the many ancillary benefits beyond stormwater retention that designed ecosystems or nature based infrastructure can provide hobbie and grimm 2020 there has been a shift from a focus on pipe and storage tank based drainage systems to increased integration of vegetated basins swales and roofs for stormwater management mcphillips and matsler 2018 in understanding that cities are fundamentally designed systems grimm s work recognized early on that urban ecological research could and should be used to help design urban ecosystems to maximize potential benefits designed ecosystems generally do not represent complete ecosystem restoration but can provide multiple ecosystem services for example the rio salado project in central arizona created several acres of riparian habitat and returned flows to previously dry sections of the salt river but the naturally flashy hydrological regime was not restored because of the desire to protect the existing built environment larson et al 2013 shifts may also occur through the opening of policy windows by co occurrence of problems solutions and policies for example communities managing combined sewer overflows were more likely to use green infrastructure following guidance on green infrastructure from the us environmental protection agency hopkins et al 2018 these examples demonstrate how urban ecohydrology research can be explicitly directed to inform management and policy considerations 4 2 future scenarios visioning urban ecology can contribute to maximizing potential ecosystem services provided by urban sets such as mitigation of floods and urban heat islands hobbie and grimm 2020 mcphearson et al 2022 grimm and colleagues are contributing to realizing the potential of urban sets by expanding research from understanding social ecological dynamics in cities to include informing scenarios to guide cities toward desirable and sustainable futures grimm et al 2013 specifically grimm and colleagues recognized that urban ecosystems can be re imagined to maximize ecosystem services including flood protection habitat water quality regulation and a sense of place grimm et al 2008a in phoenix grimm convened an interdisciplinary team focused on developing alternative positive and long term scenarios for the city that include strategies for managing projected extremes in precipitation and temperature scenarios are a tool for building shared and innovative ideas to enhance future resilience and decision making in the face of climate change and other uncertainty the series of workshops sought co production of transformative possibilities in that researchers worked side by side with municipal county state federal tribal and community decision makers to generate visions of a more sustainable resilient and socially equitable future iwaniec et al 2020b 2020a the workshops resulted in six regional scenarios https sustainability innovation asu edu future scenarios that proposed and questioned ideas about urban hydrology rewilding water conservation walkable cities drought or heat resilience iwaniec et al 2020b fig 5 importantly the co production process was integrated with creative works multi criteria assessments berbés blázquez et al 2021 urban systems models including hydrological land use and temperature modelling iwaniec et al 2020a sampson et al 2020 and climate policy analyses iwaniec et al 2020b kim et al 2021b sampson et al 2020 applied the scenario outcomes to identify and compare alternative water management and policy pathways by projecting how land use and water related strategies influenced water use demand and conservation for example anticipated decreases in surface water allocations could be adequately managed by changing future land use and associated water demand in addition to policies supporting use of greywater reclaimed water and rainwater harvesting sampson et al 2020 fig 5 grimm expanded application of futures research and participatory methods to nine cities in the united states and latin america with the urban resilience to extremes sustainability research network urex srn iwaniec et al 2021b collaborative groups comprising a total of 200 researchers and practitioners co produced over 50 sustainable visions of 2080 aimed at heat drought and flood adaptation and sustainability transformations berbés blázquez et al 2021 cook et al 2021 hamstead et al 2021 iwaniec et al 2021a a common feature in many of these scenarios was implementation or leveraging of urban ecological infrastructure for managing flood risk as well as other ecosystem services for example the eco wetland city scenario in valdivia chile included protection of wetlands and new ecological infrastructure as strategies for maintaining ecosystem services under changing climate in addition to exploring ecological and hydrological benefits of urban ecological infrastructure urexsrn efforts sought to understand the social benefits of each strategy mcphearson et al 2022 pallathadka et al 2022 4 3 synthesis 4 3 1 core and emergent concepts grounding in key ecological and hydrological principles has motivated grimm s discoveries which integrate the components of her expansive research program foremost grimm applies systems thinking which focuses on interactions among multiple interdependent parts and emphasizes feedbacks among them for example in streams grimm and colleagues pioneered research into surface water groundwater interactions with the hyporheic zone which supported hot spots of biogeochemical reactions biotic diversity and primary production e g boulton et al 1998 clinton et al 1996 holmes et al 1996 jones et al 1995 in the urban domain grimm was instrumental in developing the concept of social ecological technological systems sets and applied a sets perspective to study dynamics of urban and ecohydrological systems chang et al 2021 grimm et al 2017 mcphearson et al 2022 for example the sets concept has aided in understanding how elements of the social ecological and technological domains all contribute to and interact to influence vulnerability to flooding chang et al 2021 study of ecological responses to disturbance particularly those caused by variation in hydrologic regimes organizes grimm s research across wildland to urban domains the obvious role of floods and droughts in structuring the physical template and biological processes of desert streams motivated a research program integrating hydrology and ecology of desert streams the opportunity to study multiple disturbance events in a single year in contrast to terrestrial ecosystems where succession occurs on multi decadal time scales accelerated contributions of this program to general ecological theory fisher et al 1982 grimm 1987 grimm and petrone 1997 sponseller et al 2010 in urban ecosystems grimm and her colleagues considered how disturbances may affect and be amplified by sets dynamics such as exploring how nature based infrastructure can help manage and reduce impacts of hazards in social ecological and technical domains hobbie and grimm 2020 a focus on succession following disturbance led to incorporating concepts of resilience in particular addressing the speed and trajectories of recovery by algal and invertebrate communities and ecosystem processes following floods boulton et al 1992 grimm and fisher 1989 stanley et al 1994 in cities grimm and colleagues promoted planning for transformation of infrastructure toward systems that are resilient to extreme weather events andersson et al 2022 kim et al 2021a in general research into sets has shown that shifting management approaches from flood control such as dams or canals toward safe to fail approaches such as sports fields that also serve as stormwater retention basins supports resilience to floods kim et al 2017 muñoz erickson et al 2021 all domains of grimm s research program have characterized the role of temporal and spatial heterogeneity and hydrologic connectivity among diverse patch types in supporting ecosystem function and resilience to disturbance in desert streams distinct patch types comprising the stream riparian corridor support differential rates of ecosystem processes e g nitrogen retention and hydrologic connections among them facilitate ecosystem recovery from floods fisher et al 1998a grimm et al 1991 valett et al 1994 in urban ecosystems the spatial heterogeneity of land cover land use and infrastructure interacts with patterns of hydrologic connection and disconnection to drive nutrient transformation export and hydrological functioning of urban watersheds hale et al 2014 hopkins et al 2015b larson and grimm 2012 lewis and grimm 2007 redistribution of water in cities forms novel aquatic patch types such as lakes and wetlands that support rates of biogeochemical processes and water retention distinct from wildlands grimm et al 2005 hale et al 2015 handler et al 2022 larson and grimm 2012 palta et al 2017 roach et al 2008 broadly grimm s work is characterized by another form of connectivity that is by bridging between concepts or among traditionally separate scientific disciplines in early work on desert streams for example she pursued interactions between nitrogen cycling and communities of algae and macroinvertebrates e g grimm 1987 1988 which had traditionally been the domains of ecosystem and community ecology respectively further she placed this work within the context of hydrologic variation i e floods and droughts that in turn fostered subsequent studies integrating hydrologic connectivity and spatial heterogeneity e g dent et al 2001 bridging central concepts from landscape ecology with biogeochemistry similarly grimm s work in cities has bridged ecosystem science with social sciences design and sustainability connections that seem natural or essential now were new and challenging in their early days such as including human behaviors to understand urban hydrology e g larson et al 2005 roach et al 2008 collaborations between social scientists and ecologists for example required years to find common language and understand how to collaborate across vastly different epistemologies one of grimm s key contributions to all of these fields has been providing spaces for these conversations and these connections to happen through her brave leadership style and inclusive transdisciplinary mentorship 4 4 practices of a path breaking scientist much has been written about the attributes of productive scientists typically identifying qualities such as persistence and curiosity fortunato et al 2018 gotian 2022 jensen 2018 that are exemplified by grimm beyond these general attributes grimm s boundary spanning career is distinguished by a collaborative interdisciplinary approach with research rooted in observations that have contributed long term perspectives along with a commitment to mentoring the next generation of scientists grimm s contributions to hydrology derive from a hypothetico deductive approach based on observations for example observations of successional and biogeochemical responses to variation in the magnitude and timing of precipitation and floods in desert streams e g fisher et al 1982 grimm and fisher 1984 welter et al 2005 led to mechanistic research on the influence of surface water groundwater interactions and hydrologic connectivity dent and grimm 1999 holmes et al 1994 martí et al 1997 schade et al 2001 valett et al 1994 this empirical research in turn supported conceptual and numerical models applicable beyond aridland catchments that incorporated pulsed dynamics hydrologic transport and hydrologic connectivity within heterogeneous ecosystems belnap et al 2005 collins et al 2014 fisher et al 1998a while grimm s contributions to hydrology expanded across domains she also persisted in supporting long term investigations of key ecosystems for over 40 years she has studied sycamore creek az characterizing relationships between ecology and long term variation in the hydrologic regime caused by climate oscillations long term drought and changing land management dong et al 2017 sponseller et al 2010 the long term record at sycamore creek motivated its inclusion as a core aquatic site in the national ecological observatory network neon ensuring its continuation for 25 years she has led or contributed to efforts at cap lter to support ongoing data collection related to regional water quality biogeochemistry and hydrology in central arizona grimm s collaborative approach has been a keystone of her productive career as she recognized the value of engaging diverse expertise and perspectives to understand complex systems and identify feasible solutions key collaborative efforts include establishment of the fisher grimm group in stream ecology at arizona state university a foundational role in linx the first large cross site collaborative group in stream ecology cross ecosystem synthesis groups at the national center for ecological analysis and synthesis and the national socio environmental synthesis center and leadership of multiple interdisciplinary groups comprised of social scientists engineers and ecologists studying urban sets e g cap lter urex srn natura nature based solutions for urban resilience in the anthropocene innovations from these collaborative groups arose from the synthesis of perspectives drawn from across networks and domains forcing reassessment of existing ideas for example urexsrn championed a sets perspective bringing together large teams of collaborators from ecology hydrology social sciences and engineering with city managers and planners consultants and ngos iwaniec et al 2021b kim et al 2021b muñoz erickson et al 2021 similarly the collaborative natura project brought together practitioners and academics in africa asia pacific europe north america and latin america to synthesize and share knowledge on the use benefits and potential tradeoffs of nature based solutions for mitigating natural hazards and impacts of climate change across global urban contexts by creating a research agenda that supports co production between academic research teams community organizations and municipal and tribal governments grimm embeds social ecological and engineering perspectives into sustainability and amplifies marginalized voices in planning for the future of urban watersheds e g guardaro et al 2020 grimm uses her role in every initiative as an opportunity to advance the practice of higher education and uplift the next generation of leaders within and outside of academia she curates research groups without consideration of traditional disciplinary boundaries provides the space for collaborators including students to pursue their own directions and defends their ability to do so the freedom afforded to these groups has led to surprises and provided opportunities for early career scientists to play leadership roles in addition to sharing resources and opportunities with mentees grimm shares freely of her ideas and approaches to science she leads by example with consistent complete intellectual engagement in the topic at hand whether planning an experiment crafting a proposal or analyzing the literature this skill in finding the most interesting crux of any topic or task provides intellectual guidance and motivation her constant pursuit of connections among seemingly disparate projects ideas and approaches has led her more than 60 graduate and postdoctoral mentees to find careers well beyond the cities desert streams or basic science in which they were trained grimm s mentees many of whom continue to collaborate together e g writing this synthesis have applied their training in collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches to generate new insights in ecohydrology biogeochemistry urban ecology landscape ecology sustainability sciences and beyond in addition to her own research group grimm has led or co led several programs explicitly focused on training and mentoring the nsf supported integrative graduate education and research traineeship igert in urban ecology 2005 2013 for example emphasized leadership and interdisciplinarity grimm and co leaders provided resources and guidance to enable student initiated collaborative research integrating frameworks research questions and methods across disciplinary fields recently grimm co founded a graduate training program in earth systems science for the anthropocene essa at arizona state university which leverages community embedded transdisciplinary research across social biophysical and engineering domains essa provides transdisciplinary training with an emphasis on co production of knowledge networked mentoring diversity of knowledge systems and individual skill development other graduate training initiatives have focused on networking among early career professionals working on nature based solutions including international learning exchanges and fellowships that offer non traditional academic and research experiences 5 conclusions as mentees of dr grimm we are grateful for the many lessons learned both in the office and out over meals or while wading through a stream

2617,pollutant first flush ff is a critical phenomenon in urban regions driven by multiple factors therefore having a robust mathematical ff definition and modeling tool along with thorough knowledge of its main influencing variables is essential machine learning techniques have been widely exploited in the water quality field however their use to predict ff occurrence and pollutant load is limited this study developed a generic machine learning framework based on the two most commonly adopted ff definitions 30 80 and m v curve and implemented for three of the most detected pollutants in urban areas tss tn and tp this framework is able to accurately predict if a rainfall event generates ff and in case it does the correspondent pollutant load very good model performance it can also quantify and rank the most influencing factors using a non model biased method based on game theory shapley additive explanations shap showing that the rainfall variables are the most significant predictors of sediment and nutrient ff occurrence in urban regions the findings proved that the machine learning framework developed in this study can be a valuable modeling tool for improving the accuracy and reliability of pollutant load prediction during ff events in urban areas furthermore they represent one of the first steps towards a robust mathematical ff definition which is still a

2015 dams et al 2013 consequently such land use change not only alters the hydrologic cycle and the pathways by which water reaches urban streams but is also associated with numerous impairments of water yao et al 2016 jeung et al 2019 for this reason urban runoff has been considered as one of the most detrimental non point source pollutions gorgoglione et al 2020 pollutant first flush ff is regularly recognized as the initial and most contaminated portion of the urban runoff even though different criteria have been proposed to quantify a load threshold over which the ff is considered significant this topic is still under debate di modugno et al 2015 saget et al 1996 affirmed that an event generates ff when at least 80 of the pollutant load is washed off by the first 30 of the runoff volume 30 80 definition since the thresholds adopted for this definition 30 and 80 were arbitrary bertrand krajewski et al 1998 introduced a graphical representation for identifying a ff event the mass volume curve m v curve definition it is a dimensionless graph which draws the curve that gives the variation of the cumulative pollutant load divided by the total pollutant load in relation to the cumulative volume divided by the total volume ff is occurring when the m v curve lies above the 1 1 line of such plot in this case the more the curve is far from the 1 1 line the higher the ff intensity is this approach is limited by the fact that it adopts hydrograph and pollutograph referred to the same rainfall event in this context pollutant ff prediction is of paramount importance for the design of stormwater treatment systems accurately quantifying the ff means designing optimal tanks that can opportunely store and treat the most polluted runoff volume reducing unnecessary space and construction maintenance costs bach et al 2010 mamun et al 2020 over the years extensive studies have been carried out to evaluate the ff phenomenon and understand which are the most critical factors that determine its generation as for ff evaluation and pollutant concentration prediction physically based models i e swmm storm infoworks have become a widely used engineering tool showing good performances gorgoglione et al 2018 hur et al 2018 however their application is limited by data availability since they need as input meteorological data catchment and drainage network characteristics along with hydrologic and water quality information flow rate and pollutant concentration for model calibration gorgoglione et al 2016 rodríguez et al 2021 for this reason in the last years the use of machine learning techniques such as random forest rf has been increasing exponentially in different environmental fields tyralis et al 2019 vilaseca et al 2021 rf is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees weak learners that is good in avoiding overfitting and can be adopted in cases characterized by more variables than observations breiman 1996 regarding the most influencing factors gnecco et al 2005 and kang et al 2006 have demonstrated that the ff phenomenon is particularly influenced by antecedent dry period a d p maximum rainfall intensity i m a x and rainfall duration d later lee et al 2011 and gorgoglione et al 2019b also remarked the importance of total rainfall t r and runoff volume r v among the rainfall runoff variables and of the catchment slope s l o p e and the percentage of impervious surface a i m p among the watershed characteristics on the other hand perera et al 2019 stated that total precipitation depth t p d is the most important variable in ff prediction while a d p and a i m p have relatively low impact even though several studies evaluated the high or low influence of rainfall runoff and watershed characteristics on the ff phenomenon only a few of them have quantified and ranked such variables perera et al 2019 jeung et al 2019 furthermore in such cases the feature importance analysis performed was limited by the use of model biased techniques aimed to simply quantify the variable importance without gaining deep insights into the physical processes represented compared with other techniques shapley additive explanations shap proved higher computational performance and a better alignment with human interpretation by simply adding a new class of feature importance measures lundberg and lee 2017 consequently shap has been applied in many fields as a robust model interpretation technique in the last few years zhong et al 2021 padarian et al 2020 cross et al 2020 uusitalo et al 2015 based on these considerations in this study we developed an integrated framework based on machine learning techniques rf and shap able to predict if a rainfall event generates ff and in case it does it can also predict different pollutant loads independently from the ff definition adopted this framework uses the two most common ff definitions 30 80 and m v curve and considers three of the most detected pollutants in urban areas total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp with the aim of developing such a general integrated framework we first assessed its capability in predicting ff occurrence and pollutant load per ff definition and per pollutant six independent rf models after assuring the good performance of such independent models we proceeded with the integrated model implementation one rf for all the pollutants and ff definitions moreover we ranked and interpreted the rainfall runoff variables regarding their degree of influence in predicting pollutant load with a non model biased method feature importance 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology description it is important to highlight that two of the most common ff definitions were adopted in this study 30 80 and m v curve based on the latter definition four ff intensity classes can be identified i class 0 no ff occurrence ii class 1 weak ff intensity iii class 2 medium ff intensity iii class 4 strong ff intensity di modugno et al 2015 furthermore three pollutants were considered for this study tss tn and tp this is justified by the fact that nitrogen and phosphorus are the main nutrients that can be commonly detected in urban wash off gorgoglione et al 2021 pitt 1985 sartor et al 1974 moreover their adsorption to sediment particles or loose soil is the primary form by which their offsite movement occurs gorgoglione et al 2019b hence tss was also considered for this study the methodology adopted in this paper is summarized in fig 1 it can be divided into four main steps step 1 dataset creation three different data sources constituted the complete dataset used for this work observations simulations and generations the observations are observed precipitation flow rate and pollutant concentration recorded during a monitoring campaign carried out at the study area di modugno et al 2015 the simulations represent rainfall runoff events constituted by observed precipitation along with flow rate and pollutant concentration obtained from the hydrologic hydraulic and water quality model swmm rossman 2015 implemented and calibrated for the study area di modugno et al 2015 the observed precipitation was used as model input along with catchment and drainage network characteristics the generations are rainfall runoff events characterized by synthetic precipitation obtained from the iterated random pulse irp model veneziano and iacobellis 2002 used as input of swmm and simulated flow rate and pollutant concentration the irp model generated a 15 year long time series of precipitation with an aggregation of 15 min considering the regional regulation regional regulation 26 2013 single rainfall events were identified based on the criterion of 48 h of antecedent dry weather the complete dataset included 577 rainfall runoff events step 2 data analysis a ff analysis was carried out to identify whether the 577 events generate or not ff based on the two ff definitions adopted in this study 30 80 and m v curve the output of this analysis was used as ground truth for the modeling training and testing processes furthermore an exploratory data analysis eda was conducted to detect outliers understand the pollutant behavior at our case study and select appropriate rainfall runoff variables to avoid correlated variables from concealing crucial relationships between rainfall runoff characteristics and stormwater quality this information was then used in the feature engineering process in which variables were processed and trimmed to increase the model s capability the outcomes of this step are the input output matrices used to train validate and test the models step 3 ff occurrence detection to predict the occurrence of ff based on the two selected ff definitions 30 80 and m v curve for the pollutants under study tss tn tp six independent rf classifiers rfcs were developed by exploiting the input output matrices previously obtained a feature importance analysis was carried out to quantify and rank the rainfall runoff variables in terms of their influence in predicting ff occurrence step 4 ff occurrence detection and event mean load eml prediction we extended the model capability with the objective of predicting pollutant emls in case ff occurrence is detected for a particular rainfall event to this aim six independent rf regressors rfrs were developed two ff definitions times three pollutants furthermore a more general and integrated model that takes into account the two ff definitions and the three pollutants was also devised a feature importance analysis was carried out also for such models it is worth remarking that the work reported in this paper represents step 4 of fig 1 further information methods and results about the previous steps can be found in russo et al 2022 all the analyses related to the four steps were conducted using a desktop computer with an intel core i7 10th generation 32 gb ram ddr4 and 1 tb ssd 2 2 study site and dataset creation the study site is located in southern italy apulia region in the city of sannicandro di bari it is a residential watershed with a drainage surface equal to 31 24 ha and an average slope equal to 1 56 70 of the total area is covered by impervious surfaces mainly streets and roofs while parks and gardens occupy only 3 8 of the catchment sit puglia 2022 the mean annual temperature and precipitation for the study area are 15 0 c and 586 mm respectively three different data sources contributed to the dataset construction used for this study observations simulations and generations an in depth description of them can be found in russo et al 2022 as a result 577 rainfall runoff events constitute the dataset the following variables were computed to characterize each of them a d p d t r average rainfall intensity i a v e i m a x r p and r v the pollutants considered for this study were tss tn and tp event mean concentration e m c t s s e m c t n e m c t p and event mean load e m l t s s e m l t n e m l t p were calculated for the three pollutants and considered as water quality variables it is important to highlight that the complete dataset adopted in this study was properly built to test the performance of the framework here developed the models adopted to simulate swmm and generate irp data were previously satisfactorily calibrated and validated for this study site di modugno et al 2015 veneziano and iacobellis 2002 2 3 data analysis the 30 80 and m v curve graphical methods were applied to identify whether the 577 events generate or not ff for the three pollutants under study in fig 2 the class distribution for 30 80 and m v curve ff definitions are shown in both cases a class imbalance characterizes the dataset based on the 30 80 ff for tss and tp almost 30 of the events generates ff while for tn almost 70 of the events produces ff for the m v curve definition class 2 medium ff is the most populated one for tss 59 and tp 72 and the second most populated for tn 41 after class 3 strong ff 52 class 1 weak ff is the least populated for the three pollutants 8 for tss 1 for tn 9 for tp an eda was carried out to detect possible outliers understand the pollutant behavior for our case study and select appropriate rainfall runoff input variables for the models to avoid correlated variables from concealing crucial relationships between rainfall runoff characteristics and stormwater quality no outliers were detected the variables t r and i m a x were discarded because of their high correlation with t r and r v respectively spearman coefficients equal to 0 99 and 0 97 furthermore it was found that tp has a higher particle bound component than tn which instead tends to decrease its concentration when precipitation and consequently runoff increases dilution process therefore the variables selected to build the input output model matrix were a d p r v r p d i a v e e m l t s s e m l t p and e m l t n further information about eda can be found in russo et al 2022 2 4 random forest rf is a supervised machine learning algorithm able to represent non linear relationships it is an ensemble method i e it is composed of many decision trees weak learners that are used to predict a value regression or a class classification its response is the average of the predicted values for regression or the most predicted class for classification breiman 2001 in this work we will exploit the capability of this algorithm as a rfr rf uses bootstrap aggregating bagging methods to reduce model variance breiman 1996 such methods build multiple instances of a random subset of the original training set and aggregate those individual predictions to form the final prediction moreover when creating such instances rf also randomizes the model features set by randomizing the weak learner building process and then forming an ensemble from it the variance of the model is decreased the injected randomness separates the prediction errors of individual weak learners by averaging these predictions some errors can cancel each other out therefore bagging methods work best with strong and complex models rf vs decision tree breiman 2001 2 4 1 regression it is important to highlight that emls are predicted here if a rainfall event produces ff therefore rfr is prior used for classification ff occurrence or not and if ff occurs is also used as a regressor to predict eml when using a regressor for a classification problem we need to transform the categorical variables i e discrete into continuous ones this process is called encoding in this work we used one hot encoding zheng and casari 2018 in general if a categorical variable has m possible values m number of classes it is substituted with m variables with domain 0 1 each input row will only have one 1 in the variable corresponding to its class in our models it was used to encode the classes of the ff events for both 30 80 and m v ff definitions when one hot encoding is used for an output variable a single output problem becomes multi output since a single variable is transformed into as many variables as the number of classes in the end the objective is to select the class chosen by the model one immediate way to do this is by taking the category which has the highest output value this is achieved using the argmax function which returns the index of the variable with the highest value to predict eml which is a continuous variable a regressor model is needed therefore rfr was adopted to predict pollutant load in case a rainfall event generates ff in particular as we mentioned in section 2 1 we developed six independent rfrs one per pollutant tss tn and tp and one per ff definition 30 80 and m v curve independent rfrs furthermore we implemented one more rfr able to predict the load of the three pollutants at the same time integrated rfr the python class randomforestregressor from the sklearn ensemble package was used to implement our rfr algorithms and the class onehotencoder from the sklearn preprocessing package was adopted for variable encoding 2 5 model cross validation and testing the rfrs were cross validated and tested by dividing the rainfall runoff dataset into training 75 and testing the remaining 25 subsets the two subsets were randomly selected to minimize the model bias a 5 fold cross validation was adopted a hyperparameter optimization process that aims at achieving an accurate and reliable model is executed during cross validation in this study the open source python library optuna for hyperparameter optimization was adopted it aims to balance the sampling and pruning algorithms akiba et al 2019 the following hyperparameters were considered for model cross validation i n estimators is the number of decision trees in the forest it is related to the bagging process by controlling the number of instances in the ensemble ii max features is the maximum number of features that a tree can consider it is related to the randomization of model features and represents the number of features to consider when looking for the best split iii max depth is the maximum depth of each tree in the forest it controls the decision tree growth the deeper the tree the more splits it has and it captures more information about the data a regularization mechanism was applied to rf to prevent over fitting adopting max depth as the parameter for pruning after identifying the best set of hyperparameters the final scoring was computed on the testing dataset using the model that implements such best set to assess model performance several metrics were adopted for classification the accuracy and the f1 score were considered perera et al 2019 davis and goadrich 2006 flach and kull 2015 1 a c c u r a c y t r u e p o s i t i v e s f a l s e n e g a t i v e s t o t s 2 f 1 2 p r p r where true positives and false negatives represent the correctly classified samples t o t s represents the total number of samples p is the precision and r is the recall that are respectively equal to 3 p t r u e p o s i

classified samples it gives an immediate and intuitive representation of how the model behaves f1 score behaves better in the case of unbalanced classes and also takes into account the non corrected classified samples false positives davis and goadrich 2006 flach and kull 2015 the f1 score was used as the objective function for classification and the accuracy was computed for validation f1 score and accuracy range between 0 1 the closer to 1 the more accurate the model for regression the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r 2 were adopted chen et al 2017 rodríguez et al 2021 5 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y i ˆ 2 i 1 n y i y 2 6 r 2 i 1 n y i y y i ˆ y ˆ i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i ˆ y ˆ 2 2 where n is the number of samples y i and y i ˆ are the i th observed and predicted values y and y ˆ are the average of the observed and predicted values the nse varies in the range 1 the closer to 1 the more accurate the model is in particular if n s e 1 the predictions perfectly match the observations if n s e 0 the predictions are as good as the observed mean if n s e 0 the observed mean is a better predictor than predicted values the r 2 varies in the range 0 1 as well as nse the closer to one the more accurate the model in particular if r 2 1 predicted values perfectly match the observations nse was here adopted as the objective function for rfr r 2 was computed for validation table 1 summarizes the performance evaluation criteria for nse and r 2 defined according to the water quality standard review chen et al 2017 rodríguez et al 2021 physical water quality variables include tss while tn and tp are part of the chemical water quality variables for classifiers we used stratified and uniform models as baselines for regressors we used the mean and median functions as baseline models 2 6 feature importance analysis the feature importance analysis was carried out by using shap lundberg and lee 2017 it is based on the game theoretically optimal shapley values shapley 1997 shap is a method for estimating the contribution of a factor feature to the prediction shap was chosen over the given feature importance computed by rf for several reasons i it is not model biased in other words it can be computed for any model allowing a fair comparison among different models ii it not only provides the contribution of each variable but it can also calculate the positive or negative influence of each predictor with the output iii its effectiveness has recently been corroborated by various works on environmental issues padarian et al 2020 uusitalo et al 2015 zhong et al 2021 cross et al 2020 this analysis was implemented using the shap python package 3 results 3 1 ff and emls prediction six independent rfr models the first step of this analysis consisted in identifying if an event produces ff and therefore understanding to which class it belongs for both ff definitions fig 2 these categorical variables were one hot encoded for being analyzed by a rfr the second step was related to the emls prediction since emls are continuous variables they were min max normalized as we did for the other continuous variables this led to six regressors being separately developed three models one per pollutant with 5 input a d p r v r p d i a v e and 3 output variables ff yes ff no eml based on 30 80 ff definition and three models with 5 input a d p r v r p d i a v e and 5 output variables ff class 0 ff class 1 ff class 2 ff class 3 eml based on m v curve ff definition the selected hyperparameters max depth n estimators and max features were optimized with a 5 fold cross validation with the training dataset the best values chosen for such parameters are shown in table 2 afterward the rfrs were tested with the testing dataset to correctly evaluate model performance the f1 score was used as the objective function for the categorical variables with the aid of accuracy for validation classification while nse was adopted as the objective function for the continuous variables with the aid of r 2 for validation regression the results of the two steps of the six best rfrs are reported in table 3 such outcomes were obtained by considering the hyperparameter max depth for regularization i e as a parameter that limits the decision tree growth overall the models presented very good results the f1 scores obtained are all higher or equal to 0 65 showing very good model performance this is confirmed by the high accuracy values 0 69 considering the nse rating the eml prediction performance are very good for tss n s e 0 80 tn n s e 0 78 and tp n s e 0 85 the r 2 rating confirmed the very satisfactory results obtained for the three pollutants the model performance is always higher when the 30 80 ff definition is considered since it implies only two classes ff yes or no compared to the four classes of the m v curve definition in fig 3 a graphical comparison between eml predictions and ground truth for the testing dataset is reported for the m v curve ff definitions and for the three pollutants 3 2 ff and emls prediction integrated rfr model after assuring the good performance of the six independent rfrs a step further was taken by increasing the model complexity and developing a single integrated rfr model able to identify the occurrence of ff with its intensity based on 30 80 and m v curve definitions and also predict the eml of any of the three pollutants under study tss tn and tp the matrix 577 26 was the input where 577 are the storm events and 26 are the input output variables input a d p r v r p d i a v e output ff yes or no based on 30 80 ff classes based on the m v curve eml the output variables are calculated per pollutant the steps taken for model cross validation and testing and the hyperparameters chosen for optimization were the same explained in 3 1 for the six independent rfr models the best selected hyperparameters are reported in table 4 the results of the two steps of the integrated model are reported in table 5 and fig 4 despite the increase in model complexity the integrated model presented satisfactory outcomes the f1 score and accuracy values of the ff identification process first step slightly outperformed the ones obtained by the six independent rfr models for 30 80 definition while they are very similar for the m v curve ff definition considering the eml prediction second step the model returned very good results for tss nse 0 81 and r 2 0 82 and for tp nse 0 84 and r 2 0 84 while for tn model performance dropped to 0 49 nse and 0 56 r 2 showing in any case satisfactory outputs 3 3 feature importance the shap values were calculated for the input variables of each of the best rfr models six independent and integrated ones therefore the most influencing features in the prediction of pollutant emls were detected and ranked in figs 5 and 6 the shap values for the six independent rfrs are represented in fig 7 the shap values of the integrated model are reported the variables are ranked in terms of their degree of influence in predicting tss fig 7 a and nutrient fig 7 b and c emls for the study site overall high values of all the input variables have a positive impact on the model outcomes red dots while low values may not have an influence or have a negative impact on model results blue dots in particular i a v e and r p are the most important predictors of tss ff with their high and low values while d is the least important variable for all the models as for tn the entire range of values of a d p has the highest influence on model performance positive values of d have a positive impact on e m l t n prediction while since its negative values present a dense sample cluster close to the zero of the x axis they have a very low impact on the model performance the latter also happens for the entire range of values of r v r p and i a v e as for tp d and r v are the most influencing variables particularly their high values contribute to better model performance while low values of r v and i a v e negatively affect model outcomes a d p is the least influencing variable for all the models 4 discussion 4 1 modeling approach and assessment the main scientific contribution of this study is represented by the integrated machine learning framework that is able not only to identify whether a storm event generates ff and if it does its intensity but also to predict the emls of the three most detected pollutants in urban areas tss tn and tp such framework shows very satisfactory performance in ff identification f 1 a v e r a g e 0 81 and a c c u r a c y a v e r a g e 0 87 for 30 80 definition f 1 a v e r a g e 0 72 and a c c u r a c y a v e r a g e 0 76 for m v curve definition very good results are also achieved for pollutant load prediction e m l t s s n s e 0 81 and r 2 0 82 and e m l t p n s e 0 84 and r 2 0 76 predictions while n s e and r 2 dropped to 0 49 and 0 56 respectively for e m l t n prediction satisfactory performance in their work jeung et al 2019 developed a rf algorithm to predict mass first flush ratio for tss tn tp bod cod and toc they obtained acceptable results for most of the pollutants except for tn n s e 0 05 and r 2 0 29 such model performance decrease may be due to the existence of some unclear relationships between stormwater runoff and water quality for tn in urban regions lee and bang 2000 and more precise monitoring is recommended to gather better model outcomes mannina and viviani 2010 the advantage of this machine learning framework compared to the classical physically based models e g swmm storm infoworks is the amount of input output information required the classical models need as input meteorological information watershed characteristics and drainage system characteristics along with storage treatment system information they use flow rate and pollutant concentration for model calibration output variables the input of our integrated model for predicting emls is limited to precipitation and flow rate pollutant load data is used for model testing output variables it is important to highlight that the dataset used for this study was properly built to test the application of the framework developed 4 2 influencing variables for eml prediction this work also quantified and ranked the most critical variables in predicting sediment and nutrient emls in urban regions by adopting shap a non model biased method such capability was proved by the fact that the results yielded were comparable independently from the model for the ff definitions and the pollutants considered a d p was the most important predictor of e m l t n while it was the lowest or one of the lowest for e m l t s s and e m l t p tss and tp s similar behavior was justified because tp has a higher particle bound component than tn gorgoglione et al 2019b 2021 d highly affects e m l t n and e m l t p while it has a low impact on e m l t s s in this case d influences the dissolved portion of the nutrients in fact the higher d the higher is the runoff volume the smaller is the nutrient concentration due to the dilution process the correlation tn d was also found by jeung et al 2019 who marked that even though this correlation was detected the range in importance rate was wider than the ones found for the other variables therefore the correlation tn rainfall characteristics always requires further research compared to other pollutants despite the low shap values of a d p confirmed by several authors perera et al 2019 jeung et al 2019 the impact of such variable cannot be neglected in a model development since its influence on pollutant ff has been proved in past investigations lee et al 2011 sartor et al 1974 gorgoglione et al 2019a and it was detected in this study for the e m l t n prediction overall it is possible to affirm that the rf models were able to correctly represent the physical processes of build up and wash off of different types of pollutants particle bound and dissolved furthermore compared to other techniques shap proved higher computational performance and overcame the bias of simply quantifying the variable importance without gaining deep insights into the physical processes represented 4 3 practical value of this study the findings of this study represent the first step towards a robust mathematical ff definition which is still a topic under debate the current approach for predicting pollutant ff is based on a graphical representation that adopts hydrograph and pollutograph referred to the same rainfall event this work provides new insights into ff prediction adopting a new integrated framework based on rf and rainfall runoff characteristics it is important to highlight that the dataset used for this study was properly built to test the application of the framework developed even though it is based on data from our case study the framework can be applied to other geographical regions with a complete rainfall runoff dataset therefore the framework developed is generic and independent from the data adopted in this study the outcomes of this study are expected to contribute to accurate ff predictions which can be exploited for the design of treatment systems aimed to store and treat the ff runoff volume this approach can aid in reducing the space required and therefore the correspondent construction and maintenance costs 5 conclusions in this study we developed a machine learning framework based on two of the most commonly adopted ff definitions 30 80 and m v curve and three of the most detected pollutants in urban areas tss tn and tp considering the rainfall runoff variables that characterize a particular event this framework was able to i predict the ff occurrence and its intensity ii in case ff is detected predict the correspondent pollutant load iii quantify and rank the rainfall runoff variables in terms of their influence in the pollutant load prediction firstly we assessed the framework capability in satisfactorily accomplishing i ii and iii separately for the three pollutants and the two ff definitions six independent models then we developed a generic integrated framework that can predict ff occurrence and the correspondent e m l t s s e m l t n and e m l t p based on the two ff definitions in the same model execution the performance of the integrated model even though slightly lower than the ones of the six separated models were overall satisfactory for the prediction of the three pollutant loads n s e 0 81 for e m l t s s n s e 0 84 for e m l t p n s e 0 49 for e m l t n the feature importance analysis run with shap a non model biased method based on game theory revealed that a d p and d are the highest rank factors in predicting e m l t n i a v e and r p are the most influencing variables in predicting e m l t s s d and r v have the highest impact in e m l t p prediction the results highlighted that analyzing the interactions among variables can return more robust predictions instead of studying the role of an individual variable at the time moreover the results allowed us to state that the models were able to represent the physical processes of build up and wash off for different pollutant types dissolved and particle bound the findings of this study will benefit from a more extensive monitoring campaign at the study area to enlarge the observation dataset however they demonstrated the potential of the machine learning framework developed as a modeling tool to predict pollutant loads in case of ff occurrence and therefore aid in better understanding urban stormwater quality processes the outcomes are expected to contribute to the development of accurate stormwater quality models in urban areas and therefore generate valuable stormwater treatment designs research data and software availability the stormwater

2617,pollutant first flush ff is a critical phenomenon in urban regions driven by multiple factors therefore having a robust mathematical ff definition and modeling tool along with thorough knowledge of its main influencing variables is essential machine learning techniques have been widely exploited in the water quality field however their use to predict ff occurrence and pollutant load is limited this study developed a generic machine learning framework based on the two most commonly adopted ff definitions 30 80 and m v curve and implemented for three of the most detected pollutants in urban areas tss tn and tp this framework is able to accurately predict if a rainfall event generates ff and in case it does the correspondent pollutant load very good model performance it can also quantify and rank the most influencing factors using a non model biased method based on game theory shapley additive explanations shap showing that the rainfall variables are the most significant predictors of sediment and nutrient ff occurrence in urban regions the findings proved that the machine learning framework developed in this study can be a valuable modeling tool for improving the accuracy and reliability of pollutant load prediction during ff events in urban areas furthermore they represent one of the first steps towards a robust mathematical ff definition which is still a

2015 dams et al 2013 consequently such land use change not only alters the hydrologic cycle and the pathways by which water reaches urban streams but is also associated with numerous impairments of water yao et al 2016 jeung et al 2019 for this reason urban runoff has been considered as one of the most detrimental non point source pollutions gorgoglione et al 2020 pollutant first flush ff is regularly recognized as the initial and most contaminated portion of the urban runoff even though different criteria have been proposed to quantify a load threshold over which the ff is considered significant this topic is still under debate di modugno et al 2015 saget et al 1996 affirmed that an event generates ff when at least 80 of the pollutant load is washed off by the first 30 of the runoff volume 30 80 definition since the thresholds adopted for this definition 30 and 80 were arbitrary bertrand krajewski et al 1998 introduced a graphical representation for identifying a ff event the mass volume curve m v curve definition it is a dimensionless graph which draws the curve that gives the variation of the cumulative pollutant load divided by the total pollutant load in relation to the cumulative volume divided by the total volume ff is occurring when the m v curve lies above the 1 1 line of such plot in this case the more the curve is far from the 1 1 line the higher the ff intensity is this approach is limited by the fact that it adopts hydrograph and pollutograph referred to the same rainfall event in this context pollutant ff prediction is of paramount importance for the design of stormwater treatment systems accurately quantifying the ff means designing optimal tanks that can opportunely store and treat the most polluted runoff volume reducing unnecessary space and construction maintenance costs bach et al 2010 mamun et al 2020 over the years extensive studies have been carried out to evaluate the ff phenomenon and understand which are the most critical factors that determine its generation as for ff evaluation and pollutant concentration prediction physically based models i e swmm storm infoworks have become a widely used engineering tool showing good performances gorgoglione et al 2018 hur et al 2018 however their application is limited by data availability since they need as input meteorological data catchment and drainage network characteristics along with hydrologic and water quality information flow rate and pollutant concentration for model calibration gorgoglione et al 2016 rodríguez et al 2021 for this reason in the last years the use of machine learning techniques such as random forest rf has been increasing exponentially in different environmental fields tyralis et al 2019 vilaseca et al 2021 rf is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees weak learners that is good in avoiding overfitting and can be adopted in cases characterized by more variables than observations breiman 1996 regarding the most influencing factors gnecco et al 2005 and kang et al 2006 have demonstrated that the ff phenomenon is particularly influenced by antecedent dry period a d p maximum rainfall intensity i m a x and rainfall duration d later lee et al 2011 and gorgoglione et al 2019b also remarked the importance of total rainfall t r and runoff volume r v among the rainfall runoff variables and of the catchment slope s l o p e and the percentage of impervious surface a i m p among the watershed characteristics on the other hand perera et al 2019 stated that total precipitation depth t p d is the most important variable in ff prediction while a d p and a i m p have relatively low impact even though several studies evaluated the high or low influence of rainfall runoff and watershed characteristics on the ff phenomenon only a few of them have quantified and ranked such variables perera et al 2019 jeung et al 2019 furthermore in such cases the feature importance analysis performed was limited by the use of model biased techniques aimed to simply quantify the variable importance without gaining deep insights into the physical processes represented compared with other techniques shapley additive explanations shap proved higher computational performance and a better alignment with human interpretation by simply adding a new class of feature importance measures lundberg and lee 2017 consequently shap has been applied in many fields as a robust model interpretation technique in the last few years zhong et al 2021 padarian et al 2020 cross et al 2020 uusitalo et al 2015 based on these considerations in this study we developed an integrated framework based on machine learning techniques rf and shap able to predict if a rainfall event generates ff and in case it does it can also predict different pollutant loads independently from the ff definition adopted this framework uses the two most common ff definitions 30 80 and m v curve and considers three of the most detected pollutants in urban areas total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp with the aim of developing such a general integrated framework we first assessed its capability in predicting ff occurrence and pollutant load per ff definition and per pollutant six independent rf models after assuring the good performance of such independent models we proceeded with the integrated model implementation one rf for all the pollutants and ff definitions moreover we ranked and interpreted the rainfall runoff variables regarding their degree of influence in predicting pollutant load with a non model biased method feature importance 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology description it is important to highlight that two of the most common ff definitions were adopted in this study 30 80 and m v curve based on the latter definition four ff intensity classes can be identified i class 0 no ff occurrence ii class 1 weak ff intensity iii class 2 medium ff intensity iii class 4 strong ff intensity di modugno et al 2015 furthermore three pollutants were considered for this study tss tn and tp this is justified by the fact that nitrogen and phosphorus are the main nutrients that can be commonly detected in urban wash off gorgoglione et al 2021 pitt 1985 sartor et al 1974 moreover their adsorption to sediment particles or loose soil is the primary form by which their offsite movement occurs gorgoglione et al 2019b hence tss was also considered for this study the methodology adopted in this paper is summarized in fig 1 it can be divided into four main steps step 1 dataset creation three different data sources constituted the complete dataset used for this work observations simulations and generations the observations are observed precipitation flow rate and pollutant concentration recorded during a monitoring campaign carried out at the study area di modugno et al 2015 the simulations represent rainfall runoff events constituted by observed precipitation along with flow rate and pollutant concentration obtained from the hydrologic hydraulic and water quality model swmm rossman 2015 implemented and calibrated for the study area di modugno et al 2015 the observed precipitation was used as model input along with catchment and drainage network characteristics the generations are rainfall runoff events characterized by synthetic precipitation obtained from the iterated random pulse irp model veneziano and iacobellis 2002 used as input of swmm and simulated flow rate and pollutant concentration the irp model generated a 15 year long time series of precipitation with an aggregation of 15 min considering the regional regulation regional regulation 26 2013 single rainfall events were identified based on the criterion of 48 h of antecedent dry weather the complete dataset included 577 rainfall runoff events step 2 data analysis a ff analysis was carried out to identify whether the 577 events generate or not ff based on the two ff definitions adopted in this study 30 80 and m v curve the output of this analysis was used as ground truth for the modeling training and testing processes furthermore an exploratory data analysis eda was conducted to detect outliers understand the pollutant behavior at our case study and select appropriate rainfall runoff variables to avoid correlated variables from concealing crucial relationships between rainfall runoff characteristics and stormwater quality this information was then used in the feature engineering process in which variables were processed and trimmed to increase the model s capability the outcomes of this step are the input output matrices used to train validate and test the models step 3 ff occurrence detection to predict the occurrence of ff based on the two selected ff definitions 30 80 and m v curve for the pollutants under study tss tn tp six independent rf classifiers rfcs were developed by exploiting the input output matrices previously obtained a feature importance analysis was carried out to quantify and rank the rainfall runoff variables in terms of their influence in predicting ff occurrence step 4 ff occurrence detection and event mean load eml prediction we extended the model capability with the objective of predicting pollutant emls in case ff occurrence is detected for a particular rainfall event to this aim six independent rf regressors rfrs were developed two ff definitions times three pollutants furthermore a more general and integrated model that takes into account the two ff definitions and the three pollutants was also devised a feature importance analysis was carried out also for such models it is worth remarking that the work reported in this paper represents step 4 of fig 1 further information methods and results about the previous steps can be found in russo et al 2022 all the analyses related to the four steps were conducted using a desktop computer with an intel core i7 10th generation 32 gb ram ddr4 and 1 tb ssd 2 2 study site and dataset creation the study site is located in southern italy apulia region in the city of sannicandro di bari it is a residential watershed with a drainage surface equal to 31 24 ha and an average slope equal to 1 56 70 of the total area is covered by impervious surfaces mainly streets and roofs while parks and gardens occupy only 3 8 of the catchment sit puglia 2022 the mean annual temperature and precipitation for the study area are 15 0 c and 586 mm respectively three different data sources contributed to the dataset construction used for this study observations simulations and generations an in depth description of them can be found in russo et al 2022 as a result 577 rainfall runoff events constitute the dataset the following variables were computed to characterize each of them a d p d t r average rainfall intensity i a v e i m a x r p and r v the pollutants considered for this study were tss tn and tp event mean concentration e m c t s s e m c t n e m c t p and event mean load e m l t s s e m l t n e m l t p were calculated for the three pollutants and considered as water quality variables it is important to highlight that the complete dataset adopted in this study was properly built to test the performance of the framework here developed the models adopted to simulate swmm and generate irp data were previously satisfactorily calibrated and validated for this study site di modugno et al 2015 veneziano and iacobellis 2002 2 3 data analysis the 30 80 and m v curve graphical methods were applied to identify whether the 577 events generate or not ff for the three pollutants under study in fig 2 the class distribution for 30 80 and m v curve ff definitions are shown in both cases a class imbalance characterizes the dataset based on the 30 80 ff for tss and tp almost 30 of the events generates ff while for tn almost 70 of the events produces ff for the m v curve definition class 2 medium ff is the most populated one for tss 59 and tp 72 and the second most populated for tn 41 after class 3 strong ff 52 class 1 weak ff is the least populated for the three pollutants 8 for tss 1 for tn 9 for tp an eda was carried out to detect possible outliers understand the pollutant behavior for our case study and select appropriate rainfall runoff input variables for the models to avoid correlated variables from concealing crucial relationships between rainfall runoff characteristics and stormwater quality no outliers were detected the variables t r and i m a x were discarded because of their high correlation with t r and r v respectively spearman coefficients equal to 0 99 and 0 97 furthermore it was found that tp has a higher particle bound component than tn which instead tends to decrease its concentration when precipitation and consequently runoff increases dilution process therefore the variables selected to build the input output model matrix were a d p r v r p d i a v e e m l t s s e m l t p and e m l t n further information about eda can be found in russo et al 2022 2 4 random forest rf is a supervised machine learning algorithm able to represent non linear relationships it is an ensemble method i e it is composed of many decision trees weak learners that are used to predict a value regression or a class classification its response is the average of the predicted values for regression or the most predicted class for classification breiman 2001 in this work we will exploit the capability of this algorithm as a rfr rf uses bootstrap aggregating bagging methods to reduce model variance breiman 1996 such methods build multiple instances of a random subset of the original training set and aggregate those individual predictions to form the final prediction moreover when creating such instances rf also randomizes the model features set by randomizing the weak learner building process and then forming an ensemble from it the variance of the model is decreased the injected randomness separates the prediction errors of individual weak learners by averaging these predictions some errors can cancel each other out therefore bagging methods work best with strong and complex models rf vs decision tree breiman 2001 2 4 1 regression it is important to highlight that emls are predicted here if a rainfall event produces ff therefore rfr is prior used for classification ff occurrence or not and if ff occurs is also used as a regressor to predict eml when using a regressor for a classification problem we need to transform the categorical variables i e discrete into continuous ones this process is called encoding in this work we used one hot encoding zheng and casari 2018 in general if a categorical variable has m possible values m number of classes it is substituted with m variables with domain 0 1 each input row will only have one 1 in the variable corresponding to its class in our models it was used to encode the classes of the ff events for both 30 80 and m v ff definitions when one hot encoding is used for an output variable a single output problem becomes multi output since a single variable is transformed into as many variables as the number of classes in the end the objective is to select the class chosen by the model one immediate way to do this is by taking the category which has the highest output value this is achieved using the argmax function which returns the index of the variable with the highest value to predict eml which is a continuous variable a regressor model is needed therefore rfr was adopted to predict pollutant load in case a rainfall event generates ff in particular as we mentioned in section 2 1 we developed six independent rfrs one per pollutant tss tn and tp and one per ff definition 30 80 and m v curve independent rfrs furthermore we implemented one more rfr able to predict the load of the three pollutants at the same time integrated rfr the python class randomforestregressor from the sklearn ensemble package was used to implement our rfr algorithms and the class onehotencoder from the sklearn preprocessing package was adopted for variable encoding 2 5 model cross validation and testing the rfrs were cross validated and tested by dividing the rainfall runoff dataset into training 75 and testing the remaining 25 subsets the two subsets were randomly selected to minimize the model bias a 5 fold cross validation was adopted a hyperparameter optimization process that aims at achieving an accurate and reliable model is executed during cross validation in this study the open source python library optuna for hyperparameter optimization was adopted it aims to balance the sampling and pruning algorithms akiba et al 2019 the following hyperparameters were considered for model cross validation i n estimators is the number of decision trees in the forest it is related to the bagging process by controlling the number of instances in the ensemble ii max features is the maximum number of features that a tree can consider it is related to the randomization of model features and represents the number of features to consider when looking for the best split iii max depth is the maximum depth of each tree in the forest it controls the decision tree growth the deeper the tree the more splits it has and it captures more information about the data a regularization mechanism was applied to rf to prevent over fitting adopting max depth as the parameter for pruning after identifying the best set of hyperparameters the final scoring was computed on the testing dataset using the model that implements such best set to assess model performance several metrics were adopted for classification the accuracy and the f1 score were considered perera et al 2019 davis and goadrich 2006 flach and kull 2015 1 a c c u r a c y t r u e p o s i t i v e s f a l s e n e g a t i v e s t o t s 2 f 1 2 p r p r where true positives and false negatives represent the correctly classified samples t o t s represents the total number of samples p is the precision and r is the recall that are respectively equal to 3 p t r u e p o s i

classified samples it gives an immediate and intuitive representation of how the model behaves f1 score behaves better in the case of unbalanced classes and also takes into account the non corrected classified samples false positives davis and goadrich 2006 flach and kull 2015 the f1 score was used as the objective function for classification and the accuracy was computed for validation f1 score and accuracy range between 0 1 the closer to 1 the more accurate the model for regression the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r 2 were adopted chen et al 2017 rodríguez et al 2021 5 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y i ˆ 2 i 1 n y i y 2 6 r 2 i 1 n y i y y i ˆ y ˆ i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i ˆ y ˆ 2 2 where n is the number of samples y i and y i ˆ are the i th observed and predicted values y and y ˆ are the average of the observed and predicted values the nse varies in the range 1 the closer to 1 the more accurate the model is in particular if n s e 1 the predictions perfectly match the observations if n s e 0 the predictions are as good as the observed mean if n s e 0 the observed mean is a better predictor than predicted values the r 2 varies in the range 0 1 as well as nse the closer to one the more accurate the model in particular if r 2 1 predicted values perfectly match the observations nse was here adopted as the objective function for rfr r 2 was computed for validation table 1 summarizes the performance evaluation criteria for nse and r 2 defined according to the water quality standard review chen et al 2017 rodríguez et al 2021 physical water quality variables include tss while tn and tp are part of the chemical water quality variables for classifiers we used stratified and uniform models as baselines for regressors we used the mean and median functions as baseline models 2 6 feature importance analysis the feature importance analysis was carried out by using shap lundberg and lee 2017 it is based on the game theoretically optimal shapley values shapley 1997 shap is a method for estimating the contribution of a factor feature to the prediction shap was chosen over the given feature importance computed by rf for several reasons i it is not model biased in other words it can be computed for any model allowing a fair comparison among different models ii it not only provides the contribution of each variable but it can also calculate the positive or negative influence of each predictor with the output iii its effectiveness has recently been corroborated by various works on environmental issues padarian et al 2020 uusitalo et al 2015 zhong et al 2021 cross et al 2020 this analysis was implemented using the shap python package 3 results 3 1 ff and emls prediction six independent rfr models the first step of this analysis consisted in identifying if an event produces ff and therefore understanding to which class it belongs for both ff definitions fig 2 these categorical variables were one hot encoded for being analyzed by a rfr the second step was related to the emls prediction since emls are continuous variables they were min max normalized as we did for the other continuous variables this led to six regressors being separately developed three models one per pollutant with 5 input a d p r v r p d i a v e and 3 output variables ff yes ff no eml based on 30 80 ff definition and three models with 5 input a d p r v r p d i a v e and 5 output variables ff class 0 ff class 1 ff class 2 ff class 3 eml based on m v curve ff definition the selected hyperparameters max depth n estimators and max features were optimized with a 5 fold cross validation with the training dataset the best values chosen for such parameters are shown in table 2 afterward the rfrs were tested with the testing dataset to correctly evaluate model performance the f1 score was used as the objective function for the categorical variables with the aid of accuracy for validation classification while nse was adopted as the objective function for the continuous variables with the aid of r 2 for validation regression the results of the two steps of the six best rfrs are reported in table 3 such outcomes were obtained by considering the hyperparameter max depth for regularization i e as a parameter that limits the decision tree growth overall the models presented very good results the f1 scores obtained are all higher or equal to 0 65 showing very good model performance this is confirmed by the high accuracy values 0 69 considering the nse rating the eml prediction performance are very good for tss n s e 0 80 tn n s e 0 78 and tp n s e 0 85 the r 2 rating confirmed the very satisfactory results obtained for the three pollutants the model performance is always higher when the 30 80 ff definition is considered since it implies only two classes ff yes or no compared to the four classes of the m v curve definition in fig 3 a graphical comparison between eml predictions and ground truth for the testing dataset is reported for the m v curve ff definitions and for the three pollutants 3 2 ff and emls prediction integrated rfr model after assuring the good performance of the six independent rfrs a step further was taken by increasing the model complexity and developing a single integrated rfr model able to identify the occurrence of ff with its intensity based on 30 80 and m v curve definitions and also predict the eml of any of the three pollutants under study tss tn and tp the matrix 577 26 was the input where 577 are the storm events and 26 are the input output variables input a d p r v r p d i a v e output ff yes or no based on 30 80 ff classes based on the m v curve eml the output variables are calculated per pollutant the steps taken for model cross validation and testing and the hyperparameters chosen for optimization were the same explained in 3 1 for the six independent rfr models the best selected hyperparameters are reported in table 4 the results of the two steps of the integrated model are reported in table 5 and fig 4 despite the increase in model complexity the integrated model presented satisfactory outcomes the f1 score and accuracy values of the ff identification process first step slightly outperformed the ones obtained by the six independent rfr models for 30 80 definition while they are very similar for the m v curve ff definition considering the eml prediction second step the model returned very good results for tss nse 0 81 and r 2 0 82 and for tp nse 0 84 and r 2 0 84 while for tn model performance dropped to 0 49 nse and 0 56 r 2 showing in any case satisfactory outputs 3 3 feature importance the shap values were calculated for the input variables of each of the best rfr models six independent and integrated ones therefore the most influencing features in the prediction of pollutant emls were detected and ranked in figs 5 and 6 the shap values for the six independent rfrs are represented in fig 7 the shap values of the integrated model are reported the variables are ranked in terms of their degree of influence in predicting tss fig 7 a and nutrient fig 7 b and c emls for the study site overall high values of all the input variables have a positive impact on the model outcomes red dots while low values may not have an influence or have a negative impact on model results blue dots in particular i a v e and r p are the most important predictors of tss ff with their high and low values while d is the least important variable for all the models as for tn the entire range of values of a d p has the highest influence on model performance positive values of d have a positive impact on e m l t n prediction while since its negative values present a dense sample cluster close to the zero of the x axis they have a very low impact on the model performance the latter also happens for the entire range of values of r v r p and i a v e as for tp d and r v are the most influencing variables particularly their high values contribute to better model performance while low values of r v and i a v e negatively affect model outcomes a d p is the least influencing variable for all the models 4 discussion 4 1 modeling approach and assessment the main scientific contribution of this study is represented by the integrated machine learning framework that is able not only to identify whether a storm event generates ff and if it does its intensity but also to predict the emls of the three most detected pollutants in urban areas tss tn and tp such framework shows very satisfactory performance in ff identification f 1 a v e r a g e 0 81 and a c c u r a c y a v e r a g e 0 87 for 30 80 definition f 1 a v e r a g e 0 72 and a c c u r a c y a v e r a g e 0 76 for m v curve definition very good results are also achieved for pollutant load prediction e m l t s s n s e 0 81 and r 2 0 82 and e m l t p n s e 0 84 and r 2 0 76 predictions while n s e and r 2 dropped to 0 49 and 0 56 respectively for e m l t n prediction satisfactory performance in their work jeung et al 2019 developed a rf algorithm to predict mass first flush ratio for tss tn tp bod cod and toc they obtained acceptable results for most of the pollutants except for tn n s e 0 05 and r 2 0 29 such model performance decrease may be due to the existence of some unclear relationships between stormwater runoff and water quality for tn in urban regions lee and bang 2000 and more precise monitoring is recommended to gather better model outcomes mannina and viviani 2010 the advantage of this machine learning framework compared to the classical physically based models e g swmm storm infoworks is the amount of input output information required the classical models need as input meteorological information watershed characteristics and drainage system characteristics along with storage treatment system information they use flow rate and pollutant concentration for model calibration output variables the input of our integrated model for predicting emls is limited to precipitation and flow rate pollutant load data is used for model testing output variables it is important to highlight that the dataset used for this study was properly built to test the application of the framework developed 4 2 influencing variables for eml prediction this work also quantified and ranked the most critical variables in predicting sediment and nutrient emls in urban regions by adopting shap a non model biased method such capability was proved by the fact that the results yielded were comparable independently from the model for the ff definitions and the pollutants considered a d p was the most important predictor of e m l t n while it was the lowest or one of the lowest for e m l t s s and e m l t p tss and tp s similar behavior was justified because tp has a higher particle bound component than tn gorgoglione et al 2019b 2021 d highly affects e m l t n and e m l t p while it has a low impact on e m l t s s in this case d influences the dissolved portion of the nutrients in fact the higher d the higher is the runoff volume the smaller is the nutrient concentration due to the dilution process the correlation tn d was also found by jeung et al 2019 who marked that even though this correlation was detected the range in importance rate was wider than the ones found for the other variables therefore the correlation tn rainfall characteristics always requires further research compared to other pollutants despite the low shap values of a d p confirmed by several authors perera et al 2019 jeung et al 2019 the impact of such variable cannot be neglected in a model development since its influence on pollutant ff has been proved in past investigations lee et al 2011 sartor et al 1974 gorgoglione et al 2019a and it was detected in this study for the e m l t n prediction overall it is possible to affirm that the rf models were able to correctly represent the physical processes of build up and wash off of different types of pollutants particle bound and dissolved furthermore compared to other techniques shap proved higher computational performance and overcame the bias of simply quantifying the variable importance without gaining deep insights into the physical processes represented 4 3 practical value of this study the findings of this study represent the first step towards a robust mathematical ff definition which is still a topic under debate the current approach for predicting pollutant ff is based on a graphical representation that adopts hydrograph and pollutograph referred to the same rainfall event this work provides new insights into ff prediction adopting a new integrated framework based on rf and rainfall runoff characteristics it is important to highlight that the dataset used for this study was properly built to test the application of the framework developed even though it is based on data from our case study the framework can be applied to other geographical regions with a complete rainfall runoff dataset therefore the framework developed is generic and independent from the data adopted in this study the outcomes of this study are expected to contribute to accurate ff predictions which can be exploited for the design of treatment systems aimed to store and treat the ff runoff volume this approach can aid in reducing the space required and therefore the correspondent construction and maintenance costs 5 conclusions in this study we developed a machine learning framework based on two of the most commonly adopted ff definitions 30 80 and m v curve and three of the most detected pollutants in urban areas tss tn and tp considering the rainfall runoff variables that characterize a particular event this framework was able to i predict the ff occurrence and its intensity ii in case ff is detected predict the correspondent pollutant load iii quantify and rank the rainfall runoff variables in terms of their influence in the pollutant load prediction firstly we assessed the framework capability in satisfactorily accomplishing i ii and iii separately for the three pollutants and the two ff definitions six independent models then we developed a generic integrated framework that can predict ff occurrence and the correspondent e m l t s s e m l t n and e m l t p based on the two ff definitions in the same model execution the performance of the integrated model even though slightly lower than the ones of the six separated models were overall satisfactory for the prediction of the three pollutant loads n s e 0 81 for e m l t s s n s e 0 84 for e m l t p n s e 0 49 for e m l t n the feature importance analysis run with shap a non model biased method based on game theory revealed that a d p and d are the highest rank factors in predicting e m l t n i a v e and r p are the most influencing variables in predicting e m l t s s d and r v have the highest impact in e m l t p prediction the results highlighted that analyzing the interactions among variables can return more robust predictions instead of studying the role of an individual variable at the time moreover the results allowed us to state that the models were able to represent the physical processes of build up and wash off for different pollutant types dissolved and particle bound the findings of this study will benefit from a more extensive monitoring campaign at the study area to enlarge the observation dataset however they demonstrated the potential of the machine learning framework developed as a modeling tool to predict pollutant loads in case of ff occurrence and therefore aid in better understanding urban stormwater quality processes the outcomes are expected to contribute to the development of accurate stormwater quality models in urban areas and therefore generate valuable stormwater treatment designs research data and software availability the stormwater

2618,streams are vital landscape ecosystems and urbanization and modern agriculture have introduced pollutants including excess nitrate which threaten these waterways riparian zones have been shown to attenuate pollutants and riparian buffers are commonly implemented to capture these benefits nevertheless preferential flowpaths such as soil pipes have potential to bypass such attenuation we used a modflow groundwater model with the conduit flow package cfp along with the groundwater transport code mt3d usgs to simulate flow of water and nitrate through riparian groundwater to a gaining stream we conducted a numerical sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of soil pipe presence and characteristics as wells as soil matrix characteristics on nitrate transport and uptake by denitrification within the saturated zone we found that in systems with 2 0 m long soil pipes low head gradient h less than 0 0035 low hydraulic conductivity k 10 4 75 m s and high reaction constant k 4 day 1 soil pipes increased riparian bypass of nitrate by several orders of magnitude yet soil pipes increased the volumetric flowrate of water across the riparian zone only by up to 3 9 times this comparatively greater effect on transport occurred because the accelerated advection of nitrate through the soil pipes decreased the residence time available for denitrification we created two non dimensional parameters that show when bypass will be important the riparian bypass potential ψ that accounts for key governing factors such as volumetric flowrate and damköhler number and riparian predictive index ζ which is calculated from easily measurable parameters nitrate bypass starts to increase by orders of magnitude above ψ 2 75 and ζ 3 4 our results emphasize the importance of accounting for soil pipes when constructing riparian buffers and predicting their effects on dissolved pollutant transport keywords riparian zone floodplains preferential flow nutrients data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction streams and rivers act as a hotbed for biodiversity and nexus for ecological flourishment baxter et al 2005 colvin et al 2019 moore and palmer 2005 and play a pivotal role in nitrogen cycling peterson et al 2001 surface waters account for roughly 70 of drinking water in the united states dieter et al 2018 therefore it is important to understand phenomenon which transport pathways to these vital components of our ecosystem urbanization modern agriculture and other anthropogenic activities have added increased pollutants including nitrogen excess nitrogen n and specifically nitrate no3 end up in streams due to agriculture and urban development royer et al 2006 and contribute to eutrophication in downstream inland and coastal surface waters around the world boesch et al 2001 dodds 2006 dodds et al 2009 kemp et al 2005 liu et al 2015 sinha et al 2017 struijs et al 2011 thus knowledge of the efficacy and limitations of natural denitrification mechanisms in the landscape is paramount one of the primary natural filtration and denitrification sites is the riparian zone hester and fox 2020 hill 1996 hill 2019 the riparian zone is the strip of land immediately adjacent to the stream banks it typically includes vegetation an organic soil layer unsaturated groundwater vadose zone and the saturated groundwater beneath riparian buffers are a subset of riparian zones that remove pollutants coming from adjacent human dominated uplands dosskey et al 1997 riparian buffers mitigate bank erosion enhancing geomorphic stability they trap sediment bound contaminants at the surface and attenuate reactive contaminants e g nitrates in groundwater from anthropogenic sources such as farms commercial areas and industrial parks fennessy and cronk 1997 mayer and canfield 2018 osborne and kovacic 1993 stutter et al 2019 turunen et al 2019 unfortunately various bypass mechanisms offer ways nitrate and other pollutants can circumvent the riparian zone undermining its filtering capabilities inamdar 2006 o donnell and jones 2006 steiness et al 2021 one bypass mechanism in riparian groundwater is preferential flow a phenomenon where a slender portion of soil or sediment exhibits significantly faster flow than the rest of the surrounding area and accounts for a significant portion of the flow in the entire domain as shown by tracer studies allaire et al 2015 fox et al 2011 heeren et al 2010 extensive long term nitrate sampling in riparian zone piezometers has revealed a small portion of groundwater accounting for a large amount of no3 discharge evident through observations of spatial distribution of contaminant delivery patterns angier and mccarty 2008 angier et al 2001 angier et al 2005 o driscoll and dewalle 2010 smethurst et al 2014 williams et al 2014 spatial distribution of denitrification enzyme activity also indicates that preferential flow is a widespread phenomenon in riparian zones mccarty et al 2007 bypass can occur in both alluvium of elevated hydraulic conductivity as well as enlarged void spaces as an example of the former significant nitrate can bypass riparian zones through gravel veins burt et al 1999 and zones of permeable sands devito et al 2000 as an example of the latter soil pipes are common along banks of lower order streams hester et al 2020 menichino et al 2015 macropores and soil pipes can short circuit hydrologic flow between an agricultural catchment and the stream allowing pesticides and fertilizers to circumvent or bypass the soil matrix and associated processes bernatek jakiel et al 2017 orozco lopez et al 2018 effluent from soil pipes and macropores can contribute more than half the total nitrate load to channels bohlke et al 2007 while the ability of preferential flow paths to undermine riparian buffer functions has been established steiness et al 2021 the effects of soil pipe characteristics on riparian nitrate removal have not been systematically quantified in this study we sought to quantify the relationships between soil pipe and soil matrix characteristics and riparian bypass of a widespread pollutant excess nitrate we used numerical methods to explore the effects of soil pipe length diameter density and the effects of soil matrix hydraulic conductivity first order reaction constant and hydraulic gradient on nitrate riparian bypass we also examined the effects of gravel veins for comparison 2 methods 2 1 hydraulics governing equations and boundary conditions we modeled riparian groundwater hydraulics adjacent to a gaining stream or river using modflow harbaugh 2005 to solve the 2d transient unconfined isotropic saturated groundwater flow boussinesq equation eqn 1 2d was chosen over 3d because prior studies found that hydraulics and contaminant transport in riparian settings remained essentially unaffected by the vertical placement of submerged pipes lotts and hester 2020 lotts and hester 2022 which suggests that the increased complexity parameterization and numerical challenges necessary for a 3d unconfined model particularly with regards to wetting and drying were not justified furthermore in unconfined systems such as riparian zones the flowlines are often assumed to be horizontal and equipotentials vertical freeze and cherry 1979 we ran the model to steady state on a rectangular prismatic domain 5 5 m in the x direction parallel to the stream channel 2 0 m in the y direction perpendicular to the stream channel and 2 0 m in the z direction corresponding to depth gray area in fig 1 1 x h h x y h h y r k s y k h t cartesian spatial coordinates l are denoted by x y and z h is hydraulic head l r is volumetric flux per unit volume of sources and sinks t 1 sy is specific yield dimensionless k is the hydraulic conductivity of riparian soil l t 1 and t is time t the model domain is similar to lotts and hester 2020 with 275 rows and 100 columns of 2 0 cm by 2 0 cm computational cells in the x and y directions respectively lotts and hester 2020 employed the same governing equation and soil pipe configuration as this study and their supplemental showed that a 4 cm grid produces identical results as a 2 cm grid thereby demonstrating that a 2 cm grid is sufficiently small the model also had one layer 2 0 m thick with a spatially varying water table the stream channel was represented with a constant head boundary right hand of gray area fig 1b to represent a steady state channel flow depth of 1 m stream channel in fig 1b the upslope boundary left hand side of gray area in fig 1b was also a constant head boundary which we set to achieve a desired steady state gaining head gradient toward the channel section 2 3 we modeled soil pipe flow in a separate domain using the conduit flow package cfp shoemaker et al 2007 the cfp has generally been used to model large scale karst terrain conduits saller et al 2013 xu et al 2015 however karay and hajnal 2015 demonstrated the efficacy of the cfp package for modeling small scale conduit networks by reproducing laboratory results for a conduit network of 0 8 and 3 2 cm diameter conduits and gallegos et al 2013 showed that the cfp performs better than high matrix k cells in modeling a 2 cm diameter conduit network in laboratory settings furthermore lotts and hester 2020 successfully reproduced trends of a riparian field study menichino and hester 2015 the domain for the current study consisted of one or more 1d soil pipes within the saturated zone divided into nodes which correspond in one to one fashion to cells in the soil matrix domain fig 1a the cfp applies kirchhoff s law 2 ip 1 np q ip q ex q s 0 to all the nodes q in the pipe domain where i p 1 n p q i p is the sum of volumetric flows at node q coming from all pipe

number at the outlet ranged from 1 to 600 for all scenarios so flow was always laminar and eq 4 was not used the two domains are coupled at each corresponding node with an exchange term eq 5 and thereby the soil pipes act as a head dependent flux boundary condition to riparian soil matrix domain 5 q ex α i j h q h i j where q e x and α i j are the volumetric flowrate l3 t 1 and conductance l2 t 1 between the soil pipe and riparian soil at modflow respectively and h i j is the hydraulic head l in cell i j shoemaker et al 2007 we set α to 6 28 10 6 m2 s to be consistent with k of the surrounding soil matrix using eqn 38 of shoemaker et al 2007 and then varied α with k in our sensitivity analysis sections 2 3 we chose to have all soil pipes connect to the stream bank which we call bank facing soil pipes this decision reflects their documented commonness along streams hester et al 2020 menichino et al 2015 and their heightened potential to affect the stream channel given their direct connection 2 2 nitrate transport governing equations and boundary conditions we solved the advection dispersion reaction equation in saturated groundwater using a first order reaction term in mt3d usgs bedekar et al 2016 to obtain dissolved nitrate concentration at each node in the modeling domain gray area in fig 1 6 c t x i d ij c x j x i v i c k c where c is the nitrate concentration at a given node i j ml 3 t is time t x i is the cartesian spatial coordinate l d ij is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2 t 1 vj is the seepage or linear pore water velocity l t 1 k is a first order reaction rate constant t 1 we are justified in using first order kinetics since we are only interested in the ideal scenario for denitrification i e the subset of riparian soils where redox conditions favor denitrification where there is effectively infinite labile dissolved carbon plenty of nitrate and anoxic conditions riparian zones commonly exhibit anoxic conditions briggs et al 2013 cooper 1990 galloway et al 2004 hill 2019 mcdowell et al 1992 and riparian and hyporheic zone soil waters are rich with dissolved organic carbon fiebig et al 1990 first order kinetics in many cases have reliably reproduced nitrate field data in the riparian zone boyer et al 2006 gilles et al 2009 pittroff et al 2017 rahimi et al 2015 sheibley et al 2003 zarnetske et al 2015 furthermore first order kinetics closely resemble monod kinetics when nitrate concentrations are below the half reaction constant of a typical riparian soil 1 64 mg l hester et al 2018 hester et al 2016 zarnetske et al 2012 which they are for our study given we set the upslope concentration to 1 0 mg l thus first order kinetics are a parsimonious way to simulate denitrification and probe our research objectives in a way applicable to a large subset of riparian zones we set the upslope boundary left hand side of the gray area in fig 1 as specified concentration of 1 0 mg l which represented nitrate coming from a source such as farmland or a leaky sewer pipe while these sources would often be further than two m from the channel our choice of 2 meter domain reflects current knowledge where very few studies map riparian soil pipes one of the best extant studies gormally et al 2011 shows many soil pipes approximately perpendicular to the stream roughly 2 or less m in length similarly menichino et al 2015 and hester et al 2020 show a maximum soil pipe length of 1 2 m the latter length data were only to the first bend in the soil pipe as measured from the bank face and thus are underestimates in some cases but are among the only systematic data available we discuss the implications of these spatial layout assumptions in section 4 3 mt3d usgs cannot directly simulate transport within conduits where flow is simulated by the cfp since flow in our simulated riparian soil matrix converged on the soil pipes except in cases with more than one soil pipe where there were transverse head gradients we simulated contaminant transport in the soil pipes with a one way coupled model in python 3 where we applied mass conservation to each node in the pipe domain eqn 7 since denitrification occurs via the biofilm attached to sediment surfaces and there is negligible sediment surface area in the pipes relative to that in the matrix as a first approximation we assumed no nitrate reaction in the soil pipes 7 q out c out q q inflow c inflow q q ex c i j q where q o u t and q i n f l o w are the flow out of and into respectively pipe node q l3t 1 and c o u t and c i n f l o w are the concentrations of nitrate flowing out of and into from the adjacent upslope pipe node node q respectively ml 3 q e x is the exchange term from eq 5 and c i j is the concentration of the corresponding riparian soil matrix node ml 3 using python 3 we extracted values from the cfp output files to populate q o u t q i n f l o w and q e x for all nodes q in the pipe domain and concentration values from mt3d usgs to populate c i j we calculated the mass balance across the bank face along the domain of interest i e total mass flowing into the stream channel as 8 m total m pipe m soil where m t o t a l is the total nitrate mass flowrate across the bank face mt 1 and m p i p e is the nitrate mass flowrate of the soil pipe s emptying into the stream channel mt 1 obtained from the q out c out q value for the most downslope rightmost node node in the pipe domain eq 7 we obtained m s o i l mt 1 by integrating the nitrate flux over the boundary between the riparian soil and stream channel 9 m soil 0 m 1 m c x q x j d x where we have defined x 0 m and x 1 m as the up and downstream ends of the domain of interest fig 1b respectively c x is the concentration along the bank face which varies with x ml 3 h x is the hydraulic head at the boundary which varies with x l q x is the specific discharge at a given point along the bank face lt 1 q x has components in x and y direction and j is the unit vector in the y direction dimensionless 2 3 parameter selection and sensitivity analysis we define riparian bypass as the ratio of the mass flowrate of nitrate flowing from the domain of interest fig 1 to the stream channel relative to the equivalent mass flowrate with soil pipes this shows the extent to which soil pipes intensify mass transport from the upslope pollutant source to the stream we refer to this ratio as the normalized mass flowrate m m 0 dimensionless it is calculated as 10 m m 0 m total ρ 0 m 1 m total ρ 0 m 1 where ρ 0 m 1 is a soil pipe density of zero soil pipes per m and ρ 0 is a soil pipe per m density other than zero 1 2 3 4 or 5 we explored how a variety of both soil pipe and soil matrix parameters table 1 impact m m 0 we examined the effect of three different soil pipe parameters including soil pipe density soil pipes per m ρ l 1 soil pipe length l l and soil pipe diameter d l we based the range of values of these parameters roughly on those for bank facing soil pipes in hester et al 2020 and menichino et al 2015 the base case was ρ 1 m 1 since that value facilitated isolation of the effects of other parameters we varied l from 0 m to 2 m based on the bank facing soil pipes mapped with ground penetrating radar gpr in gormally et al 2011 and we set the base case to the midpoint of that interval 1 m the diameter range varied from 0 to 5 cm hester et al 2020 menichino et al 2015 although there are larger soil pipes the effects asymptote sharply after d 1 cm as the system becomes exchange limited section 3 and the vast majority of the soil pipes in prior studies have diameters below 5 cm hester et al 2020 the base case was set to d 2 cm we examined the effect of three soil matrix parameters matrix k l t nitrate first order reaction decay rate in the soil matrix k t 1 and head gradient perpendicular to the channel and parallel to the soil pipe h ll 1 fig 1 we varied h from 0 0025 to h 0 025 which are common in stream and river banks lacombe and rosman 1997 usgs 2005 and allows m m 0 to span from very small m m 0 1 to large m m 0 3 105 we varied matrix k from 10 5 m s to k 10 4 m s which corresponds to fine sand silty sand or silt which are common in riparian sediments anderson et al 2015 heath 1983 lotts and hester 2020 and allows m m 0 to span roughly the same range 1 3 105 as the selected h interval likewise we varied k through a subset of the interval examined in hester et al 2016 from k 0 6 day 1 to k 6 day 1 which also spans a similar range of m m 0 as with h and k the base case parameters were h 0 0025 k 10 4 m s k 0 6 day 1 since they were common in situ anderson et al 2015 hester et al 2016 lacombe and rosman 1997 usgs 2005 since the relationships of m m 0 versus l were often strongly exponential section 3 we chose to conduct sensitivity analyses for each value of l throughout the entire parameter ranges of the soil matrix and reaction parameters h matrix k k table 1 thus we explored the controlling parameter space beyond a simple one at a time approach by contrast we only conducted m m 0 versus d sensitivity analysis for variation in h similarly we only conducted one sensitivity analysis for ρ for the base case of k k h and d we did not perform this at the base case for h 0 025 since we would need two way coupling not just a one way coupling to model the water and nitrate going back into the matrix due to transverse head gradients the one way coupling incorrectly models water driven into the matrix by the transverse head gradient as having no nitrate for h 0 025 much solute would be ejected back into the matrix and ultimately end up in the stream and modeling it without nitrate drastically underestimates m m 0 this assumption does not matter for h 0 0025 since negligible nitrate even makes it to the pipes and practically none of the nitrate which is ejected back into the matrix makes it to the stream in addition to soil pipes preferential flow in alluvium can also occur through areas of higher permeability sediment fox et al 2011 fuchs et al 2009 the actual hydraulic conductivity of the sediment in such preferential flowpaths can vary considerably but for convenience we refer to all such preferential flowpaths as gravel veins while the focus of our study is soil pipes we conducted a small number of model runs on gravel veins for comparison in particular we compared m m 0 for a system with a single 1 0 m long soil pipe to that with a single 1 0 m long gravel vein m m 0 for gravel veins is mass flow of nitrate in a system with a gravel vein divided by the mass flow of nitrate in a system without a gravel vein we examined two gravel vein widths 0 16 m and 0 3 m wide the widths are arbitrary but make sense within the 1 0 m wide domain of interest fig 1 since 0 16 m 8 cells wide is a very narrow gravel vein and anything much 0 3 m takes up a sizeable portion of the domain since the height of the water table i e model saturated thickness is 1 0 m at the bank face the cross sectional areas of the gravel veins are 0 16 m2 and 0 3 m2 we varied the hydraulic conductivity in the gravel vein kvein ms 1 from 10 3 5 m s to 10 2 m s kvein 10 3 5 10 3 25 10 3 10 2 5 10 2 25 and 10 2 m s commensurate with the k range found in gravel alluvium alongside streams chen 2004 cheong et al 2008 fox et al 2011 miller et al 2014 2 4 particle tracking and residence time calculation to determine residence times τ t of riparian groundwater flowpaths within the matrix we used the particle tracking package modpath7 pollock 2016 for each simulation we released 8 particles in each cell of the upslope boundary left hand side of the gray area in the domain of interest and we extended the particle release past the domain of interest in both directions so that we calculated residence time for each particle crossing the bank face on the stream channel boundary of the domain of interest right side of gray area in fig 1 we then calculated the average τ across all released particles τavg for simplicity we did not account for residence time in the soil pipes this approximation is reasonable because the primary removal mechanism is the biofilm attached to the sediment surfaces in the matrix and the sediment surface area to water volume ratio is much greater in the matrix than the soil pipes furthermore the residence time in the soil pipes are orders of magnitude shorter than the matrix e g o 103 for the base case the specific discharge in modflow must be divided by effective porosity to account the fact that water only flows through the sediment void spaces and not through the whole cross section and some of it will adhere to the porous media surface therefore not using the entire void space thus modpath calculates the velocity of the particle as follows v k h η e where η e is effective porosity for all particle tracking purposes we used η e of 0 25 commensurate with sand gravel and silt gelhar et al 1992 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analyses of soil pipe and matrix physicochemical parameters our results show that soil pipes increased flow towards the streambank by up to 3 9 times within the range of parameter values in our sensitivity analysis fig 2 the magnitude of that increase varied depending upon the number and dimensions of the soil pipes for example as soil pipe length l increased the normalized flowrate of water toward the streambank q q0 increased non linearly up to 3 9 times that without soil pipes fig 2a this non linear behavior is due to a non linear increase in the length of the isopotentials along which an integral of the normal fluxes determines the flux into the pipe fig 6 of lotts and hester 2020 by contrast as soil pipe diameter d increased q q0 quickly increased to 1 5 and then leveled off sharply because the maximum potential pipe flow is greater than the maximum potential exchange rate between the matrix and pipe i e flow in the pipe shifts from pipe limited to exchange limited fig 2b and lotts and hester 2020 q q0 increased at a decreasing rate with soil pipe density ρ since less flow can occur through the middle pipes with each pipe added for ρ 3 fig 2c neither hydraulic head gradient toward the channel h nor matrix hydraulic conductivity k had any effect on q q0 fig 2de since an increase in h or k increased the matrix to pipe flow by the same factor they increased flow from the matrix directly to the streambank we define normalized concentration c c0 as the concentration where the soil pipe flows into the stream channel divided by the concentration at the same location in the matrix without soil pipes our results for c c0 were very similar to q q0 there was a non linear increase in c c0 versus l fig 3 a a steep initial increase in c c0 vs d with a sharp leveling off for d s greater than 1 cm fig 3b and a linear increase with ρ fig 3c however unlike for q q0 c c0 varied with both k and h in particular an asymptotic decrease fig 3ef for low values of k and h the existence of the soil pipe made a profound difference in concentration reaching the stream since nitrate moved very slowly in the matrix under these conditions and can move much more quickly in the soil pipe hence leading to a larger disparity between c and c0 we also observed a non linear increase in c c0 with respect to k fig 3d where at high values of k proportionally more removal occurs in the surrounding matrix which drives up relative concentrations in the pipe our results show that soil pipes also significantly increased the mass flowrate of nitrate towards the streambank fig 4 in a very similar way to c c0 we refer to this increase as riparian bypass which is quantified as the normalized mass flowrate i e mass flowrate of nitrate with soil pipes divided by mass flowrate without soil pipes m m 0 the degree of increase i e magnitude of m m 0 was highly variable depending on values of controlling parameters yet the overall magnitude of increase was much greater than the increase in q q0 ranging up to hundreds or thousands of times for most parameters in particular m m 0 grew non linearly with l up to 300 000x fig 4a m m 0 initially increased rapidly with d up to 350x fig 4b but then leveled off sharply beyond d 1 cm because of similar trends in q q0 compare fig 2b and 3b as expected m m 0 spiked as k increased towards 6 day 1 fig 4d m m 0 also spiked sharply where h decreased towards 0 0025 and as k decreased towards 10 5 m s fig 4ef there appeared to be an inflection point near k 5 day 1 k 1 33 10 5 m s and h 0 005 where m m 0 started to increase by orders of magnitude with increases in k and decreases in k and h the strong nonlinearity and high values in some parts of fig 4 underscore the profoundness of the impact soil pipes had in some settings for this reason we ran model runs for k h and k for the full range of l and in some cases d fig 5 this effect on m m 0 was greatest where there was low h low matrix k high k and high l d and soil pipe density ρ had less effect another way to highlight the importance of soil pipes and their profound impact on riparian bypass is to quantify non normalized total mass flowrate m and how the addition of a soil pipe can compensate for lower h for example a system with a soil pipe where l 1 m and h 0 025 had the same m as a system with l 2 m roughly three times as small h fig 6 a longer soil pipe was enough to increase m by three times furthermore a riparian zone with no soil pipes had the same m of nitrate as a system with a roughly 32 flatter h with a 1 m 2 cm diameter soil pipe fig 6 3 2 comparison with gravel veins the overall magnitude of the effect on flow across the riparian zone of the gravel veins we simulated q q0 was similar in magnitude to that of the base case soil pipe fig 7 a this may seem counter intuitive given that sediment in the gravel vein would obstruct flow relative to a soil pipe however the cross sectional area of the gravel veins 0 3 m2 and 0 16 m2 even after multiplying by porosity to estimate the effective cross sectional area of pore space 0 075 m2 and 0 04 m2 was still much greater than the cross sectional area of the soil pipes 0 00031 m2 for 2 cm diameter base case in terms of trends q q0 for a system with gravel veins increased with the hydraulic conductivity of the gravel in the vein kvein but at a decreasing rate fig 7a the rate of increase decreased because the overall k of a composite layer composed of two ks matrix k and kvein in series is the harmonic mean of both ks and there is diminishing return for a single k s ability within that harmonic mean to impact the overall matrix k in other words flow into the faster layer is limited by flow out of the slow layer the flowrate through the gravel vein at high values of kvein was therefore exchange limited rather than flow limited we observe the same trend in c c0 increasing at a decreasing rate fig 7b as the flowrate levelled off so did the disparity between c and c0 in terms of nitrate transport gravel veins surpassed the effect of the base case soil pipe for kvein 0 0006 m s and kvein 0 0008 m s 6 and 8 times greater than the surrounding matrix at widths 0 30 m and 0 16 m respectively fig 7c at high values of kvein gravel veins of both widths allowed an order of magnitude more nitrate to bypass the riparian zone than the base case soil pipe nevertheless soil pipes were more effective per unit of cross sectional area as five soil pipes caused about half of the nitrate bypass as the gravel veins at highest values of kvein even though the cross sectional area of the five soil pipes was orders of magnitude less than that of the gravel veins also doubling the gravel vein width caused much less than a doubling in m m 0 since the flowrate through the gravel layer was exchange limited and the length of the gravel layer was greater versus its width the flux across the boundary of the gravel vein and hence the flowrate within the gravel vein was not enhanced much by an increase in width in short increasing the width did not increase relative flux boundary length into the gravel vein by much 4 discussion 4 1 factors controlling riparian bypass by soil pipes soil pipes enhanced the mass flowrate of nitrate m toward the channel by up to i e m m 0 ranged up to several orders of magnitude within the range of parameter values used in our sensitivity analysis fig 3 yet soil pipes only caused volumetric flowrate of water q toward the channel to increase up to i e q q0 ranged up to 3 9 times within the same parameter space fig 2 thus the effect of soil pipes on q q0 only tells part of the story of how pipes impacted nitrate migration through the riparian zone nevertheless the shapes of the relationships between q q0 and m m 0 and l d and ρ were similar compare fig 2abc to 4abc indicating that q q0 is an important control and is correlated to m m 0 by contrast the shapes of the relationships between q q0 and m m 0 and k and h were completely different compare fig 2de to 4ef the q q0 curves were flat for these parameters fig 2de because as k and h increased there was a simultaneous increase in volumetric flowrate through both the soil pipes and soil matrix unlike with l d and ρ where matrix flow did not increase since q q0 did not change with k and h the change in m m 0 must have been caused by factors other than q q0 increase normalized outlet concentration c c0 fig 3 provides insight into these other factors that contributed to increased m m 0 and helps explain the shape of the relationships in fig 4 for example the relationship between m m 0 and l is more strongly exponential than that for q q0 and the strongly exponential relationship between c c0 and l fig 3a can explain that difference in particular the product of q q0 fig 2a and c c0 fig 3a is roughly equal to m m 0 fig 4a similarly the shape of the relationships between m m 0 and both k and h fig 4ef almost exactly mirror those for c c0 fig 3ef furthermore gravel veins exhibited the same relationship between m m 0 and the combination of q q0 and c c0 fig 7 overall then the combination of the effect soil pipes have on both flows q q0 and concentrations c c0 governs the overall effect on m m 0 the reason soil pipes affect c c0 so profoundly relates to residence times water enters the soil pipe from the upslope and exits the soil pipe into the stream channel after a very short sojourn in the soil pipe relative to that which would occur in the matrix and thus with significantly less nitrate attenuation than would occur without soil pipes for example variation of h and k had almost identical effect on average matrix residence time τavg e g a tenfold decrease in either causes the same increase in τavg and consequently had almost identical effect on m m 0 fig 8 ab thus m m 0 increased non linearly with h and k fig 4ef the same way τavg did fig 8ab however τavg does not sufficiently explain all the variation throughout the explored parameter space for any given l value for example τavg was the same for all values of reaction rate constant k fig 8a yet m m 0 grew non linearly with increasing k fig 4d thus to more comprehensively quantify whether or not bank facing soil pipes will have an effect on riparian bypass we calculated the damköhler number da a ratio of characteristic reaction time scale to the characteristic transport time scale da is given by 11 da τ avg k where k is the first order reaction constant harvey et al 2013 in systems with similar q q0 transforming k k and h into da will collapse these curves into one curve fig 8cd also examining the m m 0 vs l curves with combinations of k k and h with roughly the same da shows that the curve remains relatively invariant for different systems with the same da fig 9 in other words a tenfold decrease in k has the same effect on m m 0 as a tenfold decrease in h and a tenfold increase in k i e k and water particle velocity have opposite effects on characteristic time scale thus da is a more efficient comprehensive way of describing the physical phenomenon which governs m m 0 than just focusing on one parameter at a time our results show that for systems where l 1 m and l 2 m riparian bypass m m 0 starts to increase by orders of magnitude i e reaches a threshold where da 7 and da 4 respectively fig 8cd note the slight deviation of the k curve is an artifact of our simplified method for calculating τavg we did not do flow weighted residence time however there are more factors that govern riparian bypass shown by these da thresholds varying with l compare fig 8c and d thus we derived a more comprehensive factor that accounts not only for the ratio of characteristic reaction to transport time scales da but also the increase in flowrate from the bank to the stream channel we introduce the dimensionless riparian bypass potential ψ 12 ψ d a 0 39 q q 0 0 61 where the two exponents were varied over the interval 0 1 to systematically sample their joint parameter space to find the global minimum least squared error i e maximum coefficient of determination r2 between an exponential curve fit and the model output for both l 1 m and l 2 m in the relationship between m m 0 and ψ in fig 8e the success of this process is shown by fig 8e collapsing the six model runs from fig 8a and 8b into one curve showing that ψ accounts for all the factors that govern m m 0 q q0 controlled the behavior of m m 0 more strongly than da indicated by a larger exponent m m 0 starts to increase by orders of magnitude at roughly ψ 2 75 though ψ only applies specifically to the six sensitivity analyses in fig 8 it introduces the concept of a non dimensional parameter which accounts not only for characteristic transport vs reaction time scale ratios da but also soil pipe effects on flowrate and scales both by relative importance with exponents it provides insight into the relative importance of soil pipe effects on flowrate and da and helps break the bypass phenomenon down into its three broad governing categories characteristic reaction and transport time scales and relative changes in hyporheic volume while ψ provides insight into the factors which govern nitrate bypass in riparian zones it would be preferable to estimate riparian bypass based on easily measurable quantities to do so we first note that flow in the soil matrix q0 can be quantified using darcy s law 13 q 0 k a h where a is the cross sectional area of the control volume of interest l2 next we note that flow in the soil pipe q increases with l lotts and hester 2020 and would also decrease with τ avg 14 q l τ avg by combining eqs 13 and 14 and assuming a is a constant and can thus be absorbed into the proportionality we find that that q q0 would increase roughly linearly with the dimensionless ratio l k hτavg we can then substitute this ratio for q q0 in eq 12 and re calculate the exponents which results in the dimensionless riparian prediction index ζ 15 ζ d a 0 392 l k h τ avg 0 45 in eq 15 k can be obtained by a falling head test or estimated based on soil type h can be obtained from observation wells or piezometers τavg would ideally be obtained by tracer tests but could also be estimated by dividing flowpath length by groundwater average linear porewater velocity v as determined from h and η e l is more challenging to measure in the field yet soil pipes are formed by burrowing fauna and roots of flora beven and germann 1982 2013 thus l will be a function of the fauna and flora types as well as soil characteristics which are in turn functions of the geographical location future studies could therefore survey soil pipe lengths in multiple regions and correlate soil pipe length with a geographical area similarly to ψ ζ also collapses the same six data sets onto one curve fig 8f furthermore there is a transition point similar to ψ where m m 0 starts to increase by orders of magnitude at roughly ζ 3 4 fig 8f 4 2 scientific impact and practical application removal of nitrate by the riparian aquifer is championed as one of the primary pollutant removal mechanisms of the riparian zone connolly et al 2015 groffman et al 2002 our study indicates that soil pipes where present can dominate how much nitrate reaches the stream particularly for low h and matrix k therefore our results show that soil pipes can undermine the effectiveness of riparian buffers and thus soil pipes must be accounted for when riparian zones are to be used as a removal mechanism for upslope nitrate our study reinforces the recent field study steiness et al 2021 which concluded that bypass flow from various preferential flow mechanisms accounted for a significant portion of the nitrate loads observed in streams further our results also help address the challenge posed in inamdar 2006 of what level of complexity is justified in modeling groundwater flow in riparian zones we have shown that even large scale hydrologic models need to include enough complexity to account for small scale features such as soil pipes and other preferential flow mechanisms by quantifying the magnitude by which soil pipes and gravel veins can induce riparian bypass we reinforce the findings of allaire et al 2015 that riparian buffers would benefit from plant species with fine roots that reduce formation of soil pipes or filters which require periodic maintenance we have also partially addressed another challenge posed by inamdar 2006 regarding how processes at the riparian scale can be quantified we crafted two non dimensional parameters which quantify the degree to which soil pipes cause riparian bypass we have shown roughly at what riparian bypass potential and riparian bypass predictive index a riparian buffer begins to experience bypass ψ 2 75 and ζ 3 4 respectively the latter may be used more easily as a predictive tool as it composed of parameters that are easier to measure this is a good starting point for a theoretical framework to describe riparian bypass from a mathematical perspective further our results with gravel veins highlight how important preferential flow paths are in general not just soil pipes with respect to riparian bypass 4 3 model limitations and future study riparian buffers are generally wider than 2 m and nitrate sources in groundwater are often farther than 2 m from the channel thus our upslope boundary condition would ideally be farther than 2 m from the channel nevertheless existing field studies show that the vast majority of bank facing soil pipes are less than 2 m length gormally et al 2011 showed them to be up to 2 m in length menichino et al 2015 and hester et al 2020 show that bank facing soil pipes average length to the first bend was roughly 0 5 m with a maximum of 1 2 m length to first bend is likely an underestimate for some soil pipes and our upland boundary condition represents contaminated water ultimately stemming from sewers or agriculture so our simplification is reasonable we also used simplified soil pipe geometries due to the current dearth of information on the spatial layout of riparian soil pipe networks gormally et al 2011 mapped bank facing soil pipes but we are not aware of other studies that spatially mapped bank facing riparian soil pipes it seems likely that the further into the streambank we look the less valid our assumption of a straight perfectly perpendicular soil pipe additionally further research in spatial layouts of soil pipes is necessary to establish typical soil pipe lengths which would make eqn 15 more useful moreover although there were many bank facing soil pipes approximately perpendicular to the channel in gormally et al 2011 and in hester et al 2020 there were also others with different orientations non bank facing soil pipes could also be examined and would be expected to have less of impact on flow and nitrate transport than bank facing soil pipes since there is no outlet for the nitrate in the soil pipes other than the flow restrictive surrounding soil matrix furthermore in addition to varying soil pipe geometry in situ riparian zone soils are often heterogeneous which would be beneficial to simulate for example pryshlak et al 2015 showed that heterogeneity profoundly altered the flow paths of water parcels and darcy fluxes throughout their domain and we would anticipate that heterogeneity would have similar effects in systems with soil pipes nonetheless the homogenous soil assumption helps isolate the effects of and trends caused by soil pipes withal more field data on the spatial layout of soil pipe networks and soil heterogeneities in riparian zones are needed followed by numerical simulations that account for these more realistic and complex riparian conditions there is also room to explore other hydraulic and hydrological conditions such as examining the effects of evapotranspiration and recharge as these may impact the soil pipe s effects on riparian bypass furthermore temporal variations for all boundary conditions could be implemented to replicate diel or seasonal variations to examine possible effects on riparian bypass for example one could implement sinusoidal temporal boundary conditions like schmadel et al 2016 to see if phase lag impacts soil pipes effects on riparian bypass moreover since we only examined a 2d scenario future studies could examine the effects of vertical placement of pipes in 3d particularly for temporally varying scenarios our study used first order reaction kinetics for parsimonious reasons given our relatively low nitrate concentrations this approach adequately establishes a characteristic reaction time scale for the damköhler analysis however monod kinetics are more accurate for biogeochemical reactions like denitrification if reasonable values can be obtained for the additional parameters required while we gained insight into key controls on riparian nitrate bypass future investigations could extend our work by probing the monod kinetics parameter space particularly where accuracy is needed for the full duration of the simulation rather than just a characteristic reaction time scale given these limitations our modeling offers a rough quantification as well as a set of foundational principles upon which future studies can build while the magnitudes of our specific m m 0 results should not be interpreted as applicable to all systems they demonstrate the sheer magnitude of influence of soil pipes on riparian bypass and the highly non linear relationships between m m 0 and k k h and l 5 conclusions we modeled soil pipe impacts to flow and nitrate transport from an upslope pollutant source through a riparian buffer toward a gaining stream using modflow with the cfp package and mt3d usgs we found that soil pipes can increase nitrate transport in this setting by several orders of magnitude in certain circumstances low k low h high k and high l the most sensitive soil pipe parameter was pipe length we also found that the amount of riparian bypass is governed by a combination of effects on volumetric flowrate and residence time captured by the non dimensional parameter we call riparian bypass potential ψ which accounts for the damköhler number the ratio of reaction and transport characteristic timescales and normalized volumetric flowrate we have shown that above certain values of the dimensionless parameter riparian bypass potential ψ 2 75 and riparian predictive index ζ 3 4 an orders of magnitude increase in riparian bypass results further ζ predicts the combination of soil matrix transport parameters and soil pipe parameters which will create significant bypass our results combined with the commonness of riparian soil pipes as shown by prior field studies menichino et al 2015 suggest that riparian soil pipes in a riparian buffer context may benefit from mitigation either by plant species with fine roots or filtration systems credit authorship

2618,streams are vital landscape ecosystems and urbanization and modern agriculture have introduced pollutants including excess nitrate which threaten these waterways riparian zones have been shown to attenuate pollutants and riparian buffers are commonly implemented to capture these benefits nevertheless preferential flowpaths such as soil pipes have potential to bypass such attenuation we used a modflow groundwater model with the conduit flow package cfp along with the groundwater transport code mt3d usgs to simulate flow of water and nitrate through riparian groundwater to a gaining stream we conducted a numerical sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of soil pipe presence and characteristics as wells as soil matrix characteristics on nitrate transport and uptake by denitrification within the saturated zone we found that in systems with 2 0 m long soil pipes low head gradient h less than 0 0035 low hydraulic conductivity k 10 4 75 m s and high reaction constant k 4 day 1 soil pipes increased riparian bypass of nitrate by several orders of magnitude yet soil pipes increased the volumetric flowrate of water across the riparian zone only by up to 3 9 times this comparatively greater effect on transport occurred because the accelerated advection of nitrate through the soil pipes decreased the residence time available for denitrification we created two non dimensional parameters that show when bypass will be important the riparian bypass potential ψ that accounts for key governing factors such as volumetric flowrate and damköhler number and riparian predictive index ζ which is calculated from easily measurable parameters nitrate bypass starts to increase by orders of magnitude above ψ 2 75 and ζ 3 4 our results emphasize the importance of accounting for soil pipes when constructing riparian buffers and predicting their effects on dissolved pollutant transport keywords riparian zone floodplains preferential flow nutrients data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction streams and rivers act as a hotbed for biodiversity and nexus for ecological flourishment baxter et al 2005 colvin et al 2019 moore and palmer 2005 and play a pivotal role in nitrogen cycling peterson et al 2001 surface waters account for roughly 70 of drinking water in the united states dieter et al 2018 therefore it is important to understand phenomenon which transport pathways to these vital components of our ecosystem urbanization modern agriculture and other anthropogenic activities have added increased pollutants including nitrogen excess nitrogen n and specifically nitrate no3 end up in streams due to agriculture and urban development royer et al 2006 and contribute to eutrophication in downstream inland and coastal surface waters around the world boesch et al 2001 dodds 2006 dodds et al 2009 kemp et al 2005 liu et al 2015 sinha et al 2017 struijs et al 2011 thus knowledge of the efficacy and limitations of natural denitrification mechanisms in the landscape is paramount one of the primary natural filtration and denitrification sites is the riparian zone hester and fox 2020 hill 1996 hill 2019 the riparian zone is the strip of land immediately adjacent to the stream banks it typically includes vegetation an organic soil layer unsaturated groundwater vadose zone and the saturated groundwater beneath riparian buffers are a subset of riparian zones that remove pollutants coming from adjacent human dominated uplands dosskey et al 1997 riparian buffers mitigate bank erosion enhancing geomorphic stability they trap sediment bound contaminants at the surface and attenuate reactive contaminants e g nitrates in groundwater from anthropogenic sources such as farms commercial areas and industrial parks fennessy and cronk 1997 mayer and canfield 2018 osborne and kovacic 1993 stutter et al 2019 turunen et al 2019 unfortunately various bypass mechanisms offer ways nitrate and other pollutants can circumvent the riparian zone undermining its filtering capabilities inamdar 2006 o donnell and jones 2006 steiness et al 2021 one bypass mechanism in riparian groundwater is preferential flow a phenomenon where a slender portion of soil or sediment exhibits significantly faster flow than the rest of the surrounding area and accounts for a significant portion of the flow in the entire domain as shown by tracer studies allaire et al 2015 fox et al 2011 heeren et al 2010 extensive long term nitrate sampling in riparian zone piezometers has revealed a small portion of groundwater accounting for a large amount of no3 discharge evident through observations of spatial distribution of contaminant delivery patterns angier and mccarty 2008 angier et al 2001 angier et al 2005 o driscoll and dewalle 2010 smethurst et al 2014 williams et al 2014 spatial distribution of denitrification enzyme activity also indicates that preferential flow is a widespread phenomenon in riparian zones mccarty et al 2007 bypass can occur in both alluvium of elevated hydraulic conductivity as well as enlarged void spaces as an example of the former significant nitrate can bypass riparian zones through gravel veins burt et al 1999 and zones of permeable sands devito et al 2000 as an example of the latter soil pipes are common along banks of lower order streams hester et al 2020 menichino et al 2015 macropores and soil pipes can short circuit hydrologic flow between an agricultural catchment and the stream allowing pesticides and fertilizers to circumvent or bypass the soil matrix and associated processes bernatek jakiel et al 2017 orozco lopez et al 2018 effluent from soil pipes and macropores can contribute more than half the total nitrate load to channels bohlke et al 2007 while the ability of preferential flow paths to undermine riparian buffer functions has been established steiness et al 2021 the effects of soil pipe characteristics on riparian nitrate removal have not been systematically quantified in this study we sought to quantify the relationships between soil pipe and soil matrix characteristics and riparian bypass of a widespread pollutant excess nitrate we used numerical methods to explore the effects of soil pipe length diameter density and the effects of soil matrix hydraulic conductivity first order reaction constant and hydraulic gradient on nitrate riparian bypass we also examined the effects of gravel veins for comparison 2 methods 2 1 hydraulics governing equations and boundary conditions we modeled riparian groundwater hydraulics adjacent to a gaining stream or river using modflow harbaugh 2005 to solve the 2d transient unconfined isotropic saturated groundwater flow boussinesq equation eqn 1 2d was chosen over 3d because prior studies found that hydraulics and contaminant transport in riparian settings remained essentially unaffected by the vertical placement of submerged pipes lotts and hester 2020 lotts and hester 2022 which suggests that the increased complexity parameterization and numerical challenges necessary for a 3d unconfined model particularly with regards to wetting and drying were not justified furthermore in unconfined systems such as riparian zones the flowlines are often assumed to be horizontal and equipotentials vertical freeze and cherry 1979 we ran the model to steady state on a rectangular prismatic domain 5 5 m in the x direction parallel to the stream channel 2 0 m in the y direction perpendicular to the stream channel and 2 0 m in the z direction corresponding to depth gray area in fig 1 1 x h h x y h h y r k s y k h t cartesian spatial coordinates l are denoted by x y and z h is hydraulic head l r is volumetric flux per unit volume of sources and sinks t 1 sy is specific yield dimensionless k is the hydraulic conductivity of riparian soil l t 1 and t is time t the model domain is similar to lotts and hester 2020 with 275 rows and 100 columns of 2 0 cm by 2 0 cm computational cells in the x and y directions respectively lotts and hester 2020 employed the same governing equation and soil pipe configuration as this study and their supplemental showed that a 4 cm grid produces identical results as a 2 cm grid thereby demonstrating that a 2 cm grid is sufficiently small the model also had one layer 2 0 m thick with a spatially varying water table the stream channel was represented with a constant head boundary right hand of gray area fig 1b to represent a steady state channel flow depth of 1 m stream channel in fig 1b the upslope boundary left hand side of gray area in fig 1b was also a constant head boundary which we set to achieve a desired steady state gaining head gradient toward the channel section 2 3 we modeled soil pipe flow in a separate domain using the conduit flow package cfp shoemaker et al 2007 the cfp has generally been used to model large scale karst terrain conduits saller et al 2013 xu et al 2015 however karay and hajnal 2015 demonstrated the efficacy of the cfp package for modeling small scale conduit networks by reproducing laboratory results for a conduit network of 0 8 and 3 2 cm diameter conduits and gallegos et al 2013 showed that the cfp performs better than high matrix k cells in modeling a 2 cm diameter conduit network in laboratory settings furthermore lotts and hester 2020 successfully reproduced trends of a riparian field study menichino and hester 2015 the domain for the current study consisted of one or more 1d soil pipes within the saturated zone divided into nodes which correspond in one to one fashion to cells in the soil matrix domain fig 1a the cfp applies kirchhoff s law 2 ip 1 np q ip q ex q s 0 to all the nodes q in the pipe domain where i p 1 n p q i p is the sum of volumetric flows at node q coming from all pipe segments from neighboring nodes denoted with index ip np is the number of pipes coming into a given node q e x is flow from or to the matrix and q s is storage only applicable to partially filled pipes the laminar hagen poiseuille equation eqn 3 or the turbulent darcy weisbach equation eqn 4 transform kirchhoff s law into a function with respect to head 3 q ip π d ip 4 g h q h neighbor 128 ν δ

other end of the pipe segment and ν is the viscosity l2 t 1 of water at 25 c the length of the pipe segment l the tortuosity dimensionless and the roughness height l are all given by δ l i p τ i p and k c respectively the cfp transitions from laminar to turbulent at reynolds number 4000 and transitions from turbulent back to laminar at reynolds numbers less than 2000 in our modeling the reynolds number at the outlet ranged from 1 to 600 for all scenarios so flow was always laminar and eq 4 was not used the two domains are coupled at each corresponding node with an exchange term eq 5 and thereby the soil pipes act as a head dependent flux boundary condition to riparian soil matrix domain 5 q ex α i j h q h i j where q e x and α i j are the volumetric flowrate l3 t 1 and conductance l2 t 1 between the soil pipe and riparian soil at modflow respectively and h i j is the hydraulic head l in cell i j shoemaker et al 2007 we set α to 6 28 10 6 m2 s to be consistent with k of the surrounding soil matrix using eqn 38 of shoemaker et al 2007 and then varied α with k in our sensitivity analysis sections 2 3 we chose to have all soil pipes connect to the stream bank which we call bank facing soil pipes this decision reflects their documented commonness along streams hester et al 2020 menichino et al 2015 and their heightened potential to affect the stream channel given their direct connection 2 2 nitrate transport governing equations and boundary conditions we solved the advection dispersion reaction equation in saturated groundwater using a first order reaction term in mt3d usgs bedekar et al 2016 to obtain dissolved nitrate concentration at each node in the modeling domain gray area in fig 1 6 c t x i d ij c x j x i v i c k c where c is the nitrate concentration at a given node i j ml 3 t is time t x i is the cartesian spatial coordinate l d ij is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2 t 1 vj is the seepage or linear pore water velocity l t 1 k is a first order reaction rate constant t 1 we are justified in using first order kinetics since we are only interested in the ideal scenario for denitrification i e the subset of riparian soils where redox conditions favor denitrification where there is effectively infinite labile dissolved carbon plenty of nitrate and anoxic conditions riparian zones commonly exhibit anoxic conditions briggs et al 2013 cooper 1990 galloway et al 2004 hill 2019 mcdowell et al 1992 and riparian and hyporheic zone soil waters are rich with dissolved organic carbon fiebig et al 1990 first order kinetics in many cases have reliably reproduced nitrate field data in the riparian zone boyer et al 2006 gilles et al 2009 pittroff et al 2017 rahimi et al 2015 sheibley et al 2003 zarnetske et al 2015 furthermore first order kinetics closely resemble monod kinetics when nitrate concentrations are below the half reaction constant of a typical riparian soil 1 64 mg l hester et al 2018 hester et al 2016 zarnetske et al 2012 which they are for our study given we set the upslope concentration to 1 0 mg l thus first order kinetics are a parsimonious way to simulate denitrification and probe our research objectives in a way applicable to a large subset of riparian zones we set the upslope boundary left hand side of the gray area in fig 1 as specified concentration of 1 0 mg l which represented nitrate coming from a source such as farmland or a leaky sewer pipe while these sources would often be further than two m from the channel our choice of 2 meter domain reflects current knowledge where very few studies map riparian soil pipes one of the best extant studies gormally et al 2011 shows many soil pipes approximately perpendicular to the stream roughly 2 or less m in length similarly menichino et al 2015 and hester et al 2020 show a maximum soil pipe length of 1 2 m the latter length data were only to the first bend in the soil pipe as measured from the bank face and thus are underestimates in some cases but are among the only systematic data available we discuss the implications of these spatial layout assumptions in section 4 3 mt3d usgs cannot directly simulate transport within conduits where flow is simulated by the cfp since flow in our simulated riparian soil matrix converged on the soil pipes except in cases with more than one soil pipe where there were transverse head gradients we simulated contaminant transport in the soil pipes with a one way coupled model in python 3 where we applied mass conservation to each node in the pipe domain eqn 7 since denitrification occurs via the biofilm attached to sediment surfaces and there is negligible sediment surface area in the pipes relative to that in the matrix as a first approximation we assumed no nitrate reaction in the soil pipes 7 q out c out q q inflow c inflow q q ex c i j q where q o u t and q i n f l o w are the flow out of and into respectively pipe node q l3t 1 and c o u t and c i n f l o w are the concentrations of nitrate flowing out of and into from the adjacent upslope pipe node node q respectively ml 3 q e x is the exchange term from eq 5 and c i j is the concentration of the corresponding riparian soil matrix node ml 3 using python 3 we extracted values from the cfp output files to populate q o u t q i n f l o w and q e x for all nodes q in the pipe domain and concentration values from mt3d usgs to populate c i j we calculated the mass balance across the bank face along the domain of interest i e total mass flowing into the stream channel as 8 m total m pipe m soil where m t o t a l is the total nitrate mass flowrate across the bank face mt 1 and m p i p e is the nitrate mass flowrate of the soil pipe s emptying into the stream channel mt 1 obtained from the q out c out q value for the most downslope rightmost node node in the pipe domain eq 7 we obtained m s o i l mt 1 by integrating the nitrate flux over the boundary between the riparian soil and stream channel 9 m soil 0 m 1 m c x q x j d x where we have defined x 0 m and x 1 m as the up and downstream ends of the domain of interest fig 1b respectively c x is the concentration along the bank face which varies with x ml 3 h x is the hydraulic head at the boundary which varies with x l q x is the specific discharge at a given point along the bank face lt 1 q x has components in x and y direction and j is the unit vector in the y direction dimensionless 2 3 parameter selection and sensitivity analysis we define riparian bypass as the ratio of the mass flowrate of nitrate flowing from the domain of interest fig 1 to the stream channel relative to the equivalent mass flowrate with soil pipes this shows the extent to which soil pipes intensify mass transport from the upslope pollutant source to the stream we refer to this ratio as the normalized mass flowrate m m 0 dimensionless it is calculated as 10 m m 0 m total ρ 0 m 1 m total ρ 0 m 1 where ρ 0 m 1 is a soil pipe density of zero soil pipes per m and ρ 0 is a soil pipe per m density other than zero 1 2 3 4 or 5 we explored how a variety of both soil pipe and soil matrix parameters table 1 impact m m 0 we examined the effect of three different soil pipe parameters including soil pipe density soil pipes per m ρ l 1 soil pipe length l l and soil pipe diameter d l we based the range of values of these parameters roughly on those for bank facing soil pipes in hester et al 2020 and menichino et al 2015 the base case was ρ 1 m 1 since that value facilitated isolation of the effects of other parameters we varied l from 0 m to 2 m based on the bank facing soil pipes mapped with ground penetrating radar gpr in gormally et al 2011 and we set the base case to the midpoint of that interval 1 m the diameter range varied from 0 to 5 cm hester et al 2020 menichino et al 2015 although there are larger soil pipes the effects asymptote sharply after d 1 cm as the system becomes exchange limited section 3 and the vast majority of the soil pipes in prior studies have diameters below 5 cm hester et al 2020 the base case was set to d 2 cm we examined the effect of three soil matrix parameters matrix k l t nitrate first order reaction decay rate in the soil matrix k t 1 and head gradient perpendicular to the channel and parallel to the soil pipe h ll 1 fig 1 we varied h from 0 0025 to h 0 025 which are common in stream and river banks lacombe and rosman 1997 usgs 2005 and allows m m 0 to span from very small m m 0 1 to large m m 0 3 105 we varied matrix k from 10 5 m s to k 10 4 m s which corresponds to fine sand silty sand or silt which are common in riparian sediments anderson et al 2015 heath 1983 lotts and hester 2020 and allows m m 0 to span roughly the same range 1 3 105 as the selected h interval likewise we varied k through a subset of the interval examined in hester et al 2016 from k 0 6 day 1 to k 6 day 1 which also spans a similar range of m m 0 as with h and k the base case parameters were h 0 0025 k 10 4 m s k 0 6 day 1 since they were common in situ anderson et al 2015 hester et al 2016 lacombe and rosman 1997 usgs 2005 since the relationships of m m 0 versus l were often strongly exponential section 3 we chose to conduct sensitivity analyses for each value of l throughout the entire parameter ranges of the soil matrix and reaction parameters h matrix k k table 1 thus we explored the controlling parameter space beyond a simple one at a time approach by contrast we only conducted m m 0 versus d sensitivity analysis for variation in h similarly we only conducted one sensitivity analysis for ρ for the base case of k k h and d we did not perform this at the base case for h 0 025 since we would need two way coupling not just a one way coupling to model the water and nitrate going back into the matrix due to transverse head gradients the one way coupling incorrectly models water driven into the matrix by the transverse head gradient as having no nitrate for h 0 025 much solute would be ejected back into the matrix and ultimately end up in the stream and modeling it without nitrate drastically underestimates m m 0 this assumption does not matter for h 0 0025 since negligible nitrate even makes it to the pipes and practically none of the nitrate which is ejected back into the matrix makes it to the stream in addition to soil pipes preferential flow in alluvium can also occur through areas of higher permeability sediment fox et al 2011 fuchs et al 2009 the actual hydraulic conductivity of the sediment in such preferential flowpaths can vary considerably but for convenience we refer to all such preferential flowpaths as gravel veins while the focus of our study is soil pipes we conducted a small number of model runs on gravel veins for comparison in particular we compared m m 0 for a system with a single 1 0 m long soil pipe to that with a single 1 0 m long gravel vein m m 0 for gravel veins is mass flow of nitrate in a system with a gravel vein divided by the mass flow of nitrate in a system without a gravel vein we examined two gravel vein widths 0 16 m and 0 3 m wide the widths are arbitrary but make sense within the 1 0 m wide domain of interest fig 1 since 0 16 m 8 cells wide is a very narrow gravel vein and anything much 0 3 m takes up a sizeable portion of the domain since the height of the water table i e model saturated thickness is 1 0 m at the bank face the cross sectional areas of the gravel veins are 0 16 m2 and 0 3 m2 we varied the hydraulic conductivity in the gravel vein kvein ms 1 from 10 3 5 m s to 10 2 m s kvein 10 3 5 10 3 25 10 3 10 2 5 10 2 25 and 10 2 m s commensurate with the k range found in gravel alluvium alongside streams chen 2004 cheong et al 2008 fox et al 2011 miller et al 2014 2 4 particle tracking and residence time calculation to determine residence times τ t of riparian groundwater flowpaths within the matrix we used the particle tracking package modpath7 pollock 2016 for each simulation we released 8 particles in each cell of the upslope boundary left hand side of the gray area in the domain of interest and we extended the particle release past the domain of interest in both directions so that we calculated residence time for each particle crossing the bank face on the stream channel boundary of the domain of interest right side of gray area in fig 1 we then calculated the average τ across all released particles τavg for simplicity we did not account for residence time in the soil pipes this approximation is reasonable because the primary removal mechanism is the biofilm attached to the sediment surfaces in the matrix and the sediment surface area to water volume ratio is much greater in the matrix than the soil pipes furthermore the residence time in the soil pipes are orders of magnitude shorter than the matrix e g o 103 for the base case the specific discharge in modflow must be divided by effective porosity to account the fact that water only flows through the sediment void spaces and not through the whole cross section and some of it will adhere to the porous media surface therefore not using the entire void space thus modpath calculates the velocity of the particle as follows v k h η e where η e is effective porosity for all particle tracking purposes we used η e of 0 25 commensurate with sand gravel and silt gelhar et al 1992 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analyses of soil pipe and matrix physicochemical parameters our results show that soil pipes increased flow towards the streambank by up to 3 9 times within the range of parameter values in our sensitivity analysis fig 2 the magnitude of that increase varied depending upon the number and dimensions of the soil pipes for example as soil pipe length l increased the normalized flowrate of water toward the streambank q q0 increased non linearly up to 3 9 times that without soil pipes fig 2a this non linear behavior is due to a non linear increase in the length of the isopotentials along which an integral of the normal fluxes determines the flux into the pipe fig 6 of lotts and hester 2020 by contrast as soil pipe diameter d increased q q0 quickly increased to 1 5 and then leveled off sharply because the maximum potential pipe flow is greater than the maximum potential exchange rate between the matrix and pipe i e flow in the pipe shifts from pipe limited to exchange limited fig 2b and lotts and hester 2020 q q0 increased at a decreasing rate with soil pipe density ρ since less flow can occur through the middle pipes with each pipe added for ρ 3 fig 2c neither hydraulic head gradient toward the channel h nor matrix hydraulic conductivity k had any effect on q q0 fig 2de since an increase in h or k increased the matrix to pipe flow by the same factor they increased flow from the matrix directly to the streambank we define normalized concentration c c0 as the concentration where the soil pipe flows into the stream channel divided by the concentration at the same location in the matrix without soil pipes our results for c c0 were very similar to q q0 there was a non linear increase in c c0 versus l fig 3 a a steep initial increase in c c0 vs d with a sharp leveling off for d s greater than 1 cm fig 3b and a linear increase with ρ fig 3c however unlike for q q0 c c0 varied with both k and h in particular an asymptotic decrease fig 3ef for low values of k and h the existence of the soil pipe made a profound difference in concentration reaching the stream since nitrate moved very slowly in the matrix under these conditions and can move much more quickly in the soil pipe hence leading to a larger disparity between c and c0 we also observed a non linear increase in c c0 with respect to k fig 3d where at high values of k proportionally more removal occurs in the surrounding matrix which drives up relative concentrations in the pipe our results show that soil pipes also significantly increased the mass flowrate of nitrate towards the streambank fig 4 in a very similar way to c c0 we refer to this increase as riparian bypass which is quantified as the normalized mass flowrate i e mass flowrate of nitrate with soil pipes divided by mass flowrate without soil pipes m m 0 the degree of increase i e magnitude of m m 0 was highly variable depending on values of controlling parameters yet the overall magnitude of increase was much greater than the increase in q q0 ranging up to hundreds or thousands of times for most parameters in particular m m 0 grew non linearly with l up to 300 000x fig 4a m m 0 initially increased rapidly with d up to 350x fig 4b but then leveled off sharply beyond d 1 cm because of similar trends in q q0 compare fig 2b and 3b as expected m m 0 spiked as k increased towards 6 day 1 fig 4d m m 0 also spiked sharply where h decreased towards 0 0025 and as k decreased towards 10 5 m s fig 4ef there appeared to be an inflection point near k 5 day 1 k 1 33 10 5 m s and h 0 005 where m m 0 started to increase by orders of magnitude with increases in k and decreases in k and h the strong nonlinearity and high values in some parts of fig 4 underscore the profoundness of the impact soil pipes had in some settings for this reason we ran model runs for k h and k for the full range of l and in some cases d fig 5 this effect on m m 0 was greatest where there was low h low matrix k high k and high l d and soil pipe density ρ had less effect another way to highlight the importance of soil pipes and their profound impact on riparian bypass is to quantify non normalized total mass flowrate m and how the addition of a soil pipe can compensate for lower h for example a system with a soil pipe where l 1 m and h 0 025 had the same m as a system with l 2 m roughly three times as small h fig 6 a longer soil pipe was enough to increase m by three times furthermore a riparian zone with no soil pipes had the same m of nitrate as a system with a roughly 32 flatter h with a 1 m 2 cm diameter soil pipe fig 6 3 2 comparison with gravel veins the overall magnitude of the effect on flow across the riparian zone of the gravel veins we simulated q q0 was similar in magnitude to that of the base case soil pipe fig 7 a this may seem counter intuitive given that sediment in the gravel vein would obstruct flow relative to a soil pipe however the cross sectional area of the gravel veins 0 3 m2 and 0 16 m2 even after multiplying by porosity to estimate the effective cross sectional area of pore space 0 075 m2 and 0 04 m2 was still much greater than the cross sectional area of the soil pipes 0 00031 m2 for 2 cm diameter base case in terms of trends q q0 for a system with gravel veins increased with the hydraulic conductivity of the gravel in the vein kvein but at a decreasing rate fig 7a the rate of increase decreased because the overall k of a composite layer composed of two ks matrix k and kvein in series is the harmonic mean of both ks and there is diminishing return for a single k s ability within that harmonic mean to impact the overall matrix k in other words flow into the faster layer is limited by flow out of the slow layer the flowrate through the gravel vein at high values of kvein was therefore exchange limited rather than flow limited we observe the same trend in c c0 increasing at a decreasing rate fig 7b as the flowrate levelled off so did the disparity between c and c0 in terms of nitrate transport gravel veins surpassed the effect of the base case soil pipe for kvein 0 0006 m s and kvein 0 0008 m s 6 and 8 times greater than the surrounding matrix at widths 0 30 m and 0 16 m respectively fig 7c at high values of kvein gravel veins of both widths allowed an order of magnitude more nitrate to bypass the riparian zone than the base case soil pipe nevertheless soil pipes were more effective per unit of cross sectional area as five soil pipes caused about half of the nitrate bypass as the gravel veins at highest values of kvein even though the cross sectional area of the five soil pipes was orders of magnitude less than that of the gravel veins also doubling the gravel vein width caused much less than a doubling in m m 0 since the flowrate through the gravel layer was exchange limited and the length of the gravel layer was greater versus its width the flux across the boundary of the gravel vein and hence the flowrate within the gravel vein was not enhanced much by an increase in width in short increasing the width did not increase relative flux boundary length into the gravel vein by much 4 discussion 4 1 factors controlling riparian bypass by soil pipes soil pipes enhanced the mass flowrate of nitrate m toward the channel by up to i e m m 0 ranged up to several orders of magnitude within the range of parameter values used in our sensitivity analysis fig 3 yet soil pipes only caused volumetric flowrate of water q toward the channel to increase up to i e q q0 ranged up to 3 9 times within the same parameter space fig 2 thus the effect of soil pipes on q q0 only tells part of the story of how pipes impacted nitrate migration through the riparian zone nevertheless the shapes of the relationships between q q0 and m m 0 and l d and ρ were similar compare fig 2abc to 4abc indicating that q q0 is an important control and is correlated to m m 0 by contrast the shapes of the relationships between q q0 and m m 0 and k and h were completely different compare fig 2de to 4ef the q q0 curves were flat for these parameters fig 2de because as k and h increased there was a simultaneous increase in volumetric flowrate through both the soil pipes and soil matrix unlike with l d and ρ where matrix flow did not increase since q q0 did not change with k and h the change in m m 0 must have been caused by factors other than q q0 increase normalized outlet concentration c c0 fig 3 provides insight into these other factors that contributed to increased m m 0 and helps explain the shape of the relationships in fig 4 for example the relationship between m m 0 and l is more strongly exponential than that for q q0 and the strongly exponential relationship between c c0 and l fig 3a can explain that difference in particular the product of q q0 fig 2a and c c0 fig 3a is roughly equal to m m 0 fig 4a similarly the shape of the relationships between m m 0 and both k and h fig 4ef almost exactly mirror those for c c0 fig 3ef furthermore gravel veins exhibited the same relationship between m m 0 and the combination of q q0 and c c0 fig 7 overall then the combination of the effect soil pipes have on both flows q q0 and concentrations c c0 governs the overall effect on m m 0 the reason soil pipes affect c c0 so profoundly relates to residence times water enters the soil pipe from the upslope and exits the soil pipe into the stream channel after a very short sojourn in the soil pipe relative to that which would occur in the matrix and thus with significantly less nitrate attenuation than would occur without soil pipes for example variation of h and k had almost identical effect on average matrix residence time τavg e g a tenfold decrease in either causes the same increase in τavg and consequently had almost identical effect on m m 0 fig 8 ab thus m m 0 increased non linearly with h and k fig 4ef the same way τavg did fig 8ab however τavg does not sufficiently explain all the variation throughout the explored parameter space for any given l value for example τavg was the same for all values of reaction rate constant k fig 8a yet m m 0 grew non linearly with increasing k fig 4d thus to more comprehensively quantify whether or not bank facing soil pipes will have an effect on riparian bypass we calculated the damköhler number da a ratio of characteristic reaction time scale to the characteristic transport time scale da is given by 11 da τ avg k where k is the first order reaction constant harvey et al 2013 in systems with similar q q0 transforming k k and h into da will collapse these curves into one curve fig 8cd also examining the m m 0 vs l curves with combinations of k k and h with roughly the same da shows that the curve remains relatively invariant for different systems with the same da fig 9 in other words a tenfold decrease in k has the same effect on m m 0 as a tenfold decrease in h and a tenfold increase in k i e k and water particle velocity have opposite effects on characteristic time scale thus da is a more efficient comprehensive way of describing the physical phenomenon which governs m m 0 than just focusing on one parameter at a time our results show that for systems where l 1 m and l 2 m riparian bypass m m 0 starts to increase by orders of magnitude i e reaches a threshold where da 7 and da 4 respectively fig 8cd note the slight deviation of the k curve is an artifact of our simplified method for calculating τavg we did not do flow weighted residence time however there are more factors that govern riparian bypass shown by these da thresholds varying with l compare fig 8c and d thus we derived a more comprehensive factor that accounts not only for the ratio of characteristic reaction to transport time scales da but also the increase in flowrate from the bank to the stream channel we introduce the dimensionless riparian bypass potential ψ 12 ψ d a 0 39 q q 0 0 61 where the two exponents were varied over the interval 0 1 to systematically sample their joint parameter space to find the global minimum least squared error i e maximum coefficient of determination r2 between an exponential curve fit and the model output for both l 1 m and l 2 m in the relationship between m m 0 and ψ in fig 8e the success of this process is shown by fig 8e collapsing the six model runs from fig 8a and 8b into one curve showing that ψ accounts for all the factors that govern m m 0 q q0 controlled the behavior of m m 0 more strongly than da indicated by a larger exponent m m 0 starts to increase by orders of magnitude at roughly ψ 2 75 though ψ only applies specifically to the six sensitivity analyses in fig 8 it introduces the concept of a non dimensional parameter which accounts not only for characteristic transport vs reaction time scale ratios da but also soil pipe effects on flowrate and scales both by relative importance with exponents it provides insight into the relative importance of soil pipe effects on flowrate and da and helps break the bypass phenomenon down into its three broad governing categories characteristic reaction and transport time scales and relative changes in hyporheic volume while ψ provides insight into the factors which govern nitrate bypass in riparian zones it would be preferable to estimate riparian bypass based on easily measurable quantities to do so we first note that flow in the soil matrix q0 can be quantified using darcy s law 13 q 0 k a h where a is the cross sectional area of the control volume of interest l2 next we note that flow in the soil pipe q increases with l lotts and hester 2020 and would also decrease with τ avg 14 q l τ avg by combining eqs 13 and 14 and assuming a is a constant and can thus be absorbed into the proportionality we find that that q q0 would increase roughly linearly with the dimensionless ratio l k hτavg we can then substitute this ratio for q q0 in eq 12 and re calculate the exponents which results in the dimensionless riparian prediction index ζ 15 ζ d a 0 392 l k h τ avg 0 45 in eq 15 k can be obtained by a falling head test or estimated based on soil type h can be obtained from observation wells or piezometers τavg would ideally be obtained by tracer tests but could also be estimated by dividing flowpath length by groundwater average linear porewater velocity v as determined from h and η e l is more challenging to measure in the field yet soil pipes are formed by burrowing fauna and roots of flora beven and germann 1982 2013 thus l will be a function of the fauna and flora types as well as soil characteristics which are in turn functions of the geographical location future studies could therefore survey soil pipe lengths in multiple regions and correlate soil pipe length with a geographical area similarly to ψ ζ also collapses the same six data sets onto one curve fig 8f furthermore there is a transition point similar to ψ where m m 0 starts to increase by orders of magnitude at roughly ζ 3 4 fig 8f 4 2 scientific impact and practical application removal of nitrate by the riparian aquifer is championed as one of the primary pollutant removal mechanisms of the riparian zone connolly et al 2015 groffman et al 2002 our study indicates that soil pipes where present can dominate how much nitrate reaches the stream particularly for low h and matrix k therefore our results show that soil pipes can undermine the effectiveness of riparian buffers and thus soil pipes must be accounted for when riparian zones are to be used as a removal mechanism for upslope nitrate our study reinforces the recent field study steiness et al 2021 which concluded that bypass flow from various preferential flow mechanisms accounted for a significant portion of the nitrate loads observed in streams further our results also help address the challenge posed in inamdar 2006 of what level of complexity is justified in modeling groundwater flow in riparian zones we have shown that even large scale hydrologic models need to include enough complexity to account for small scale features such as soil pipes and other preferential flow mechanisms by quantifying the magnitude by which soil pipes and gravel veins can induce riparian bypass we reinforce the findings of allaire et al 2015 that riparian buffers would benefit from plant species with fine roots that reduce formation of soil pipes or filters which require periodic maintenance we have also partially addressed another challenge posed by inamdar 2006 regarding how processes at the riparian scale can be quantified we crafted two non dimensional parameters which quantify the degree to which soil pipes cause riparian bypass we have shown roughly at what riparian bypass potential and riparian bypass predictive index a riparian buffer begins to experience bypass ψ 2 75 and ζ 3 4 respectively the latter may be used more easily as a predictive tool as it composed of parameters that are easier to measure this is a good starting point for a theoretical framework to describe riparian bypass from a mathematical perspective further our results with gravel veins highlight how important preferential flow paths are in general not just soil pipes with respect to riparian bypass 4 3 model limitations and future study riparian buffers are generally wider than 2 m and nitrate sources in groundwater are often farther than 2 m from the channel thus our upslope boundary condition would ideally be farther than 2 m from the channel nevertheless existing field studies show that the vast majority of bank facing soil pipes are less than 2 m length gormally et al 2011 showed them to be up to 2 m in length menichino et al 2015 and hester et al 2020 show that bank facing soil pipes average length to the first bend was roughly 0 5 m with a maximum of 1 2 m length to first bend is likely an underestimate for some soil pipes and our upland boundary condition represents contaminated water ultimately stemming from sewers or agriculture so our simplification is reasonable we also used simplified soil pipe geometries due to the current dearth of information on the spatial layout of riparian soil pipe networks gormally et al 2011 mapped bank facing soil pipes but we are not aware of other studies that spatially mapped bank facing riparian soil pipes it seems likely that the further into the streambank we look the less valid our assumption of a straight perfectly perpendicular soil pipe additionally further research in spatial layouts of soil pipes is necessary to establish typical soil pipe lengths which would make eqn 15 more useful moreover although there were many bank facing soil pipes approximately perpendicular to the channel in gormally et al 2011 and in hester et al 2020 there were also others with different orientations non bank facing soil pipes could also be examined and would be expected to have less of impact on flow and nitrate transport than bank facing soil pipes since there is no outlet for the nitrate in the soil pipes other than the flow restrictive surrounding soil matrix furthermore in addition to varying soil pipe geometry in situ riparian zone soils are often heterogeneous which would be beneficial to simulate for example pryshlak et al 2015 showed that heterogeneity profoundly altered the flow paths of water parcels and darcy fluxes throughout their domain and we would anticipate that heterogeneity would have similar effects in systems with soil pipes nonetheless the homogenous soil assumption helps isolate the effects of and trends caused by soil pipes withal more field data on the spatial layout of soil pipe networks and soil heterogeneities in riparian zones are needed followed by numerical simulations that account for these more realistic and complex riparian conditions there is also room to explore other hydraulic and hydrological conditions such as examining the effects of evapotranspiration and recharge as these may impact the soil pipe s effects on riparian bypass furthermore temporal variations for all boundary conditions could be implemented to replicate diel or seasonal variations to examine possible effects on riparian bypass for example one could implement sinusoidal temporal boundary conditions like schmadel et al 2016 to see if phase lag impacts soil pipes effects on riparian bypass moreover since we only examined a 2d scenario future studies could examine the effects of vertical placement of pipes in 3d particularly for temporally varying scenarios our study used first order reaction kinetics for parsimonious reasons given our relatively low nitrate concentrations this approach adequately establishes a characteristic reaction time scale for the damköhler analysis however monod kinetics are more accurate for biogeochemical reactions like denitrification if reasonable values can be obtained for the additional parameters required while we gained insight into key controls on riparian nitrate bypass future investigations could extend our work by probing the monod kinetics parameter space particularly where accuracy is needed for the full duration of the simulation rather than just a characteristic reaction time scale given these limitations our modeling offers a rough quantification as well as a set of foundational principles upon which future studies can build while the magnitudes of our specific m m 0 results should not be interpreted as applicable to all systems they demonstrate the sheer magnitude of influence of soil pipes on riparian bypass and the highly non linear relationships between m m 0 and k k h and l 5 conclusions we modeled soil pipe impacts to flow and nitrate transport from an upslope pollutant source through a riparian buffer toward a gaining stream using modflow with the cfp package and mt3d usgs we found that soil pipes can increase nitrate transport in this setting by several orders of magnitude in certain circumstances low k low h high k and high l the most sensitive soil pipe parameter was pipe length we also found that the amount of riparian bypass is governed by a combination of effects on volumetric flowrate and residence time captured by the non dimensional parameter we call riparian bypass potential ψ which accounts for the damköhler number the ratio of reaction and transport characteristic timescales and normalized volumetric flowrate we have shown that above certain values of the dimensionless parameter riparian bypass potential ψ 2 75 and riparian predictive index ζ 3 4 an orders of magnitude increase in riparian bypass results further ζ predicts the combination of soil matrix transport parameters and soil pipe parameters which will create significant bypass our results combined with the commonness of riparian soil pipes as shown by prior field studies menichino et al 2015 suggest that riparian soil pipes in a riparian buffer context may benefit from mitigation either by plant species with fine roots or filtration systems credit authorship

2619,natural aquifers can contain multiscale medium heterogeneity whose joint impact on solute transport however remains obscure to fill this knowledge gap this study selected an alluvial aquifer as the representative medium where the spatial distribution of multiple hydrofacies with a typically nonuniform hydraulic conductivity k within each facies could represent both regional scale large scale and subhydrofacies scale local scale heterogeneities to obtain first hand data a field tracer test was conducted in an alluvial aquifer located at the tongzhou site in beijing china where the breakthrough curves btcs obtained at various aquifer depths indicated a significant influence of both regional and subhydrofacies scale heterogeneities on solute transport further numerical analysis revealed that the impact of regional scale heterogeneity on solute transport increased with increasing discrepancy in k between adjacent hydrofacies in comparison subhydrofacies scale heterogeneity embedded within each hydrofacies played an important role in controlling solute transport when the mean ks value of adjacent hydrofacies became more similar bimodal transport at early stages was mainly impacted by multiscale preferential flow paths while solute retention at later times was induced by immobile zones dominating late time transport anomalous transport induced by multiscale heterogeneity could be captured by the dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm while the dual advection dispersion equation dade or fractal mobile immobile fmim model could only provide reasonable predictions at the early or later stage respectively this study sheds light on the control mechanism of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport keywords solute transport multiscale heterogeneity alluvial aquifer stochastic model data availability i have shared the link to my data in data availability statement section of the manuscript the code used to generate the heterogeneous field can be found in emery and lantuejoul 2006 the open source scripting environment in matlab mflab was used to setup run and analyze groundwater flow and transport models which is available on https code google com p mflab the observed btcs shown in fig 4 and fig 5 simulated data in the figures and input file for the numerical model can be obtained from https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7188052 1 introduction a comprehensive understanding of the rate and pathways of contaminant migration in aquifers is essential for sustainable groundwater use andrews and hennet 2022 however the prediction of solute transport in natural aquifer systems remains a major challenge due to anomalous or non fickian transport caused by medium heterogeneity jeopardizing the prevention and control of groundwater contaminants berkowitz et al 2006 de barros et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 ma et al 2010 ma et al 2014 the heterogeneous distribution of aquifer hydrological properties mainly the hydraulic conductivity k normally occurs at multiple scales in response to dynamic sedimentary processes pryshlak et al 2015 soltanian et al 2020 soltanian and ritzi 2014 ritzi and soltanian 2015 correspondingly anomalous transport behavior patterns such as superdiffusion subdiffusion or transport with multiple peaks have been experimentally observed at various scales ranging from the pore scale zhang and lv 2007 de anna et al 2013 puyguiraud et al 2019 to the laboratory scale huang et al 1995 bromly and hinz 2004 zaheer et al 2017 sherman et al 2018 and further to the regional scale zheng et al 2011 guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 goeppert et al 2020 hence heterogeneity at multiple scales could simultaneously impact solute transport and result in a much more complex transport process than that in a medium with single scale heterogeneity wu et al 2004 zhang and gable 2008 soltanian et al 2015c zhang and zhang 2015 for instance lagrangian based transport model was used to reveal the impact of hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture on solute transport in alluvial aquifer soltanian et al 2015a 2015b dai et al 2020 simulated results shown that due to the impact of multiscale heterogeneity the longitudinal dispersivity of the plume cannot reach its asymptotic value even after 10 000 years of travel time soltanian et al 2017 regarding porous media at field sites alluvial settings are often characterized by interbedded litho or hydrofacies due to periodic variations in sedimentary deposition davis et al 1997 allen king et al 1998 fogg and zhang 2016 zhang et al 2013 great discrepancies in k may exist among different hydrofacies a typical k value for fine sediments such as clay and silt ranges from 10 11 10 5 cm s while this value for coarse sediments including coarse sand and gravel ranges from 10 7 10 2 cm s domenico and schwartz 1990 fogg and zhang 2016 due to different sedimentary environments the mean length of the spatial continuity of hydrofacies may range from 30 1000 m along the depositional dip direction and 1 20 m along the vertical direction bianchi and zheng 2016 zhang et al 2013 guo et al 2019 2020 wallace et al 2021 spatially continuous coarse grained hydrofacies may constitute regional preferential flow paths and significantly impact solute transport in regional fluvial aquifers bianchi and zheng 2016 yin et al 2020b additionally preferential flow paths may exist at the pore to darcy scales in poorly sorted or nonuniformly consolidated sediments the impact of subhydrofacies scale preferential flow paths on solute transport has been experimentally or numerically investigated zheng et al 2011 liu et al 2004 it should be noted that inherent associations between preferential flow paths may exist at different scales for instance regional scale preferential flow paths may be generated via the accumulation of small scale preferential paths or constructed via interconnected small scale preferential paths to reveal the impact of multiscale heterogeneity of alluvial aquifers on solute transport zhang et al 2013 conducted systematic monte carlo simulations of contaminant transport in regional scale alluvial settings and found that the subhydrofacies scale i e local scale heterogeneity did not significantly affect the overall transport dynamics this conclusion is consistent with that drawn by frei et al 2009 and sun et al 2008 these studies assumed a log normal or truncated pareto distribution for the increment in natural log k for each facies where the change in k within facies was much smaller than that between facies however limited by the resolution of model domain discretization grids with a 2 to 50 m length and 0 5 m height in the abovementioned models may not be fine enough to reflect the real world subhydrofacies scale heterogeneity more recently numerical flow and solute transport models with significantly refined resolutions were established by hakoun et al 2019 and comolli et al 2019 to investigate anomalous transport in porous media in which k was described by log normal distributions their results indicated that the spatial correlation of the particle velocity induced by preferential flow paths significant impacts solute transport confirming the importance of a suitable description of subhydrofacies scale heterogeneity when modeling solute transport in alluvial aquifers due to the different sedimentary structure the mean length volume proportion and mean k of hydrofacies as well as the sub hydrofacies heterogeneity degrees may vary from site to site causing the understanding obtained from one specific site to be difficult transferrable to other sites correspondingly yin et al 2020a investigated the impacts of hydrofacies mean lengths and volumetric proportion of hydrofacies with high hydraulic conductivity on the spatial pattern of super diffusion for alluvial aquifer systems most recently ren et al 2022 conducted numerical simulations to explore the controlling mechanisms of multiscale heterogeneity on the effected dispersion and dilution of plumes at borden site their results indicated that meter scale heterogeneity plays a major role in controlling solute transport processes and the effective dispersion is more sensitive to the spatial organization of sedimentary facies type these studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the impact of sedimentary architecture on transport processes however they did not address how different scale of aquifer heterogeneity i e regional and hydrofacies scale and the k differences between hydrofacies affect the spatial solute plume and mass evolution as well as non fickian transport behavior during different transport period to fill this knowledge gap we focused on the mechanism and model characterization of competitive control of multiple heterogeneities on solute transport in alluvial aquifers fig 1 it should be noted that hierarchical or layered structures are common in various terrestrial sedimentary environments such as mountain stream glacial sand dune and river fluvial environments with various bedding planes or cross bedding structures such as a fining upward juxtaposition tendency different adjacent sedimentary facies can also accumulate laterally at the same time reflecting the conditions of a particular environment or different energy environments occurring simultaneously thus enhancing the multiscale aquifer heterogeneity and its impact on pollutant transport hence the results of this study may be expanded to a broad range of depositional environments in this study a tracer test was conducted at a field site to investigate solute transport in natural alluvial aquifers with multiscale heterogeneity note that the impact of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport has also identified and discussed in other field sites such as the well known made site zheng et al 2011 bianchi and zheng 2016 the borden site ritzi et al 2013 ren et al 2022 llnl site zhang et al 2013 yin et al 2022 among others compared to abovementioned field sites the tongzhou site has regularly stratified structure as shown in fig 2 the relatively simple hydrofacies architecture can contribute to the identification of the competitive impact of multiscale heterogeneity high resolution numerical models were also built to analyze the field test results and provide quantitative interpretation for the determination of flow and transport behaviors in alluvial aquifers systematic analysis about the plume variance velocities distribution and nonlocal model application provided insight on mechanism how different scale aquifer heterogeneity competitively control the solute transport in alluvial aquifer when mean k differences between hydrofacies and degrees of sub hydrofaices heterogeneity vary overall the results in this study can improve the understanding of anomalous transport in alluvial aquifer with multiscale heterogeneity 2 field tracer test and numerical model development 2 1 study site the tongzhou test site located in the southwestern part of tongzhou district in the chaobai river alluvial plain beijing china is instrumented with 48 continuous multichannel tubing cmt wells and three fully screened wells within an area of 30 m 90 m fig 2a the cmt wells were screened at seven individual depths of 5 10 15 17 5 20 25 and 30 m and each well screen section was 1 m long the injection and extraction wells were fully screened at depths between 5 and 30 m ma et al 2019 lin 2020 based on borehole data the aquifer system at the tongzhou site contains a shallow aquifer at depths between 2 and 13 m an aquitard at depths ranging from 13 20 m and a confined aquifer at depths from 20 to 30 m the aquifer system mainly comprises fine sand coarse sand silty clay and medium sand fig 2b lu 2015 the water table depth of the shallow aquifer seasonally fluctuates with a mean value of 5 m the general groundwater flow direction extends from northwest to southeast in winter and is reversed in summer fig 2a the field water table measurements indicated that the mean ambient hydraulic gradient reached approximately 0 0028 2 2 tracer test a two well dipole tracer test was conducted at the tongzhou site from 10 00 am 9 27 2014 to 8 45 am 10 10 2014 in the tracer test pneumatized packers were installed in the injection and extraction wells at a depth of 15 m to ensure that the test only impacted the shallow part of the aquifer system with a depth less than 15 m the distance between the injection 4 4 and extraction 0 0 wells was 8 m and the injection and extraction rates were 42 24 and 50 64 m3 d respectively in the tracer test the locations of the extraction and injection wells and cmt monitoring wells are shown in fig 2c the tracer test was conducted in three consecutive steps first water without tracer was injected into well 4 4 and groundwater was simultaneously extracted from well 0 0 the first step lasted 16 h to achieve a quasi steady state of the groundwater flow field second groundwater was continuously extracted from well 0 0 and water containing br at a concentration of 400 mg l was injected into well 4 4 for 6 25 h third all processes remained the same as those in the previous step except that the water injected into well 4 4 did not contain br the last stage lasted 129 25 h groundwater samples at three depths 5 10 and 15 m were collected from the cmt wells along the main flow lines using a peristaltic pump at 1 6 h intervals the br concentration was monitored in situ via a br ion selective electrode in the field test and validated against laboratory measurements obtained with an ion chromatography system ics 1100 dionex u s a 2 3 numerical modeling 2 3 1 stochastic simulation of the hydraulic conductivity fields the borehole data obtained at the tongzhou site exhibited four hydrofacies at depths less than 15 m clay from 0 to 2 m fine sand from 2 to 6 5 m coarse sand from 6 5 to 13 m and silt and clay from 13 to 15 m in practice the surface clay layer always remains unsaturated and therefore was not considered in the numerical model the multivariate normal mvn algorithm was used to generate the 3 d heterogeneous lnk field within each hydrofacies since this method has been widely applied in field scale medium characterization and numerical simulations rehfeldt et al 1992 de dreuzy et al 2007 fiori et al 2015 hakoun et al 2019 with the use of this approach the heterogeneous field of lnk can be quantitatively described by the geometric mean and variance in lnk in addition the exponential autocorrelation function can be used to model the correlation of the random field y lnk di dato et al 2019 ρ y r e r w i t h r x 2 i x 2 y 2 i y 2 z 2 i z 2 where i x i y and i z are the integral scales along the x y and z directions respectively and r denotes the normalized separation distance initial values of k in this study were obtained from the parameter inversion study conducted by lin 2020 in which both heat and bromide tracer test results were used to numerically inverse the k distribution the results of lin 2020 revealed a moderate heterogeneity of the porous medium at the tongzhou site with a mean lnk and variance of 0 33 m d and 0 18 respectively for fine sand and 1 2 m d and 0 12 respectively for coarse sand in addition to the mean and variance in k of each hydrofacies the correlation length of hydrofacies could impact the heterogeneity of porous media and thus affect the model performance the initial correlation length was 1 m along the horizontal direction and 0 5 m along the vertical direction in both the fine and coarse sand layers to represent a moderate degree of medium heterogeneity the k value of clay layers the fourth layer is generally much lower than that of sand layers and was assumed to be homogeneously distributed with an lnk value of 0 17 m d a model domain with a horizontal distance of 50 m along the x direction and 20 m along the y direction and a vertical distance of 13 m was defined with a total of 3 2 million cells with dimensions of 0 2 0 2 0 1 m length width height and the long axis was parallel to the main flow direction to prevent the effect of boundary conditions on the subsequent flow process and transport model the distances between the model boundaries and well field were set to 20 m along the x direction and 10 m along the y direction both regional and subhydrofacies scale aquifer heterogeneities were considered in the realizations of the 3 d k field generated by the mvn algorithm based on the obtained data pertaining to the tongzhou site fig 3 2 3 2 flow and transport simulation the grids used in the flow model were the same as those used to generate the hydraulic conductivity field modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 code was used to simulate the steady state groundwater flow process in the 3 d unconfined aquifer at stages two and three of the tracer test at the tongzhou site fig 3 the left boundary of the flow model was defined as a specified head with the measured groundwater level at x 0 since the measured groundwater levels in the tracer test demonstrated that the impact of the test did not reach the model boundary the groundwater level at the right boundary located at x 50 m remained unchanged and was calculated according to the measured natural hydraulic gradient of 0 0028 no flow conditions were imposed at the boundaries at y 0 and y 20 since these two boundaries are parallel to the main groundwater flow direction the bottom boundary was also treated as a zero flux flow boundary the sink and source terms were defined as involving injection in well 4 4 and extraction from well 0 0 at rates of 42 24 and 50 64 m3 d respectively since no precipitation occurred during the experimental period no surface recharge was considered evaporation was neglected due to the relatively deep groundwater table 5 m the vertical hydraulic conductivity was set to one tenth of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity mt3dms was employed to characterize the solute transport behavior zheng 2010 two stress periods from 0 0 26 days and 0 27 6 days were selected to match the second tracer injection and third steps tracer pushing respectively of the test to consider the impact of the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity the vertical distribution of the injection or extraction rate in the corresponding well at multiple depths was assigned according to the k value in each cell traversed by the well and the cell thickness harbaugh 2006 a constant porosity 0 37 and longitudinal dispersivity α l 0 01 m throughout the model domain were used in this study and the values are similar to those used in models in other field scale tracer tests labolle and fogg 2001 zhang et al 2013 additionally the molecular diffusion coefficient was set to 0 33 10 6 m2 h the two horizontal dispersivities α th and α v were 1 and 2 orders of magnitude lower than the longitudinal dispersivity α l 2 3 3 evaluation of the model performance and calibration to evaluate the performance of the stochastic model the mean absolute residual mar was employed which can be defined as kelly et al 2017 2 mar i j 1 n j k 1 n j c i j k c x j t j k c 0 where mar i j is the mean absolute residual between the simulated breakthrough curve btc of the i th realization and the observed btc at the j th sampling port n j is the total number of data of the observed btc at the j th sampling port c 0 is the initial concentration of the tracer injected into the aquifer c i j k c x j t j k denotes the residual between the observed and simulated concentrations at position x j and time t j k and x j and t j k are the spatial position and sampling time respectively of the k th btc concentration at the j th sampling port a smaller mar value indicates a better performance of the stochastic model in regard to model calibration the observed btcs were used to calibrate nine parameters including the mean value variance horizontal and vertical correlation lengths of the hydraulic conductivity of two hydrofacies the upper find sand layer and lower coarse sand layer and mean k of the bottom silt layer based on our numerical tests the model performance was only sensitive to the mean and variance in k of each hydrofacies in each calibration process one hundred simulations were generated and used for flow and solute transport simulations then the performance of the numerical models was evaluated based on the mar value 2 3 4 calculation of plume variance the plume variance e g second centered spatial moment was commonly used to quantify the anomalous transport in heterogeneous media adams and gelhar 1992 zhang et al 2008 bianchi and zheng 2016 in this study we focused on the evolution of longitudinal plume variance parallel to the main flow direction the normalized mass distribution along the main flow direction x direction was calculated as 3 m x n y 1 y 2 z 2 z 1 c x y z d x d y d z m 0 where m x is the normalized mass located at x n is the porosity assumed equal to 0 37 y 1 z 1 and y 2 z 2 denotes boundary location at the y z direction c x y z denotes the average solute concentration at location x y z over all realizations in the same scenario and m 0 is the total mass injected into the aquifer then the longitudinal plume variance var can be calculated as 4 var x 1 x 2 x x 2 m x d x x 1 x 2 m x d x and 5 x x 1 x 2 x m x d x x 1 x 2 m x d x 3 results 3 1 calibration of the numerical models the focus of this study was on solute transport along the main flow direction and thus btcs observed for monitoring wells 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 located along the flow direction are mainly considered in this section the observed and calculated btcs using models with the best performance for the monitoring wells are shown in fig 4 btc signals at the 5 and 15 m depths in well 1 3 and at the 15 m depth in well 2 3 were barely detected and thus are not shown here the btcs exhibited variations in the arrival time and peak concentration of the injected tracer at the different depths originating from different locations reflecting the control of the alluvial aquifer heterogeneity on solute transport at the tongzhou site in particular the btcs observed at the 10 m depth exhibited a higher peak and earlier arrival time than those at the other depths fig 4b and e respectively this occurred because the sampling points at the 10 m depth were located within the coarse sand layer which may function as a regional preferential flow path in the aquifer system similar results were also observed in another tracer test at the tongzhou site conducted by ma et al 2019 additionally solute retention at the later stage is shown in fig 4b and e indicating the existence of immobile zones or low permeability media in this alluvial aquifer this is consistent with our core analysis results which suggests the occurrence of 5 silt and clay in the coarse sand layer lu 2015 the peak concentration and late tail of the btcs observed in the field were generally captured by the numerical models fig 4 the slight underestimation of the btc peak observed at the 10 m depth in well 2 3 may be attributable to an additional small scale preferential flow path however the impact of the extra small scale preferential flow path on tracer transport should be limited in our field test since the overall observed solute transport behavior patterns were captured by the models therefore the calibrated numerical model could reasonably represent the heterogeneous aquifer and exhibited a satisfactory performance in the prediction of solute transport at the tongzhou site the parameters used to generate the heterogeneous k field in the monte carlo simulations are listed in table 1 3 2 interpretation of the solute transport behavior considering the modeling results the monte carlo simulations shown in fig 4 generated multiple unconditioned equally probable realizations of the joint distribution of k in space hence the simulation results may exhibit uncertainties to interpret the solute transport behavior in the tracer test the results of three simulations with the smallest total mar are shown in fig 5 to reveal the overall agreement between the observed and calculated btcs it should be noted that even though the simulation results could be further improved via local adjustment of the k value further calibration is unnecessary and meaningless for achieving our study purpose the heterogeneous k fields and cross sectional views along the x z plane of simulated plume snapshots at y 10 m of the top three realizations clearly revealed the impact of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport in the alluvial aquifer fig 6 fig 6a c show the multiscale medium heterogeneity represented by the multiscale spatial variation in k there existed an apparent difference in the average k value between the upper and lower hydrofacies and a significant fluctuation in k at the subhydrofacies scale the complex spread and evolution of the solute plume in the alluvial aquifer were induced by multiscale heterogeneity as shown in fig 6d i at the regional scale solutes in the lower layer mainly comprising coarse sand with an overall higher ks value moved much faster than those in the upper layer comprising fine sand this macroscopic result is consistent with the conclusion drawn by zhang et al 2013 who found that the hydrofacies architecture could notably impact solute transport in alluvial aquifers at the subhydrofacies scale due to the k field heterogeneity local preferential flow paths and relatively immobile zones were formed within each facies enhancing plume deformation and fingering fig 6 therefore comprehensive control of multiscale heterogeneity could challenge the simulation and prediction of solute transport in alluvial aquifers highlighting the requirement of full characterization of the aquifer heterogeneity at both the regional and subhydrofacies scales or of an upscaling model approach considering the effect of multiscale heterogeneity 4 discussion 4 1 competitive control of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport as shown in the abovementioned results and previous studies soltanian et al 2020 zhang and zhang 2015 multiscale heterogeneity widely exists and affects solute transport in alluvial aquifers to further investigate the competitive control mechanism of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport thirteen aquifer scenarios with various hydrofacies structures and degrees of subhydrofacies heterogeneity were built in this study among them seven scenarios scenarios 1 7 were characterized by single hydrofacies aquifers with different mean k values and degrees of subhydrofacies heterogeneity represented by the variance in k among these scenarios the mean lnk of the single hydrofacies aquifer structure increased from scenarios 1 to 4 while the variance remained unchanged at 0 89 the mean lnk value increased from scenarios 5 to 7 and the variance remained the same value at 1 08 table 2 scenarios 2 and 5 considered the same mean lnk value but scenario 5 considered a higher lnk variance the same was true for scenarios 3 and 6 and scenarios 4 and 7 respectively to explore the control of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport six scenarios 8 13 characterized by a dual heterogeneous hydrofacies aquifer considering different means and variances in lnk were also designed in which the mean lnk value increased from scenarios 8 to 10 and 11 to 13 table 2 referring to the characterization of shallow aquifer properties at the tongzhou site a dual hydrofacies structure with an upper fine sand layer with a lower average k value and lower coarse sand layer with a higher average k value was considered the facies thickness reached 4 5 m for the upper fine sand hydrofacies and 6 5 m for the lower coarse sand hydrofacies which is similar to the properties of the tongzhou aquifer the mean and variance in lnk of the upper layer under dual hydrofacies aquifer scenarios 8 13 were the same as those under scenario 1 and those of the lower layers were the same as those under scenarios 2 to 7 it should be noted that the parameters used in this section slightly differed from the calibrated results listed in table 1 to emphasize the impact of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport a constant ambient hydraulic gradient and an instantaneous line source with a uniform concentration were used in the numerical simulations the simulated variance in the plumes second order spatial moment under the seven scenarios with a single hydrofacies i e scenarios 1 7 and the six dual hydrofacies aquifer scenarios scenarios 8 13 are shown in fig 7 in regard to the single hydrofacies aquifer structure an increase in the mean lnk value enhanced plume spreading which was indicated by the plume variance change over time under scenarios 1 4 and scenarios 5 7 moreover an increase in the lnk variance with the same mean lnk value resulted in faster plume growth by comparing the results of scenarios 2 and 5 scenarios 3 and 6 and scenarios 4 and 7 in terms of the dual hydrofacies aquifer structure the plume variance increased faster than linearly over time under all scenarios furthermore the simulation results indicated that the growth rate of the plume variance could be accelerated by enhancing the subhydrofacies heterogeneity indicated by the comparison of the results between scenarios 8 and 11 scenarios 9 and 12 and scenarios 10 and 13 these scenario pairs considered the same mean lnk value but different variance values or increasing the discrepancy in the average k value between the upper and lower layers or hydrofacies reflected by the results of scenarios 8 to 10 and scenarios 11 to 13 hence the observed nonlinear rapid increase in the plume variance under dual hydrofacies aquifer scenarios was induced by both regional and subhydrofacies scale k heterogeneities based on the simulation results the effect of the dual hydrofacies structure on solute transport mainly depended on both the difference in the average k value between adjacent hydrofacies and the heterogeneity degree of each subhydrofacies as identified in existing studies the impact of the subhydrofacies scale heterogeneity on solute transport is controlled by the variance and spatial correlation of k in single hydrofacies aquifers tompson and gelhar 1990 fiori et al 2003 xia et al 2021 our results indicated that when the difference in the mean k value between adjacent hydrofacies was relatively small corresponding to the situations shown in fig 7a b d and e the increase in plume variance in the dual hydrofacies aquifers occurred faster than that in the single fine sand hydrofacies aquifer with a lower mean and variance in lnk blue solid line but slower than that in the single coarse sand hydrofacies aquifer with a higher mean and variance in lnk red solid line this suggests that anomalous transport in the dual hydrofacies aquifers was dominated by a high subhydrofacies heterogeneity in other words the layered structure did not enhance the integral aquifer heterogeneity however under a large discrepancy in the mean k value between adjacent hydrofacies the impact of the layered structure on solute transport became increasingly prominent as indicated by the results of scenarios 10 and 13 shown in fig 7c and f respectively the plume variance in the dual hydrofacies aquifers increased faster than that in both the single coarse sand scenarios 4 and 7 and single fine sand scenario 1 hydrofacies aquifers this result is consistent with the higher heterogeneity under scenarios 10 and 13 represented by a larger σ 1 2 value than that of the single hydrofacies aquifers this finding emphasizes that the regional scale heterogeneity became the dominant factor controlling solute transport to further explore the impact of the flow velocity variation induced by the multiscale heterogeneity of dual hydrofacies aquifers on solute transport distribution probability density functions pdfs of the eulerian velocity under all thirteen scenarios were calculated as shown in fig 8 a wide distribution and high spatial correlation of the velocity or hydraulic conductivity are commonly considered the main controlling factors of anomalous transport in porous media berkowitz et al 2006 dentz and bolster 2010 fogg and zhang 2016 as shown in fig 8 the width of the velocity pdf was affected by both the subhydrofacies and regional scale heterogeneities on the one hand due to the different degrees of subhydrofacies heterogeneity the pdf of the velocity under scenarios 1 4 σ 1 2 0 89 was narrower with a higher peak while the pdfs of the velocity under scenarios 5 7 σ 1 2 1 08 were much wider with lower peaks on the other hand the dual peak characteristics of the velocity pdf under the dual hydrofacies aquifer scenarios became increasingly apparent and the width of the velocity pdf increased with increasing discrepancy in the mean k value between adjacent hydrofacies i e fine and coarse sand fig 8c and 8f respectively this indicated that the velocity pdf of the dual hydrofacies aquifers was controlled by both regional and subhydrofacies scale heterogeneities additionally as shown in fig 8 when a relatively small k discrepancy existed between adjacent hydrofacies the velocity pdf of the dual hydrofacies aquifers was unimodal rather than bimodal this result indicates that for simplification and computational efficiency of conservative solute transport prediction in practice adjacent hydrofacies with similar mean k values could be integrated into a single hydrofacies 4 2 upscaling solute transport in dual hydrofacies aquifers this section proposes a new nonlocal transport model to quantify anomalous transport behavior under the impact of both subhydrofacies and regional scale heterogeneities the model results in turn could provide insight into solute transport in multiscale heterogeneous media the employed dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm was developed from the distributed order fractional derivative model yin et al 2020 yin et al 2022 the dhdm macroscopically conceptualizes the target aquifer into dual domains to capture anomalous transport induced by regional scale heterogeneity and invokes the time fractional derivative to account for solute retention induced by subhydrofacies scale heterogeneity therefore compared to classical nonlocal transport models the dhdm provides an instinctive capacity for the simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous multiscale aquifers the governing equations can be expressed as follows 6a c 1 t β 1 γ 1 c 1 t γ v 1 x d 1 2 x 2 w 1 x t 6b c 2 t β 2 γ 2 c 2 t γ v 2 x d 2 2 x 2 w 2 x t 7 w i x t ε θ i c 1 c 2 where c i ml 3 i 1 2 is the concentration in domain i t t is the time coordinate x l is the space coordinate v i lt 1 is the effective velocity in the i th domain v i is typically referred to as the seepage velocity of groundwater in the hydrogeology community which is equal to the darcy velocity divided by the effective porosity d i l 2 t 1 is the dispersion coefficient ε t 1 is the first order rate coefficient controlling mass transfer between different mobile domains θ i dimensionless is the water content proportion in domain i to the total water content β i t γ 1 is the fractional capacity coefficient in the i th domain and γ i dimensionless 0 γ 1 in this study is the time index in the i th domain representing the degree of time nonlocality for solute transport for β i 0 the dhdm can be reduced to the classical dual advection dispersion equation dade model that has been applied for decades by various hydrologists in the simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous media gerke and van genuchten 1993 chastanet and wood 2008 hu et al 2002 xie et al 2018 for v 1 v 2 and d 1 d 2 i e one domain only the dhdm can be reduced to the fractal mobile immobile fmim model proposed by schumer et al 2003 to simulate solute transport with a power law waiting time in the immobile phase the dhdm can be solved via either the finite difference method or the lagrangian particle tracking method yin et al 2022 the boundary and initial conditions of the dhdm 6 are the same as those used in the monte carlo simulations as described in section 2 3 to apply the 1 d dhdm 6 the spatial distribution of the solute mass in the aquifer was calculated and integrated to one dimension in the monte carlo simulations in addition the mass transfer rates ε was assumed to be identical within two domains to the valid ergodicity of the monte carlo simulations obvious mass retention is shown in fig 9 which should be induced by the low permeability zones in the aquifer additionally a larger discrepancy in k between adjacent hydrofacies resulted in a heavier leading edge of the plume therefore both super and subdiffusion processes were captured in the simulated mass distribution curves due to the impact of multiscale heterogeneity the simulation results of the dhdm 6 exhibited a suitable agreement with the mass distribution of the monte carlo simulations fig 9 which further confirmed the capability of the dhdm in capturing solute transport behavior affected by multiscale medium heterogeneity the best fit parameters of the dhdm 6 for scenarios 8 13 are listed in table 3 in the dhdm aquifers were conceptualized into one slow transport domain domain 1 with a low effective velocity and one fast transport domain domain 2 with a high velocity while the hydraulic properties within each domain were heterogeneous as indicated in table 3 a larger discrepancy in the average k value between adjacent hydrofacies yielded a higher v 2 value while v 1 remained relatively stable the impact of this k discrepancy on the dispersion coefficient was similar to that on the velocities due to the relatively low degree of medium heterogeneity at the subhydrofacies scale under all six scenarios with σ 1 2 1 1 small β i and large γ i values were obtained to capture the weak mass retention within each domain a larger k discrepancy between adjacent hydrofacies in the aquifer could also enhance the form of the preferential flow paths and reduce mass transfer between two mobile domains resulting in smaller θ 1 and ε values note that the θ i denotes the water content proportion in domain i to the total water content per bulk volume and thus the smaller θ 1 implies less water volume proportion in the slow domain fig 10 shows the velocity distribution of realization 1 under scenarios 11 13 in cross section y 10 m and reveals the impact of the k discrepancy combined with the subhydrofacies heterogeneity on the distribution of the preferential flow paths with increasing k discrepancy more preferential flow paths were present and concentrated in the underlying hydrofacies which further enhanced the connection between the high velocity zones the velocity distributions shown in fig 10 also confirmed that the solute transport domains fast or slow domains did not necessarily overlap with the hydrofacies structure but were significantly influenced by both the hydrofacies structure and subhydrofacies heterogeneity 4 3 dominant controlling mechanism of multiscale heterogeneity on anomalous transport btcs along a control plane 20 m downstream from the injection location were numerically sampled from the monte carlo simulations dade and fmim modeling results were also obtained for comparison to those of the dhdm and to further investigate the dominant mechanism of anomalous transport controlled by multiscale heterogeneity in alluvial aquifers at the different stages as discussed in section 4 2 solute transport under scenario 13 was typically controlled by both regional and subhydrofacies scale heterogeneities therefore scenario 13 was selected as a representative scenario and is examined in this section fig 11 a shows the mass distribution curves for scenario 13 at t 150 days after tracer injection and the best fit results using the dhdm dade and fmim models similar to the fitting results of the dhdm the bimodal transport behavior shown in fig 11a was also generally captured by the dade model this could be attributed to the similar conceptualization between the dade model and dhdm as both models assumed dual mobile domains to account for the impact of preferential flow paths on solute transport however the dade model could not capture solute retention induced by the immobile zones e g the late time tails of the btcs fig 11b in comparison although the fmim model exhibited a relatively poor performance in mass distribution curve simulation it captured the late time tails of the btcs well fig 11b the fact that the mobile immobile model the fmim model could not capture the bimodal transport process under scenario 13 indicated that solute transport was mainly dominated by the dual mobile domain structure at the early stage compared to the dade and fmim models the dhdm could capture both the mass distribution curve at the early stage and the btcs at all stages indicating a high capability in the simulation of anomalous transport in complex media the above comparison between the dhdm and the other two nonlocal transport models the dade and fmim models confirmed that solute transport in layered fluvial aquifers was affected by both preferential flow paths formed by regional scale heterogeneity and subhydrofacies heterogeneity the dual domain structure i e preferential flow paths and relatively slow flow paths on a larger scale dominated solute transport at early stages thus its impact on solute transport could be captured by dual domain models such as the dade model and dhdm at later times immobile zones at the subhydrofacies scale embedded in the heterogeneous aquifer became controlling factors of solute transport and resulted in heavy late time tails of the btcs however neither the dade nor the fmim model can fully capture the anomalous behaviors of solute transport in multiscale heterogeneous media because both of them only consider single scale heterogeneity in contrast the dhdm used in this study could reasonably predict the multiple anomalous behaviors of solute transport i e early arrival bi peak and late time tail simultaneously significantly expanding the capability of nonlocal transport models yin et al 2022 the abovementioned results also suggest that if possible both spatial concentration data i e mass distribution curves or snapshots and btcs should be used in model calibration therefore the dhdm should be considered to simulate solute transport in aquifers with multiscale heterogeneity 5 conclusions multiscale heterogeneity widely exists in natural aquifer systems yet its control on solute transport at different scales remains unclear this study provided the first systematic examination of the competitive impact of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport based on field experimental results and numerical model analysis of alluvial aquifers both the btcs observed at various aquifer depths in the field tracer test and the monte carlo numerical simulation results for the tongzhou site exhibited the obvious impact of both regional scale hydrofacies structure and subhydrofacies heterogeneities on tracer transport further numerical analysis was conducted involving various scenarios with different aquifer structures regional scale heterogeneity and degrees of subhydrofacies heterogeneity and the results of upscaling models dade fmim model and dhdm were also compared the results indicated that the subhydrofacies heterogeneity played a dominant role in controlling solute transport in alluvial settings when the discrepancy in the mean k value between adjacent hydrofacies was relatively small in this case both the velocity distribution and solute plume in the considered dual hydrofacies aquifers remained unimodal the impact of regional scale medium heterogeneity on solute transport was more pronounced when the discrepancy in the mean k value between adjacent hydrofacies increased under this situation the velocity distribution exhibited obvious bimodal characteristics resulting in bi peak btcs at the early stage of solute transport under the comprehensive impact of multiscale heterogeneity the bimodal characteristics of solute transport at the early stage were dominated by the preferential flow paths attributed to regional scale heterogeneity while the heavy tails at the later stage were mainly controlled by immobile zones induced by subhydrofacies heterogeneity the dhdm model could capture both bimodal transport at the early stage and btc late time tails of the layered aquifer structure the insights obtained in this study could

2619,natural aquifers can contain multiscale medium heterogeneity whose joint impact on solute transport however remains obscure to fill this knowledge gap this study selected an alluvial aquifer as the representative medium where the spatial distribution of multiple hydrofacies with a typically nonuniform hydraulic conductivity k within each facies could represent both regional scale large scale and subhydrofacies scale local scale heterogeneities to obtain first hand data a field tracer test was conducted in an alluvial aquifer located at the tongzhou site in beijing china where the breakthrough curves btcs obtained at various aquifer depths indicated a significant influence of both regional and subhydrofacies scale heterogeneities on solute transport further numerical analysis revealed that the impact of regional scale heterogeneity on solute transport increased with increasing discrepancy in k between adjacent hydrofacies in comparison subhydrofacies scale heterogeneity embedded within each hydrofacies played an important role in controlling solute transport when the mean ks value of adjacent hydrofacies became more similar bimodal transport at early stages was mainly impacted by multiscale preferential flow paths while solute retention at later times was induced by immobile zones dominating late time transport anomalous transport induced by multiscale heterogeneity could be captured by the dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm while the dual advection dispersion equation dade or fractal mobile immobile fmim model could only provide reasonable predictions at the early or later stage respectively this study sheds light on the control mechanism of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport keywords solute transport multiscale heterogeneity

comprehensive understanding of the rate and pathways of contaminant migration in aquifers is essential for sustainable groundwater use andrews and hennet 2022 however the prediction of solute transport in natural aquifer systems remains a major challenge due to anomalous or non fickian transport caused by medium heterogeneity jeopardizing the prevention and control of groundwater contaminants berkowitz et al 2006 de barros et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 ma et al 2010 ma et al 2014 the heterogeneous distribution of aquifer hydrological properties mainly the hydraulic conductivity k normally occurs at multiple scales in response to dynamic sedimentary processes pryshlak et al 2015 soltanian et al 2020 soltanian and ritzi 2014 ritzi and soltanian 2015 correspondingly anomalous transport behavior patterns such as superdiffusion subdiffusion or transport with multiple peaks have been experimentally observed at various scales ranging from the pore scale zhang and lv 2007 de anna et al 2013 puyguiraud et al 2019 to the laboratory scale huang et al 1995 bromly and hinz 2004 zaheer et al 2017 sherman et al 2018 and further to the regional scale zheng et al 2011 guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 goeppert et al 2020 hence heterogeneity at multiple scales could simultaneously impact solute transport and result in a much more complex transport process than that in a medium with single scale heterogeneity wu et al 2004 zhang and gable 2008 soltanian et al 2015c zhang and zhang 2015 for instance lagrangian based transport model was used to reveal the impact of hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture on solute transport in alluvial aquifer soltanian et al 2015a 2015b dai et al 2020 simulated results shown that due to the impact of multiscale heterogeneity the longitudinal dispersivity of the plume cannot reach its asymptotic value even after 10 000 years of travel time soltanian et al 2017 regarding porous media at field sites alluvial settings are often characterized by interbedded litho or hydrofacies due to periodic variations in sedimentary deposition davis et al 1997 allen king et al 1998 fogg and zhang 2016 zhang et al 2013 great discrepancies in k may exist among different hydrofacies a typical k value for fine sediments such as clay and silt ranges from 10 11 10 5 cm s while this value for coarse sediments including coarse sand and gravel ranges from 10 7 10 2 cm s domenico and schwartz 1990 fogg and zhang 2016 due to different sedimentary environments the mean length of the spatial continuity of hydrofacies may range from 30 1000 m along the depositional dip direction and 1 20 m along the vertical direction bianchi and zheng 2016 zhang et al 2013 guo et al 2019 2020 wallace et al 2021 spatially continuous coarse grained hydrofacies may constitute regional preferential flow paths and significantly impact solute transport in regional fluvial aquifers bianchi and zheng 2016 yin et al 2020b additionally preferential flow paths may exist at the pore to darcy scales in poorly sorted or nonuniformly consolidated sediments the impact of subhydrofacies scale preferential flow paths on solute transport has been experimentally or numerically investigated zheng et al 2011 liu et al 2004 it should be noted that inherent associations between preferential flow paths may exist at different scales for instance regional scale preferential flow paths may be generated via the accumulation of small scale preferential paths or constructed via interconnected small scale preferential paths to reveal the impact of multiscale heterogeneity of alluvial aquifers on solute transport zhang et al 2013 conducted systematic monte carlo simulations of contaminant transport in regional scale alluvial settings and found that the subhydrofacies scale i e local scale heterogeneity did not significantly affect the overall transport dynamics this conclusion is consistent with that drawn by frei et al 2009 and sun et al 2008 these studies assumed a log normal or truncated pareto distribution for the increment in natural log k for each facies where the change in k within facies was much smaller than that between facies however limited by the resolution of model domain discretization grids with a 2 to 50 m length and 0 5 m height in the abovementioned models may not be fine enough to reflect the real world subhydrofacies scale heterogeneity more recently numerical flow and solute transport models with significantly refined resolutions were established by hakoun et al 2019 and comolli et al 2019 to investigate anomalous transport in porous media in which k was described by log normal distributions their results indicated that the spatial correlation of the particle velocity induced by preferential flow paths significant impacts solute transport confirming the importance of a suitable description of subhydrofacies scale heterogeneity when modeling solute transport in alluvial aquifers due to the different sedimentary structure the mean length volume proportion and mean k of hydrofacies as well as the sub hydrofacies heterogeneity degrees may vary from site to site causing the understanding obtained from one specific site to be difficult transferrable to other sites correspondingly yin et al 2020a investigated the impacts of hydrofacies mean lengths and volumetric proportion of hydrofacies with high hydraulic conductivity on the spatial pattern of super diffusion for alluvial aquifer systems most recently ren et al 2022 conducted numerical simulations to explore the controlling mechanisms of multiscale heterogeneity on the effected dispersion and dilution of plumes at borden site their results indicated that meter scale heterogeneity plays a major role in controlling solute transport processes and the effective dispersion is more sensitive to the spatial organization of sedimentary facies type these studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the impact of sedimentary architecture on transport processes however they did not address how different scale of aquifer heterogeneity i e regional and hydrofacies scale and the k differences between hydrofacies affect the spatial solute plume and mass evolution as well as non fickian transport behavior during different transport period to fill this knowledge gap we focused on the mechanism and model characterization of competitive control of multiple heterogeneities on solute transport in alluvial aquifers fig 1 it should be noted that hierarchical or layered structures are common in various terrestrial sedimentary environments such as mountain stream glacial sand dune and river fluvial environments with various bedding planes or cross bedding structures such as a fining upward juxtaposition tendency different adjacent sedimentary facies can also accumulate laterally at the same time reflecting the conditions of a particular environment or different energy environments occurring simultaneously thus enhancing the multiscale aquifer heterogeneity and its impact on pollutant transport hence the results of this study may be expanded to a broad range of depositional environments in this study a tracer test was conducted at a field site to investigate solute transport in natural alluvial aquifers with multiscale heterogeneity note that the impact of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport has also identified and discussed in other field sites such as the well known made site zheng et al 2011 bianchi and zheng 2016 the borden site ritzi et al 2013 ren et al 2022 llnl site zhang et al 2013 yin et al 2022 among others compared to abovementioned field sites the tongzhou site has regularly stratified structure as shown in fig 2 the relatively simple hydrofacies architecture can contribute to the identification of the competitive impact of multiscale heterogeneity high resolution numerical models were also built to analyze the field test results and provide quantitative interpretation for the determination of flow and transport behaviors in alluvial aquifers systematic analysis about the plume variance velocities distribution and nonlocal model application provided insight on mechanism how different scale aquifer heterogeneity competitively control the solute transport in alluvial aquifer when mean k differences between hydrofacies and degrees of sub hydrofaices heterogeneity vary overall the results in this study can improve the understanding of anomalous transport in alluvial aquifer with multiscale heterogeneity 2 field tracer test and numerical model development 2 1 study site the tongzhou test site located in the southwestern part of tongzhou district in the chaobai river alluvial plain beijing china is instrumented with 48 continuous multichannel tubing cmt wells and three fully screened wells within an area of 30 m 90 m fig 2a the cmt wells were screened at seven individual depths of 5 10 15 17 5 20 25 and 30 m and each well screen section was 1 m long the injection and extraction wells were fully screened at depths between 5 and 30 m ma et al 2019 lin 2020 based on borehole data the aquifer system at the tongzhou site contains a shallow aquifer at depths between 2 and 13 m an aquitard at depths ranging from 13 20 m and a confined aquifer at depths from 20 to 30 m the aquifer system mainly comprises fine sand coarse sand silty clay and medium sand fig 2b lu 2015 the water table depth of the shallow aquifer seasonally fluctuates with a mean value of 5 m the general groundwater flow direction extends from northwest to southeast in winter and is reversed in summer fig 2a the field water table measurements indicated that the mean ambient hydraulic gradient reached approximately 0 0028 2 2 tracer test a two well dipole tracer test was conducted at the tongzhou site from 10 00 am 9 27 2014 to 8 45 am 10 10 2014 in the tracer test pneumatized packers were installed in the injection and extraction wells at a depth of 15 m to ensure that the test only impacted the shallow part of the aquifer system with a depth less than 15 m the distance between the injection 4 4 and extraction 0 0 wells was 8 m and the injection and extraction rates were 42 24 and 50 64 m3 d respectively in the tracer test the locations of the extraction and injection wells and cmt monitoring wells are shown in fig 2c the tracer test was conducted in three consecutive steps first water without tracer was injected into well 4 4 and groundwater was simultaneously extracted from well 0 0 the first step lasted 16 h to achieve a quasi steady state of the groundwater flow field second groundwater was continuously extracted from well 0 0 and water containing br at a concentration of 400 mg l was injected into well 4 4 for 6 25 h third all processes remained the same as those in the previous step except that the water injected into well 4 4 did not contain br the last stage lasted 129 25 h groundwater samples at three depths 5 10 and 15 m were collected from the cmt wells along the main flow lines using a peristaltic pump at 1 6 h intervals the br concentration was monitored in situ via a br ion selective electrode in the field test and validated against laboratory measurements obtained with an ion chromatography system ics 1100 dionex u s a 2 3 numerical modeling 2 3 1 stochastic simulation of the hydraulic conductivity fields the borehole data obtained at the tongzhou site exhibited four hydrofacies at depths less than 15 m clay from 0 to 2 m fine sand from 2 to 6 5 m coarse sand from 6 5 to 13 m and silt and clay from 13 to 15 m in practice the surface clay layer always remains unsaturated and therefore was not considered in the numerical model the multivariate normal mvn algorithm was used to generate the 3 d heterogeneous lnk field within each hydrofacies since this method has been widely applied in field scale medium characterization and numerical simulations rehfeldt et al 1992 de dreuzy et al 2007 fiori et al 2015 hakoun et al 2019 with the use of this approach the heterogeneous field of lnk can be quantitatively described by the geometric mean and variance in lnk in addition the exponential autocorrelation function can be used to model the correlation of the random field y lnk di dato et al 2019 ρ y r e r w i t h r x 2 i x 2 y 2 i y 2 z 2 i z 2 where i x i y and i z are the integral scales along the x y and z directions respectively and r denotes the normalized separation distance initial values of k in this study were obtained from the parameter inversion study conducted by lin 2020 in which both heat and bromide tracer test results were used to numerically inverse the k distribution the results of lin 2020 revealed a moderate heterogeneity of the porous medium at the tongzhou site with a mean lnk and variance of 0 33 m d and 0 18 respectively for fine sand and 1 2 m d and 0 12 respectively for coarse sand in addition to the mean and variance in k of each hydrofacies the correlation length of hydrofacies could impact the heterogeneity of porous media and thus affect the model performance the initial correlation length was 1 m along the horizontal direction and 0 5 m along the vertical direction in both the fine and coarse sand layers to represent a moderate degree of medium heterogeneity the k value of clay layers the fourth layer is generally much lower than that of sand layers and was assumed to be homogeneously distributed with an lnk value of 0 17 m d a model domain with a horizontal distance of 50 m along the x direction and 20 m along the y direction and a vertical distance of 13 m was defined with a total of 3 2 million cells with dimensions of 0 2 0 2 0 1 m length width height and the long axis was parallel to the main flow direction to prevent the effect of boundary conditions on the subsequent flow process and transport model the distances between the model boundaries and well field were set to 20 m along the x direction and 10 m along the y direction both regional and subhydrofacies scale aquifer heterogeneities were considered in the realizations of the 3 d k field generated by the mvn algorithm based on the obtained data pertaining to the tongzhou site fig 3 2 3 2 flow and transport simulation the grids used in the flow model were the same as those used to generate the hydraulic conductivity field modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 code was used to simulate the steady state groundwater flow process in the 3 d unconfined aquifer at stages two and three of the tracer test at the tongzhou site fig 3 the left boundary of the flow model was defined as a specified head with the measured groundwater level at x 0 since the measured groundwater levels in the tracer test demonstrated that the impact of the test did not reach the model boundary the groundwater level at the right boundary located at x 50 m remained unchanged and was calculated according to the measured natural hydraulic gradient of 0 0028 no flow conditions were imposed at the boundaries at y 0 and y 20 since these two boundaries are parallel to the main groundwater flow direction the bottom boundary was also treated as a zero flux flow boundary the sink and source terms were defined as involving injection in well 4 4 and extraction from well 0 0 at rates of 42 24 and 50 64 m3 d respectively since no precipitation occurred during the experimental period no surface recharge was considered evaporation was neglected due to the relatively deep groundwater table 5 m the vertical hydraulic conductivity was set to one tenth of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity mt3dms was employed to characterize the solute transport behavior zheng 2010 two stress periods from 0 0 26 days and 0 27 6 days were selected to match the second tracer injection and third steps tracer pushing respectively of the test to consider the impact of the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity the vertical distribution of the injection or extraction rate in the corresponding well at multiple depths was assigned according to the k value in each cell traversed by the well and the cell thickness harbaugh 2006 a constant porosity 0 37 and longitudinal dispersivity α l 0 01 m throughout the model domain were used in this study and the values are similar to those used in models in other field scale tracer tests labolle and fogg 2001 zhang et al 2013 additionally the molecular diffusion coefficient was set to 0 33 10 6 m2 h the two horizontal dispersivities α th and α v were 1 and 2 orders of magnitude lower than the longitudinal dispersivity α l 2 3 3 evaluation of the model performance and calibration to evaluate the performance of the stochastic model the mean absolute residual mar was employed which can be defined as kelly et al 2017 2 mar i j 1 n j k 1 n j c i j k c x j t j k c 0 where mar i j is the mean absolute residual between the simulated breakthrough curve btc of the i th realization and the observed btc at the j th sampling port n j is the total number of data of the observed btc at the j th sampling port c 0 is the initial concentration of the tracer injected into the aquifer c i j k c x j t j k denotes the residual between the observed and simulated concentrations at position x j and time t j k and x j and t j k are the spatial position and sampling time respectively of the k th btc concentration at the j th sampling port a smaller mar value indicates a better performance of the stochastic model in regard to model calibration the observed btcs were used to calibrate nine parameters including the mean value variance horizontal and vertical correlation lengths of the hydraulic conductivity of two hydrofacies the upper find sand layer and lower coarse sand layer and mean k of the bottom silt layer based on our numerical tests the model performance was only sensitive to the mean and variance in k of each hydrofacies in each calibration process one hundred simulations were generated and used for flow and solute transport simulations then the performance of the numerical models was evaluated based on the mar value 2 3 4 calculation of plume variance the plume variance e g second centered spatial moment was commonly used to quantify the anomalous transport in heterogeneous media adams and gelhar 1992 zhang et al 2008 bianchi and zheng 2016 in this study we focused on the evolution of longitudinal plume variance parallel to the main flow direction the normalized mass distribution along the main flow direction x direction was calculated as 3 m x n y 1 y 2 z 2 z 1 c x y z d x d y d z m 0 where m x is the normalized mass located at x n is the porosity assumed equal to 0 37 y 1 z 1 and y 2 z 2 denotes boundary location at the y z direction c x y z denotes the average solute concentration at location x y z over all realizations in the same scenario and m 0 is the total mass injected into the aquifer then the longitudinal plume variance var can be calculated as 4 var x 1 x 2 x x 2 m x d x x 1 x 2 m x d x and 5 x x 1 x 2 x m x d x x 1 x 2 m x d x 3 results 3 1 calibration of the numerical models the focus of this study was on solute transport along the main flow direction and thus btcs observed for monitoring wells 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 located along the flow direction are mainly considered in this section the observed and calculated btcs using models with the best performance for the monitoring wells are shown in fig 4 btc signals at the 5 and 15 m depths in well 1 3 and at the 15 m depth in well 2 3 were barely detected and thus are not shown here the btcs exhibited variations in the arrival time and peak concentration of the injected tracer at the different depths originating from different locations reflecting the control of the alluvial aquifer heterogeneity on solute transport at the tongzhou site in particular the btcs observed at the 10 m depth exhibited a higher peak and earlier arrival time than those at the other depths fig 4b and e respectively this occurred because the sampling points at the 10 m depth were located within the coarse sand layer which may function as a regional preferential flow path in the aquifer system similar results were also observed in another tracer test at the tongzhou site conducted by ma et al 2019 additionally solute retention at the later stage is shown in fig 4b and e indicating the existence of immobile zones or low permeability media in this alluvial aquifer this is consistent with our core analysis results which suggests the occurrence of 5 silt and clay in the coarse sand layer lu 2015 the peak concentration and late tail of the btcs observed in the field were generally captured by the numerical models fig 4 the slight underestimation of the btc peak observed at the 10 m depth in well 2 3 may be attributable to an additional small scale preferential flow path however the impact of the extra small scale preferential flow path on tracer transport should be limited in our field test since the overall observed solute transport behavior patterns were captured by the models therefore the calibrated numerical model could reasonably represent the heterogeneous aquifer and exhibited a satisfactory performance in the prediction of solute transport at the tongzhou site the parameters used to generate the heterogeneous k field in the monte carlo simulations are listed in table 1 3 2 interpretation of the solute transport behavior considering the modeling results the monte carlo simulations shown in fig 4 generated multiple unconditioned equally probable realizations of the joint distribution of k in space hence the simulation results may exhibit uncertainties to interpret the solute transport behavior in the tracer test the results of three simulations with the smallest total mar are shown in fig 5 to reveal the overall agreement between the observed and calculated btcs it should be noted that even though the simulation results could be further improved via local adjustment of the k value further calibration is unnecessary and meaningless for achieving our study purpose the heterogeneous k fields and cross sectional views along the x z plane of simulated plume snapshots at y 10 m of the top three realizations clearly revealed the impact of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport in the alluvial aquifer fig 6 fig 6a c show the multiscale medium heterogeneity represented by the multiscale spatial variation in k there existed an apparent difference in the average k value between the upper and lower hydrofacies and a significant fluctuation in k at the subhydrofacies scale the complex spread and evolution of the solute plume in the alluvial aquifer were induced by multiscale heterogeneity as shown in fig 6d i at the regional scale solutes in the lower layer mainly comprising coarse sand with an overall higher ks value moved much faster than those in the upper layer comprising fine sand this macroscopic result is consistent with the conclusion drawn by zhang et al 2013 who found that the hydrofacies architecture could notably impact solute transport in alluvial aquifers at the subhydrofacies scale due to the k field heterogeneity local preferential flow paths and relatively immobile zones were formed within each facies enhancing plume deformation and fingering fig 6 therefore comprehensive control of multiscale heterogeneity could challenge the simulation and prediction of solute transport in alluvial aquifers highlighting the requirement of full characterization of the aquifer heterogeneity at both the regional and subhydrofacies scales or of an upscaling model approach considering the effect of multiscale heterogeneity 4 discussion 4 1 competitive control of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport as shown in the abovementioned results and previous studies soltanian et al 2020 zhang and zhang 2015 multiscale heterogeneity widely exists and affects solute transport in alluvial aquifers to further investigate the competitive control mechanism of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport thirteen aquifer scenarios with various hydrofacies structures and degrees of subhydrofacies heterogeneity were built in this study among them seven scenarios scenarios 1 7 were characterized by single hydrofacies aquifers with different mean k values and degrees of subhydrofacies heterogeneity represented by the variance in k among these scenarios the mean lnk of the single hydrofacies aquifer structure increased from scenarios 1 to 4 while the variance remained unchanged at 0 89 the mean lnk value increased from scenarios 5 to 7 and the variance remained the same value at 1 08 table 2 scenarios 2 and 5 considered the same mean lnk value but scenario 5 considered a higher lnk variance the same was true for scenarios 3 and 6 and scenarios 4 and 7 respectively to explore the control of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport six scenarios 8 13 characterized by a dual heterogeneous hydrofacies aquifer considering different means and variances in lnk were also designed in which the mean lnk value increased from scenarios 8 to 10 and 11 to 13 table 2 referring to the characterization of shallow aquifer properties at the tongzhou site a dual hydrofacies structure with an upper fine sand layer with a lower average k value and lower coarse sand layer with a higher average k value was considered the facies thickness reached 4 5 m for the upper fine sand hydrofacies and 6 5 m for the lower coarse sand hydrofacies which is similar to the properties of the tongzhou aquifer the mean and variance in lnk of the upper layer under dual hydrofacies aquifer scenarios 8 13 were the same as those under scenario 1 and those of the lower layers were the same as those under scenarios 2 to 7 it should be noted that the parameters used in this section slightly differed from the calibrated results listed in table 1 to emphasize the impact of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport a constant ambient hydraulic gradient and an instantaneous line source with a uniform concentration were used in the numerical simulations the simulated variance in the plumes second order spatial moment under the seven scenarios with a single hydrofacies i e scenarios 1 7 and the six dual hydrofacies aquifer scenarios scenarios 8 13 are shown in fig 7 in regard to the single hydrofacies aquifer structure an increase in the mean lnk value enhanced plume spreading which was indicated by the plume variance change over time under scenarios 1 4 and scenarios 5 7 moreover an increase in the lnk variance with the same mean lnk value resulted in faster plume growth by comparing the results of scenarios 2 and 5 scenarios 3 and 6 and scenarios 4 and 7 in terms of the dual hydrofacies aquifer structure the plume variance increased faster than linearly over time under all scenarios furthermore the simulation results indicated that the growth rate of the plume variance could be accelerated by enhancing the subhydrofacies heterogeneity indicated by the comparison of the results between scenarios 8 and 11 scenarios 9 and 12 and scenarios 10 and 13 these scenario pairs considered the same mean lnk value but different variance values or increasing the discrepancy in the average k value between the upper and lower layers or hydrofacies reflected by the results of scenarios 8 to 10 and scenarios 11 to 13 hence the observed nonlinear rapid increase in the plume variance under dual hydrofacies aquifer scenarios was induced by both regional and subhydrofacies scale k heterogeneities based on the simulation results the effect of the dual hydrofacies structure on solute transport mainly depended on both the difference in the average k value between adjacent hydrofacies and the heterogeneity degree of each subhydrofacies as identified in existing studies the impact of the subhydrofacies scale heterogeneity on solute transport is controlled by the variance and spatial correlation of k in single hydrofacies aquifers tompson and gelhar 1990 fiori et al 2003 xia et al 2021 our results indicated that when the difference in the mean k value between adjacent hydrofacies was relatively small corresponding to the situations shown in fig 7a b d and e the increase in plume variance in the dual hydrofacies aquifers occurred faster than that in the single fine sand hydrofacies aquifer with a lower mean and variance in lnk blue solid line but slower than that in the single coarse sand hydrofacies aquifer with a higher mean and variance in lnk red solid line this suggests that anomalous transport in the dual hydrofacies aquifers was dominated by a high subhydrofacies heterogeneity in other words the layered structure did not enhance the integral aquifer heterogeneity however under a large discrepancy in the mean k value between adjacent hydrofacies the impact of the layered structure on solute transport became increasingly prominent as indicated by the results of scenarios 10 and 13 shown in fig 7c and f respectively the plume variance in the dual hydrofacies aquifers increased faster than that in both the single coarse sand scenarios 4 and 7 and single fine sand scenario 1 hydrofacies aquifers this result is consistent with the higher heterogeneity under scenarios 10 and 13 represented by a larger σ 1 2 value than that of the single hydrofacies aquifers this finding emphasizes that the regional scale heterogeneity became the dominant factor controlling solute transport to further explore the impact of the flow velocity variation induced by the multiscale heterogeneity of dual hydrofacies aquifers on solute transport distribution probability density functions pdfs of the eulerian velocity under all thirteen scenarios were calculated as shown in fig 8 a wide distribution and high spatial correlation of the velocity or hydraulic conductivity are commonly considered the main controlling factors of anomalous transport in porous media berkowitz et al 2006 dentz and bolster 2010 fogg and zhang 2016 as shown in fig 8 the width of the velocity pdf was affected by both the subhydrofacies and regional scale heterogeneities on the one hand due to the different degrees of subhydrofacies heterogeneity the pdf of the velocity under scenarios 1 4 σ 1 2 0 89 was narrower with a higher peak while the pdfs of the velocity under scenarios 5 7 σ 1 2 1 08 were much wider with lower peaks on the other hand the dual peak characteristics of the velocity pdf under the dual hydrofacies aquifer scenarios became increasingly apparent and the width of the velocity pdf increased with increasing discrepancy in the mean k value between adjacent hydrofacies i e fine and coarse sand fig 8c and 8f respectively this indicated that the velocity pdf of the dual hydrofacies aquifers was controlled by both regional and subhydrofacies scale heterogeneities additionally as shown in fig 8 when a relatively small k discrepancy existed between adjacent hydrofacies the velocity pdf of the dual hydrofacies aquifers was unimodal rather than bimodal this result indicates that for simplification and computational efficiency of conservative solute transport prediction in practice adjacent hydrofacies with similar mean k values could be integrated into a single hydrofacies 4 2 upscaling solute transport in dual hydrofacies aquifers this section proposes a new nonlocal transport model to quantify anomalous transport behavior under the impact of both subhydrofacies and regional scale heterogeneities the model results in turn could provide insight into solute transport in multiscale heterogeneous media the employed dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm was developed from the distributed order fractional derivative model yin et al 2020 yin et al 2022 the dhdm macroscopically conceptualizes the target aquifer into dual domains to capture anomalous transport induced by regional scale heterogeneity and invokes the time fractional derivative to account for solute retention induced by subhydrofacies scale heterogeneity therefore compared to classical nonlocal transport models the dhdm provides an instinctive capacity for the simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous multiscale aquifers the governing equations can be expressed as follows 6a c 1 t β 1 γ 1 c 1 t γ v 1 x d 1 2 x 2 w 1 x t 6b c 2 t β 2 γ 2 c 2 t γ v 2 x d 2 2 x 2 w 2 x t 7 w i x t ε θ i c 1 c 2 where c i ml 3 i 1 2 is the concentration in domain i t t is the time coordinate x l is the space coordinate v i lt 1 is the effective velocity in the i th domain v i is typically referred to as the seepage velocity of groundwater in the hydrogeology community which is equal to the darcy velocity divided by the effective porosity d i l 2 t 1 is the dispersion coefficient ε t 1 is the first order rate coefficient controlling mass transfer between different mobile domains θ i dimensionless is the water content proportion in domain i to the total water content β i t γ 1 is the fractional capacity coefficient in the i th domain and γ i dimensionless 0 γ 1 in this study is the time index in the i th domain representing the degree of time nonlocality for solute transport for β i 0 the dhdm can be reduced to the classical dual advection dispersion equation dade model that has been applied for decades by various hydrologists in the simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous media gerke and van genuchten 1993 chastanet and wood 2008 hu et al 2002 xie et al 2018 for v 1 v 2 and d 1 d 2 i e one domain only the dhdm can be reduced to the fractal mobile immobile fmim model proposed by schumer et al 2003 to simulate solute transport with a power law waiting time in the immobile phase the dhdm can be solved via either the finite difference method or the lagrangian particle tracking method yin et al 2022 the boundary and initial conditions of the dhdm 6 are the same as those used in the monte carlo simulations as described in section 2 3 to apply the 1 d dhdm 6 the spatial distribution of the solute mass in the aquifer was calculated and integrated to one dimension in the monte carlo simulations in addition the mass transfer rates ε was assumed to be identical within two domains to the valid ergodicity of the monte carlo simulations obvious mass retention is shown in fig 9 which should be induced by the low permeability zones in the aquifer additionally a larger discrepancy in k between adjacent hydrofacies resulted in a heavier leading edge of the plume therefore both super and subdiffusion processes were captured in the simulated mass distribution curves due to the impact of multiscale heterogeneity the simulation results of the dhdm 6 exhibited a suitable agreement with the mass distribution of the monte carlo simulations fig 9 which further confirmed the capability of the dhdm in capturing solute transport behavior affected by multiscale medium heterogeneity the best fit parameters of the dhdm 6 for scenarios 8 13 are listed in table 3 in the dhdm aquifers were conceptualized into one slow transport domain domain 1 with a low effective velocity and one fast transport domain domain 2 with a high velocity while the hydraulic properties within each domain were heterogeneous as indicated in table 3 a larger discrepancy in the average k value between adjacent hydrofacies yielded a higher v 2 value while v 1 remained relatively stable the impact of this k discrepancy on the dispersion coefficient was similar to that on the velocities due to the relatively low degree of medium heterogeneity at the subhydrofacies scale under all six scenarios with σ 1 2 1 1 small β i and large γ i values were obtained to capture the weak mass retention within each domain a larger k discrepancy between adjacent hydrofacies in the aquifer could also enhance the form of the preferential flow paths and reduce mass transfer between two mobile domains resulting in smaller θ 1 and ε values note that the θ i denotes the water content proportion in domain i to the total water content per bulk volume and thus the smaller θ 1 implies less water volume proportion in the slow domain fig 10 shows the velocity distribution of realization 1 under scenarios 11 13 in cross section y 10 m and reveals the impact of the k discrepancy combined with the subhydrofacies heterogeneity on the distribution of the preferential flow paths with increasing k discrepancy more preferential flow paths were present and concentrated in the underlying hydrofacies which further enhanced the connection between the high velocity zones the velocity distributions shown in fig 10 also confirmed that the solute transport domains fast or slow domains did not necessarily overlap with the hydrofacies structure but were significantly influenced by both the hydrofacies structure and subhydrofacies heterogeneity 4 3 dominant controlling mechanism of multiscale heterogeneity on anomalous transport btcs along a control plane 20 m downstream from the injection location were numerically sampled from the monte carlo simulations dade and fmim modeling results were also obtained for comparison to those of the dhdm and to further investigate the dominant mechanism of anomalous transport controlled by multiscale heterogeneity in alluvial aquifers at the different stages as discussed in section 4 2 solute transport under scenario 13 was typically controlled by both regional and subhydrofacies scale heterogeneities therefore scenario 13 was selected as a representative scenario and is examined in this section fig 11 a shows the mass distribution curves for scenario 13 at t 150 days after tracer injection and the best fit results using the dhdm dade and fmim models similar to the fitting results of the dhdm the bimodal transport behavior shown in fig 11a was also generally captured by the dade model this could be attributed to the similar conceptualization between the dade model and dhdm as both models assumed dual mobile domains to account for the impact of preferential flow paths on solute transport however the dade model could not capture solute retention induced by the immobile zones e g the late time tails of the btcs fig 11b in comparison although the fmim model exhibited a relatively poor performance in mass distribution curve simulation it captured the late time tails of the btcs well fig 11b the fact that the mobile immobile model the fmim model could not capture the bimodal transport process under scenario 13 indicated that solute transport was mainly dominated by the dual mobile domain structure at the early stage compared to the dade and fmim models the dhdm could capture both the mass distribution curve at the early stage and the btcs at all stages indicating a high capability in the simulation of anomalous transport in complex media the above comparison between the dhdm and the other two nonlocal transport models the dade and fmim models confirmed that solute transport in layered fluvial aquifers was affected by both preferential flow paths formed by regional scale heterogeneity and subhydrofacies heterogeneity the dual domain structure i e preferential flow paths and relatively slow flow paths on a larger scale dominated solute transport at early stages thus its impact on solute transport could be captured by dual domain models such as the dade model and dhdm at later times immobile zones at the subhydrofacies scale embedded in the heterogeneous aquifer became controlling factors of solute transport and resulted in heavy late time tails of the btcs however neither the dade nor the fmim model can fully capture the anomalous behaviors of solute transport in multiscale heterogeneous media because both of them only consider single scale heterogeneity in contrast the dhdm used in this study could reasonably predict the multiple anomalous behaviors of solute transport i e early arrival bi peak and late time tail simultaneously significantly expanding the capability of nonlocal transport models yin et al 2022 the abovementioned results also suggest that if possible both spatial concentration data i e mass distribution curves or snapshots and btcs should be used in model calibration therefore the dhdm should be considered to simulate solute transport in aquifers with multiscale heterogeneity 5 conclusions multiscale heterogeneity widely exists in natural aquifer systems yet its control on solute transport at different scales remains unclear this study provided the first systematic examination of the competitive impact of multiscale heterogeneity on solute transport based on field experimental results and numerical model analysis of alluvial aquifers both the btcs observed at various aquifer depths in the field tracer test and the monte carlo numerical simulation results for the tongzhou site exhibited the obvious impact of both regional scale hydrofacies structure and subhydrofacies heterogeneities on tracer transport further numerical analysis was conducted involving various scenarios with different aquifer structures regional scale heterogeneity and degrees of subhydrofacies heterogeneity and the results of upscaling models dade fmim model and dhdm were also compared the results indicated that the subhydrofacies heterogeneity played a dominant role in controlling solute transport in alluvial settings when the discrepancy in the mean k value between adjacent hydrofacies was relatively small in this case both the velocity distribution and solute plume in the considered dual hydrofacies aquifers remained unimodal the impact of regional scale medium heterogeneity on solute transport was more pronounced when the discrepancy in the mean k value between adjacent hydrofacies increased under this situation the velocity distribution exhibited obvious bimodal characteristics resulting in bi peak btcs at the early stage of solute transport under the comprehensive impact of multiscale heterogeneity the bimodal characteristics of solute transport at the early stage were dominated by the preferential flow paths attributed to regional scale heterogeneity while the heavy tails at the later stage were mainly controlled by immobile zones induced by subhydrofacies heterogeneity the dhdm model could capture both bimodal transport at the early stage and btc late time tails of the layered aquifer structure the insights obtained in this study could improve our understanding and the modeling capability of solute transport in alluvial aquifers with multiscale heterogeneity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
