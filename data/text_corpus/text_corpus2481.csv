12405,fabrication of nanoadsorbents with excellent adsorption capacity selectivity easy separation and superior reusability for removing organic dyes from polluted water remains challenging in this study novel expansive clay polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers clay pva nfs were fabricated as sheet membranes using an electrospinning technique the expansive clay with different ratios 5 10 and 15 wt was incorporated into pva nfs and comprehensively studied in terms of morphological and physicochemical characteristics sem images showed that incorporating the clay by electrospinning resulted in nanofibers with smaller diameters than the neat pva nfs the clay pva composite possesses high stability in aqueous media and a negatively charged surface at a ph higher than 4 1 the results showed that incorporating clay into pva nfs improved the adsorption capacity for removal of crystal violet dye cv from single and binary systems the incorporation of 5 clay into the pva nfs reduced diameter from 341 to 217 nm and increased its maximum adsorption capacity for the cv dye removal from 48 65 to 121 73 mg g the redlich peterson and pseudo first order models provided the best modeling of the experimental adsorption isotherm and adsorption kinetic data respectively the clay pva nfs exhibited outstanding reusability with a removal efficiency for cv dye of 99 34 after ten cycles of reuse with easily separated after adsorption in addition the clay pva nfs have good selectivity for separating cv dye from various binary dye systems the selectivity of the clay pva to separate the cv dye from the binary dye systems of cv methylene blue cv coomassie brilliant blue and cv hematoxylin was 88 57 90 92 and 97 24 respectively finally excellent adsorption performance good selectivity high reusability and ease of separation make clay pva nfs a promising adsorbent for cv dye removal from complex wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords natural clay polymeric nanofibers dyes removal binary system selectivity reusability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the uncontrolled and random discharge of industrially polluted water into water bodies such as lakes and rivers has posed an environmental challenge since the beginning of the industrial revolution colored pollutants such as dyes are one of the major contaminants in wastewater discharged by the textile printing tanning and cosmetics industries 1 2 the global production of dyes is about 800 000 tons annually and about 80 000 120 000 tons reach the environment directly as liquid waste or as a result of losses during the various operations of those industries 3 most dyes are complex organic molecules with various toxic and carcinogenic structures and reduce water quality even at low concentrations 4 the discharge of dye effluents into water bodies increases the chemical oxygen demand it also leads to a decrease in light transmittance and visibility which leads to an environmental imbalance due to the impact on aquatic organisms 5 6 thus different and effective advanced methods are required to remove these organic dyes before releasing them into the environment and bodies of water 7 9 adsorption is one of the most commonly used physical methods to remove dyes from aqueous effluent due to its low cost simplicity high efficiency and low energy consumption 10 11 the adsorption efficiency of adsorbents varies according to their surface area porosity and chemical structure as well as the nature of the target dye 12 many natural and synthetic materials including clay agricultural waste 13 15 carbon materials 16 17 magnetic biopolymers 18 19 hydrogels 20 and metal oxides have been studied and used as dyes adsorbents however many common adsorbents lack selectivity towards specific organic dyes and cannot separate individual dyes from their mixtures 21 22 due to the varying toxicity environmental effects and chemical stability of dyes the design of adsorbents with high selectivity and excellent efficiency is required to remove the most toxic dyes recent studies have reported that the design of the adsorbent material in the nanoscale increases its surface area and thus improves its efficiency in adsorbing different dyes from aqueous systems 23 the unique properties of nanoadsorbents such as their surface area porosity exposed facets and surface functional groups can generally improve the rate of mass transfer and render ample sites accessible for dye adsorption 24 25 however most of the nanomaterials are in the form of a fine powder with high dispersion in aqueous media and require a complex separation process and thus an increase in the cost of the adsorption process therefore designing the adsorbent materials in the nanoscale with easy separation and reuse is desirable to reduce treatment costs and facilitate reuse polymeric nanofibers are one dimensional nanostructures and are among the most important nanomaterials that have gained wide interest in recent years as an adsorbent material to remove pollutants because of their surface area to volume ratios and physical form as membrane sheets 26 27 polymer nanofibers are fabricated by dissolving spinnable polymers in a suitable solvent and spinning them using electrospinning electrospun nanofiber materials offer unique advantages when used as adsorbents such as their sheet like form which facilitates their separation after the adsorption process and reuse however the adsorption efficiency of some polymeric nanofibers is low compared to other nanomaterials due to the absence of effective surface functional groups and the hydrophobic nature of the surface 28 recently several methods have been reported to improve the adsorption efficiency of nanofibers the most important of which is surface modification 29 the surface modification can be accomplished in two methods first before electrospinning by blending spinnable polymers with other polymers or by incorporating inorganic materials and second post electrospinning by bonding between the functional groups on the surface of the nanofibers with organic molecules the incorporation of inorganic materials into polymer nanofibers is a simple and effective method for modifying the surface properties of polymer nanofibers and improving their adsorption sites 29 polymer nanofiber sheets incorporating accessible adsorptive materials have significant advantages over pristine polymer nanofibers 30 the additive materials must be well dispersed in the polymer solution and able to segregate to the surface of nanofibers to be properly incorporated 31 furthermore these incorporated materials must be non toxic low cost readily available and not require chemical pretreatment and have efficient adsorption sites 32 the most common materials used to incorporate nanofiber mats are carbon nanomaterials 33 metal organic frameworks 34 metal oxides 35 and silica 36 however incorporating of these materials into nanofibers still faced challenges such as poor dispersion and aggregation in the spinnable polymer solution which hinders the electrospinning process to improve nanofiber adsorption efficiency and reduce production costs inexpensive readily available non toxic and dispersible materials are required without pretreatment or surfactant addition clays are natural materials of hydrous aluminum magnesium and iron silicates with prominent cationic and anionic ions on their surface the morphology of clay is described by the presence of two dimensional sheets octahedral al2o3 and tetrahedral sio4 and its particle size is 2 Î¼m 37 swelling clay is clay soil prone to large volume changes which has advantages over many other materials in terms of its non toxic nature low cost abundant availability and excellent adsorption properties 38 39 several recent studies have shown that clays are an effective adsorbent for many organic dyes and their adsorption capacity depends on the type of clay its composition the nature of the surface charge and surface area 40 41 the effect of expansive clay on the adsorption characteristics selectivity and reusability of pva nanofibers for cationic dye removal from single and binary dye mixtures has not previously been studied and warrants additional exploration in this study we demonstrate the incorporation of natural expansive clay in polymeric nanofiber mats by electrospinning technique without any surfactants and crosslinking agents for enhancing their adsorption capacity and selectivity towards removing organic dyes in single and binary dye mixtures its smaller size surface ions swelling and dispersibility in aqueous solutions without surfactant makes expansive clay very special as an incorporated material to improve the adsorption properties of nanofibers prepared from water soluble polymers a series of polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers pva nfs were fabricated with different ratios of expansive clay and characterized by several techniques the effects of expansive clay ratio ph contact time dye concentration and temperature on adsorption were investigated isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption process of cv dye by pva nfs and clay pva nfs the adsorption selectivity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs for removing cv dye from three binary dye mixtures was also studied furthermore the reusability of the clay pva nfs was investigated the results indicated that incorporating the natural clay enhances the adsorption capacity and selectivity of the nanofibers in the removal of the cv dye and can be reused for ten consecutive cycles without appreciable loss of removal efficiency 2 materials methods 2 1 materials the expansive natural clay was collected from alqatif area which is a coastal oasis region located in the eastern province of saudi arabia 26 56 0 n 50 1 0 e this type of clay is classified within highly expansive soils in nature due to possessing a unique property of volume change potential when subjected to varying moisture conditions 42 poly vinyl alcohol pva mw 72 000 85 89 hydrolyzed was purchased from panreac applichem germany crystal violet cv methylene blue mb hematoxylin htx hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from merck darmstadt germany coomassie brilliant blue 250 r cbb was obtained from fluka ag chemische fabrik buchs switzerland fig s1 shows the chemical structure of mb cv cbb and htx dyes 2 2 fabrication of clay pva nfs a certain amount of expansive clay was dispersed in 20 ml of distilled water for 2 h by a sonication probe to exfoliate the nanolayers 2 0 g of pva was then added to the clay suspension and stirred at 50 c until dissolved and a homogeneous solution formed the clay pva solution was loaded into a 20 ml syringe and electrospun to nanofibers using an electrospinning setup the electrospinning process was done through applied 17 kv of voltage 15 cm distance between tip and collector tcd 0 6 ml h flow rate of solution and 25 33 humidity after the electrospinning process the formed nanofiber sheet was peeled off from the surface of the collector and dried in vacuum oven overnight at 70 c to eliminate the residual solvent finally it was thermally crosslinked at 150 c under vacuum for 24 h to stabilize the nanofiber sheet in aqueous media the prepared samples are referred to as pva nfs clay pva nfs 5 clay pva nfs 10 and clay pva nfs 15 throughout the text based on the clay to pva weight ratio 0 5 10 and 15 respectively 2 3 characterization of expansive clay pva nfs and clay pva nfs composites the expansive clay and prepared nanofibers samples were characterized using various techniques scanning electron microscopy sem jeol japan was used to examine the morphology of clay pva nfs and clay pva nfs average diameters size distribution of nanofiber samples were calculated by imagej software the elemental composition of expansive clay was determined by energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir thermo fisher scientific usa was used to investigate the functional groups of expansive clay and nanofiber samples the thermal stability of expansive clay pva nfs and clay pva nfs was studied by thermogravimetric analysis tga q500 usa the surface area and porosity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs 5 were estimated by n2 physisorption adsorption desorption isotherms using a micromeritics asap 2020 analyzer the surface charge of clay was determined by measuring the point of zero charges phpzc using the ph drift method as follows series of kcl solutions were prepared in tubes with a fixed concentration of 0 1 m and a volume of 10 ml with different ph between 2 and 11 then 20 mg of the expansive clay was added to each solution ph and shaking at 120 rpm and 25 c in a thermostat water bath with a shaker after 4 0 h of equilibration the final ph phf of the solution was measured by using a ph meter 3540 jenway uk and plotted Î´ph versus initial ph phi values 2 4 adsorption study initially stock solutions were prepared at a concentration of 1000 mg l for each dye followed by serial dilution at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 mg l a uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer 35 uk was used to measure the absorbance of standard solutions of crystal violet dye cv methylene blue dye mb coomassie brilliant blue dye cbb and hematoxylin dye htx at Î» max 589 664 555 and 375 nm respectively to generate the calibration curve a preliminary survey was carried out to investigate the effect of expansive clay ratio and type of dyes on adsorption efficiency by soaking 10 mg of each prepared nanofiber mats in 10 ml of dye solution in neutral ph and shaking at 120 rpm and 25 c for 24 h in a thermostat water bath with a shaker the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity was investigated at ph values of 3 6 4 6 7 and 10 4 by adjusting the ph with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid and the cv dye concentration was 100 mg l the concentration effect was investigated using cv dye concentrations ranging from 25 to 400 mg l at ph 10 4 and 10 mg of nanofiber sheet at various temperatures and thermodynamic parameters also were evaluated to determine the equilibration time 100 mg of nanofiber sheet was immersed in 100 ml of cv dye solution at ph 10 4 for 5 h in a thermostatic shaker at 25 c because the adsorbent was a sheet form and the dye solutions were free of any suspended residue no additional separation procedures such as filtration or centrifugation were required in all measurements to remove the adsorbent in the binary system and selectivity study three mixed solutions of cv mb cv htx and cv cbb were prepared by mixing an equal volume of cv with other dyes and the final concentration of each dye in the mixture was 20 mg l the residual dye concentration in the mixture was measured after adsorption control adsorption experiments with individual dye solutions were also carried out under the same conditions all binary system measurements were carried out at a neutral ph and a temperature of 25 c for a reuse study 10 mg of nanofiber sheet was immersed in 10 ml of cv dye solution with a concentration of 40 mg l and ph 10 4 then kept in a shaker for 3 0 h finally the nanofiber sheet was taken out from the solution with tweezers and the residual dye concentration was measured to desorbing cv dye the used nanofiber was immersed in 10 ml of a solution consisting of hcl 0 2 m acetone at a ratio of 75 25 in shaker for 2 0 h the nanofiber sheet was taken and washed with distilled water dilute solution of naoh 0 01 m and then washed again by distilled water the equations for the statistical analysis adsorption capacity and separation efficiency are summarized in the supplementary material sections 1 1 and 1 2 3 result discussion 3 1 characterization of expansive clay pva nfs and clay pva nfs sem image of expansive clay shows agglomerated particles containing irregularly stacked flat sheets or flakes as shown in fig 1a b the flakes appear in different shapes and sizes under the microscope with some edges more prominent than others the most important feature is the presence of small and short bristle fibers connecting the edges of the flakes the elemental composition of the expansive clay was examined using the edx analysis as displayed in fig 1c edx analysis showed that the expansive clay contained the following elements oxygen silicon aluminum iron magnesium potassium calcium titanium sodium sulfur and chlorine these elements are also found in pva nfs after expansive clay incorporation and the weight ratio of the main elements e g si and al increases with the increase in the ratio of incorporated clay into the nanofiber mats as shown in fig s2 the xrd technique was utilized to detect the main minerals contained in the expansive clay and their interaction with the pva nfs the xrd spectra of expansive clay shows multi peaks with varied intensities at different 2Î¸ values showing that it contains more than one mineral fig 1d the characteristic peaks at 20 85 26 54 42 59 50 19 and 67 84Î¿ indicates quartz mineral 43 44 furthermore the 2Î¸ peaks at 19 82 34 7 45 5 and 61 57Î¿ corresponding to the structure of the montmorillonite mineral 45 the characteristic peaks for kaolinite appeared at 12 22 and 55 1Î¿ 46 the peaks that appeared at 8 30 and 13 66Î¿ are due to the palygorskite mineral 47 also clear pecks that appeared at 30 90 41 1 and 59 97Î¿ are attributed to the dolomite mineral 48 the apparent weak peaks at 11 49 and 55Î¿ are also attributed to kaolinite mineral based on the xrd results the expansive clay contains quartz montmorillonite dolomite palygorskite and kaolinite minerals fig s3 shows the xrd spectra of the pva nfs before and after incorporation of the clay into nanofiber mats for pure pv nfs has three intense peaks at 19 49 5 and 73Î¿ after incorporating the clay the peaks at 49 5 and 73Î¿ disappeared and the intensity of the peak at 19Î¿ decreased moreover no clay specific peaks appeared indicating that the clay particles were inserted between the polymer chains rather than on their surface fig 2 shows a typical sem image and diameter size distribution of neat pva nfs and pva nfs incorporating different proportions of clay after thermal crosslinking it can be seen that neat pva nfs exhibited uniform and distinct nanofibers with an average diameter of about 340 81 74 nm the nanofibers formed quasi oblate tubes with mostly fused bonds at the junction points due to thermal crosslinking before thermal crosslinking the morphology of pva nfs is cylindrical smooth free of flattening and fused contact points are less as shown in fig s4 the incorporation of 5 clay into the pva nfs reduced the nanofiber diameter to 216 88 41 nm and eliminated flatness in tubes and the appearance of nanoparticles on the surface with keeping fused bonds at junction points this could be attributable to the fact that adding clay into the electrospinning solution reduces the spinning jet surface tension and increases solution conductivity results in creating the nanofibers with smaller diameters 49 however incorporating 10 and 15 of clay increased the diameters of the nanofibers with appear beads but they are still smaller than the diameters of the neat pva nfs ftir analysis was used to study the nature of functional groups in clay pva nfs and clay pva nfs as shown in fig 3a the clay spectrum shows distinct bands at 1638 54 1442 61 983 48 and 797 71 cm 1 also the clay spectrum shows several weak absorption bands in the range between 3400 and 3650 cm 1 which are attributed to hydroxyl linkage the band at 1638 54 cm 1 was attributed to water absorption between the clay layers which was also confirmed by the thermogravimetric analysis tga results the broad band observed at 1442 61 cm 1 is due to vibrational modes of tetrahedral silicate or the presence of calcite 50 51 the strong band at 980 cm 1 is the highest intensity in the spectrum due to the bending of siloxane si o si the weak bands that appear between 600 and 900 cm 1 range are attributed to stretch vibration of the inner surface of the oh group and the bending of si o for pva nfs it showed characteristic absorption bands at 3316 85 2935 27 2914 46 1729 24 1429 33 1372 41 1324 71 1245 06 1138 22 1091 53 1026 1 and 845 36 cm 1 absorption bands at high frequency at 3316 85 2935 27 and 2914 46 cm 1 are due to o h stretching asymmetric and symmetric stretching of ch2 respectively because the pva used is partially hydrolyzed it exhibits an absorption characteristic band of a carbonyl group for the acetate at 1729 24 cm 1 the bands located between 1429 and 1245 cm 1 are attributed to ch2 bending in plane bending vibration of ch and rocking with ch wagging the remaining absorption bands at 1138 22 1091 53 1026 1 cm 1 are due to shoulder stretching of c o stretching of co and bending of oh respectively after incorporating clay into the pva nfs all of the pva bands appeared with a distinct decrease in intensity due to the interaction between functional groups of clay and pva chains in contrast the band intensity at 1026 cm 1 in spectra of clay pva nfs was higher than of pva nfs this confirms that the pva chains are more rigid and more crystallized by the incorporation of clay tga dtg analysis was used to study the moisture content of the clay its thermal stability as well as its effect on the thermal stability of the pva nfs as shown in fig 3b it was observed that the weight ratio of the clay versus the temperature decreases at the low temperature range between 30 and 200 c the weight loss percentage at 200 c for clay was 4 which is attributed to the water physically bound to the clay the clay also loses 4 of its weight in the thermal range of 320 to 700 c which may be due to the degradation of organic impurities and dehydroxylation of clay 52 thermal decomposition of thermal treated pva nfs at 150 c occurs in one main step while non heat treated pva nfs take more than one step degradation confirming the successful crosslinking of polymer chains by heat treatment as shown in fig s5 the incorporation of clay into the pva nfs led to a decrease in thermal stability as the weight loss of clay pva nfs began at 190 c compared to the pure pva nfs whose thermal stability was observed up to 250 c however at a temperature higher than 300 c it was observed that the weight loss of clay pva nfs is less than pva nfs indicating that chemical cross linking occurs between the clay and the pva chains at high temperatures the difference in residual weight ratio at 800 c for pva nfs and clay pva nfs is 16 which is greater than the theoretical weight ratio of the clay 5 in nanofibers indicating that the clay slows the thermal decomposition of the pva at high temperatures and improves the residual carbon yield the surface nature of materials plays a crucial role in their adsorption properties the point of zero charges pzc measurement by the drift method is reliable for studying the surface nature of different materials phpzc is the ph value at which the net surface charge of a materials external and internal is equal to zero it is well known that the surface of a material is positively charged when the ph of the solution is lower than the phpzc value of the surface and negatively charged when the ph of the solution is higher than the phpzc value fig 3c shows the plot of the initial ph phi versus the difference between the initial and final ph ph after adding a certain amount of clay or nanofibers to the kcl salt solution 0 1 m the observed phpzc for clay pva nfs and clay pva were 9 44 3 70 and 4 10 respectively based on these values the surface of the pva nfs and clay pva nfs is expected to have a negatively charged surface over a wide ph range ph 4 1 compared to clay ph 9 44 it was also observed that the addition of clay had a minor effect on the phpzc value of the nanofibers indicating that functional groups in the pva chain control the surface nature charge to study the effect of clay on the interaction between chains of pva nfs and their stability in aqueous media the swelling was studied before and after the incorporation of different proportions of clay into their structure fig 3d shows that the incorporation of 5 of the clay reduced the swelling capacity from 13 23 to 7 62 g g and also improved the stability of the pva nfs in the aqueous media as the weight loss decreased from 28 48 to 0 64 the significant reduction in swelling confirms the interaction between the clay and the pva chains in which the clay acts as a physical cross linking agent limiting water penetration and reduce the swelling n2 adsorption desorption isotherm was used to measure the specific surface area of the pva nfs before and after the incorporation of clay 5 w w as shown in fig s6a the specific surface area of pva nfs 4 98 m2 g slightly decreases after being incorporated with clay 4 31 m2 g possibly due to the clay causing plugged pores fig s6b displays that pva nfs and clay pva nfs have micro meso porous structures with average pore width is 7 8 and 7 2 nm 3 2 adsorption study many factors influence the adsorption process including adsorbent properties e g surface area porosity surface nature functional groups dye type e g cationic anionic neutral and adsorption conditions e g ph initial concentration contact time and temperature 3 2 1 effect of incorporated clay the cv dye was used as a model for cationic dyes to study the effect of clay ratio on the adsorption capacity of pva nfs at neutral ph initial dye concentration of 100 mg l and the temperature at 25 c fig 4a shows that incorporating 5 expansive clay enhances the adsorption capacity of pva nfs by four times however the incorporation of expansive clay at a ratio higher than 5 resulted in lower adsorption capacity this result is due to the increasing diameters and agglomeration of clay particles in the pores of pva nf which leads to a reduction in pores and impedes dye penetration into the porous structure as confirmed by the sem images and bet analysis moreover the substantial increase in clay ratio in the nanofibrous mats would decrease the surface area to mass ratio therefore clay pva nfs 5 sample was used to perform all adsorption experiments and compared with a pva nfs sample 3 2 2 effect of dye type fig 4b presents the adsorption capacity of clay pva nfs and pva nfs towards removing various dyes at the initial dye concentration of 200 mg l at 25 c for 24 h crystal violet cv and methylene blue mb dyes were used as cationic dye models hematoxylin htx dye as a neutral dye model and coomassie brilliant blue r 250 cbb dye as an anionic dye model it is noted that the adsorption capacity of clay pva is higher than the adsorption capacity of pva nfs for various dye removal these results confirm that the incorporation of 5 clay into the pva nfs enhances the adsorption sites on their surface also expansive clay incorporation improves pva nfs selectivity towards dyes with a functional group or specific charge characteristic according to the results shown in fig 4b the adsorption capacity of clay pva nf to remove cationic dyes varies significantly with cationic dyes having a higher adsorption capacity than neutral and anionic dyes the adsorption capacities of clay pva nfs to remove cv mb htx and cbb dyes were 75 41 37 61 6 71 and 27 56 mg g respectively it was observed that the expansive clay incorporation in the nanofiber mats did not affect the adsorption of the anionic cbb dye which indicates that the expansive clay enhances the negative surface of the nanofibers although both the cv and mb dyes have a positive charge there is a significant difference in adsorption capacity indicating that other factors in addition to electrostatic interaction play a crucial role in the adsorption process 3 2 3 effect of ph the ph of the adsorption medium is one of the main factors that play a pivotal role in the adsorption process as it affects the adsorbent and adsorbate properties the effect of ph on cv dye adsorption by pva nfs and clay pva nfs was investigated as displayed in fig 4c partially hydrolyzed pva has an abundance of free oh and o co ch3 groups which could plays the main role in the adsorption of cationic cv dye 53 54 the acetate groups are ionized at a lower ph than the hydroxyl groups and it was ionized at a ph 8 0 55 therefore increasing the ph of the dye solution causes the acetate groups to ionize which increases the negatively charged surface groups as a result the interaction forces between the cationic cv dye and pva nfs also increase the obtained results indicate that the adsorption capacity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs in a basic medium is higher than that of a neutral or acidic medium in alkaline media the number of ionized acetate groups with a negative charge increases and thus the adsorption capacity of the pva nfs and clay pva nfs increases in the case of clay pva nfs increasing the ph promotes higher adsorption sites than those in pristine pva nfs due to the clay surface becoming negatively charged at a ph higher than 9 42 as confirmed by the phpzc analysis 3 2 4 effect of initial dye concentration the dye s initial concentration depends on the direct relationship between the dye concentration and the available adsorption sites on the surface of an adsorbent fig 4d presents the effect of the initial cv dye concentration on the adsorption capacity of the pva nfs and clay pva nfs in general the adsorption capacity increases with increasing initial dye concentration which may be due to the mass driving force at higher initial dye concentration however this increase in the adsorption capacity reaches a steady state when the adsorption process reaches equilibrium and all adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface are occupied the adsorption capacity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs increases with increasing initial cv dye concentration and approaches a steady state at 75 and 300 mg l respectively as shown in fig 4e the photographs in fig s7 show that the cv dye solutions in the concentration range of 25 75 mg l have become colorless which indicates that the dye molecules have completely adsorbed on the clay pva nfs surface at lower concentrations the adsorption capacity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs increased sharply in the initial dye concentration range of 25 75 mg l and 25 100 mg l respectively since the number of unoccupied adsorption sites in the range of 100 300 mg l a gradual increase in the adsorption capacity was observed on the surface of the clay pva nfs which may be attributed to the lower swelling rate after clay incorporation and makes the penetration of dye molecules slower to reach the unoccupied sites 3 2 5 effect of contact time to determine the required time to reach the equilibrium state the contact time effect was studied as shown in fig 4e the adsorption capacity of the cv dye on the surface of pva nfs and clay pva nfs increased very quickly from 0 to 15 min and 0 to 60 min respectively due to the presence of unoccupied adsorption sites it was observed from the obtained results that the incorporation of clay increases the required time to reach the state of equilibrium this result is consistent with the results of the swelling study that indicate the incorporation of clay in nanofiber mats significantly reduces swelling capacity which slows down the rate of dye penetration to reach all adsorption sites 3 2 6 effect of temperature temperature is an important factor to consider when studying the behavior of the adsorption mechanism therefore the cv dye adsorption was studied at different temperatures ranging from 25 to 35 c with a constant initial dye concentration of 100 mg l in ph 10 4 the adsorption capacity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs showed a slight decrease when the temperature was increased from 25 to 35 c fig 4f this result indicated that the cv dye molecules tend to escape from the nanofiber mats to the bulk phase with an increased temperature 3 3 adsorption isotherm study the equilibrium studies for cv dye adsorption onto pva nfs and clay pva nfs were carried out between 25 and 35 c as displayed in figs 5a and 6a five isotherm models were used to analyze the adsorption behavior including langmuir 56 freundlich 57 dubinin radushkevich d r 58 redlich peterson r p 59 and tempkin 60 models and fitting results displayed in fig 5b f and fig 6b f all applied model equations are summarized in the supplementary materials section 1 3 and the model constants and correlation coefficients are reported in table 1 based on the r2 and Ï2 values it can be concluded that the r p isotherm model was the best model for fitting the experimental data and describing the cv dye adsorption behavior on pva nfs and clay pva nfs from 25 to 35 c because the r2 values were closest to the unit and the Ï2 values were the lowest among all results by analogy between r p and langmuir models it is clear that the adsorption affinity Î² value for all measurements approaches unity when the isotherm data best fit the langmuir model thus the langmuir model is a special case of the r p model when the constant Î² close to unity considering the langmuir fitted model at 25 c the maximum adsorption capacities qmax of the pva nfs and clay pva nfs were 48 65 and 121 73 mg g respectively it also was found that an increase in temperature resulted in lower qmax values table 1 shows the calculated separation factor rl values for the adsorption of cv dye onto pva nfs and clay pva nfs at various temperatures the rl values ranged between 0 and 1 0 and dropped with increasing temperature demonstrating that adsorption was highly favorable at low adsorption temperatures the r2 and Ï2 values of the d r model are also close to those of the langmuir model so they can be used to calculate the mean adsorption energy e the e values for cv dye adsorption by pva nfs and clay pva nfs were 8 kj mol confirming the physical nature of the adsorption process 3 4 kinetics study the kinetic studies of pva nfs and clay pva nfs towards cv dye were performed to determine the required time to reach the equilibrium state and comprehend the adsorption process the pseudo first order model pfo 61 pseudo second order model pso 62 and elovich model 63 were used to simulate the adsorption kinetics and evaluate the adsorption rate all applied kinetics model equations and details of their parameters are summarized in the supplementary materials section 1 4 the fitting results of the three models are exhibited in fig 7a b it is clear that the kinetic fitting curve produced by the elovich model outperforms those produced by the pfo and pso models for the adsorption of cv dye onto pva nfs also the r2 and Ï2 values of the elovich model confirmed this as they were 0 9918 and 4 31 respectively as displayed in table 2 in contrast the most representative cv dye adsorption kinetic curve model on clay pva nfs was pfo depending on the highest value of r2 0 9909 and the lowest value of Ï2 16 24 interestingly the pso model is non fitting the adsorption curve of clay pva nfs which indicates that it is insufficient for describing the cv dye adsorption behavior the calculated value of qt 70 91 mg g from the pso model was very close to the experimental value of qt exp 71 32 mg g which indicates that pso model is also suitable for describing the adsorption process on the surface of the pva nfs the qt value for dye adsorption on clay pva nfs derived from the pfo model was 116 97 mg g the cv dye adsorption rate on pva nfs and clay pva nfs was 0 0024 g mg 1 min 1 and 0 0269 min 1 according to the results of the pso and pfo models respectively the difference in the adsorption rate and kinetic behavior on the pva nfs and clay pva surface is due to the different number and nature of the adsorption sites after incorporating clay in nanofibers for a deeper understanding of the adsorption kinetic mechanism of cv dye on the pva nfs and clay pva nfs an intraparticle diffusion model was used fig 7c shows linearized plots of qt vs t0 5 based on the intraparticle diffusion model the single linear plot of the slope for the pva nfs sample was obtained revealing that the adsorption of cv dye occurred in a single step and on the external surface of nanofibers but the adsorption behavior on clay pva nfs produced two linear slope plots revealing that cv dye adsorption occurred in two steps the first step s adsorption rate was quick which can be attributed to the diffusion of cv dye molecules from the solution media to the external surface of the clay pva nfs in contrast the second step was slow due to the effect of the density and pores sizes based on the sem images the nanofibers are randomly arranged and multi layered with a porous structure in the first step the interaction between the cv dye molecules with the surface of the nanofibers occurs quickly while in the second step the cv dye molecules are required to diffuse through the internal layers and the pores therefore the interaction between the dye and the surface of the pores takes a longer time in the second step furthermore in the qt vs t0 5 plot the regression does not pass through the origin showing that the intraparticle diffusion process is not the only rate limiting step 64 3 5 thermodynamic studies thermodynamic studies play a pivotal role in determining the nature of the adsorption process e g physical or chemical the following equations can be used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics 1 g rtln k eq 2 ln k c s r h rt the adsorption gibbs free energy Î´g can be calculated directly from eq 1 the slope and intercept of a plot of lnkeq against 1 t fig 7d were used to calculate the adsorption enthalpy h and adsorption entropy s the langmuir constant kl was used as the equilibrium constant to calculate thermodynamic parameters due to the adsorption equilibrium constant keq must be dimensionless the keq value was calculated by multiplying the kl value by the molecular weight of cv dye mwt 407 97 g mol 1000 and then 55 5 moles number of pure water per liter table 3 displays the thermodynamic parameters for cv dye adsorption on pva nfs and clay pva nfs g values were negative and increased with increasing temperatures indicating that the adsorption of cv dye on both pva nfs and clay pva nfs is spontaneous and favorable with low required activation energy at a specific temperature this finding agreed well with the conclusion drawn from the mean adsorption energy e separation factor r analysis the adsorption of cv dye onto pva nfs and clay pva nfs was an exothermic process as evidenced by the positive h value and increase of equilibrium constant with increasing temperatures the clay pva nfs 15 21 kj mol had a higher h magnitude than the pva nfs 13 06 kj mol indicating a higher affinity for cv dye in solution the positive value of Î´s further suggested that the increasing degree of freedom of the cv ions in the solution and adsorption process was entropy governed rather than enthalpy governed 65 3 6 selectivity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs adsorbent selectivity is defined as removing a specific pollutant from a medium containing more than one pollutants differ in toxicity and environmental impact so designing an adsorbent with high selectivity is required in water treatment to target the most toxic pollutants surface modification is one of the most important methods for improving adsorbent selectivity to remove the target pollutants the selective adsorption property of pva nfs and clay pva nfs of cv was investigated using three dye mixtures containing cv mb cv htx and cv cbb as shown in fig 8 it was noted that using pva nfs did not affect the color of the dye mixtures made up of cv mb cv htx and cv cbb the colors of the dye mixtures cv mb cv htx and cv cbb before and after adsorption with clay pva nfs ranged from dark blue to light blue violet to pale yellow and blue to light violet respectively the color change when using clay pva nfs is attributed to its selectivity towards removing the cv dye from the mixtures of cv mb cv cbb and cv htx the separation efficiency of clay pva nfs for the removal of cv dye from the dye mixtures was higher than the separation efficiency of pva nfs specifically the separation efficiency of cv dye increased from 17 26 67 43 and 64 86 for pva nfs fig 9a c to 88 57 90 92 and 97 24 for clay pva nfs fig 9d f from cv mb cv cbb and cv htx mixtures respectively the low selectivity adsorption of cv dye from the cv mb mixture is attributed to the adsorption competition between the cv and mb since both have a positive charge on the other hand the selectivity of the clay pva nfs towards the adsorption of the cv dye from the cv htx mixture was the highest this result confirms that the negative charge on the surface of clay pva nfs electrostatically interacted with the cationic cv molecules while the neutral htx remained in the solution the separation efficiency of pva nfs to remove dyes from the mixed dye system was lower than that of the single dye system fig 9a c which could be attributed to the limited adsorption sites and competition between dyes on adsorption in contrast the separation efficiency of clay pva nfs for the removal of cbb and htx from the dye mixture was higher than that of the single dye solution as shown in fig 9d f this is because part of the charge of the cv dye partially neutralizes the charge of the clay which reduces the repulsion between the surface of clay pva nfs and the cbb dye and also enhances hydrogen bonding with the htx dye clay pva nfs removed 97 64 of cv 89 51 of mb 25 57 of cbb and 4 96 of htx from their respective single dye solution while they adsorbed 88 57 of cv 67 84 of mb 55 96 of cbb and 11 25 of htx from their mixed dye mixture based on the nature of the surface and functional groups electrostatic interaction ion exchange and hydrogen bonding are the three driving forces controlling dye adsorption by clay pva nfs 3 7 reusability of clay pva nfs the reusability of adsorbents is one of the most important factors determining their cost and is a good indicator of understanding the adsorption mechanisms the reusability of clay pva nfs to remove cv dye was studied for ten consecutive cycles as displayed in fig 10a the cv dye removal efficiency after ten cycles of reuse of clay pva nfs was 99 34 the removal efficiency decreased by only 0 66 indicating that the clay pva nfs performed excellently in reuse the considerable recyclability of clay pva nfs indicated its long term potential for decolorizing polluted water polluted with cv dye also the possibility of reuse for ten consecutive cycles suggests that the cv dye adsorption on the surface of clay pva nfs is physical 3 8 proposed mechanism in general the adsorption mechanism of organic dyes on the surface of various materials is a complex mechanism controlled by multiple factors such as the surface nature of the adsorbent the structure of the dye and the medium of the adsorption process based on these factors the adsorption of the dye on the adsorbent surface is controlled by different forces such as electrostatic attraction formation of hydrogen bonds n Ï interaction pore filling Ï Ï interaction or ion exchange isothermal kinetic thermodynamic reuse and spectroscopy studies are the most important studies for understanding the adsorption mechanism the hÎ¿ value 15 kj mol and mean energy values 2 43 2 54 kj mol calculated from the d r model confirm that the cv dye adsorption process on the clay pva nfs surface is a physical process the study of the reuse of clay pva nfs for ten consecutive cycles without loss in adsorption efficiency indicates that the adsorption process is reversible it was also noted that intraparticle diffusion modeling revealed a contribution of film diffusion to the control of adsorption kinetics however intraparticle diffusion was not the dominant mechanism the electrostatic attraction plays an essential role in the adsorption mechanism which was also confirmed by studying the effect of ph and low phpzc value 4 1 however the results demonstrated that clay pva nfs could adsorb the cv dye at ph levels lower than 4 1 indicating the presence of other forces that contribute to the adsorption process such as n Ï interaction and hydrogen bonding the ftir spectrum of clay pva nfs after cv dye adsorption fig s8 proved that the absorption bands at 1138 22 and 1091 5 cm 1 decrease significantly in intensity and a slight shift of band at 1027 to1025 cm 1 which confirms the presence of n Ï interaction also after the adsorption of the cv dye the intensity of the absorption bands between 3300 and 3500 cm 1 decreased which indicates the presence of hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of the clay pva nfs and the nitrogen atom of the cv dye 66 according to the obtained results and based on the cv dye structure and surface properties of the clay pva nfs it can be assumed that the adsorption mechanism involves the following steps the cv dye adsorption on the surface of clay pva nfs is a physical and reversible process the cv dye adsorbs in two steps first it migrates from the bulk solution to the surface and second it diffuses through the boundary layer to the pores of the clay pva nfs electrostatic attraction plays an important role in the adsorption process and hydrogen bonding and n Ï interaction contribute as shown in fig 10b 3 9 comparison of the clay pva nfs with reported adsorbents a comparison of the adsorption capacity of the clay pva nfs to remove the cv dye with other adsorbents based on nanofiber or clay composites is summarized in table 4 the prepared clay pva nfs prepared by incorporating 5 clay into the nanofiber mats have a higher adsorption capacity than reported adsorbents 67 75 in addition the prepared clay pva nf was more practical to use as it could be easily removed after the adsorption process and reused the study also includes a test of the selectivity of clay pva nfs towards removing the cv dye from three different mixtures containing cationic neutral and anionic dye which was missing from the studies listed in table 4 the results showed a high selectivity of the clay pva nfs towards the cv dye adsorption from the three mixtures reaching 90 moreover the fabricated nanoadsorbent clay pva nfs showed high reusability for ten consecutive cycles without significant loss in adsorption efficiency making it superior to many adsorbents nanofibers provide a large surface area while clay provides the binding sites for adsorbate therefore the incorporation of clay into the nanofiber mats improves adsorption efficiency mechanical properties and stability in aqueous media enhancing their reuse and easy separation after adsorption 4 conclusion in this work we have successfully fabricated highly selective and superior reusable nanoadsorbent by incorporating expansive clay into pva nfs for the adsorption and separation of cv dye from single and binary dye systems a series of expansive clay incorporated pva nfs were fabricated by electrospinning technique followed by thermal crosslinking without surfactants or chemical crosslinking agents the optimum ratio of expensive clay to produce pva nfs with the lowest diameters and the highest adsorption capacity was 5 w w adsorption experiments showed that increasing the ph cv dye concentration and contact time was accompanied by an increase in the adsorption capacity while the effect of the temperature was negative the maximum adsorption capacity of the pva nfs 5 clays was 121 73 mg g compared to 48 65 mg g for the neat pva nfs the prepared clay pva nfs have a higher adsorption capacity than reported adsorbents in the single system five isotherm models and three kinetic models were used to analyze the adsorption behavior of the cv dye on clay pva nfs and the r p isotherm model and pfo kinetic model were the best model for fitting the experimental data respectively according to the results of the thermodynamic studies the adsorption of the cv dye is spontaneous and favorable on the surface of the clay pva nfs in the binary dyes system the separation efficiency of clay pva nfs for removal of cv dye from the dye mixtures were higher than separation efficiency of pure pva nfs specifically the separation efficiency of cv dye increased from 17 26 67 43 and 64 86 for pva nfs to 88 57 90 92 and 97 24 for clay pva nfs from cv mb cv cbb and cv htx mixtures respectively the effects of ph ftir phpzc measurement and selectivity revealed that electrostatic attraction was the most important contribution to cationic dye adsorption followed by hydrogen bonding and n Ï interaction the results showed a superior reusable of the clay pva nfs and can be used for ten consecutive cycles without losing the adsorption efficiency 99 34 after the 10th cycle excellent adsorption capacity high selectivity superior reusability and easy handling separation of clay pva nfs after the adsorption process are the main features of this work which is a new window for designing adsorbents and use in practical

12405,fabrication of nanoadsorbents with excellent adsorption capacity selectivity easy separation and superior reusability for removing organic dyes from polluted water remains challenging in this study novel expansive clay polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers clay pva nfs were fabricated as sheet membranes using an electrospinning technique the expansive clay with different ratios 5 10 and 15 wt was incorporated into pva nfs and comprehensively studied in terms of morphological and physicochemical characteristics sem images showed that incorporating the clay by electrospinning resulted in nanofibers with smaller diameters than the neat pva nfs the clay pva composite possesses high stability in aqueous media and a negatively charged surface at a ph higher than 4 1 the results showed that incorporating clay into pva nfs improved the adsorption capacity for removal of crystal violet dye cv from single and binary systems the incorporation of 5 clay into the pva nfs reduced diameter from 341 to 217 nm and increased its maximum adsorption capacity for the cv dye removal from 48 65 to 121 73 mg g the redlich peterson and pseudo first order models provided the best modeling of the experimental adsorption isotherm and adsorption kinetic data respectively the clay pva nfs exhibited outstanding reusability with a removal efficiency for cv dye of 99 34 after ten cycles of reuse with easily separated after adsorption in addition the clay pva nfs have good selectivity for separating cv dye from various binary dye systems the selectivity of the clay pva to separate the cv dye from the binary dye systems of cv methylene blue cv coomassie brilliant blue and cv hematoxylin was 88 57 90 92 and 97 24 respectively finally excellent adsorption performance good selectivity high reusability and ease of separation make clay pva nfs a promising adsorbent for cv dye removal from complex wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords natural clay polymeric nanofibers dyes removal binary system selectivity reusability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the uncontrolled and random discharge of industrially polluted water into water bodies such as lakes and rivers has posed an environmental challenge since the beginning of the industrial revolution colored pollutants such as dyes are one of the major contaminants in wastewater discharged by the textile printing tanning and cosmetics industries 1 2 the global production of dyes is about 800 000 tons annually and about 80 000 120 000 tons reach the environment directly as liquid waste or as a result of losses during the various operations of those industries 3 most dyes are complex organic molecules with various toxic and carcinogenic structures and reduce water quality even at low concentrations 4 the discharge of dye effluents into water bodies increases the chemical oxygen demand it also leads to a decrease in light transmittance and visibility which leads to an environmental imbalance due to the impact on aquatic organisms 5 6 thus different and effective advanced methods are required to remove these organic dyes before releasing them into the environment and bodies of water 7 9 adsorption is one of the most commonly used physical methods to remove dyes from aqueous effluent due to its low cost simplicity high efficiency and low energy consumption 10 11 the adsorption efficiency of adsorbents varies according to their surface area porosity and chemical structure as well as the nature of the target dye 12 many natural and synthetic materials including clay agricultural waste 13 15 carbon materials 16 17 magnetic biopolymers 18 19 hydrogels 20 and metal oxides have been studied and used as dyes adsorbents however many common adsorbents lack selectivity towards specific organic dyes and cannot separate individual dyes from their mixtures 21 22 due to the varying toxicity environmental effects and chemical stability of dyes the design of adsorbents with high selectivity and excellent efficiency is required to remove the most toxic dyes recent studies have reported that the design of the adsorbent material in the nanoscale increases its surface area and thus improves its efficiency in adsorbing different dyes from aqueous systems 23 the unique properties of nanoadsorbents such as their surface area porosity exposed facets and surface functional groups can generally improve the rate of mass transfer and render ample sites accessible for dye adsorption 24 25 however most of the nanomaterials are in the form of a fine powder with high dispersion in aqueous media and require a complex separation process and thus an increase in the cost of the adsorption process therefore designing the adsorbent materials in the nanoscale with easy separation and reuse is desirable to reduce treatment costs and facilitate reuse polymeric nanofibers are one dimensional nanostructures and are among the most important nanomaterials that have gained wide interest in recent years as an adsorbent material to remove pollutants because of their surface area to volume ratios and physical form as membrane sheets 26 27 polymer nanofibers are fabricated by dissolving spinnable polymers in a suitable solvent and spinning them using electrospinning electrospun nanofiber materials offer unique advantages when used as adsorbents such as their sheet like form which facilitates their separation after the adsorption process and reuse however the adsorption efficiency of some polymeric nanofibers is low compared to other nanomaterials due to the absence of effective surface functional groups and the hydrophobic nature of the surface 28 recently several methods have been reported to improve the adsorption efficiency of nanofibers the most important of which is surface modification 29 the surface modification can be accomplished in two methods first before electrospinning by blending spinnable polymers with other polymers or by incorporating inorganic materials and second post electrospinning by bonding between the functional groups on the surface of the nanofibers with organic molecules the incorporation of inorganic materials into polymer nanofibers is a simple and effective method for modifying the surface properties of polymer nanofibers and improving their adsorption sites 29 polymer nanofiber sheets incorporating accessible adsorptive materials have significant advantages over pristine polymer nanofibers 30 the additive materials must be well dispersed in the polymer solution and able to segregate to the surface of nanofibers to be properly incorporated 31 furthermore these incorporated materials must be non toxic low cost readily available and not require chemical pretreatment and have efficient adsorption sites 32 the most common materials used to incorporate nanofiber mats are carbon nanomaterials 33 metal organic frameworks 34 metal oxides 35 and silica 36 however incorporating of these materials into nanofibers still faced challenges such as poor dispersion and aggregation in the spinnable polymer solution which hinders the electrospinning process to improve nanofiber adsorption efficiency and reduce production costs inexpensive readily available non toxic and dispersible materials are required without pretreatment or surfactant addition clays are natural materials of hydrous aluminum magnesium and iron silicates with prominent cationic and anionic ions on their surface the morphology of clay is described by the presence of two dimensional sheets octahedral al2o3 and tetrahedral sio4 and its particle size is 2 Î¼m 37 swelling clay is clay soil prone to large volume changes which has advantages over many other materials in terms of its non toxic nature low cost abundant availability and excellent adsorption properties 38 39 several recent studies have shown that clays are an effective adsorbent for many organic dyes and their adsorption capacity depends on the type of clay its composition the nature of the surface charge and surface area 40 41 the effect of expansive clay on the adsorption characteristics selectivity and reusability of pva nanofibers for cationic dye removal from single and binary dye mixtures has not previously been studied and warrants additional exploration in this study we demonstrate the incorporation of natural expansive clay in polymeric nanofiber mats by electrospinning technique without any surfactants and crosslinking agents for enhancing their adsorption capacity and selectivity towards removing organic dyes in single and binary dye mixtures its smaller size surface ions swelling and dispersibility in aqueous solutions without surfactant makes expansive clay very special as an incorporated material to improve the adsorption properties of nanofibers prepared from water soluble polymers a series of polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers pva nfs were fabricated with different ratios of expansive clay and characterized by several techniques the effects of expansive clay ratio ph contact time dye concentration and temperature on adsorption were investigated isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption process of cv dye by pva nfs and clay pva nfs the adsorption selectivity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs for removing cv dye from three binary dye mixtures was also studied furthermore the reusability of the clay pva nfs was investigated the results indicated that incorporating the natural clay enhances the adsorption capacity and selectivity of the nanofibers in the removal of the cv dye and can be reused for ten consecutive cycles without appreciable loss of removal efficiency 2 materials methods 2 1 materials the expansive natural clay was collected from alqatif area which is a coastal oasis region located in the eastern province of saudi arabia 26 56 0 n 50 1 0 e this type of clay is classified within highly expansive soils in nature due to possessing a unique property of volume change potential when subjected to varying moisture conditions 42 poly vinyl alcohol pva mw 72 000 85 89 hydrolyzed was purchased from panreac applichem germany crystal violet cv methylene blue mb hematoxylin htx hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from merck darmstadt germany coomassie brilliant blue 250 r cbb was obtained from fluka ag chemische fabrik buchs switzerland fig s1 shows the chemical structure of mb cv cbb and htx dyes 2 2 fabrication of clay pva nfs a certain amount of expansive clay was dispersed in 20 ml of distilled water for 2 h by a sonication probe to exfoliate the nanolayers 2 0 g of pva was then added to the clay suspension and stirred at 50 c until dissolved and a homogeneous solution formed the clay pva solution was loaded into a 20 ml syringe and electrospun to nanofibers using an electrospinning setup the electrospinning process was done through applied 17 kv of voltage 15 cm distance between tip and collector tcd 0 6 ml h flow rate of solution and 25 33 humidity after the electrospinning process the formed nanofiber sheet was peeled off from the surface of the collector and dried in vacuum oven overnight at 70 c to eliminate the residual solvent finally it was thermally crosslinked at 150 c under vacuum for 24 h to stabilize the nanofiber sheet in aqueous media the prepared samples are referred to as pva nfs clay pva nfs 5 clay pva nfs 10 and clay pva nfs 15 throughout the text based on the clay to pva weight ratio 0 5 10 and 15 respectively 2 3 characterization of expansive clay pva nfs and clay pva nfs composites the expansive clay and prepared nanofibers samples were characterized using various techniques scanning electron microscopy sem jeol japan was used to examine the morphology of clay pva nfs and clay pva nfs average diameters size distribution of nanofiber samples were calculated by imagej software the elemental composition of expansive clay was determined by energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir thermo fisher scientific usa was used to investigate the functional groups of expansive clay and nanofiber samples the thermal stability of expansive clay pva nfs and clay pva nfs was studied by thermogravimetric analysis tga q500 usa the surface area and porosity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs 5 were estimated by n2 physisorption adsorption desorption isotherms using a micromeritics asap 2020 analyzer the surface charge of clay was determined by measuring the point of zero charges phpzc using the ph drift method as follows series of kcl solutions were prepared in tubes with a fixed concentration of 0 1 m and a volume of 10 ml with different ph between 2 and 11 then 20 mg of the expansive clay was added to each solution ph and shaking at 120 rpm and 25 c in a thermostat water bath with a shaker after 4 0 h of equilibration the final ph phf of the solution was measured by using a ph meter 3540 jenway uk and plotted Î´ph versus initial ph phi values 2 4 adsorption study initially stock solutions were prepared at a concentration of 1000 mg l for each dye followed by serial dilution at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 mg l a uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer 35 uk was used to measure the absorbance of standard solutions of crystal violet dye cv methylene blue dye mb coomassie brilliant blue dye cbb and hematoxylin dye htx at Î» max 589 664 555 and 375 nm respectively to generate the calibration curve a preliminary survey was carried out to investigate the effect of expansive clay ratio and type of dyes on adsorption efficiency by soaking 10 mg of each prepared nanofiber mats in 10 ml of dye solution in neutral ph and shaking at 120 rpm and 25 c for 24 h in a thermostat water bath with a shaker the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity was investigated at ph values of 3 6 4 6 7 and 10 4 by adjusting the ph with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid and the cv dye concentration was 100 mg l the concentration effect was investigated using cv dye concentrations ranging from 25 to 400 mg l at ph 10 4 and 10 mg of nanofiber sheet at various temperatures and thermodynamic parameters also were evaluated to determine the equilibration time 100 mg of nanofiber sheet was immersed in 100 ml of cv dye solution at ph 10 4 for 5 h in a thermostatic shaker at 25 c because the adsorbent was a sheet form and the dye solutions were free of any suspended residue no additional separation procedures such as filtration or centrifugation were required in all measurements to remove the adsorbent in the binary system and selectivity study three mixed solutions of cv mb cv htx and cv cbb were prepared by mixing an equal volume of cv with other dyes and the final concentration of each dye in the mixture was 20 mg l the residual dye concentration in the mixture was measured after adsorption control adsorption experiments with individual dye solutions were also carried out under the same conditions all binary system measurements were carried out at a neutral ph and a temperature of 25 c for a reuse study 10 mg of nanofiber sheet was immersed in 10 ml of cv dye solution with a concentration of 40 mg l and ph 10 4 then kept in a shaker for 3 0 h finally the nanofiber sheet was taken out from the solution with tweezers and the residual dye concentration was measured to desorbing cv dye the used nanofiber was immersed in 10 ml of a solution consisting of hcl 0 2 m acetone at a ratio of 75 25 in shaker for 2 0 h the nanofiber sheet was taken and washed with distilled water dilute solution of naoh 0 01 m and then washed again by distilled water the equations for the statistical analysis adsorption capacity and separation efficiency are summarized in the supplementary material sections 1 1 and 1 2 3 result discussion 3 1 characterization of expansive clay pva nfs and clay pva nfs sem image of expansive clay shows agglomerated particles containing irregularly stacked flat sheets or flakes as shown in fig 1a b the flakes appear in different shapes and sizes under the microscope with some edges more prominent than others the most important feature is the presence of small and short bristle fibers connecting the edges of the flakes the elemental composition of the expansive clay was examined using the edx analysis as displayed in fig 1c edx analysis showed that the expansive clay contained the following elements oxygen silicon aluminum iron magnesium potassium calcium titanium sodium sulfur and chlorine these elements are also found in pva nfs after expansive clay incorporation and the weight ratio of the main elements e g si and al increases with the increase in the ratio of incorporated clay into the nanofiber mats as shown in fig s2 the xrd technique was utilized to detect the main minerals contained in the expansive clay and their interaction with the pva nfs the xrd spectra of expansive clay shows multi peaks with varied intensities at different 2Î¸ values showing that it contains more than one mineral fig 1d the characteristic peaks at 20 85 26 54 42 59 50 19 and 67 84Î¿ indicates quartz mineral 43 44 furthermore the 2Î¸ peaks at 19 82 34 7 45 5 and 61 57Î¿ corresponding to the structure of the montmorillonite mineral 45 the characteristic peaks for kaolinite appeared at 12 22 and 55 1Î¿ 46 the peaks that appeared at 8 30 and 13 66Î¿ are due to the palygorskite mineral 47 also clear pecks that appeared at 30 90 41 1 and 59 97Î¿ are attributed to the dolomite mineral 48 the apparent weak peaks at 11 49 and 55Î¿ are also attributed to kaolinite mineral based on the xrd results the expansive clay contains quartz montmorillonite dolomite palygorskite and kaolinite minerals fig s3 shows the xrd spectra of the pva nfs before and after incorporation of the clay into nanofiber mats for pure pv nfs has three intense peaks at 19 49 5 and 73Î¿ after incorporating the clay the peaks at 49 5 and 73Î¿ disappeared and the intensity of the peak at 19Î¿ decreased moreover no clay specific peaks appeared indicating that the clay particles were inserted between the polymer chains rather than on their surface fig 2 shows a typical sem image and diameter size distribution of neat pva nfs and pva nfs incorporating different proportions of clay after thermal crosslinking it can be seen that neat pva nfs exhibited uniform and distinct nanofibers with an average diameter of about 340 81 74 nm the nanofibers formed quasi oblate tubes with mostly fused bonds at the junction points due to thermal crosslinking before thermal crosslinking the morphology of pva nfs is cylindrical smooth free of flattening and fused contact points are less as shown in fig s4 the incorporation of 5 clay into the pva nfs reduced the nanofiber diameter to 216 88 41 nm and eliminated flatness in tubes and the appearance of nanoparticles on the surface with keeping fused bonds at junction points this could be attributable to the fact that adding clay into the electrospinning solution reduces the spinning jet surface tension and increases solution conductivity results in creating the nanofibers with smaller diameters 49 however incorporating 10 and 15 of clay increased the diameters of the nanofibers with appear beads but they are still smaller than the diameters of the neat pva nfs ftir analysis was used to study the nature of functional groups in clay pva nfs and clay pva nfs as shown in fig 3a the clay spectrum shows distinct bands at 1638 54 1442 61 983 48 and 797 71 cm 1 also the clay spectrum shows several weak absorption bands in the range between 3400 and 3650 cm 1 which are attributed to hydroxyl linkage the band at 1638 54 cm 1 was attributed to water absorption between the clay layers which was also confirmed by the thermogravimetric analysis tga results the broad band observed at 1442 61 cm 1 is due to vibrational modes of tetrahedral silicate or the presence of calcite 50 51 the strong band at 980 cm 1 is the highest intensity in the spectrum due to the bending of siloxane si o si the weak bands that appear between 600 and 900 cm 1 range are attributed to stretch vibration of the inner surface of the oh group and the bending of si o for pva nfs it showed characteristic absorption bands at 3316 85 2935 27 2914 46 1729 24 1429 33 1372 41 1324 71 1245 06 1138 22 1091 53 1026 1 and 845 36 cm 1 absorption bands at high frequency at 3316 85 2935 27 and 2914 46 cm 1 are due to o h stretching asymmetric and symmetric stretching of ch2 respectively because the pva used is partially hydrolyzed it exhibits an absorption characteristic band of a carbonyl group for the acetate at 1729 24 cm 1 the bands located between 1429 and 1245 cm 1 are attributed to ch2 bending in plane bending vibration of ch and rocking with ch wagging the remaining absorption bands at 1138 22 1091 53 1026 1 cm 1 are due to shoulder stretching of c o stretching of co and bending of oh respectively after incorporating clay into the pva nfs all of the pva bands appeared with a distinct decrease in intensity due to the interaction between functional groups of clay and pva chains in contrast the band intensity at 1026 cm 1 in spectra of clay pva nfs was higher than of pva nfs this confirms that the pva chains are more rigid and more crystallized by the incorporation of clay tga dtg analysis was used to study the moisture content of the clay its thermal stability as well as its effect on the thermal stability of the pva nfs as shown in fig 3b it was observed that the weight ratio of the clay versus the temperature decreases at the low temperature range between 30 and 200 c the weight loss percentage at 200 c for clay was 4 which is attributed to the water physically bound to the clay the clay also loses 4 of its weight in the thermal range of 320 to 700 c which may be due to the degradation of organic impurities and dehydroxylation of clay 52 thermal decomposition of thermal treated pva nfs at 150 c occurs in one main step while non heat treated pva nfs take more than one step degradation confirming the successful crosslinking of polymer chains by heat treatment as shown in fig s5 the incorporation of clay into the pva nfs led to a decrease in thermal stability as the weight loss of clay pva nfs began at 190 c compared to the pure pva nfs whose thermal stability was observed up to 250 c however at a temperature higher than 300 c it was observed that the weight loss of clay pva nfs is less than pva nfs indicating that chemical cross linking occurs between the clay and the pva chains at high temperatures the difference in residual weight ratio at 800 c for pva nfs and clay pva nfs is 16 which is greater than the theoretical weight ratio of the clay 5 in nanofibers indicating that the clay slows the thermal decomposition of the pva at high temperatures and improves the residual carbon yield the surface nature of materials plays a crucial role in their adsorption properties the point of zero charges pzc measurement by the drift method is reliable for studying the surface nature of different materials phpzc is the ph value at which the net surface charge of a materials external and internal is equal to zero it is well known that the surface of a material is positively charged when the ph of the solution is lower than the phpzc value of the surface and negatively charged when the ph of the solution is higher than the phpzc value fig 3c shows the plot of the initial ph phi versus the difference between the initial and final ph ph after adding a certain amount of clay or nanofibers to the kcl salt solution 0 1 m the observed phpzc for clay pva nfs and clay pva were 9 44 3 70 and 4 10 respectively based on these values the surface of the pva nfs and clay pva nfs is expected to have a negatively charged surface over a wide ph range ph 4 1 compared to clay ph 9 44 it was also observed that the addition of clay had a minor effect on the phpzc value of the nanofibers indicating that functional groups in the pva chain control the surface nature charge to study the effect of clay on the interaction between chains of pva nfs and their stability in aqueous media the swelling was studied before and after the incorporation of different proportions of clay into their structure fig 3d shows that the incorporation of 5 of the clay reduced the swelling capacity from 13 23 to 7 62 g g and also improved the stability of the pva nfs in the aqueous media as the weight loss decreased from 28 48 to 0 64 the significant reduction in swelling confirms the interaction between the clay and the pva chains in which the clay acts as a physical cross linking agent limiting water penetration and reduce the swelling n2 adsorption desorption isotherm was used to measure the specific surface area of the pva nfs before and after the incorporation of clay 5 w w as shown in fig s6a the specific surface area of pva nfs 4 98 m2 g slightly decreases after being incorporated with clay 4 31 m2 g possibly due to the clay causing plugged pores fig s6b displays that pva nfs and clay pva nfs have micro meso porous structures with average pore width is 7 8 and 7 2 nm 3 2 adsorption study many factors influence the adsorption process including adsorbent properties e g surface area porosity surface nature functional groups dye type e g cationic anionic neutral and adsorption conditions e g ph initial concentration contact time and temperature 3 2 1 effect of incorporated clay the cv dye was used as a model for cationic dyes to study the effect of clay ratio on the adsorption capacity of pva nfs at neutral ph initial dye concentration of 100 mg l and the temperature at 25 c fig 4a shows that incorporating 5 expansive clay enhances the adsorption capacity of pva nfs by four times however the incorporation of expansive clay at a ratio higher than 5 resulted in lower adsorption capacity this result is due to the increasing diameters and agglomeration of clay particles in the pores of pva nf which leads to a reduction in pores and impedes dye penetration into the porous structure as confirmed by the sem images and bet analysis moreover the substantial increase in clay ratio in the nanofibrous mats would decrease the surface area to mass ratio therefore clay pva nfs 5 sample was used to perform all adsorption experiments and compared with a pva nfs sample 3 2 2 effect of dye type fig 4b presents the adsorption capacity of clay pva nfs and pva nfs towards removing various dyes at the initial dye concentration of 200 mg l at 25 c for 24 h crystal violet cv and methylene blue mb dyes were used as cationic dye models hematoxylin htx dye as a neutral dye model and coomassie brilliant blue r 250 cbb dye as an anionic dye model it is noted that the adsorption capacity of clay pva is higher than the adsorption capacity of pva nfs for various dye removal these results confirm that the incorporation of 5 clay into the pva nfs enhances the adsorption sites on their surface also expansive clay incorporation improves pva nfs selectivity towards dyes with a functional group or specific charge characteristic according to the results shown in fig 4b the adsorption capacity of clay pva nf to remove cationic dyes varies significantly with cationic dyes having a higher adsorption capacity than neutral and anionic dyes the adsorption capacities of clay pva nfs to remove cv mb htx and cbb dyes were 75 41 37 61 6 71 and 27 56 mg g respectively it was observed that the expansive clay incorporation in the nanofiber mats did not affect the adsorption of the anionic cbb dye which indicates that the expansive clay enhances the negative surface of the nanofibers although both the cv and mb dyes have a positive charge there is a significant difference in adsorption capacity indicating that other factors in addition to electrostatic interaction play a crucial role in the adsorption process 3 2 3 effect of ph the ph of the adsorption medium is one of the main factors that play a pivotal role in the adsorption process as it affects the adsorbent and adsorbate properties the effect of ph on cv dye adsorption by pva nfs and clay pva nfs was investigated as displayed in fig 4c partially hydrolyzed pva has an abundance of free oh and o co ch3 groups which could plays the main role in the adsorption of cationic cv dye 53 54 the acetate groups are ionized at a lower ph than the hydroxyl groups and it was ionized at a ph 8 0 55 therefore increasing the ph of the dye solution causes the acetate groups to ionize which increases the negatively charged surface groups as a result the interaction forces between the cationic cv dye and pva nfs also increase the obtained results indicate that the adsorption capacity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs in a basic medium is higher than that of a neutral or acidic medium in alkaline media the number of ionized acetate groups with a negative charge increases and thus the adsorption capacity of the pva nfs and clay pva nfs increases in the case of clay pva nfs increasing the ph promotes higher adsorption sites than those in pristine pva nfs due to the clay surface becoming negatively charged at a ph higher than 9 42 as confirmed by the phpzc analysis 3 2 4 effect of initial dye concentration the dye s initial concentration depends on the direct relationship between the dye concentration and the available adsorption sites on the surface of an adsorbent fig 4d presents the effect of the initial cv dye concentration on the adsorption capacity of the pva nfs and clay pva nfs in general the adsorption capacity increases with increasing initial dye concentration which may be due to the mass driving force at higher initial dye concentration however this increase in the adsorption capacity reaches a steady state when the adsorption process reaches equilibrium and all adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface are occupied the adsorption capacity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs increases with increasing initial cv dye concentration and approaches a steady state at 75 and 300 mg l respectively as shown in fig 4e the photographs in fig s7 show that the cv dye solutions in the concentration range of 25 75 mg l have become colorless which indicates that the dye molecules have completely adsorbed on the clay pva nfs surface at lower concentrations the adsorption capacity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs increased sharply in the initial dye concentration range of 25 75 mg l and 25 100 mg l respectively since the number of unoccupied adsorption sites in the range of 100 300 mg l a gradual increase in the adsorption capacity was observed on the surface of the clay pva nfs which may be attributed to the lower swelling rate after clay incorporation and makes the penetration of dye molecules slower to reach the unoccupied sites 3 2 5 effect of contact time to determine the required time to reach the equilibrium state the contact time effect was studied as shown in fig 4e the adsorption capacity of the cv dye on the surface of pva nfs and clay pva nfs increased very quickly from 0 to 15 min and 0 to 60 min respectively due to the presence of unoccupied adsorption sites it was observed from the obtained results that the incorporation of clay increases the required time to reach the state of equilibrium this result is consistent with the results of the swelling study that indicate the incorporation of clay in nanofiber mats significantly reduces swelling capacity which slows down the rate of dye penetration to reach all adsorption sites 3 2 6 effect of temperature temperature is an important factor to consider when studying the behavior of the adsorption mechanism therefore the cv dye adsorption was studied at different temperatures ranging from 25 to 35 c with a constant initial dye concentration of 100 mg l in ph 10 4 the adsorption capacity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs showed a slight decrease when the temperature was increased from 25 to 35 c fig 4f this result indicated that the cv dye molecules tend to escape from the nanofiber mats to the bulk phase with an increased temperature 3 3 adsorption isotherm study the equilibrium studies for cv dye adsorption onto pva nfs and clay pva nfs were carried out between 25 and 35 c as displayed in figs 5a and 6a five isotherm models were used to analyze the adsorption behavior including langmuir 56 freundlich 57 dubinin radushkevich d r 58 redlich peterson r p 59 and tempkin 60 models and fitting results displayed in fig 5b f and fig 6b f all applied model equations are summarized in the supplementary materials section 1 3 and the model constants and correlation coefficients are reported in table 1 based on the r2 and Ï2 values it can be concluded that the r p isotherm model was the best model for fitting the experimental data and describing the cv dye adsorption behavior on pva nfs and clay pva nfs from 25 to 35 c because the r2 values were closest to the unit and the Ï2 values were the lowest among all results by analogy between r p and langmuir models it is clear that the adsorption affinity Î² value for all measurements approaches unity when the isotherm data best fit the langmuir model thus the langmuir model is a special case of the r p model when the constant Î² close to unity considering the langmuir fitted model at 25 c the maximum adsorption capacities qmax of the pva nfs and clay pva nfs were 48 65 and 121 73 mg g respectively it also was found that an increase in temperature resulted in lower qmax values table 1 shows the calculated separation factor rl values for the adsorption of cv dye onto pva nfs and clay pva nfs at various temperatures the rl values ranged between 0 and 1 0 and dropped with increasing temperature demonstrating that adsorption was highly favorable at low adsorption temperatures the r2 and Ï2 values of the d r model are also close to those of the langmuir model so they can be used to calculate the mean adsorption energy e the e values for cv dye adsorption by pva nfs and clay pva nfs were 8 kj mol confirming the physical nature of the adsorption process 3 4 kinetics study the kinetic studies of pva nfs and clay pva nfs towards cv dye were performed to determine the required time to reach the equilibrium state and comprehend the adsorption process the pseudo first order model pfo 61 pseudo second order model pso 62 and elovich model 63 were used to simulate the adsorption kinetics and evaluate the adsorption rate all applied kinetics model equations and details of their parameters are summarized in the supplementary materials section 1 4 the fitting results of the three models are exhibited in fig 7a b it is clear that the kinetic fitting curve produced by the elovich model outperforms those produced by the pfo and pso models for the adsorption of cv dye onto pva nfs also the r2 and Ï2 values of the elovich model confirmed this as they were 0 9918 and 4 31 respectively as displayed in table 2 in contrast the most representative cv dye adsorption kinetic curve model on clay pva nfs was pfo depending on the highest value of r2 0 9909 and the lowest value of Ï2 16 24 interestingly the pso model is non fitting the adsorption curve of clay pva nfs which indicates that it is insufficient for describing the cv dye adsorption behavior the calculated value of qt 70 91 mg g from the pso model was very close to the experimental value of qt exp 71 32 mg g which indicates that pso model is also suitable for describing the adsorption process on the surface of the pva nfs the qt value for dye adsorption on clay pva nfs derived from the pfo model was 116 97 mg g the cv dye adsorption rate on pva nfs and clay pva nfs was 0 0024 g mg 1 min 1 and 0 0269 min 1 according to the results of the pso and pfo models respectively the difference in the adsorption rate and kinetic behavior on the pva nfs and clay pva surface is due to the different number and nature of the adsorption sites after incorporating clay in nanofibers for a deeper understanding of the adsorption kinetic mechanism of cv dye on the pva nfs and clay pva nfs an intraparticle diffusion model was used fig 7c shows linearized plots of qt vs t0 5 based on the intraparticle diffusion model the single linear plot of the slope for the pva nfs sample was obtained revealing that the adsorption of cv dye occurred in a single step and on the external surface of nanofibers but the adsorption behavior on clay pva nfs produced two linear slope plots revealing that cv dye adsorption occurred in two steps the first step s adsorption rate was quick which can be attributed to the diffusion of cv dye molecules from the solution media to the external surface of the clay pva nfs in contrast the second step was slow due to the effect of the density and pores sizes based on the sem images the nanofibers are randomly arranged and multi layered with a porous structure in the first step the interaction between the cv dye molecules with the surface of the nanofibers occurs quickly while in the second step the cv dye molecules are required to diffuse through the internal layers and the pores therefore the interaction between the dye and the surface of the pores takes a longer time in the second step furthermore in the qt vs t0 5 plot the regression does not pass through the origin showing that the intraparticle diffusion process is not the only rate limiting step 64 3 5 thermodynamic studies thermodynamic studies play a pivotal role in determining the nature of the adsorption process e g physical or chemical the following equations can be used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics 1 g rtln k eq 2 ln k c s r h rt the adsorption gibbs free energy Î´g can be calculated directly from eq 1 the slope and intercept of a plot of lnkeq against 1 t fig 7d were used to calculate the adsorption enthalpy h and adsorption entropy s the langmuir constant kl was used as the equilibrium constant to calculate thermodynamic parameters due to the adsorption equilibrium constant keq must be dimensionless the keq value was calculated by multiplying the kl value by the molecular weight of cv dye mwt 407 97 g mol 1000 and then 55 5 moles number of pure water per liter table 3 displays the thermodynamic parameters for cv dye adsorption on pva nfs and clay pva nfs g values were negative and increased with increasing temperatures indicating that the adsorption of cv dye on both pva nfs and clay pva nfs is spontaneous and favorable with low required activation energy at a specific temperature this finding agreed well with the conclusion drawn from the mean adsorption energy e separation factor r analysis the adsorption of cv dye onto pva nfs and clay pva nfs was an exothermic process as evidenced by the positive h value and increase of equilibrium constant with increasing temperatures the clay pva nfs 15 21 kj mol had a higher h magnitude than the pva nfs 13 06 kj mol indicating a higher affinity for cv dye in solution the positive value of Î´s further suggested that the increasing degree of freedom of the cv ions in the solution and adsorption process was entropy governed rather than enthalpy governed 65 3 6 selectivity of pva nfs and clay pva nfs adsorbent selectivity is defined as removing a specific pollutant from a medium containing more than one pollutants differ in toxicity and environmental impact so designing an adsorbent with high selectivity is required in water treatment to target the most toxic pollutants surface modification is one of the most important methods for improving adsorbent selectivity to remove the target pollutants the selective adsorption property of pva nfs and clay pva nfs of cv was investigated using three dye mixtures containing cv mb cv htx and cv cbb as shown in fig 8 it was noted that using pva nfs did not affect the color of the dye mixtures made up of cv mb cv htx and cv cbb the colors of the dye mixtures cv mb cv htx and cv cbb before and after adsorption with clay pva nfs ranged from dark blue to light blue violet to pale yellow and blue to light violet respectively the color change when using clay pva nfs is attributed to its selectivity towards removing the cv dye from the mixtures of cv mb cv cbb and cv htx the separation efficiency of clay pva nfs for the removal of cv dye from the dye mixtures was higher than the separation efficiency of pva nfs specifically the separation efficiency of cv dye increased from 17 26 67 43 and 64 86 for pva nfs fig 9a c to 88 57 90 92 and 97 24 for clay pva nfs fig 9d f from cv mb cv cbb and cv htx mixtures respectively the low selectivity adsorption of cv dye from the cv mb mixture is attributed to the adsorption competition between the cv and mb since both have a positive charge on the other hand the selectivity of the clay pva nfs towards the adsorption of the cv dye from the cv htx mixture was the highest this result confirms that the negative charge on the surface of clay pva nfs electrostatically interacted with the cationic cv molecules while the neutral htx remained in the solution the separation efficiency of pva nfs to remove dyes from the mixed dye system was lower than that of the single dye system fig 9a c which could be attributed to the limited adsorption sites and competition between dyes on adsorption in contrast the separation efficiency of clay pva nfs for the removal of cbb and htx from the dye mixture was higher than that of the single dye solution as shown in fig 9d f this is because part of the charge of the cv dye partially neutralizes the charge of the clay which reduces the repulsion between the surface of clay pva nfs and the cbb dye and also enhances hydrogen bonding with the htx dye clay pva nfs removed 97 64 of cv 89 51 of mb 25 57 of cbb and 4 96 of htx from their respective single dye solution while they adsorbed 88 57 of cv 67 84 of mb 55 96 of cbb and 11 25 of htx from their mixed dye mixture based on the nature of the surface and functional groups electrostatic interaction ion exchange and hydrogen bonding are the three driving forces controlling dye adsorption by clay pva nfs 3 7 reusability of clay pva nfs the reusability of adsorbents is one of the most important factors determining their cost and is a good indicator of understanding the adsorption mechanisms the reusability of clay pva nfs to remove cv dye was studied for ten consecutive cycles as displayed in fig 10a the cv dye removal efficiency after ten cycles of reuse of clay pva nfs was 99 34 the removal efficiency decreased by only 0 66 indicating that the clay pva nfs performed excellently in reuse the considerable recyclability of clay pva nfs indicated its long term potential for decolorizing polluted water polluted with cv dye also the possibility of reuse for ten consecutive cycles suggests that the cv dye adsorption on the surface of clay pva nfs is physical 3 8 proposed mechanism in general the adsorption mechanism of organic dyes on the surface of various materials is a complex mechanism controlled by multiple factors such as the surface nature of the adsorbent the structure of the dye and the medium of the adsorption process based on these factors the adsorption of the dye on the adsorbent surface is controlled by different forces such as electrostatic attraction formation of hydrogen bonds n Ï interaction pore filling Ï Ï interaction or ion exchange isothermal kinetic thermodynamic reuse and spectroscopy studies are the most important studies for understanding the adsorption mechanism the hÎ¿ value 15 kj mol and mean energy values 2 43 2 54 kj mol calculated from the d r model confirm that the cv dye adsorption process on the clay pva nfs surface is a physical process the study of the reuse of clay pva nfs for ten consecutive cycles without loss in adsorption efficiency indicates that the adsorption process is reversible it was also noted that intraparticle diffusion modeling revealed a contribution of film diffusion to the control of adsorption kinetics however intraparticle diffusion was not the dominant mechanism the electrostatic attraction plays an essential role in the adsorption mechanism which was also confirmed by studying the effect of ph and low phpzc value 4 1 however the results demonstrated that clay pva nfs could adsorb the cv dye at ph levels lower than 4 1 indicating the presence of other forces that contribute to the adsorption process such as n Ï interaction and hydrogen bonding the ftir spectrum of clay pva nfs after cv dye adsorption fig s8 proved that the absorption bands at 1138 22 and 1091 5 cm 1 decrease significantly in intensity and a slight shift of band at 1027 to1025 cm 1 which confirms the presence of n Ï interaction also after the adsorption of the cv dye the intensity of the absorption bands between 3300 and 3500 cm 1 decreased which indicates the presence of hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of the clay pva nfs and the nitrogen atom of the cv dye 66 according to the obtained results and based on the cv dye structure and surface properties of the clay pva nfs it can be assumed that the adsorption mechanism involves the following steps the cv dye adsorption on the surface of clay pva nfs is a physical and reversible process the cv dye adsorbs in two steps first it migrates from the bulk solution to the surface and second it diffuses through the boundary layer to the pores of the clay pva nfs electrostatic attraction plays an important role in the adsorption process and hydrogen bonding and n Ï interaction contribute as shown in fig 10b 3 9 comparison of the clay pva nfs with reported adsorbents a comparison of the adsorption capacity of the clay pva nfs to remove the cv dye with other adsorbents based on nanofiber or clay composites is summarized in table 4 the prepared clay pva nfs prepared by incorporating 5 clay into the nanofiber mats have a higher adsorption capacity than reported adsorbents 67 75 in addition the prepared clay pva nf was more practical to use as it could be easily removed after the adsorption process and reused the study also includes a test of the selectivity of clay pva nfs towards removing the cv dye from three different mixtures containing cationic neutral and anionic dye which was missing from the studies listed in table 4 the results showed a high selectivity of the clay pva nfs towards the cv dye adsorption from the three mixtures reaching 90 moreover the fabricated nanoadsorbent clay pva nfs showed high reusability for ten consecutive cycles without significant loss in adsorption efficiency making it superior to many adsorbents nanofibers provide a large surface area while clay provides the binding sites for adsorbate therefore the incorporation of clay into the nanofiber mats improves adsorption efficiency mechanical properties and stability in aqueous media enhancing their reuse and easy separation after adsorption 4 conclusion in this work we have successfully fabricated highly selective and superior reusable nanoadsorbent by incorporating expansive clay into pva nfs for the adsorption and separation of cv dye from single and binary dye systems a series of expansive clay incorporated pva nfs were fabricated by electrospinning technique followed by thermal crosslinking without surfactants or chemical crosslinking agents the optimum ratio of expensive clay to produce pva nfs with the lowest diameters and the highest adsorption capacity was 5 w w adsorption experiments showed that increasing the ph cv dye concentration and contact time was accompanied by an increase in the adsorption capacity while the effect of the temperature was negative the maximum adsorption capacity of the pva nfs 5 clays was 121 73 mg g compared to 48 65 mg g for the neat pva nfs the prepared clay pva nfs have a higher adsorption capacity than reported adsorbents in the single system five isotherm models and three kinetic models were used to analyze the adsorption behavior of the cv dye on clay pva nfs and the r p isotherm model and pfo kinetic model were the best model for fitting the experimental data respectively according to the results of the thermodynamic studies the adsorption of the cv dye is spontaneous and favorable on the surface of the clay pva nfs in the binary dyes system the separation efficiency of clay pva nfs for removal of cv dye from the dye mixtures were higher than separation efficiency of pure pva nfs specifically the separation efficiency of cv dye increased from 17 26 67 43 and 64 86 for pva nfs to 88 57 90 92 and 97 24 for clay pva nfs from cv mb cv cbb and cv htx mixtures respectively the effects of ph ftir phpzc measurement and selectivity revealed that electrostatic attraction was the most important contribution to cationic dye adsorption followed by hydrogen bonding and n Ï interaction the results showed a superior reusable of the clay pva nfs and can be used for ten consecutive cycles without losing the adsorption efficiency 99 34 after the 10th cycle excellent adsorption capacity high selectivity superior reusability and easy handling separation of clay pva nfs after the adsorption process are the main features of this work which is a new window for designing adsorbents and use in practical

12406,uncontrolled discharge of textile industry wastewater defined by its highly toxic content causes serious problems in receiving environment especially nitrogen derived pollutants in wastewater threaten the ecosystem and aquatic life separate or simultaneous nitrification denitrification is the preferred biological processes for removing nitrogen based pollutants from wastewater this study aimed to evaluate the impact of aeration on off cycle durations on organic matter color and nitrogen removal performances in an intermittently aerated membrane bioreactor mbr receiving real textile wastewater for this purpose the mbr was operated under different dissolved oxygen concentrations 6 and 3 mg l and the aeration on off cycle durations from 2 min 2 min to 90 min 360 min at a constant flux of 10 l m2 h while the chemical oxygen demand cod removal performance ranged from 84 to 91 the color removal efficiencies were highly variable nitrification performance of 89 was achieved with a minimum of 30 min aeration cycles the highest denitrification efficiency was obtained in the cycle with 360 min aeration off duration intermittent aeration provided higher tn removal less sludge generation and lower energy requirements for aeration the impacts of aeration cycle duration on membrane filtration performance and foulant characterization were also investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir scanning electron microscopy sem gel permeation chromatography gpc sem coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds particle size distribution psd analyses graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords textile wastewater membrane bioreactor intermittent aeration nitrogen removal filtration performance data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction textile industry produces 50 400 l of wastewater per kg product and it causes many serious environmental problems in the receiving environment due to its toxic content 1 textile industry wastewater contains high levels of organic matter color solids dyestuffs metals and nitrogen 2 the nitrogen concentration of textile wastewater varies depending on the method and technology used in the dyeing process 3 in the literature higher nitrogen concentrations in textile industry wastewater have been reported in recent studies for example the total nitrogen tn and ammonium nitrogen n nh4 in wastewater in the balancing tank of a fabric printing factory located in the textile region of como italy were 105 9 24 9 mg n l and 93 1 23 4 mg n l respectively 4 around 120 140 mg tn l in the influent of textile wastewater taken from a small sized factory making zippers in shenzhen guangdong china was reported 5 the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn concentration of wastewater from the j textile factory in seoul korea was measured between 86 and 145 mg l 6 uncontrolled discharge of nitrogen containing wastewater into the receiving environment causes eutrophication and adverse effects on ecological balance 7 nitrification and denitrification are the two preferred biological processes for nitrogen removal from wastewater in the nitrification process ammonium is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate in aerobic conditions 8 by ammonia oxidizing and nitrite oxidizing bacteria respectively 9 in the denitrification process nitrate or nitrite is converted to nitrogen gas by heterotrophic and or autotrophic microorganisms under anoxic conditions 10 the intermittent aeration process provides many advantages such as high nitrogen removal performance due to creating appropriate conditions for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification its suitability for low performing wastewater treatment plants retrofitting lower energy requirement and less sludge problems 11 intermittent aeration provides energy savings between 33 and 45 compared to conventional processes which may be due to the possibility of denitrification over nitrite 12 intermittent aeration process is preferred in many different systems such as sequencing batch reactors sbr 13 14 constructed wetlands 15 16 activated sludge systems 17 baffled reactors 18 and membrane bioreactors mbr 19 in particular mbrs provide advantages such as effective filtration higher effluent quality less sludge production low footprint as well as high nitrogen removal efficiency compared to conventional biological systems 20 there are some studies in the literature on wastewater treatment performances of intermittently aerated mbrs under varying operational conditions in one of these studies conducted by kim et al 21 cod and tn removal efficiencies were 95 2 and 72 7 respectively in a full scale treatment plant consisting of an anaerobic reactor two modified intermittent aeration reactors a deoxygenation deox tank and aerobic mbr for sewage treatment in another study a pilot scale mbr process consisting of aerobic anoxic membrane and deox tanks was operated for municipal wastewater treatment at different aeration on off cycle durations the highest efficiencies obtained at the aeration on off cycle durations of 80 min 100 min were 96 9 78 27 and 75 14 for nitrification denitrification and total nitrogen removal respectively 22 instead of achieving the nitrification and denitrification processes in two separate tanks with internal recirculation optimum conditions for both processes may be created in a single system to minimize the size of treatment plants 23 the success of the nitrification and denitrification processes in a single system may be highly affected by parameters such as dissolved oxygen do carbon nitrogen c n ratio hydraulic retention time hrt and aeration anoxic cycles 24 anoxic denitrifying bacteria are sensitive to the presence of oxygen 25 and theoretically at least 2 86 mg cod mg n must be provided in the system for heterotrophic denitrification 26 also slow growing autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria are generally recognized as the rate limiting step in the nitrification process and an adequate amount of nitrifiers should be present in the system for effective biological nitrogen removal 27 there are limited studies in the literature on the real textile wastewater treatment using an mbr process in which intermittent aeration is appalled in the study by sahinkaya et al 28 the effect of different aeration on off cycle durations 5 min 3 min 1 min 10 min and 1 min 15 min on the dye and chromium removal performances of a dynamic membrane bioreactor treating synthetic textile wastewater was evaluated the ammonium nitrogen in the synthetic wastewater was 33 2 mg l and it decreased 1 3 1 mg l in the permeate at the aeration on off cycle of 5 min 3 min and 1 min 10 min whereas it increased up 28 mg l at the aeration on off cycle of 1 min 15 min the average cod removal efficiency was 96 until the aeration on off durations of 1 min 15 min 28 the present study aims to determine and compare carbon and nitrogen removal performances of a real textile industry wastewater at varying do concentrations do of 6 and 3 mg l and the different aeration on off cycle durations from 2 min 2 min to 90 min 360 min in an intermittently aerated mbr including a hollow fiber ultrafiltration uf membrane membrane filtration performance and fouling tendency for each operating condition were discussed in detail also organic and inorganic membrane foulants under the different aeration off cycle durations were characterized with the ft ir sem sem eds gpc and psd analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor in the study a cylindrical lab scale submerged mbr system with an effective volume of 7 l was used influent permeate and recirculation flows were controlled with peristaltic pumps longer pump bt600 2 j seko pr7 a hollow fiber pvdf 0 04 Î¼m pore sized ultrafiltration membrane suez with a surface area of 0 23 m2 was used in the mbr in order to reduce membrane fouling filtration was applied intermittently in 6 min cycles employing 5 min of permeation and 1 min of relaxation differential pressure values in the system were monitored with a manometer daily excess sludge was removed from the system manually the system was aerated through a compressor operated according to the predetermined on off durations with a timer in addition an automation system was used for adjusting intermittent aeration and pump operation when feeding was done only in anoxic conditions 2 2 wastewater and biomass source the system was fed with wastewater 95 of which was of textile wastewater origin obtained from the demirtaÅ organized industrial zone dosab wastewater treatment plant located in bursa turkey general information about the treatment plant was previously provided by sahinkaya et al 29 and the wastewater characterization for this study is given in table s1 the mbr previously operated under aerobic conditions at an srt and an hrt of 30 d and 1 d respectively for around 250 days 30 was used in the present study 2 3 operating conditions the system operated under nine different main periods p1 p9 for approximately 472 days the hrt and srt in the system were constant at 1 d and 30 d respectively the average and instantaneous fluxes in the system were 8 3 and 10 lmh respectively and a certain portion of the permeate was continuously fed back into the system to keep hrt constant at 1 day for this case average influent permeate and recirculation flow rates were set to 7 46 and 39 l d respectively during the first two periods p1 p2 the system was continuously aerated to have do of 6 and 3 mg l respectively then the system was tested under intermittent aeration conditions in the periods between p3 and p7 1 aeration on off cycle durations were varied between 2 min 2 min and 90 min 90 min table 1 in order to improve the tn removal performance in the system the temperature in the reactor was first increased to around 30 c close to the operating temperature of the real treatment plant and then 2 5 l sludge 2515 mg vss l taken from a real scale 5 stage bardenpho mbr process was added to system in p7 2 up to p7 3 the system was fed intermittently in both on and off cycles similar to filtration process then the wastewater was fed to the system only during the aeration off cycles by this way the system was tested at different aeration intermittencies while observing the effects of employing different feeding patterns elevated temperature and culture supplementation in p8 and p9 1 aeration on off durations were set to 90 min 180 min and 90 min 360 min respectively in order to increase the cod n ratio in p9 2 200 mg cod l acetate was externally supplied to the wastewater and its effect on the tn removal efficiency was investigated in the last period the system was fed with a new batch wastewater with a relatively high cod content tmp was monitored regularly to determine membrane filtration performance according to the procedure provided by yurtsever et al 31 physical and chemical cleanings were performed when tmp exceeded 200 and 400 mbar in the system respectively the removal performance of the system was followed via regular measurements of cod tn nitrate nitrite color etc the do and oxidation reduction potential orp values were regularly monitored in the system for the sludge filterability properties regular measurements of supernatant filterability sf specific resistance to filtration srf sludge volume index svi viscosity and capillary suction time cst were conducted soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps concentrations as carbohydrate and protein fractions were determined at different aeration on off durations the gpc ft ir sem edx and psd analyses were performed to characterize the organic and inorganic foulants observed sludge yield yobs and energy requirement for aeration in each operating condition were calculated as given by 30 the airflow requirements were calculated by assuming the average do concentration during the aeration cycles of intermittent aeration periods around 2 5 mg l and the oxygen transfer efficiency of the diffuser as 5 m then energy requirements were calculated based on the theoretically determined airflow rates and the actual airflow rates measured during the experiments 2 4 analytical methods the regular parameters alkalinity cod ss and vss were measured following the standard methods 32 nitrate and nitrite were measured using an ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 thermo fisher scientific usa

prepared following the procedure provided by judd and judd 33 and rahman et al 34 were used to measure carbohydrates 35 and protein 36 srf and sf were measured as described by dereli et al 37 cst and viscosity were determined using trion capillary suction timer and brookfield dv e viscometer with using the newtonian model respectively molecular weights of dissolved organic molecules were measured with the gpc agilent 1260 infinity using two pl aquagel oh mixed h columns mobile phase 0 02 nan3 w v t 30 c q 1 ml min ftir samples were prepared according to the method given by yurtsever et al 38 and measured with perkin elmer spectrum two ftir device psd on the samples taken from the bioreactor was measured using a mastersizer malvern 2000mu at yildiz technical university application and research center for science and technology biÌtuam istanbul turkey for sem eds measurements the operating conditions in the bioreactor were simulated in the dead end filtration system since no observable cake layer was formed on the hollow fiber membrane used in the mbr for this purpose 200 ml sludge sample was drawn from the mbr and sludge cake was formed in the dead end filtration system by filtration at 0 5 bar through the membrane with 0 22 Î¼m pore size sem images were taken on the membrane sample using the geminisem 500 device at osmangazi university central research laboratory application and research center arum eskiÅehir turkey eds analyzes were performed on the same membrane for detecting inorganic contaminants in the cake layer the statistical analysis of the data was performed according to our previous study 30 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance of intermittently aerated mbr 3 1 1 variations of ph conductivity cod color alkalinity and phosphate in the mbr the ph and conductivity of the feed wastewater showed no appreciable change throughout the study averaging 8 2 0 5 and 5673 1168 Î¼s cm respectively fig s1 total cod in wastewater averaged 793 173 mg l of which approximately 70 was soluble cod in the continuously aerated periods p1 and p2 the removal efficiencies were above 91 and the permeate cod averaged 64 13 mg l at do of 3 mg l fig 1 employing different aeration on off durations resulted in cod removal efficiency to vary only between 84 and 90 different do concentrations and on off durations did not negatively affect the overall cod degradation efficiency p 0 05 interestingly when the operating do concentration was decreased from 6 mg l to 3 mg l the cod in the supernatant was reduced from 295 83 mg l to 133 18 mg l the supernatant cod in the intermittently aerated periods was also lower than that in p1 which may be due to high agitation conditions in p1 causing the release of a part of eps to the supernatant approximately 24 of the total cod was rejected by the membrane and the cake in the first period in the following periods the rejection by membrane and cake layer varied between 3 and 14 while the removal due to the cake layer increased as the aeration off duration increased table 2 the average color in the feed and permeate were 1171 458 pt co and 570 108 pt co respectively fig 1 no correlation was observed between color removal efficiency and different do concentrations and aeration on off cycle durations p 0 05 while the lowest removal efficiency was observed at aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min the highest removal efficiency was obtained as 68 at the aeration on off duration of 90 min 90 min considering the supernatant and permeate colors approximately 7 to 45 contribution to the total removal efficiency depending on the periods was due to the cake layer color accumulation was observed in the system especially at do of 6 mg l as the color in the supernatant increased up to 1133 pt co levels even higher than the influent concentration with the employment of intermittent aeration the color in the supernatant decreased to 566 pt co at aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min the highest color removal due to membrane and cake layer was 45 observed in the aeration on off cycle of 90 min 360 min which had the longest aeration off period jegatheesan et al 39 summarized the studies on the treatment of textile wastewater in aerobic mbrs and noted that the cod and color removals ranged between 60 and 97 and 20 98 respectively in the present study the cod removal efficiency ranged between 84 and 91 and no adverse effect of intermittent aeration on the performance was observed the color removal performance was highly variable in the literature and detailed studies with real textile wastewaters under intermittently aerated mbrs are needed around 280 000 tons year textile dyes are released into the receiving environment with wastewater and 60 of these are azo dyes which may have carcinogenic and mutagenic properties 40 conventional aerobic biological systems are not sufficient for azo dye removal and combined processes including anaerobic biological ones may be required for more effective color removal 41 in the biological processes azo dye must be reduced to aromatic compounds under anaerobic conditions however the presence of molecular oxygen in the environment inhibits the enzyme responsible for azo dye reduction 42 in a study investigating the intermittent aeration effect on azo dye removal batch reactors containing glucose and direct black 22 were aerated at different numbers of cycles 0 4 and 8 numbers d where each cycle was run 1 h with 2 5 l min of air flowrate the lowest decolorization was observed in the highest aeration cycle due to the oxygen usage as an electron acceptor instead of azo dye also the authors reported that the intermittent aeration process increased the biodegradation of azo dyes but decreased the rate of decolorization 43 the average alkalinity of the wastewater was 974 195 mg caco3 l and different consumption rates were observed depending on the nitrification and denitrification performances in the periods fig s1 while there was approximately 51 alkalinity consumption in the first period the consumption decreased to around 38 with the decreasing do to 3 mg l and the aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min in the following periods alkalinity consumption gradually decreased to 20 26 until on off durations of 90 min 90 min p7 the alkalinity consumption increased to 43 in p7 and varied again between 22 and 34 in the following periods in the nitrification process 7 14 mg caco3 per mg n nh4 is consumed while 3 57 mg caco3 is produced per mg n no3 in the denitrification process 44 the tp in the wastewater averaged 4 1 mg l and it decreased to an average of 2 3 0 9 in the permeate throughout the study fig s2 while the phosphorus removal efficiency was between 63 and 66 in the periods when the do was 6 and 3 mg l the phosphorus removal efficiency decreased to 42 43 with the intermittent aeration process at the on off time of 60 min 60 min a rapid decrease in the phosphorus removal performance was detected at the aeration on off cycle of 90 min 90 min as it ranged between 15 and 25 however it increased to 47 48 again by increasing the aeration off duration to 360 min biological p removal relies on the selection and proliferation of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos that need to be favored due to their disadvantageous of lower yield compared to heterotrophic bacteria their survival is attained by employing an anaerobic phase for rapid substrate uptake with no electron acceptor which enables the growth of pao in subsequent anoxic and aerobic conditions slightly higher removal efficiency in the continuous aerobic phases is attributed to assimilation intermittent aeration may have enabled the growth of paos that could be responsible for a certain fraction of p removal which is supported by the 48 removal achieved at p9 however the overall removal mechanism is believed to be dominated by assimilation since the results reveal less p removal with decreasing vss in the intermittent aeration phases 3 1 2 nitrogen removal complete ammonium oxidation was achieved in the system during the first three periods fig 2 and table 2 the decrease of do concentration to 3 mg l and the changing aeration on off durations according to table 1 somehow affected the nitrification performance by increasing the aeration on off durations to 15 min 15 min the ammonium concentration in the permeate reached 24 mg l n nh4 and the oxidation performance in the period averaged 72 however with increasing the on off durations to 30 min 30 min the ammonium oxidation efficiency increased to 95 and remained above 89 in the following periods p 0 05 the optimum temperature for nitrification is known to be 30 35 c 45 and the nitrification efficiency was already above 90 before the temperature was increased in the system fig 2 during the denitrification process nitrite accumulation occurs mostly due to the slower reduction of nitrite than nitrate 46 in our study nitrite was not detected in permeate except for three measurements throughout the study the highest n no3 in permeate was observed at do of 6 mg l the average nitrate concentration which was 60 8 mg n l in the first period gradually decreased to 9 10 mg n l at aeration on off durations of 15 min 15 min this led to testing longer aeration durations in the following periods which recovered the nitrification performance as the nitrate in the permeate raised to 49 4 mg n l at aeration on off durations of 90 min 90 min p7 3 by changing the aeration on off duration to 90 min 180 min the nitrate in permeate decreased to 24 12 mg n l due to increased denitrification performance the highest nitrogen removal efficiency was observed in the last period and the average nitrate in the permeate was 8 3 mg n l and decreased down to 1 5 mg n l the average tn removal efficiency for first two periods was 27 28 and lowering the dissolved oxygen level did not affect tn removal in the following periods when intermittent aeration process was employed tn removal did not change at aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min and remained at the level of 29 with the increase of the aeration on off durations to 15 min 15 min in the p4 the tn removal efficiency increased to 46 while tn removal remained at a level of 43 at aeration on off cycles of 30 min 30 min and 60 min 60 min it decreased to 36 at the aeration on off cycles of 90 min 90 min p7 1 after this period as stated above new denitrifying biomass was added to the bioreactor together with increasing the temperature to around 33 c p7 2 but the nitrogen removal efficiency decreased to 29 in p7 3 the system was fed only during the anoxic phase aeration off cycle in order to increase the cod n ratio during the anoxic phase however no increase in tn removal efficiency was observed and it even decreased to 25 increasing the aeration on off duration to 90 min 180 min and 90 min 360 min p8 and p9 1 provided positive contributions to the tn removal efficiency as it increased to 51 and 44 respectively afterward 200 mg l cod acetate based was externally added to wastewater at on off durations of 90 min 360 min and the tn removal raised to 70 in the last period the mbr was fed with a new batch of wastewater in the absence of external cod supplementation and the tn removal performance reached up 74 p 0 05 fig 2 throughout the study the permeate organic nitrogen concentration was generally 10 mg n l which may have originated from non biodegradable nitrogen containing dyes 47 non biodegradable nitrogen containing organics in the influent and protein part of smps 48 in fig 2 total inorganic nitrogen tin variations in the influent and effluent and the removal performance were illustrated in the last period the average tin removal efficiency increased up to 85 90 which may be resulted from increasing non aerated duration and feeding the reactor only in the non aerated cycle in the intermittent aeration operations high do improves nitrification performance during the aeration period while high denitrification performance can be achieved in the presence of a sufficient amount of carbon at the aeration off cycle 49 in addition the durations of on off cycles are very important to obtain optimum conditions for a high tn removal 50 in order for the nitrification performance to remain at approximately 90 and above the aeration cycle duration should be sufficient i e 30 min or longer according to the present study however the tn removal efficiency remained above 70 only when the aeration off duration was 360 min in the study by lim et al 51 bod removal efficiency and nitrification performance remained above 97 and 99 respectively regardless of the aeration on off durations tested but it was observed that at least 70 min off duration was required for obtaining denitrification efficiency above 82 in an mbr operated under intermittent aeration treating domestic wastewater in another study domestic sewage treatment was investigated in a mesh filtration bio reactor operated under continuous and intermittent aeration conditions while the bod degradation performances were similar in all aeration cycles the highest tn removal performance of 80 was attained at the aeration on off cycle of 1 h 1 h 52 in a study by lim et al 53 domestic wastewater treatment was investigated in an mbr operated at intermittent aeration condition 90 min aeration 60 min non aeration while the cod removal performance ranged from 87 6 to 98 1 the tn removal performance was between 35 and 70 also the authors reported that the length of the anoxic period may not be sufficient for a complete denitrification 53 although several studies have been conducted on domestic wastewater treatment using intermittently aerated mbr a limited amount of studies were conducted on real textile wastewater treatment hence the optimum operating conditions differ a lot which should be due to the different rates and biodegradability of the organics present in both type of wastewaters in the study by fan et al 54 a step feeding strategy increased the removal efficiencies of organics ammonium and total nitrogen in batch operated vertical flow constructed wetlands operated under intermittently aerated conditions the cod n ratio in the anoxic period increased with feeding in the anoxic period only in p7 3 and it also increased the amount of ss and vss in another study the impacts of different c n ratios 4 5 7 and 10 on the treatment performances of an intermittently aerated mbr were investigated at an aeration on off cycle of 60 min 60 min hrt 12 h while the cod removals remained above 97 for all c n ratios the nitrogen removal efficiency increased as the c n ratio increased nitrogen removal efficiency was 62 4 89 1 and 92 9 for c n ratios of 4 5 7 and 10 respectively 55 in our study although the cod tn ratio was around 12 lower tn removal efficiencies may be due to the decreased rate of cod utilization in the denitrification phase and the non biodegradable organic nitrogen in the influent increasing the temperature from 18 25 c to approximately 33 c did not have a clear positive effect on denitrification performance in the study of elefsiniotis and li 56 the temperature in the denitrifying batch tests was increased from 10 c to 20 c and 30 c respectively the greatest positive effect on specific denitrification and carbon consumption rates was observed by the temperature increase from 10 c to 20 c 3 1 3 variations of do and orp do concentration above 1 5 mg l was aimed during the aeration cycles the airflow rate was increased when the do decreased below 1 5 mg l due to sudden changes in the organic load to the mbr in some periods fig s3 however the average do concentration at aeration on off duration of 15 min 15 min decreased to 0 88 0 68 mg l the decrease in nitrification performance at the aeration on off cycle of 15 min 15 min is thought to be due to insufficient oxygen concentration during the aerobic cycle in the anoxic phase the do decreased to 0 07 mg l after the p7 1 the aeration on off of 90 min 90 min fig s3 in addition the variations of do and orp in aerobic and anoxic phases were followed regularly in each period fig s4 do concentration in the aeration off cycles decreased below 0 25 mg l after the first 30 min especially in periods when the anoxic duration was 60 min and longer fig s4 in the intermittent aeration process the presence of oxygen and insufficient organic due to its consumption during the aeration cycle limit denitrification performance 57 in a study a 35 reduction in the specific denitrification rate in the presence of 0 09 mg l oxygen was reported 58 during the first and third periods in which anoxic conditions were limited the average orp varied from 89 to 108 mv in the following periods while the orp at the end of the aerobic cycle varied between 118 and 108 mv it varied between 432 and 70 mv at the end of the anoxic cycles fig s3 in a study by choi et al 59 the treatment of synthetic domestic wastewater in mbr containing microfiltration membrane under different srts was investigated by applying an intermittent aeration cycle of 60 min on 60 min off the maximum and minimum orp values were reported as 246 5 and 11 6 mv respectively at an srt of 30 d and a c n ratio of 4 5 59 cheng and liu 60 investigated anaerobically digested swine wastewater treatment by applying an intermittent cycle of 60 min on 60 min off do values for the aerobic and anoxic cycles were 2 4 6 mg l and 0 2 1 mg l respectively while the orp value varied between 80 and 100 mv in the aerobic phase it was about 0 mv at the end of the anoxic cycle fuerhacker et al 61 reported the orp range for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification as 60 and 198 mv 3 2 impact of aeration on off durations on fouling and the membrane filtration performance 3 2 1 variations of tmp the instantaneous flux in the system was 10 0 17 lmh throughout the study the tmp in the system showed changes depending on the variations of the intermittent aeration on off durations and do concentration fig 3 tmp increased up to 130 mbar in the system and no membrane cleaning was required at do of 6 mg l in p1 after the do was reduced to 3 mg l in p2 tmp increased to 420 mbar in the first five days backwash and physical cleaning were applied to relieve the membrane fouling and the tmp remained below 25 mbar until the end of the period after starting the intermittent aeration cycles fouling formed more rapidly especially when the aeration off duration was 60 min p6 or longer tmp was measured separately in aerobic and anoxic phases at aeration on off durations of 90 min 180 min while no fouling or cake formation was observed in terms of tmp measurement in the aerobic phase it increased up to 180 mbar during the anoxic phase at aeration on off durations of 90 min 180 min by increasing the off duration to 360 min in the last period an increase in tmp was observed even in the aerobic phase the highest tmp values observed in the system were 130 and 420 mbar for aerobic and anoxic cycles respectively at aeration on off durations of 90 min 360 min during the study physical cleaning was sufficient and the tmp in the system decreased near to zero after physical cleaning as seen in fig 3 chemical cleaning was performed only during the period transitions to better observe the effect of the tested operating conditions on tmp changes 3 2 2 svi cst ss vss srf sf and viscosity variations the ss and vss in the system were highly variable fig s5 in the first period ss and vss were 3963 192 and 3583 184 mg l on average and increased to 4668 438 and 4108 338 mg l respectively by reducing the dissolved oxygen to 3 mg l although a decrease was observed in the ss and vss in the p3 and p4 with the initiation of the intermittent aeration process the average ss and vss increased to 4352 255 mg l and 3558 253 mg l respectively at the aeration on off cycle of 30 min 30 min after p7 3 the system was fed during the aeration off cycles in the last periods ss and vss dropped by 56 and 54 respectively compared to the p2 do of 3 mg l in the study by jung et al 62 sludge reduction was investigated in different aerobic and anaerobic cycles and the highest sludge reduction as mlss rate was 69 9 at the aeration on off cycle of 4 h 4 h no correlation was observed between svi and cst values and different do concentrations and different on off durations fig s4 in general high svi values were observed in the system until the aeration off duration of 360 min the average svi was 237 27 ml g and it decreased to 195 8 ml g by decreasing do from 6 to 3 mg l the average svi in the system with intermittent aeration ranged from 136 11 to 229 2 ml g for p3 to p7 in the last period the lowest svi values in the system were observed and the svi averaged 56 7 ml g the average cst decreased from 37 8 to 20 0 3 s with decreasing do from 6 m l to 3 mg l in the system the intermittent aeration process had no adverse effect on the cst which averaged between 15 1 s and 23 6 s sahinkaya et al 28 observed that the intermittent aeration had no impact on cst and svi values but in the present study a partial improvement was observed there was no change in the srf in the p1 and p2 and it remained around 1 28 1014 m kg srf decreased to 1 58 1013 m kg and 5 87 1013 at the aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min and 30 min 30 min respectively however as the aeration off duration was extended in the following periods srf increased to 1 61 1014 m kg 1 99 1014 m kg and 4 17 1014 m kg at the aeration on off durations of 60 min 60 min 90 min 90 min and 90 min 360 min respectively the highest sf values were observed as 1 49 ml min 1 52 ml min and 1 86 ml min in p1 do of 6 mg l p4 the aeration on off durations 15 min 15 min and p5 the aeration on off durations 30 min 30 min respectively and it varied between 0 82 ml min and 1 13 ml min in other periods without observing a clear trend similar trends were observed in the viscosity analysis the viscosity increased from 2 24 cp to 2 67 cp as the do was reduced from 6 mg l to 3 mg l this increase continued with the intermittent aeration process and it was 3 05 cp 3 cp and 4 71 cp at the aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min 15 min 15 min and 30 min 30 respectively contrary to srf a decrease in viscosity was observed by increasing the aeration on off duration further and it decreased to 2 11 cp at the aeration on off cycle of 90 min 360 min the decreases and increases in viscosity are thought to be related to the ss concentrations in another study conducted by kornboonraksa et al 63 sludge viscosity increased as the mlss increased at aeration on off cycles of 60 min 60 min nagaoka and kudo 64 reported that the intermittent aeration process had no effect at high organic loadings but resulted in a lower viscosity at lower organic loadings 3 2 3 smp and eps variations during the p2 do of 3 mg l smp in the supernatant was 29 1 7 mg cod l and decreased to 23 2 mg cod l until the aeration on off durations of 60 min 60 min the smp in supernatant increased to 32 1 mg cod l at the aeration on off durations of 90 min 90 min but decreased back to 24 11 mg cod l when the off duration extended to 360 min smp decreased in the system with the initiation of intermittent aeration one reason may be that with the intermittent aeration in the system bacteria are exposed to biochemical stress due to the low aeration intensity resulting in a lower concentration of smp 65 the carbohydrate and protein content of smp in supernatant varied between 58 and 76 and 42 24 respectively independent of the operating periods a more stable trend was observed in the average smp concentration in permeate and it was 15 3 5 mg cod l throughout the study the average carbohydrate and protein contents of smp in permeate were 54 62 and 46 38 respectively and higher carbohydrate rejection by the membrane and cake layer was observed no significant changes were detected in eps concentrations throughout the study as it averaged 32 7 mg cod g vss with approximately 23 and 77 of loosely lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps respectively while the carbohydrate and protein contents of lb eps ranged between 35 47 and 65 53 until the aeration on off durations of 90 min 90 min both contents were 58 and 42 at the aeration on off cycle of 90 min 360 min respectively the contents of carbohydrate and protein in the tb eps were 57 67 and 43 33 respectively carbohydrate and protein contents are closely related to fouling and a high p c ratio cause high sludge hydrophobicity 66 in our previous study 30 similar smp and eps concentrations were obtained in the mbr system treating real textile wastewater under continuous aeration at srt of 30 d however while the rejection of supernatant smp by the membrane and the cake was 53 it decreased to 24 in this study also a higher percentage of lb eps and protein contents in the smp and eps were observed in the present study fig 4 3 2 4 molecular weights of dissolved organic molecules prior to gpc analyses samples were filtered through a 0 45 pore sized filter the gpc results of wastewater supernatant and permeate samples are illustrated in fig s6 although the permeate peaks were relatively lower similar peaks were detected in the wastewater supernatant and permeate of mbr in the all samples only four peaks were observed corresponding to approximately 23 kda 5 kda 1 kda and 0 3 kda until the last period while peaks corresponding to approximately 22 kda 4 kda 0 7 kda and 0 3 kda were observed in the wastewater and supernatant another peak of 1 8 kda was identified in the permeate at the aeration on off cycles of 90 min 360 min in addition it was observed that the peak signals in all periods were very close to each other except for the p5 3 2 5 particle size distribution of mbr mixed liquor particle size distribution psd analyzes for each operating condition are shown in fig s7 according to the psd results particles generally clustered between 1 and 955 Î¼m in the supernatant an increase in particle size was observed with decreasing do concentration and increasing aeration off duration with the highest mean diameter observed at the aeration on off cycle of 90 min 360 min the mean diameter in the supernatant was 34 and 58 Î¼m at the do concentration of 6 and 3 mg l respectively with the start of intermittent aeration in the system it increased to 70 Î¼m at the aeration on off cycle of 2 min 2 min and then it decreased to 38 Î¼m at the aeration on off durations of 15 min 15 min which may be due to limited aeration during the aeration on cycle as mentioned before in the aeration on off cycle of 30 min 30 min the mean diameter increased to 71 Î¼m and remained between 111 and 131 Î¼m in the following periods floc formation is closely related to the aeration process and high aeration intensity caused dispersion in the sludge flocs size ranges from 100 to 500 Î¼m and therefore micro flocs size ranges from 10 to 15 Î¼m are formed inside the reactor 65 in the present study a high mean diameter of over 100 Î¼m was observed especially in the prolonged aeration off periods 3 2 6 ftir analyses ft ir spectra results for each operating condition throughout the study are given in fig s8 similar characteristic peaks in each condition were observed at 618 800 875 1021 1100 1260 1406 1450 1540 1640 1720 2850 2920 and 3280 1 cm in the study conducted by sahinkaya et al 28 2920 1 cm and 2850 1 cm peaks were observed which may be due to aliphatic c h stretching in addition 1540 1 cm and 1245 1260 1 cm peaks were observed which may be due to unique protein structure specified amides ii n h in plane and iii c n stretching respectively 1720 1 cm corresponds to the carboxylic groups associated with the typical properties of humic and fulvic acids 67 the spectrum between 3411 1 cm and 3288 1 cm represents the o h stretching of the o h bond in the hydroxyl functional groups 68 875 and 1640 1 cm can be attributed to strong carbonate bands and amide bands i co vibration respectively 69 the spectrum around 600 and 900 1100 1 cm may be attributed to inorganic sulfur compounds and si o stretch of clay minerals and si o si vibration of silica respectively 70 1450 1 cm can be attributed c h bending for c h group 71 3 2 7 sem eds analysis and inorganic components in the mbr the sem images of the clean and cake deposited membrane surfaces are given in figs s9 ca mg si and na peaks were identified in the cake layer in period 9 fig 5 similar results were obtained in other periods mg al fe ca and si have important effects on gel layer formation 72 and contribute to a dense cake layer formation bridging cells and biopolymers 31 3 3 impact of aeration on off cycles on observed yield and specific energy requirements for aeration the variation of yobs values and energy requirements for aeration at different operating conditions are shown in fig 6 yobs varied between 0 16 and 0 23 mg ss mg cod in between p1 and p5 the aeration on off durations of 30 min 30 min however with the increase of the aeration off duration a serious decrease was observed in the yobs and it ranged between 0 09 and 0 13 ss mg cod in the following periods in the literature a 12 6 decrease in sludge yield was reported in the longer non aeration durations 73 due to the consumption of organic matter during denitrification rather than aerobic oxidation 11 as the aeration on off duration increased 48 less waste sludge was generated in the last period compared to p1 continuous aeration silva et al 74 investigated post treatment of anaerobic process effluent in a structured bed reactor less sludge production was reported with the intermittent aeration process in another study sludge production was observed as 8 56 8 35 7 39 and 5 79 kg d for continuous aeration and the aeration durations of 2 5 h 0 5 h 2 h 1 h 1 5 h 1 h respectively in a pilot scale fixed film integrated activated sludge system hence intermittent aeration has several benefits including less sludge generation compared to the conventional aerobic process in general the amount of energy requirement for aeration constitutes approximately 40 75 of the total energy amount 75 nitrogen and carbon removal in a single reactor with intermittent aeration offers an opportunity to minimize the energy requirement 76 due to several reasons including the consumption of organic matter in an anoxic condition instead of an aerobic condition the acceleration of nitrifying bacterial activities under intermittent aeration condition 11 and the increased possibility of short cut denitrification doan and lohi 77 reported energy savings of 27 58 with intermittent aeration for wastewater treatment in their study on the other hand dan et al 78 reported 60 energy savings with intermittent cycle extended aeration systems in our study while the experimentally determined specific energy requirement for aeration was 1 7 kwh m3 during continuous aeration at do of 6 mg l it decreased to 0 9 kwh m3 with the reduction of do to 3 mg l the specific energy requirement averaged 0 53 0 06 kwh m3 under intermittent aeration conditions corresponding to around 69 and 42 reductions compared to p1 and p2 respectively 4 conclusion real textile wastewater treatment was evaluated in an mbr under different do concentrations 6 and 3 mg l and the intermittent aeration periods on off durations from 2 min 2 min to 90 min 360 min the highest tn removal efficiency was

12406,uncontrolled discharge of textile industry wastewater defined by its highly toxic content causes serious problems in receiving environment especially nitrogen derived pollutants in wastewater threaten the ecosystem and aquatic life separate or simultaneous nitrification denitrification is the preferred biological processes for removing nitrogen based pollutants from wastewater this study aimed to evaluate the impact of aeration on off cycle durations on organic matter color and nitrogen removal performances in an intermittently aerated membrane bioreactor mbr receiving real textile wastewater for this purpose the mbr was operated under different dissolved oxygen concentrations 6 and 3 mg l and the aeration on off cycle durations from 2 min 2 min to 90 min 360 min at a constant flux of 10 l m2 h while the chemical oxygen demand cod removal performance ranged from 84 to 91 the color removal efficiencies were highly variable nitrification performance of 89 was achieved with a minimum of 30 min aeration cycles the highest denitrification efficiency was obtained in the cycle with 360 min aeration off duration intermittent aeration provided higher tn removal less sludge generation and lower energy requirements for aeration the impacts of aeration cycle duration on membrane filtration performance and foulant characterization were also investigated by fourier transform

abstract unlabelled image keywords textile wastewater membrane bioreactor intermittent aeration nitrogen removal filtration performance data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction textile industry produces 50 400 l of wastewater per kg product and it causes many serious environmental problems in the receiving environment due to its toxic content 1 textile industry wastewater contains high levels of organic matter color solids dyestuffs metals and nitrogen 2 the nitrogen concentration of textile wastewater varies depending on the method and technology used in the dyeing process 3 in the literature higher nitrogen concentrations in textile industry wastewater have been reported in recent studies for example the total nitrogen tn and ammonium nitrogen n nh4 in wastewater in the balancing tank of a fabric printing factory located in the textile region of como italy were 105 9 24 9 mg n l and 93 1 23 4 mg n l respectively 4 around 120 140 mg tn l in the influent of textile wastewater taken from a small sized factory making zippers in shenzhen guangdong china was reported 5 the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn concentration of wastewater from the j textile factory in seoul korea was measured between 86 and 145 mg l 6 uncontrolled discharge of nitrogen containing wastewater into the receiving environment causes eutrophication and adverse effects on ecological balance 7 nitrification and denitrification are the two preferred biological processes for nitrogen removal from wastewater in the nitrification process ammonium is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate in aerobic conditions 8 by ammonia oxidizing and nitrite oxidizing bacteria respectively 9 in the denitrification process nitrate or nitrite is converted to nitrogen gas by heterotrophic and or autotrophic microorganisms under anoxic conditions 10 the intermittent aeration process provides many advantages such as high nitrogen removal performance due to creating appropriate conditions for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification its suitability for low performing wastewater treatment plants retrofitting lower energy requirement and less sludge problems 11 intermittent aeration provides energy savings between 33 and 45 compared to conventional processes which may be due to the possibility of denitrification over nitrite 12 intermittent aeration process is preferred in many different systems such as sequencing batch reactors sbr 13 14 constructed wetlands 15 16 activated sludge systems 17 baffled reactors 18 and membrane bioreactors mbr 19 in particular mbrs provide advantages such as effective filtration higher effluent quality less sludge production low footprint as well as high nitrogen removal efficiency compared to conventional biological systems 20 there are some studies in the literature on wastewater treatment performances of intermittently aerated mbrs under varying operational conditions in one of these studies conducted by kim et al 21 cod and tn removal efficiencies were 95 2 and 72 7 respectively in a full scale treatment plant consisting of an anaerobic reactor two modified intermittent aeration reactors a deoxygenation deox tank and aerobic mbr for sewage treatment in another study a pilot scale mbr process consisting of aerobic anoxic membrane and deox tanks was operated for municipal wastewater treatment at different aeration on off cycle durations the highest efficiencies obtained at the aeration on off cycle durations of 80 min 100 min were 96 9 78 27 and 75 14 for nitrification denitrification and total nitrogen removal respectively 22 instead of achieving the nitrification and denitrification processes in two separate tanks with internal recirculation optimum conditions for both processes may be created in a single system to minimize the size of treatment plants 23 the success of the nitrification and denitrification processes in a single system may be highly affected by parameters such as dissolved oxygen do carbon nitrogen c n ratio hydraulic retention time hrt and aeration anoxic cycles 24 anoxic denitrifying bacteria are sensitive to the presence of oxygen 25 and theoretically at least 2 86 mg cod mg n must be provided in the system for heterotrophic denitrification 26 also slow growing autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria are generally recognized as the rate limiting step in the nitrification process and an adequate amount of nitrifiers should be present in the system for effective biological nitrogen removal 27 there are limited studies in the literature on the real textile wastewater treatment using an mbr process in which intermittent aeration is appalled in the study by sahinkaya et al 28 the effect of different aeration on off cycle durations 5 min 3 min 1 min 10 min and 1 min 15 min on the dye and chromium removal performances of a dynamic membrane bioreactor treating synthetic textile wastewater was evaluated the ammonium nitrogen in the synthetic wastewater was 33 2 mg l and it decreased 1 3 1 mg l in the permeate at the aeration on off cycle of 5 min 3 min and 1 min 10 min whereas it increased up 28 mg l at the aeration on off cycle of 1 min 15 min the average cod removal efficiency was 96 until the aeration on off durations of 1 min 15 min 28 the present study aims to determine and compare carbon and nitrogen removal performances of a real textile industry wastewater at varying do concentrations do of 6 and 3 mg l and the different aeration on off cycle durations from 2 min 2 min to 90 min 360 min in an intermittently aerated mbr including a hollow fiber ultrafiltration uf membrane membrane filtration performance and fouling tendency for each operating condition were discussed in detail also organic and inorganic membrane foulants under the different aeration off cycle durations were characterized with the ft ir sem sem eds gpc and psd analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor in the study a cylindrical lab scale submerged mbr system with an effective volume of 7 l was used influent permeate and recirculation flows were controlled with peristaltic pumps longer pump bt600 2 j seko pr7 a hollow fiber pvdf 0 04 Î¼m pore sized ultrafiltration membrane suez with a surface area of 0 23 m2 was used in the mbr in order to reduce membrane fouling filtration was applied intermittently in 6 min cycles employing 5 min of permeation and 1 min of relaxation differential pressure values in the system were monitored with a manometer daily excess sludge was removed from the system manually the system was aerated through a compressor operated according to the predetermined on off durations with a timer in addition an automation system was used for adjusting intermittent aeration and pump operation when feeding was done only in anoxic conditions 2 2 wastewater and biomass source the system was fed with wastewater 95 of which was of textile wastewater origin obtained from the demirtaÅ organized industrial zone dosab wastewater treatment plant located in bursa turkey general information about the treatment plant was previously provided by sahinkaya et al 29 and the wastewater characterization for this study is given in table s1 the mbr previously operated under aerobic conditions at an srt and an hrt of 30 d and 1 d respectively for around 250 days 30 was used in the present study 2 3 operating conditions the system operated under nine different main periods p1 p9 for approximately 472 days the hrt and srt in the system were constant at 1 d and 30 d respectively the average and instantaneous fluxes in the system were 8 3 and 10 lmh respectively and a certain portion of the permeate was continuously fed back into the system to keep hrt constant at 1 day for this case average influent permeate and recirculation flow rates were set to 7 46 and 39 l d respectively during the first two periods p1 p2 the system was continuously aerated to have do of 6 and 3 mg l respectively then the system was tested under intermittent aeration conditions in the periods between p3 and p7 1 aeration on off cycle durations were varied between 2 min 2 min and 90 min 90 min table 1 in order to improve the tn removal performance in the system the temperature in the reactor was first increased to around 30 c close to the operating temperature of the real treatment plant and then 2 5 l sludge 2515 mg vss l taken from a real scale 5 stage bardenpho mbr process was added to system in p7 2 up to p7 3 the system was fed intermittently in both on and off cycles similar to filtration process then the wastewater was fed to the system only during the aeration off cycles by this way the system was tested at different aeration intermittencies while observing the effects of employing different feeding patterns elevated temperature and culture supplementation in p8 and p9 1 aeration on off durations were set to 90 min 180 min and 90 min 360 min respectively in order to increase the cod n ratio in p9 2 200 mg cod l acetate was externally supplied to the wastewater and its effect on the tn removal efficiency was investigated in the last period the system was fed with a new batch wastewater with a relatively high cod content tmp was monitored regularly to determine membrane filtration performance according to the procedure provided by yurtsever et al 31 physical and chemical cleanings were performed when tmp exceeded 200 and 400 mbar in the system respectively the removal performance of the system was followed via regular measurements of cod tn nitrate nitrite color etc the do and oxidation reduction potential orp values were regularly monitored in the system for the sludge filterability properties regular measurements of supernatant filterability sf specific resistance to filtration srf sludge volume index svi viscosity and capillary suction time cst were conducted soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps concentrations as carbohydrate and protein fractions were determined at different aeration on off durations the gpc ft ir sem edx and psd analyses were performed to characterize the organic and inorganic foulants observed sludge yield yobs and energy requirement for aeration in each operating condition were calculated as given by 30 the airflow requirements were calculated by assuming the average do concentration during the aeration cycles of intermittent aeration periods around 2 5 mg l and the oxygen transfer efficiency of the diffuser as 5 m then energy requirements were calculated based on the theoretically determined airflow rates and the actual airflow rates measured during the experiments 2 4 analytical methods the regular parameters alkalinity cod ss and vss were measured following the standard methods 32 nitrate and nitrite were measured using an ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 thermo fisher scientific usa multimeters hach hq40d wtw multi 3420 were used to measure conductivity ph do and orp parameters inside the bioreactor hach kits were used for tn ammonium and total phosphorus smp and eps samples prepared following the procedure provided by judd and judd 33 and rahman et al 34 were used to measure carbohydrates 35 and protein 36 srf and sf were measured as described by dereli et al 37 cst and viscosity were determined using trion capillary suction timer and brookfield dv e viscometer with using the newtonian model respectively molecular weights of dissolved organic molecules were measured with the gpc agilent 1260 infinity using two pl aquagel oh mixed h columns mobile phase 0 02 nan3 w v t 30 c q 1 ml min ftir samples were prepared according to the method given by yurtsever et al 38 and measured with perkin elmer spectrum two ftir device psd on the samples taken from the bioreactor was measured using a mastersizer malvern 2000mu at yildiz technical university application and research center for science and technology biÌtuam istanbul turkey for sem eds measurements the operating conditions in the bioreactor were simulated in the dead end filtration system since no observable cake layer was formed on the hollow fiber membrane used in the mbr for this purpose 200 ml sludge sample was drawn from the mbr and sludge cake was formed in the dead end filtration system by filtration at 0 5 bar through the membrane with 0 22 Î¼m pore size sem images were taken on the membrane sample using the geminisem 500 device at osmangazi university central research laboratory application and research center arum eskiÅehir turkey eds analyzes were performed on the same membrane for detecting inorganic contaminants in the cake layer the statistical analysis of the data was performed according to our previous study 30 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance of intermittently aerated mbr 3 1 1 variations of ph conductivity cod color alkalinity and phosphate in the mbr the ph and conductivity of the feed wastewater showed no appreciable change throughout the study averaging 8 2 0 5 and 5673 1168 Î¼s cm respectively fig s1 total cod in wastewater averaged 793 173 mg l of which approximately 70 was soluble cod in the continuously aerated periods p1 and p2 the removal efficiencies were above 91 and the permeate cod averaged 64 13 mg l at do of 3 mg l fig 1 employing different aeration on off durations resulted in cod removal efficiency to vary only between 84 and 90 different do concentrations and on off durations did not negatively affect the overall cod degradation efficiency p 0 05 interestingly when the operating do concentration was decreased from 6 mg l to 3 mg l the cod in the supernatant was reduced from 295 83 mg l to 133 18 mg l the supernatant cod in the intermittently aerated periods was also lower than that in p1 which may be due to high agitation conditions in p1 causing the release of a part of eps to the supernatant approximately 24 of the total cod was rejected by the membrane and the cake in the first period in the following periods the rejection by membrane and cake layer varied between 3 and 14 while the removal due to the cake layer increased as the aeration off duration increased table 2 the average color in the feed and permeate were 1171 458 pt co and 570 108 pt co respectively fig 1 no correlation was observed between color removal efficiency and different do concentrations and aeration on off cycle durations p 0 05 while the lowest removal efficiency was observed at aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min the highest removal efficiency was obtained as 68 at the aeration on off duration of 90 min 90 min considering the supernatant and permeate colors approximately 7 to 45 contribution to the total removal efficiency depending on the periods was due to the cake layer color accumulation was observed in the system especially at do of 6 mg l as the color in the supernatant increased up to 1133 pt co levels even higher than the influent concentration with the employment of intermittent aeration the color in the supernatant decreased to 566 pt co at aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min the highest color removal due to membrane and cake layer was 45 observed in the aeration on off cycle of 90 min 360 min which had the longest aeration off period jegatheesan et al 39 summarized the studies on the treatment of textile wastewater in aerobic mbrs and noted that the cod and color removals ranged between 60 and 97 and 20 98 respectively in the present study the cod removal efficiency ranged between 84 and 91 and no adverse effect of intermittent aeration on the performance was observed the color removal performance was highly variable in the literature and detailed studies with real textile wastewaters under intermittently aerated mbrs are needed around 280 000 tons year textile dyes are released into the receiving environment with wastewater and 60 of these are azo dyes which may have carcinogenic and mutagenic properties 40 conventional aerobic biological systems are not sufficient for azo dye removal and combined processes including anaerobic biological ones may be required for more effective color removal 41 in the biological processes azo dye must be reduced to aromatic compounds under anaerobic conditions however the presence of molecular oxygen in the environment inhibits the enzyme responsible for azo dye reduction 42 in a study investigating the intermittent aeration effect on azo dye removal batch reactors containing glucose and direct black 22 were aerated at different numbers of cycles 0 4 and 8 numbers d where each cycle was run 1 h with 2 5 l min of air flowrate the lowest decolorization was observed in the highest aeration cycle due to the oxygen usage as an electron acceptor instead of azo dye also the authors reported that the intermittent aeration process increased the biodegradation of azo dyes but decreased the rate of decolorization 43 the average alkalinity of the wastewater was 974 195 mg caco3 l and different consumption rates were observed depending on the nitrification and denitrification performances in the periods fig s1 while there was approximately 51 alkalinity consumption in the first period the consumption decreased to around 38 with the decreasing do to 3 mg l and the aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min in the following periods alkalinity consumption gradually decreased to 20 26 until on off durations of 90 min 90 min p7 the alkalinity consumption increased to 43 in p7 and varied again between 22 and 34 in the following periods in the nitrification process 7 14 mg caco3 per mg n nh4 is consumed while 3 57 mg caco3 is produced per mg n no3 in the denitrification process 44 the tp in the wastewater averaged 4 1 mg l and it decreased to an average of 2 3 0 9 in the permeate throughout the study fig s2 while the phosphorus removal efficiency was between 63 and 66 in the periods when the do was 6 and 3 mg l the phosphorus removal efficiency decreased to 42 43 with the intermittent aeration process at the on off time of 60 min 60 min a rapid decrease in the phosphorus removal performance was detected at the aeration on off cycle of 90 min 90 min as it ranged between 15 and 25 however it increased to 47 48 again by increasing the aeration off duration to 360 min biological p removal relies on the selection and proliferation of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos that need to be favored due to their disadvantageous of lower yield compared to heterotrophic bacteria their survival is attained by employing an anaerobic phase for rapid substrate uptake with no electron acceptor which enables the growth of pao in subsequent anoxic and aerobic conditions slightly higher removal efficiency in the continuous aerobic phases is attributed to assimilation intermittent aeration may have enabled the growth of paos that could be responsible for a certain fraction of p removal which is supported by the 48 removal achieved at p9 however the overall removal mechanism is believed to be dominated by assimilation since the results reveal less p removal with decreasing vss in the intermittent aeration phases 3 1 2 nitrogen removal complete ammonium oxidation was achieved in the system during the first three periods fig 2 and table 2 the decrease of do concentration to 3 mg l and the changing aeration on off durations according to table 1 somehow affected the nitrification performance by increasing the aeration on off durations to 15 min 15 min the ammonium concentration in the permeate reached 24 mg l n nh4 and the oxidation performance in the period averaged 72 however with increasing the on off durations to 30 min 30 min the ammonium oxidation efficiency increased to 95 and remained above 89 in the following periods p 0 05 the optimum temperature for nitrification is known to be 30 35 c 45 and the nitrification efficiency was already above 90 before the temperature was increased in the system fig 2 during the denitrification process nitrite accumulation occurs mostly due to the slower reduction of nitrite than nitrate 46 in our study nitrite was not detected in permeate except for three measurements throughout the study the highest n no3 in permeate was observed at do of 6 mg l the average nitrate concentration which was 60 8 mg n l in the first period gradually decreased to 9 10 mg n l at aeration on off durations of 15 min 15 min this led to testing longer aeration durations in the following periods which recovered the nitrification performance as the nitrate in the permeate raised to 49 4 mg n l at aeration on off durations of 90 min 90 min p7 3 by changing the aeration on off duration to 90 min 180 min the nitrate in permeate decreased to 24 12 mg n l due to increased denitrification performance the highest nitrogen removal efficiency was observed in the last period and the average nitrate in the permeate was 8 3 mg n l and decreased down to 1 5 mg n l the average tn removal efficiency for first two periods was 27 28 and lowering the dissolved oxygen level did not affect tn removal in the following periods when intermittent aeration process was employed tn removal did not change at aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min and remained at the level of 29 with the increase of the aeration on off durations to 15 min 15 min in the p4 the tn removal efficiency increased to 46 while tn removal remained at a level of 43 at aeration on off cycles of 30 min 30 min and 60 min 60 min it decreased to 36 at the aeration on off cycles of 90 min 90 min p7 1 after this period as stated above new denitrifying biomass was added to the bioreactor together with increasing the temperature to around 33 c p7 2 but the nitrogen removal efficiency decreased to 29 in p7 3 the system was fed only during the anoxic phase aeration off cycle in order to increase the cod n ratio during the anoxic phase however no increase in tn removal efficiency was observed and it even decreased to 25 increasing the aeration on off duration to 90 min 180 min and 90 min 360 min p8 and p9 1 provided positive contributions to the tn removal efficiency as it increased to 51 and 44 respectively afterward 200 mg l cod acetate based was externally added to wastewater at on off durations of 90 min 360 min and the tn removal raised to 70 in the last period the mbr was fed with a new batch of wastewater in the absence of external cod supplementation and the tn removal performance reached up 74 p 0 05 fig 2 throughout the study the permeate organic nitrogen concentration was generally 10 mg n l which may have originated from non biodegradable nitrogen containing dyes 47 non biodegradable nitrogen containing organics in the influent and protein part of smps 48 in fig 2 total inorganic nitrogen tin variations in the influent and effluent and the removal performance were illustrated in the last period the average tin removal efficiency increased up to 85 90 which may be resulted from increasing non aerated duration and feeding the reactor only in the non aerated cycle in the intermittent aeration operations high do improves nitrification performance during the aeration period while high denitrification performance can be achieved in the presence of a sufficient amount of carbon at the aeration off cycle 49 in addition the durations of on off cycles are very important to obtain optimum conditions for a high tn removal 50 in order for the nitrification performance to remain at approximately 90 and above the aeration cycle duration should be sufficient i e 30 min or longer according to the present study however the tn removal efficiency remained above 70 only when the aeration off duration was 360 min in the study by lim et al 51 bod removal efficiency and nitrification performance remained above 97 and 99 respectively regardless of the aeration on off durations tested but it was observed that at least 70 min off duration was required for obtaining denitrification efficiency above 82 in an mbr operated under intermittent aeration treating domestic wastewater in another study domestic sewage treatment was investigated in a mesh filtration bio reactor operated under continuous and intermittent aeration conditions while the bod degradation performances were similar in all aeration cycles the highest tn removal performance of 80 was attained at the aeration on off cycle of 1 h 1 h 52 in a study by lim et al 53 domestic wastewater treatment was investigated in an mbr operated at intermittent aeration condition 90 min aeration 60 min non aeration while the cod removal performance ranged from 87 6 to 98 1 the tn removal performance was between 35 and 70 also the authors reported that the length of the anoxic period may not be sufficient for a complete denitrification 53 although several studies have been conducted on domestic wastewater treatment using intermittently aerated mbr a limited amount of studies were conducted on real textile wastewater treatment hence the optimum operating conditions differ a lot which should be due to the different rates and biodegradability of the organics present in both type of wastewaters in the study by fan et al 54 a step feeding strategy increased the removal efficiencies of organics ammonium and total nitrogen in batch operated vertical flow constructed wetlands operated under intermittently aerated conditions the cod n ratio in the anoxic period increased with feeding in the anoxic period only in p7 3 and it also increased the amount of ss and vss in another study the impacts of different c n ratios 4 5 7 and 10 on the treatment performances of an intermittently aerated mbr were investigated at an aeration on off cycle of 60 min 60 min hrt 12 h while the cod removals remained above 97 for all c n ratios the nitrogen removal efficiency increased as the c n ratio increased nitrogen removal efficiency was 62 4 89 1 and 92 9 for c n ratios of 4 5 7 and 10 respectively 55 in our study although the cod tn ratio was around 12 lower tn removal efficiencies may be due to the decreased rate of cod utilization in the denitrification phase and the non biodegradable organic nitrogen in the influent increasing the temperature from 18 25 c to approximately 33 c did not have a clear positive effect on denitrification performance in the study of elefsiniotis and li 56 the temperature in the denitrifying batch tests was increased from 10 c to 20 c and 30 c respectively the greatest positive effect on specific denitrification and carbon consumption rates was observed by the temperature increase from 10 c to 20 c 3 1 3 variations of do and orp do concentration above 1 5 mg l was aimed during the aeration cycles the airflow rate was increased when the do decreased below 1 5 mg l due to sudden changes in the organic load to the mbr in some periods fig s3 however the average do concentration at aeration on off duration of 15 min 15 min decreased to 0 88 0 68 mg l the decrease in nitrification performance at the aeration on off cycle of 15 min 15 min is thought to be due to insufficient oxygen concentration during the aerobic cycle in the anoxic phase the do decreased to 0 07 mg l after the p7 1 the aeration on off of 90 min 90 min fig s3 in addition the variations of do and orp in aerobic and anoxic phases were followed regularly in each period fig s4 do concentration in the aeration off cycles decreased below 0 25 mg l after the first 30 min especially in periods when the anoxic duration was 60 min and longer fig s4 in the intermittent aeration process the presence of oxygen and insufficient organic due to its consumption during the aeration cycle limit denitrification performance 57 in a study a 35 reduction in the specific denitrification rate in the presence of 0 09 mg l oxygen was reported 58 during the first and third periods in which anoxic conditions were limited the average orp varied from 89 to 108 mv in the following periods while the orp at the end of the aerobic cycle varied between 118 and 108 mv it varied between 432 and 70 mv at the end of the anoxic cycles fig s3 in a study by choi et al 59 the treatment of synthetic domestic wastewater in mbr containing microfiltration membrane under different srts was investigated by applying an intermittent aeration cycle of 60 min on 60 min off the maximum and minimum orp values were reported as 246 5 and 11 6 mv respectively at an srt of 30 d and a c n ratio of 4 5 59 cheng and liu 60 investigated anaerobically digested swine wastewater treatment by applying an intermittent cycle of 60 min on 60 min off do values for the aerobic and anoxic cycles were 2 4 6 mg l and 0 2 1 mg l respectively while the orp value varied between 80 and 100 mv in the aerobic phase it was about 0 mv at the end of the anoxic cycle fuerhacker et al 61 reported the orp range for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification as 60 and 198 mv 3 2 impact of aeration on off durations on fouling and the membrane filtration performance 3 2 1 variations of tmp the instantaneous flux in the system was 10 0 17 lmh throughout the study the tmp in the system showed changes depending on the variations of the intermittent aeration on off durations and do concentration fig 3 tmp increased up to 130 mbar in the system and no membrane cleaning was required at do of 6 mg l in p1 after the do was reduced to 3 mg l in p2 tmp increased to 420 mbar in the first five days backwash and physical cleaning were applied to relieve the membrane fouling and the tmp remained below 25 mbar until the end of the period after starting the intermittent aeration cycles fouling formed more rapidly especially when the aeration off duration was 60 min p6 or longer tmp was measured separately in aerobic and anoxic phases at aeration on off durations of 90 min 180 min while no fouling or cake formation was observed in terms of tmp measurement in the aerobic phase it increased up to 180 mbar during the anoxic phase at aeration on off durations of 90 min 180 min by increasing the off duration to 360 min in the last period an increase in tmp was observed even in the aerobic phase the highest tmp values observed in the system were 130 and 420 mbar for aerobic and anoxic cycles respectively at aeration on off durations of 90 min 360 min during the study physical cleaning was sufficient and the tmp in the system decreased near to zero after physical cleaning as seen in fig 3 chemical cleaning was performed only during the period transitions to better observe the effect of the tested operating conditions on tmp changes 3 2 2 svi cst ss vss srf sf and viscosity variations the ss and vss in the system were highly variable fig s5 in the first period ss and vss were 3963 192 and 3583 184 mg l on average and increased to 4668 438 and 4108 338 mg l respectively by reducing the dissolved oxygen to 3 mg l although a decrease was observed in the ss and vss in the p3 and p4 with the initiation of the intermittent aeration process the average ss and vss increased to 4352 255 mg l and 3558 253 mg l respectively at the aeration on off cycle of 30 min 30 min after p7 3 the system was fed during the aeration off cycles in the last periods ss and vss dropped by 56 and 54 respectively compared to the p2 do of 3 mg l in the study by jung et al 62 sludge reduction was investigated in different aerobic and anaerobic cycles and the highest sludge reduction as mlss rate was 69 9 at the aeration on off cycle of 4 h 4 h no correlation was observed between svi and cst values and different do concentrations and different on off durations fig s4 in general high svi values were observed in the system until the aeration off duration of 360 min the average svi was 237 27 ml g and it decreased to 195 8 ml g by decreasing do from 6 to 3 mg l the average svi in the system with intermittent aeration ranged from 136 11 to 229 2 ml g for p3 to p7 in the last period the lowest svi values in the system were observed and the svi averaged 56 7 ml g the average cst decreased from 37 8 to 20 0 3 s with decreasing do from 6 m l to 3 mg l in the system the intermittent aeration process had no adverse effect on the cst which averaged between 15 1 s and 23 6 s sahinkaya et al 28 observed that the intermittent aeration had no impact on cst and svi values but in the present study a partial improvement was observed there was no change in the srf in the p1 and p2 and it remained around 1 28 1014 m kg srf decreased to 1 58 1013 m kg and 5 87 1013 at the aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min and 30 min 30 min respectively however as the aeration off duration was extended in the following periods srf increased to 1 61 1014 m kg 1 99 1014 m kg and 4 17 1014 m kg at the aeration on off durations of 60 min 60 min 90 min 90 min and 90 min 360 min respectively the highest sf values were observed as 1 49 ml min 1 52 ml min and 1 86 ml min in p1 do of 6 mg l p4 the aeration on off durations 15 min 15 min and p5 the aeration on off durations 30 min 30 min respectively and it varied between 0 82 ml min and 1 13 ml min in other periods without observing a clear trend similar trends were observed in the viscosity analysis the viscosity increased from 2 24 cp to 2 67 cp as the do was reduced from 6 mg l to 3 mg l this increase continued with the intermittent aeration process and it was 3 05 cp 3 cp and 4 71 cp at the aeration on off durations of 2 min 2 min 15 min 15 min and 30 min 30 respectively contrary to srf a decrease in viscosity was observed by increasing the aeration on off duration further and it decreased to 2 11 cp at the aeration on off cycle of 90 min 360 min the decreases and increases in viscosity are thought to be related to the ss concentrations in another study conducted by kornboonraksa et al 63 sludge viscosity increased as the mlss increased at aeration on off cycles of 60 min 60 min nagaoka and kudo 64 reported that the intermittent aeration process had no effect at high organic loadings but resulted in a lower viscosity at lower organic loadings 3 2 3 smp and eps variations during the p2 do of 3 mg l smp in the supernatant was 29 1 7 mg cod l and decreased to 23 2 mg cod l until the aeration on off durations of 60 min 60 min the smp in supernatant increased to 32 1 mg cod l at the aeration on off durations of 90 min 90 min but decreased back to 24 11 mg cod l when the off duration extended to 360 min smp decreased in the system with the initiation of intermittent aeration one reason may be that with the intermittent aeration in the system bacteria are exposed to biochemical stress due to the low aeration intensity resulting in a lower concentration of smp 65 the carbohydrate and protein content of smp in supernatant varied between 58 and 76 and 42 24 respectively independent of the operating periods a more stable trend was observed in the average smp concentration in permeate and it was 15 3 5 mg cod l throughout the study the average carbohydrate and protein contents of smp in permeate were 54 62 and 46 38 respectively and higher carbohydrate rejection by the membrane and cake layer was observed no significant changes were detected in eps concentrations throughout the study as it averaged 32 7 mg cod g vss with approximately 23 and 77 of loosely lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps respectively while the carbohydrate and protein contents of lb eps ranged between 35 47 and 65 53 until the aeration on off durations of 90 min 90 min both contents were 58 and 42 at the aeration on off cycle of 90 min 360 min respectively the contents of carbohydrate and protein in the tb eps were 57 67 and 43 33 respectively carbohydrate and protein contents are closely related to fouling and a high p c ratio cause high sludge hydrophobicity 66 in our previous study 30 similar smp and eps concentrations were obtained in the mbr system treating real textile wastewater under continuous aeration at srt of 30 d however while the rejection of supernatant smp by the membrane and the cake was 53 it decreased to 24 in this study also a higher percentage of lb eps and protein contents in the smp and eps were observed in the present study fig 4 3 2 4 molecular weights of dissolved organic molecules prior to gpc analyses samples were filtered through a 0 45 pore sized filter the gpc results of wastewater supernatant and permeate samples are illustrated in fig s6 although the permeate peaks were relatively lower similar peaks were detected in the wastewater supernatant and permeate of mbr in the all samples only four peaks were observed corresponding to approximately 23 kda 5 kda 1 kda and 0 3 kda until the last period while peaks corresponding to approximately 22 kda 4 kda 0 7 kda and 0 3 kda were observed in the wastewater and supernatant another peak of 1 8 kda was identified in the permeate at the aeration on off cycles of 90 min 360 min in addition it was observed that the peak signals in all periods were very close to each other except for the p5 3 2 5 particle size distribution of mbr mixed liquor particle size distribution psd analyzes for each operating condition are shown in fig s7 according to the psd results particles generally clustered between 1 and 955 Î¼m in the supernatant an increase in particle size was observed with decreasing do concentration and increasing aeration off duration with the highest mean diameter observed at the aeration on off cycle of 90 min 360 min the mean diameter in the supernatant was 34 and 58 Î¼m at the do concentration of 6 and 3 mg l respectively with the start of intermittent aeration in the system it increased to 70 Î¼m at the aeration on off cycle of 2 min 2 min and then it decreased to 38 Î¼m at the aeration on off durations of 15 min 15 min which may be due to limited aeration during the aeration on cycle as mentioned before in the aeration on off cycle of 30 min 30 min the mean diameter increased to 71 Î¼m and remained between 111 and 131 Î¼m in the following periods floc formation is closely related to the aeration process and high aeration intensity caused dispersion in the sludge flocs size ranges from 100 to 500 Î¼m and therefore micro flocs size ranges from 10 to 15 Î¼m are formed inside the reactor 65 in the present study a high mean diameter of over 100 Î¼m was observed especially in the prolonged aeration off periods 3 2 6 ftir analyses ft ir spectra results for each operating condition throughout the study are given in fig s8 similar characteristic peaks in each condition were observed at 618 800 875 1021

addition 1540 1 cm and 1245 1260 1 cm peaks were observed which may be due to unique protein structure specified amides ii n h in plane and iii c n stretching respectively 1720 1 cm corresponds to the carboxylic groups associated with the typical properties of humic and fulvic acids 67 the spectrum between 3411 1 cm and 3288 1 cm represents the o h stretching of the o h bond in the hydroxyl functional groups 68 875 and 1640 1 cm can be attributed to strong carbonate bands and amide bands i co vibration respectively 69 the spectrum around 600 and 900 1100 1 cm may be attributed to inorganic sulfur compounds and si o stretch of clay minerals and si o si vibration of silica respectively 70 1450 1 cm can be attributed c h bending for c h group 71 3 2 7 sem eds analysis and inorganic components in the mbr the sem images of the clean and cake deposited membrane surfaces are given in figs s9 ca mg si and na peaks were identified in the cake layer in period 9 fig 5 similar results were obtained in other periods mg al fe ca and si have important effects on gel layer formation 72 and contribute to a dense cake layer formation bridging cells and biopolymers 31 3 3 impact of aeration on off cycles on observed yield and specific energy requirements for aeration the variation of yobs values and energy requirements for aeration at different operating conditions are shown in fig 6 yobs varied between 0 16 and 0 23 mg ss mg cod in between p1 and p5 the aeration on off durations of 30 min 30 min however with the increase of the aeration off duration a serious decrease was observed in the yobs and it ranged between 0 09 and 0 13 ss mg cod in the following periods in the literature a 12 6 decrease in sludge yield was reported in the longer non aeration durations 73 due to the consumption of organic matter during denitrification rather than aerobic oxidation 11 as the aeration on off duration increased 48 less waste sludge was generated in the last period compared to p1 continuous aeration silva et al 74 investigated post treatment of anaerobic process effluent in a structured bed reactor less sludge production was reported with the intermittent aeration process in another study sludge production was observed as 8 56 8 35 7 39 and 5 79 kg d for continuous aeration and the aeration durations of 2 5 h 0 5 h 2 h 1 h 1 5 h 1 h respectively in a pilot scale fixed film integrated activated sludge system hence intermittent aeration has several benefits including less sludge generation compared to the conventional aerobic process in general the amount of energy requirement for aeration constitutes approximately 40 75 of the total energy amount 75 nitrogen and carbon removal in a single reactor with intermittent aeration offers an opportunity to minimize the energy requirement 76 due to several reasons including the consumption of organic matter in an anoxic condition instead of an aerobic condition the acceleration of nitrifying bacterial activities under intermittent aeration condition 11 and the increased possibility of short cut denitrification doan and lohi 77 reported energy savings of 27 58 with intermittent aeration for wastewater treatment in their study on the other hand dan et al 78 reported 60 energy savings with intermittent cycle extended aeration systems in our study while the experimentally determined specific energy requirement for aeration was 1 7 kwh m3 during continuous aeration at do of 6 mg l it decreased to 0 9 kwh m3 with the reduction of do to 3 mg l the specific energy requirement averaged 0 53 0 06 kwh m3 under intermittent aeration conditions corresponding to around 69 and 42 reductions compared to p1 and p2 respectively 4 conclusion real textile wastewater treatment was evaluated in an mbr under different do concentrations 6 and 3 mg l and the intermittent aeration periods on off durations from 2 min 2 min to 90 min 360 min the highest tn removal efficiency was observed at the aeration on off durations of 90 min and 360 min cod removal was over 84 throughout the operation during the treatment of real textile wastewater with the intermittent aeration process the aeration duration should be 30 min for an efficient nitrification performance and the aeration off cycle duration should be 180 min for an acceptable denitrification performance appreciable reductions in yobs and aeration energy requirements were observed with intermittent aeration while the ss vss sf and viscosity decreased under intermittent aeration conditions srf increased no changes were observed in the molecular weights of organic matters in supernatant and permeate in general the average particle size increased as the aeration off cycle duration increased ca mg si and na were

12407,the development of advanced photocatalytic materials for environmental purposes is among the high research topics in the present work a nanocomposite biocl kaol made of kaolinite supported bismuth oxychloride biocl photocatalyst was designed for rhodamine b dye photodegradation in aqueous solution the obtained biocl kaol nanocomposite exhibited high photocatalytic activity in the removal of rhodamine b dye rhb from water with a degradation efficiency reaching 100 within 35 min furthermore it was observed that the nanocomposite photocatalyst biocl 0 4kaol at optimal clay biocl ratio of 0 4 exhibited 4 37 times better photocatalytic performance compared to bare biocl finally to elucidate the photodegradation mechanisms we determined various interactions occurring between biocl and kaolinite particles as well as between rhb molecules and biocl kaol nanocomposites using monte carlo calculations it was concluded from monte carlo calculations that hydrogen bonds were established between oxygen atoms of biocl and h of kaolinite 001 hydroxyl groups upon the adsorption of biocl 003 particles on the kaolinite 001 surface owing to its high negative interaction energy meanwhile van der waals attraction was also established between the rhb molecules and the biocl kaol 001 surface graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biocl kaolinite co precipitation photocatalysis rhodamine b sunlight data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays synthetic dyes are recognized as highly hazardous organic pollutants owing to their complex structures stability in aqueous environments and their highly toxicity 1 3 the continuous environmental pollution caused by these organic substances has resulted in various negative impacts 4 5 rhodamine b rhb is a considered a potentially toxic dye due to its ability to cause various health problems 6 including respiratory tract disorders gastrointestinal disorders skin irritation eye damage 7 furthermore its presence in aquatic medium slows down the photosynthesis process 8 consequently the removal of rhb dye from aquatic system has a high priority attracted the attention of many researchers due to its impact on health and the environment 9 several techniques such as biological treatment 10 physical adsorption 3 11 12 membrane filtration 13 or chemical oxidation 14 have been explored for the remove of rhb dye from aqueous media however all these techniques still have many drawbacks that limits their application particularly processing time low removal efficiency and high costs therefore it is necessary to explore other sustainable and eco friendly techniques to remove rhb dye from aqueous medium 15 advanced oxidation processes aop especially photocatalysis are highly efficient environmentally friendly and cost effective technologies widely used for energy conversion they can result in the production of green hydrogen and fast mineralization of pollutant 16 18 the principle of the heterogeneous photocatalysis is based on the activation of semi conductor materials photocatalyst using either an artificial or natural sunlight radiation source generating electron hole pairs that cause various redox reaction at the photocatalyst surface and leading to the powerful radical s ho o2 ho2 these produced radicals are responsible for the degradation of the pollutant molecules and their conversion into h2o and co2 recently several studies have synthesized actives semiconductors for photodegradation of rhb dye in aqueous solution such as ag3po4 19 zno 20 tio2 21 srhpo4 22 g c3n4 23 however these photocatalysts have many drawbacks which limit their uses such as high cost recombination of electron and hole lower efficiency and their difficult regeneration in recent years biocl photocatalyst have gained attention due to their stability non toxic corrosion resistance remarkable structure fig s1 a good photocatalytic performance as well as their low band gap making them suitable for many applications 24 27 however pure biocl photocatalyst have some disadvantages including their tendency to form agglomerates in solution which can reduce their photocatalytic performance additionally the low photo generated charge separation efficiency can lead to poor photocatalytic activity long treatment time and low photocatalytic power under sunlight to overcome these issues many researchers have attempted to solve these problems and they proposed the establishment of heterojunction between pure biocl and other semiconductors photocatalysts such as cu2o biocl 28 biocl agbr 29 biocl g c3n4 30 biocl wo3 31 however these proposed solutions have disadvantages related to material cost and their suitability for use under sunlight therefore in the present study one potential solution to improve the photocatalytic properties of biocl under sunlight irradiation is to use clay minerals as a support clay minerals were selected due to their high specific surface areas high thermal stabilities and low cost which can help to improve the photocatalytic activity of biocl under sunlight additionally clay minerals can also help to prevent the agglomeration of biocl and can improve the photo generated charge separation efficiency thus leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance the combination of biocl and clay minerals can lead to a photocatalyst having improved stability higher photocatalytic activity and better efficiency under sunlight irradiation 32 33 various clay mineral types such as sepiolite 34 palygorskite 35 and zeolite 36 can be used to prevent semiconductors agglomeration another type of clay can be used to improve the photocatalytic performance is kaolinite this clay is very abundant chemically stable has large surface area it is non toxic and it has a best catalytic performance 33 37 kaolinite is crystallized in the triclinic system with a tetrahedron silica octahedrons alumina 1 1 layer structure fig s1 b c 38 several studies have mostly used kaolinite clay mineral to solve the photocatalysts agglomeration problem as it was observed in systems such as tio2 kaolinite 39 and g c3n4 kaolinite 40 in the present work natural kaolinite was used as support for the biocl in order to improve the photocatalyst performance under sunlight irradiation and to prevent the hole electron pairs photo charged recombination however the use of raw kaolinite clay as a carrier for biocl thus improving the photocatalytic efficiency the stability and reusability of the photocatalyst synthesis of the photocatalyst at low cost successful application of the photocatalyst biocl kaolinite for the degradation of organic dyes in water with high efficiency and long term stability avoid the problem of photocorrosion of the semiconductor therefore the biocl kaol nanocomposite was synthetized by co precipitation method in acidic medium then it was characterized by various methods such as x ray diffraction xrd to study its structures fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir to determine its functional groups scanning electron microscopy sem to observe its topography transmission electron microscopy tem to visualize its morphologies and nanostructures x ray photoelectron spectrometry xps to study the chemical states and chemical composition of the surface and ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv vis drs to study its optical properties the characterized biocl kaol nanocomposite was thereafter used for rapid removal of rhb dye from aqueous solution under sunlight irradiation the adsorption geometries energetics and electron structural properties of compounds were assessed by dft d and md calculations 2 material and methods 2 1 photocatalysts

distilled water and ethanol and dried at 80 c for 12 h and labeled biocl 1 0kaol using similar synthesis procedures biocl kaol with various mass of kaolinite 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 g were prepared and labeled as biocl 0 2kaol biocl 0 4kaol biocl 0 6kaol and biocl 0 8kaol respectively we followed the same experimental protocol to prepare biocl without adding kaolinite fig 1 summarizes the synthesis

measured using a uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra recorded on an uv vis perkin elmer lambda 2 3 photocatalysis process the efficiencies of rhb photodegradation of in aqueous solution by using the various prepared samples were studied under solar light irradiation in a beaker 100 ml of rhb dye 10 mg l was mixed with 100 mg of the photocatalyst prior to the photocatalytic reaction under sunlight

photodegradation of rhb dye was performed between 11 45 am and 12 45 pm during which the solar irradiance was perpendicular to and covered the horizontal surface of the beaker during the photocatalytic reaction 4 ml of the solution was withdrawn each 5 min and then centrifuged the concentration of residual rhb dye was measured using a uv spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu at the wavelength

at a cutoff of 12 5 Ã¥ 43 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd analysis the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of kaolinite the as synthesized biocl and the biocl kaol are presented in fig 2 the xrd peaks observed for pure biocl were attributed to various lattice planes of the tetragonal structure jcpds no 06 0249 the xrd peaks of raw kaolinite clay were assigned to specific planes jcpds no 96 900 9235 as expected the xrd pattern of the serial biocl kaol composites exhibited the both the diffraction peaks of biocl and kaolinite indicating successful support of biocl photocatalysts on the kaolinite additionally the xrd diagram of biocl kaol clearly shows the presence of kaolinite 001 and 002 peaks these x ray data shown in fig 2 confirm that biocl kaol samples were successfully prepared it is interesting to note that the intensities of the kaolinite peaks located at 2Î¸ 12 35 and 2Î¸ 24 85 increase with an increase in the kaolinite biocl weight ratio from 0 2 to 1 0 this finding can be explained by the increase in the mass of kaolinite in the biocl kaol sample furthermore it should be noted that the intensity of biocl 001 peak is slightly increases with an increase in the kaolinite biocl weight ratio from 0 2 to 1 0 suggesting proper support of biocl on the kaolinite surfaces 44 the intensities of the kaolinite peaks 001 and 002 as well as the biocl peaks are strongly reduced in all samples indicating that the kaolinite clay is well retained by biocl nanosheets 32 additionally the intensities of the kaolinite peaks 001 and 002 and biocl peaks increase when increasing the kaolinite biocl weight ratio from 0 2 to 1 0 this is due to the increase in the amount of kaolinite and the crystallinity of biocl is increased when moving the kaolinite biocl weight ratio from 0 2 to 1 0 45 46 3 2 ftir analysis results fig 3 shows the spectra obtained from ftir analysis of all prepared samples the ftir spectrum of raw kaolinite represented by the black line in this figure shows the presence of two characteristics bands at 428 19 cm 1 and 1006 84 cm 1 attributed to the stretching vibration of sio the bands located at 468 70 cm 1 and 1029 98 cm 1 are attributed to the deformation modes of the si o si group the band at 536 cm 1 is attributed to al o si deformation of kaolinite furthermore the characteristic bands at 3618 45 cm 1 and 3697 54 cm 1 correspond to the oh stretching of the al oh and si oh groups respectively 47 on the other hand the ft ir spectrum of pure biocl displays a band located at about 529 37 cm 1 which is attributed to the stretching vibrations of bio 34 the characteristic band with low intensity located at 1635 cm 1 can be associated with the stretching vibration mode of bicl the overall ft ir spectra of all photocatalysts samples show characteristic bands of both the kaolinite clay and the pure biocl with a slight increase of intensity of kaolinite band when its mass increases in the kaolinite biocl weight ratio 3 3 sem analysis results the morphologies and the elementary compositions of the raw kaolinite pure biocl and biocl 0 4kaol are shown in fig 4 the sem images of the raw kaolinite fig 4 a b show that the kaolinite particle consists of tightly packed layered hexagonal morphology due to the presence of hydrogen interaction occurring between the aluminosilicate sheets the sem images of pure biocl particles fig 6 d e exhibit a spherical gathering of many thin nanosheets resulting in uniform micro flower shape moreover fig 4 j h shows the sem images of biocl 0 4kaol nanocomposite from this image it can be observed that the nanosheets of the biocl catalyst are well supported on the kaolinite sheets additionally the edx spectra and mapping of the kaolinite fig 4 c the pure biocl fig 4 f and the biocl 0 4kaol fig 4 i indicate that the raw kaolinite mineral contains the expected elements al si and o and that pure biocl includes the bi o and cl atoms with an equal molar ratio for the biocl 0 4kaol it can be observed that the atoms were evenly distributed throughout the sample indicating that biocl was evenly dispersed on the kaolinite surface 3 4 tem analysis results the morphologies and nanostructures of as synthetized biocl kaol samples were investigated using transmittance electron microscopy fig 5 the fig 5 a b displays the tem images of biocl particles indicating that they consist of two dimensional nanosheets with a diameter size ranging from 0 08 Î¼m to 0 6 Î¼m with the presence of metallic bi nanoparticles the tem images of raw kaolinite fig 5 c d show two dimensional monolayers with a diameter size ranging from 0 5 Î¼m to 1 2 Î¼m regarding the biocl kaol nanocomposite it can be observed from fig 5 e f that the biocl microflowers shaped particles are attached on the surface of kaolinite fig 5 g h display selected areas of the electron diffraction patterns from which we can determine the calculated d spacing values of the corresponding planes 001 200 101 and 111 which are 0 75 nm 0 49 nm 0 39 nm and 0 27 nm respectively the illustrate image indicate that the studied area is monocrystalline 3 5 x ray photoelectron spectrometry xps to understand the photocatalytic reaction it is necessary to study the surface of the photocatalyst the chemical composition and chemical states of biocl kaol surface were characterized using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig 6 displays the xps spectra of biocl kaol and high resolution spectra of its constituent elements as shown in fig 6 a the biocl kaol photocatalyst display signals of al si o bi cl and c elements the xps high resolution spectrum of al 2p exhibits tow peaks at 72 6 ev and 73 1 ev corresponding to the al 2p3 2 and al 2p1 2 respectively fig 6 b the xps high resolution spectra of si 2p shown two peaks located at 100 3 ev 101 4 ev and 102 2 ev are attributed to si o si si o h and sic respectively fig 6 c 34 it can be observed from fig 6 d that the o 1 s exhibits tow peaks found at 528 6 ev 530 5 ev and 531 9 ev which are ascribed to the lattice oxygen in the bio and bi oh bands respectively 37 the xps high resolution spectra of bi 4f was illustrate in fig 6 e demonstrating the presences of two powerful diffraction peaks at the binding energies of 157 9 ev and 163 2 ev corresponding to bi3 4f7 2 and bi3 4f5 2 orbitals respectively 48 the xps high resolution of cl 2p fig 6 f illustrate the peak at 196 5 ev due to cl 2p3 2 and the peak at198 1 ev due to cl 2p1 2 in biocl respectively 49 50 additionally the comparison of xps spectra of bi 4f and o 1 s in the pure biocl and biocl kaol composites fig 6 d and e clearly show that the peaks of bi 4f 7 2 and bi 4f 5 2 are shifted from the binding energies of 157 2 ev and 162 5 ev to 157 9 ev and 163 2 ev respectively however for the o 1 s we can observe the peak assigned to the bio band moving from the binding energy of 527 9 ev to 528 6 ev then after be slightly coupled with the bi oh band in the biocl kaol composite this means that the biocl nanosheets are homogeneously combined with kaolinite particles indicating that the biocl kaolinite composites have been successfully synthesized 3 6 optical absorption properties and band gap energy of samples the optical properties of the raw kaolinite pure biocl and the different biocl kaol samples having various kaolinite biocl weight ratios were studied using uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs fig 7 a illustrate the uv vis absorption spectrum of as prepared samples in the range of 200 800 nm it can be observed that the absorption edge wavelengths of pure biocl raw kaolinite biocl 0 2kaol biocl 0 4kaol biocl 0 6kaol biocl 0 8kaol and biocl 1 0kaol are located at 390 420 385 400 375 380 and 383 nm respectively it should be noted that the observed higher absorption capacity of raw kaolinite in the visible light range results from the heterogeneous construction of the tetrahedral and the octahedral aluminosilicate sheets 15 in contrast the biocl 0 4kaol sample displays the best absorption capacity band edge absorption of 400 nm in the visible light compared to the others samples with various kaolinite biocl weight ratios and pure biocl moreover the band gap energies of the synthetized catalysts are described by the tauc s equation as follow eq 4 36 4 Î±hÎ½ c hÎ½ e g n 2 where Î± hÎ½ c and eg are the absorption coefficient the photon energy proportional constant and band gap energy respectively the value of n depends on the property of the semiconductor n 1 or 4 for direct band gap or indirect band gap separately for a semiconductor with indirect band gap biocl the value of n is equal 4 the band gap energy of each semiconductor can be determined by extrapolating the tangent of the curve Î±hÎ½ c hÎ½ e g n 2 on the axis hÎ½ fig 7 b shows the plot of Î±hv 0 5 versus the photon energy the estimated band gap energy eg of as prepared catalysts are presented in table s1 the estimated values eg for pure biocl and biocl 0 4kaol were approximately 3 32 and 3 19 ev respectively therefore the band gap for the sample having the optimal kaolinite biocl weight ratio of 0 4 is the lowest compared to the others clay biocl weight ratios 3 7 photocatalytic degradation of rhb dye the photocatalytic process of the samples was investigated in rhb solution at room temperature under sunlight irradiation fig 8 shows the adsorption desorption equilibrium test photolysis absence of photocatalyst and photocatalysis tests as shown in fig 8 a in the case of photolysis process without photocatalyst the rate of degradation of rhb dye did not exceed 2 after 60 min consequently it can be concluded that the photodegradation of rhb dye is not possible using photolysis adsorption tests for all samples show that the highest adsorption efficiency is 44 43 after 60 min recorded by the biocl 0 4kaol the results in fig 8 a revealed that biocl kaol composites have good degradation efficiencies as compared to pure biocl additionally the biocl 0 4kaol composite presents the highest photocatalytic performance de 100 in the first 35 min of irradiation compared to the others samples fig 8 b the lowest degradation efficiency of the pure biocl is 71 is due to the electron hole recombination and agglomeration phenomena of biocl additionally total organic carbon toc analysis was conducted to verify the mineralization efficiency of the rhb solution using the biocl and biocl 0 4kaol photocatalysts as shown in fig 8 c the toc removal rates were approximately 41 60 and 95 51 for biocl and biocl 0 4kaol respectively these findings confirm the catalytic degradation of the rhb dye into co2 and h2o while also indicating the presence of some intermediate rhb molecules in the medium to evaluate the origin of this exceptional photocatalytic degradation a scavenger study was conducted to confirm the radical responsible for the degradation of rhb therefore the kinetic of photodegradation of as prepared biocl 0 2kaol biocl 0 4kaol biocl 0 6kaol biocl 0 8kaol biocl 1 0kaol biocl and kaolinite have been further examined according to the langmuir hinshelwood model using the first order kinetic formula eq 5 5 ln c 0 c t k t the rate constant k min 1 is determinate graphically from the slopes of the linear plots fig 9 a the values of k min 1 are presented in fig 9 b from these results all the apparent reaction rate constant k min 1 values corresponding to the biocl kaol composites are superior to those obtained for pure biocl ones and k biocl 0 4kaol has a significant value k 0 1355 min 1 it is interesting to note that the rate constant for biocl 0 4kaol was 4 26 times that of pure biocl fig 9 b these results confirm that the surface and structure of the kaolinite clay play a very important role in improving the rapidity of degradation of rhb dye 3 8 simulation methods 3 8 1 quantum calculations to obtain optimized structures and energies the generalized gradient approximation gga using the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe functional were adopted and the stable configurations are shown in fig s3 a c total energy of kaol biocl and rhb was obtained 27 740 463 1243 137 and 1880 764 ha respectively the geometric parameters of kaol biocl and rhb are summarized in table s2 3 8 2 modeling by monte carlo adsorption locator simulation after optimization of compounds by quantum calculations the adsorption of 5 biocl 003 molecules on kaol 001 was investigated to make biocl kaol by adsorption locator module and force field universal in materials studio 2017 software the electrostatic and van der waals was calculated using the group summation method 51 the lowest energy structures of biocl kaol through md calculations are presented in fig s4 the total energy of the adsorption system for biocl kaol was obtained about 2 023 103 kcal mol demonstrating the exothermic and stability of the adsorption system owing to its high negative interaction energy the negatively charged regions were mainly distributed around the o atoms of the lying hydroxyl on kaolinite 001 surface 52 biocl molecules were approximately parallel on oh groups in addition to si terminated 001 surface of the kaolinite in the equilibrium configurations in addition the kaolinite 001 surface had the ability to form three hydrogen bonds between o atoms of biocl and oh groups of kaol 001 with 3 Ã¥ fig s5 in next stage biocl kaol adsorbate was prepared to adsorb 6 rhb molecules by the monte carlo adsorption locator module the adsorption energy ead of rhb on biocl kaol was evaluated 233 816 kcal mol and the adsorption energy of rhb on biocl kaol was more compared with the adsorption energy of rhb on biocl and kaol the adsorption energy of the rhb molecules on biocl kaol surface was negative suggesting the adsorption strength of rhb molecules the pollutants were interacted over kaolinite surface of biocl kaol fig s6 3 9 possible photocatalytic mechanism to provide better understanding the photocatalytic mechanism several species were investigated the main species responsible for the degradation of organic pollutant are generally hydroxyl radicals ho superoxide radicals o2 and holes h species named scavengers were used to determinate which species radicals responsible for the degradation process acid ascorbic asc isopropanol alcohol ipr and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta are the most commonly scavengers using to trapping radicals o2 ho and h respectively in our experiment 4 mmol of each scavenger was added in 100 ml of rhb dye solution 10 ppm with 100 mg of biocl 0 4kaol and agitated under sunlight irradiation for 35 min after that the solution was separated by centrifuge and the concentration of rhb dye is determined using uv vis spectrophotometry the obtained experimental results of the three trapping tests were presented in the fig s7 therefore the degradation efficiency without any scavengers attain 100 in 35 min in presence of asc edta and ipr the degradation rate decrease from 100 to 13 85 and 84 respectively fig s8 however the significant decrease in the presence of ascorbic acid indicates that the superoxide radicals o2 is the main radical species causing the degradation of rhb dye over biocl kaol additionally the valence band edge potential evb and conduction band edge potential ecb of the biocl kaol semiconductor were calculated using the following empirical formulas eqs 6 8 53 54 6 Ï a a b b c c Ï a a Ï b b Ï c c 1 a b c 7 e bc Ï a a b b c c e 0 e g 2 8 e bv e bc e g where Ï ev is the absolute electronegativity of the biocl semiconductor and a b and c are the number of atoms in a chemical formula aabbcc evb ecb and eg are the valence band edge potential conductor band edge potential and the band gap energy of semiconductor respectively e0 ev is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale e0 4 5 ev nhe 55 the calculate value of Ï biocl eg evb and ecb are listed in the table s3 to understand the photocatalytic mechanism of the biocl kaol photocatalyst under sunlight irradiation the excitation process involves the transfer of an electron from the valence band edge ecv to the conduction band edge ecb generating a hole in the valence band evb the scavenger s test results indicate that the degradation process is mainly driven by superoxide radicals o2 and the ecb edge 1 16 ev is more negative than the redox potential for the formation of superoxide radicals e o2 o2 0 33 ev consequently the generated electrons in the ecv edge directly reduce oxygen leading to the formation of superoxide radicals o2 which in turn oxidize rhb molecules into h2o and co2 eqs 9 11 additionally the strong adsorptive properties and negatively charged surface of kaolinite clay play a crucial role the electrostatic attraction between the photogenerated holes at the ecb edge and the negatively charged kaolinite surface effectively prevents recombination of the electron hole pairs therefore the free holes in the evb are occupied by the negative charge of the kaolinite further enhancing the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes this process significantly improves the photodegradation efficiency of rhb dye over the biocl kaol photocatalyst the potential mechanism of the rhb photodegradation reaction by biocl kaol is illustrated in fig 10 9 biocl kaol hÏ e cb h vb 10 e cb o 2 o 2 11 o 2 rhb co 2 h 2 o 3 10 stability and recyclability to evaluate the recyclability and the stability of biocl kaol photocatalyst a test of regeneration was investigated firstly the biocl kaol composite was used in the first time after completely rhb dye degradation under sunlight irradiation the biocl kaol was collected by centrifuge washed three times by distilled water and ethanol and dried in the oven at 80 c for 12 h for a future use this operation has been spotted 5 times the experimental results presented in fig s8 show that the degradation efficiency remains stable after 5 cycling runs and the removal efficiency has been slightly reduced from 100 to 98 6 after 5 cycles in comparison to pure biocl for which the photodegradation efficiency was reduced from 72 to 15 after 5 cycles in addition the photodegradation efficiency of rhb dye by our synthetized nanocomposite was compared with other biocl modification in different literature table s4 as can be seen from the table s4 the biocl kaol composite has a strongly performance in sunlight irradiation 100 after 35 min compared with other composites indicating the successful prepared nanocomposite 4 conclusion a series of biocl kaol composite photocatalysts with various clay biocl weight ratios were prepared by using a simple one step precipitation method in acidic medium the synthesized biocl kaol hybrid photocatalyst materials were then characterized by several techniques such as xrd ftir sem edx tem xps and uv vis drs and finally applied for rapid removal of rhb dye from aqueous solution by photocatalytic reaction under sunlight irradiation thus all the samples were found to be efficient for rhb degradation and 100 of the dye was degraded within 35 min for an optimal clay biocl weight ratio of 0 4 biocl 0 4kaol further the synthetized photocatalysts were found to be stable after 5 cycling runs the overall data indicate that the synthesis protocol and the application process as used in the present work bring a lot of hope for large scale applications in addition the dft d and md simulations were used to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms of biocl on kaolinite particles and rhb molecules on biocl kaol hence based on the md simulations and monte carlo calculations it was found that the biocl molecules were approximately parallel to the kaolinite surfaces containing oh groups and one of the 001 kaolinite surfaces bearing oh groups formed hydrogen bonding with the biocl o atoms materials moreover the results demonstrated that the interactions occurring between rhb molecules and biocl kaol were van der waals type finally the adsorption energies of biocl on kaolinite particles and rhb molecules on biocl kaol were found to be negative

12407,the development of advanced photocatalytic materials for environmental purposes is among the high research topics in the present work a nanocomposite biocl kaol made of kaolinite supported bismuth oxychloride biocl photocatalyst was designed for rhodamine b dye photodegradation in aqueous solution the obtained biocl kaol nanocomposite exhibited high photocatalytic activity in the removal of rhodamine b dye rhb from water with a degradation efficiency reaching 100 within 35 min furthermore it was observed that the nanocomposite photocatalyst biocl 0 4kaol at optimal clay biocl ratio of 0 4 exhibited 4 37 times better photocatalytic performance compared to bare biocl finally to elucidate the photodegradation mechanisms we determined various interactions occurring between biocl and kaolinite particles as well as between rhb molecules and biocl kaol nanocomposites using monte carlo calculations it was concluded from monte carlo calculations that hydrogen bonds were established between oxygen atoms of biocl and h of kaolinite 001 hydroxyl groups upon the adsorption of biocl 003 particles on the kaolinite 001 surface owing to its high negative interaction energy meanwhile van der waals attraction was also established between the rhb molecules and the biocl kaol 001 surface graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biocl kaolinite co precipitation photocatalysis rhodamine b sunlight data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays synthetic dyes are recognized as highly hazardous organic pollutants owing to their complex structures stability in aqueous environments and their highly toxicity 1 3 the continuous environmental pollution caused by these organic substances has resulted in various negative impacts 4 5 rhodamine b rhb is a considered a potentially toxic dye due to its ability to cause various health problems 6 including respiratory tract disorders gastrointestinal disorders skin irritation eye damage 7 furthermore its presence in aquatic medium slows down the photosynthesis process 8 consequently the removal of rhb dye from aquatic system has a high priority attracted the attention of many researchers due to its impact on health and the environment 9 several techniques such as biological treatment 10 physical adsorption 3 11 12 membrane filtration 13 or chemical oxidation 14 have been explored for the remove of rhb dye from aqueous media however all these techniques still have many drawbacks that limits their application particularly processing time low removal efficiency and high costs therefore it is necessary to explore other sustainable and eco friendly techniques to remove rhb dye from aqueous medium 15 advanced oxidation processes aop especially photocatalysis are highly efficient environmentally friendly and cost effective technologies widely used for energy conversion they can result in the production of green hydrogen and fast mineralization of pollutant 16 18 the principle of the heterogeneous photocatalysis is based on the activation of semi conductor materials photocatalyst using either an artificial or natural sunlight radiation source generating electron hole pairs that cause various redox reaction at the photocatalyst surface and leading to the powerful radical s ho o2 ho2 these produced radicals are responsible for the degradation of the pollutant molecules and their conversion into h2o and co2 recently several studies have synthesized actives semiconductors for photodegradation of rhb dye in aqueous solution such as ag3po4 19 zno 20 tio2 21 srhpo4 22 g c3n4 23 however these photocatalysts have many drawbacks which limit their uses such as high cost recombination of electron and hole lower efficiency and their difficult regeneration in recent years biocl photocatalyst have gained attention due to their stability non toxic corrosion resistance remarkable structure fig s1 a good photocatalytic performance as well as their low band gap making them suitable for many applications 24 27 however pure biocl photocatalyst have some disadvantages including their tendency to form agglomerates in solution which can reduce their photocatalytic performance additionally the low photo generated charge separation efficiency can lead to poor photocatalytic activity long treatment time and low photocatalytic power under sunlight to overcome these issues many researchers have attempted to solve these problems and they proposed the establishment of heterojunction between pure biocl and other semiconductors photocatalysts such as cu2o biocl 28 biocl agbr 29 biocl g c3n4 30 biocl wo3 31 however these proposed solutions have disadvantages related to material cost and their suitability for use under sunlight therefore in the present study one potential solution to improve the photocatalytic properties of biocl under sunlight irradiation is to use clay minerals as a support clay minerals were selected due to their high specific surface areas high thermal stabilities and low cost which can help to improve the photocatalytic activity of biocl under sunlight additionally clay minerals can also help to prevent the agglomeration of biocl and can improve the photo generated charge separation efficiency thus leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance the combination of biocl and clay minerals can lead to a photocatalyst having improved stability higher photocatalytic activity and better efficiency under sunlight irradiation 32 33 various clay mineral types such as sepiolite 34 palygorskite 35 and zeolite 36 can be used to prevent semiconductors agglomeration another type of clay can be used to improve the photocatalytic performance is kaolinite this clay is very abundant chemically stable has large surface area it is non toxic and it has a best catalytic performance 33 37 kaolinite is crystallized in the triclinic system with a tetrahedron silica octahedrons alumina 1 1 layer structure fig s1 b c 38 several studies have mostly used kaolinite clay mineral to solve the photocatalysts agglomeration problem as it was observed in systems such as tio2 kaolinite 39 and g c3n4 kaolinite 40 in the present work natural kaolinite was used as support for the biocl in order to improve the photocatalyst performance under sunlight irradiation and to prevent the hole electron pairs photo charged recombination however the use of raw kaolinite clay as a carrier for biocl thus improving the photocatalytic efficiency the stability and reusability of the photocatalyst synthesis of the photocatalyst at low cost successful application of the photocatalyst biocl kaolinite for the degradation of organic dyes in water with high efficiency and long term stability avoid the problem of photocorrosion of the semiconductor therefore the biocl kaol nanocomposite was synthetized by co precipitation method in acidic medium then it was characterized by various methods such as x ray diffraction xrd to study its structures fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir to determine its functional groups scanning electron microscopy sem to observe its topography transmission electron microscopy tem to visualize its morphologies and nanostructures x ray photoelectron spectrometry xps to study the chemical states and chemical composition of the surface and ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv vis drs to study its optical properties the characterized biocl kaol nanocomposite was thereafter used for rapid removal of rhb dye from aqueous solution under sunlight irradiation the adsorption geometries energetics and electron structural properties of compounds were assessed by dft d and md calculations 2 material and methods 2 1 photocatalysts

distilled water and ethanol and dried at 80 c for 12 h and labeled biocl 1 0kaol using similar synthesis procedures biocl kaol with various mass of kaolinite 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 g were prepared and labeled as biocl 0 2kaol biocl 0 4kaol biocl 0 6kaol and biocl 0 8kaol respectively we followed the same experimental protocol to prepare biocl without adding kaolinite fig 1 summarizes the synthesis

at a cutoff of 12 5 Ã¥ 43 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd analysis the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of kaolinite the as synthesized biocl and the biocl kaol are presented in fig 2 the xrd peaks observed for pure biocl were attributed to various lattice planes of the tetragonal structure jcpds no 06 0249 the xrd peaks of raw kaolinite clay were assigned to specific planes jcpds no 96 900 9235 as expected the xrd pattern of the serial biocl kaol composites exhibited the both the diffraction peaks of biocl and kaolinite indicating successful support of biocl photocatalysts on the kaolinite additionally the xrd diagram of biocl kaol clearly shows the presence of kaolinite 001 and 002 peaks these x ray data shown in fig 2 confirm that biocl kaol samples were successfully prepared it is interesting to note that the intensities of the kaolinite peaks located at 2Î¸ 12 35 and 2Î¸ 24 85 increase with an increase in the kaolinite biocl weight ratio from 0 2 to 1 0 this finding can be explained by the increase in the mass of kaolinite in the biocl kaol sample furthermore it should be noted that the intensity of biocl 001 peak is slightly increases with an increase in the kaolinite biocl weight ratio from 0 2 to 1 0 suggesting proper support of biocl on the kaolinite surfaces 44 the intensities of the kaolinite peaks 001 and 002 as well as the biocl peaks are strongly reduced in all samples indicating that the kaolinite clay is well retained by biocl nanosheets 32 additionally the intensities of the kaolinite peaks 001 and 002 and biocl peaks increase when increasing the kaolinite biocl weight ratio from 0 2 to 1 0 this is due to the increase in the amount of kaolinite and the crystallinity of biocl is increased when moving the kaolinite biocl weight ratio from 0 2 to 1 0 45 46 3 2 ftir analysis results fig 3 shows the spectra obtained from ftir analysis of all prepared samples the ftir spectrum of raw kaolinite represented by the black line in this figure shows the presence of two characteristics bands at 428 19 cm 1 and 1006 84 cm 1 attributed to the stretching vibration of sio the bands located at 468 70 cm 1 and 1029 98 cm 1 are attributed to the deformation modes of the si o si group the band at 536 cm 1 is attributed to al o si deformation of kaolinite furthermore the characteristic bands at 3618 45 cm 1 and 3697 54 cm 1 correspond to the oh stretching of the al oh and si oh groups respectively 47 on the other hand the ft ir spectrum of pure biocl displays a band located at about 529 37 cm 1 which is attributed to the stretching vibrations of bio 34 the characteristic band with low intensity located at 1635 cm 1 can be associated with the stretching vibration mode of bicl the overall ft ir spectra of all photocatalysts samples show characteristic bands of both the kaolinite clay and the pure biocl with a slight increase of intensity of kaolinite band when its mass increases in the kaolinite biocl weight ratio 3 3 sem analysis results the morphologies and the elementary compositions of the raw kaolinite pure biocl and biocl 0 4kaol are shown in fig 4 the sem images of the raw kaolinite fig 4 a b show that the kaolinite particle consists of tightly packed layered hexagonal morphology due to the presence of hydrogen interaction occurring between the aluminosilicate sheets the sem images of pure biocl particles fig 6 d e exhibit a spherical gathering of many thin nanosheets resulting in uniform micro flower shape moreover fig 4 j h shows the sem images of biocl 0 4kaol nanocomposite from this image it can be observed that the nanosheets of the biocl catalyst are well supported on the kaolinite sheets additionally the edx spectra and mapping of the kaolinite fig 4 c the pure biocl fig 4 f and the biocl 0 4kaol fig 4 i indicate that the raw kaolinite mineral contains the expected elements al si and o and that pure biocl includes the bi o and cl atoms with an equal molar ratio for the biocl 0 4kaol it can be observed that the atoms were evenly distributed throughout the sample indicating that biocl was evenly dispersed on the kaolinite surface 3 4 tem analysis results the morphologies and nanostructures of as synthetized biocl kaol samples were investigated using transmittance electron microscopy fig 5 the fig 5 a b displays the tem images of biocl particles indicating that they consist of two dimensional nanosheets with a diameter size ranging from 0 08 Î¼m to 0 6 Î¼m with the presence of metallic bi nanoparticles the tem images of raw kaolinite fig 5 c d show two dimensional monolayers with a diameter size ranging from 0 5 Î¼m to 1 2 Î¼m regarding the biocl kaol nanocomposite it can be observed from fig 5 e f that the biocl microflowers shaped particles are attached on the surface of kaolinite fig 5 g h display selected areas of the electron diffraction patterns from which we can determine the calculated d spacing values of the corresponding planes 001 200 101 and 111 which are 0 75 nm 0 49 nm 0 39 nm and 0 27 nm respectively the illustrate image indicate that the studied area is monocrystalline 3 5 x ray photoelectron spectrometry xps to understand the photocatalytic reaction it is necessary to study the surface of the photocatalyst the chemical composition and chemical states of biocl kaol surface were characterized using x ray photoelectron

528 6 ev 530 5 ev and 531 9 ev which are ascribed to the lattice oxygen in the bio and bi oh bands respectively 37 the xps high resolution spectra of bi 4f was illustrate in fig 6 e demonstrating the presences of two powerful diffraction peaks at the binding energies of 157 9 ev and 163 2 ev corresponding to bi3 4f7 2 and bi3 4f5 2 orbitals respectively 48 the xps high resolution of cl 2p fig 6 f illustrate the peak at 196 5 ev due to cl 2p3 2 and the peak at198 1 ev due to cl 2p1 2 in biocl respectively 49 50 additionally the comparison of xps spectra of bi 4f and o 1 s in the pure biocl and biocl kaol composites fig 6 d and e clearly show that the peaks of bi 4f 7 2 and bi 4f 5 2 are shifted from the binding energies of 157 2 ev and 162 5 ev to 157 9 ev and 163 2 ev respectively however for the o 1 s we can observe the peak assigned to the bio band moving from the binding energy of 527 9 ev to 528 6 ev then after be slightly coupled with the bi oh band in the biocl kaol composite this means that the biocl nanosheets are homogeneously combined with kaolinite particles indicating that the biocl kaolinite composites have been successfully synthesized 3 6 optical absorption properties and band gap energy of samples the optical properties of the raw kaolinite pure biocl and the different biocl kaol samples having various kaolinite biocl weight ratios were studied using uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs fig 7 a illustrate the uv vis absorption spectrum of as prepared samples in the range of 200 800 nm it can be observed that the absorption edge wavelengths of pure biocl raw kaolinite biocl 0 2kaol biocl 0 4kaol biocl 0 6kaol biocl 0 8kaol and biocl 1 0kaol are located at 390 420 385 400 375 380 and 383 nm respectively it should be noted that the observed higher absorption capacity of raw kaolinite in the visible light range results from the heterogeneous construction of the tetrahedral and the octahedral aluminosilicate sheets 15 in contrast the biocl 0 4kaol sample displays the best absorption capacity band edge absorption of 400 nm in the visible light compared to the others samples with various kaolinite biocl weight ratios and pure biocl moreover the band gap energies of the synthetized catalysts are described by the tauc s equation as follow eq 4 36 4 Î±hÎ½ c hÎ½ e g n 2 where Î± hÎ½ c and eg are the absorption coefficient the photon energy proportional constant and band gap energy respectively the value of n depends on the property of the semiconductor n 1 or 4 for direct band gap or indirect band gap separately for a semiconductor with indirect band gap biocl the value of n is equal 4 the band gap energy of each semiconductor can be determined by extrapolating the tangent of the curve Î±hÎ½ c hÎ½ e g n 2 on the axis hÎ½ fig 7 b shows the plot of Î±hv 0 5 versus the photon energy the estimated band gap energy eg of as prepared catalysts are presented in table s1 the estimated values eg for pure biocl and biocl 0 4kaol were approximately 3 32 and 3 19 ev respectively therefore the band gap for the sample having the optimal kaolinite biocl weight ratio of 0 4 is the lowest compared to the others clay biocl weight ratios 3 7 photocatalytic degradation of rhb dye the photocatalytic process of the samples was investigated in rhb solution at room temperature under sunlight irradiation fig 8 shows the adsorption desorption equilibrium test photolysis absence of photocatalyst and photocatalysis tests as shown in fig 8 a in the case of photolysis process without photocatalyst the rate of degradation of rhb dye did not exceed 2 after 60 min consequently it can be concluded that the photodegradation of rhb dye is not possible using photolysis adsorption tests for all samples show that the highest adsorption efficiency is 44 43 after 60 min recorded by the biocl 0 4kaol the results in fig 8 a revealed that biocl kaol composites have good degradation efficiencies as compared to pure biocl additionally the biocl 0 4kaol composite presents the highest photocatalytic performance de 100 in the first 35 min of irradiation compared to the others samples fig 8 b the lowest degradation efficiency of the pure biocl is 71 is due to the electron hole recombination and agglomeration phenomena of biocl additionally total organic carbon toc analysis was conducted to verify the mineralization efficiency of the rhb solution using the biocl and biocl 0 4kaol photocatalysts as shown in fig 8 c the toc removal rates were approximately 41 60 and 95 51 for biocl and biocl 0 4kaol respectively these findings confirm the catalytic degradation of the rhb dye into co2 and h2o while also indicating the presence of some intermediate rhb molecules in the medium to evaluate the origin of this exceptional photocatalytic degradation a scavenger study was conducted to confirm the radical responsible for the degradation of rhb therefore the kinetic of photodegradation of as prepared biocl 0 2kaol biocl 0 4kaol biocl 0 6kaol biocl 0 8kaol biocl 1 0kaol biocl and kaolinite have been further examined according to the langmuir hinshelwood model using the first order kinetic formula eq 5 5 ln c 0 c t k t the rate constant k min 1 is determinate graphically from the slopes of the linear plots fig 9 a the values of k min 1 are presented in fig 9 b from these results all the apparent reaction rate constant k min 1 values corresponding to the biocl kaol composites are superior to those obtained for pure biocl ones and k biocl 0 4kaol has a significant value k 0 1355 min 1 it is interesting to note that the rate constant for biocl 0 4kaol was 4 26 times that of pure biocl fig 9 b these results confirm that the surface and structure of the kaolinite clay play a very important role in improving the rapidity of degradation of rhb dye 3 8 simulation methods 3 8 1 quantum calculations to obtain optimized structures and energies the generalized gradient approximation gga using the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe functional were adopted and the stable configurations are shown in fig s3 a c total energy of kaol biocl and rhb was obtained 27 740 463 1243 137 and 1880 764 ha respectively the geometric parameters of kaol biocl and rhb are summarized in table s2 3 8 2 modeling by monte carlo adsorption locator simulation after optimization of compounds by quantum calculations the adsorption of 5 biocl 003 molecules on kaol 001 was investigated to make biocl kaol by adsorption locator module and force field universal in materials studio 2017 software the electrostatic and van der waals was calculated using the group summation method 51 the lowest energy structures of biocl kaol through md calculations are presented in fig s4 the total energy of the adsorption system for biocl kaol was obtained about 2 023 103 kcal mol demonstrating the exothermic and stability of the adsorption system owing to its high negative interaction energy the negatively charged regions were mainly distributed around the o atoms of the lying hydroxyl on kaolinite 001 surface 52 biocl molecules were approximately parallel on oh groups in addition to si terminated 001 surface of the kaolinite in the equilibrium configurations in addition the kaolinite 001 surface had the ability to form three hydrogen bonds between o atoms of biocl and oh groups of kaol 001 with 3 Ã¥ fig s5 in next stage biocl kaol adsorbate was prepared to adsorb 6 rhb molecules by the monte carlo adsorption locator module the adsorption energy ead of rhb on biocl kaol was evaluated 233 816 kcal mol and the adsorption energy of rhb on biocl kaol was more compared with the adsorption energy of rhb on biocl and kaol the adsorption energy of the rhb molecules on biocl kaol surface was negative suggesting the adsorption strength of rhb molecules the pollutants were interacted over kaolinite surface of biocl kaol fig s6 3 9 possible photocatalytic mechanism to provide better understanding the photocatalytic mechanism several species were investigated the main species responsible for the degradation of organic pollutant are generally hydroxyl radicals ho superoxide radicals o2 and holes h species named scavengers were used to determinate which species radicals responsible for the degradation process acid ascorbic asc isopropanol alcohol ipr and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta are the most commonly scavengers using to trapping radicals o2 ho and h respectively in our experiment 4 mmol of each scavenger was added in 100 ml of rhb dye solution 10 ppm with 100 mg of biocl 0 4kaol and agitated under sunlight irradiation for 35 min after that the solution was separated by centrifuge and the concentration of rhb dye is determined using uv vis spectrophotometry the obtained experimental results of the three trapping tests were presented in the fig s7 therefore the degradation efficiency without any scavengers attain 100 in 35 min in presence of asc edta and ipr the degradation rate decrease from 100 to 13 85 and 84 respectively fig s8 however the significant decrease in the presence of ascorbic acid indicates that the superoxide radicals o2 is the main radical species causing the degradation of rhb dye over biocl kaol additionally the valence band edge potential evb and conduction band edge potential ecb of the biocl kaol semiconductor were calculated using the following empirical formulas eqs 6 8 53 54 6 Ï a a b b c c Ï a a Ï b b Ï c c 1 a b c 7 e bc Ï a a b b c c e 0 e g 2 8 e bv e bc e g where Ï ev is the absolute electronegativity of the biocl semiconductor and a b and c are the number of atoms in a chemical formula aabbcc evb ecb and eg are the valence band edge potential conductor band edge potential and the band gap energy of semiconductor respectively e0 ev is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale e0 4 5 ev nhe 55 the calculate value of Ï biocl eg evb and ecb are listed in the table s3 to understand the photocatalytic mechanism of the biocl kaol photocatalyst under sunlight irradiation the excitation process involves the transfer of an electron from the valence band edge ecv to the conduction band edge ecb generating a hole in the valence band evb the scavenger s test results indicate that the degradation process is mainly driven by superoxide radicals o2 and the ecb edge 1 16 ev is more negative than the redox potential for the formation of superoxide radicals e o2 o2 0 33 ev consequently the generated electrons in the ecv edge directly reduce oxygen leading to the formation of superoxide radicals o2 which in turn oxidize rhb molecules into h2o and co2 eqs 9 11 additionally the strong adsorptive properties and negatively charged surface of kaolinite clay play a crucial role the electrostatic attraction between the photogenerated holes at the ecb edge and the negatively charged kaolinite surface effectively prevents recombination of the electron hole pairs therefore the free holes in the evb are occupied by the negative charge of the kaolinite further enhancing the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes this process significantly improves the photodegradation efficiency of rhb dye over the biocl kaol photocatalyst the potential mechanism of the rhb photodegradation reaction by biocl kaol is illustrated in fig 10 9 biocl kaol hÏ e cb h vb 10 e cb o 2 o 2 11 o 2 rhb co 2 h 2 o 3 10 stability and recyclability to evaluate the recyclability and the stability of biocl kaol photocatalyst a test of regeneration was investigated firstly the biocl kaol composite was used in the first time after completely rhb dye degradation under sunlight irradiation the biocl kaol was collected by centrifuge washed three times by distilled water and ethanol and dried in the oven at 80 c for 12 h for a future use this operation has been spotted 5 times the experimental results presented in fig s8 show that the degradation efficiency remains stable after 5 cycling runs and the removal efficiency has been slightly reduced from 100 to 98 6 after 5 cycles in comparison to pure biocl for which the photodegradation efficiency was reduced from 72 to 15 after 5 cycles in addition the photodegradation efficiency of rhb dye by our synthetized nanocomposite was compared with other biocl modification in different literature table s4 as can be seen from the table s4 the biocl kaol composite has a strongly performance in sunlight irradiation 100 after 35 min compared with other composites indicating the successful prepared nanocomposite 4 conclusion a series of biocl kaol composite photocatalysts with various clay biocl weight ratios were prepared by using a simple one step precipitation method in acidic medium the synthesized biocl kaol hybrid photocatalyst materials were then characterized by several techniques such as xrd ftir sem edx tem xps and uv vis drs and finally applied for rapid removal of rhb dye from aqueous solution by photocatalytic reaction under sunlight irradiation thus all the samples were found to be efficient for rhb degradation and 100 of the dye was degraded within 35 min for an optimal clay biocl weight ratio of 0 4 biocl 0 4kaol further the synthetized photocatalysts were found to be stable after 5 cycling runs the overall data indicate that the synthesis protocol and the application process as used in the present work bring a lot of hope for large scale applications in addition the dft d and md simulations were used to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms of biocl on kaolinite particles and rhb molecules on biocl kaol hence based on the md simulations and monte carlo calculations it was found that the biocl molecules were approximately parallel to the kaolinite surfaces containing oh groups and one of the 001 kaolinite surfaces bearing oh groups formed hydrogen bonding with the biocl o atoms materials moreover the results demonstrated that the interactions occurring between rhb molecules and biocl kaol were van der waals type finally the adsorption energies of biocl on kaolinite particles and rhb molecules on biocl kaol were found to be negative indicating a stable and exothermic system declaration of competing interest that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere nor it is currently under consideration for publication

12408,treatment of swine wastewater via cultivation of photosynthetic microorganism is highly promising due to the benefits in nutrient utilization cost reduction high efficiency and production of various bioproducts besides photosynthetic microorganisms are also acknowledged for their high tolerance toward extreme growth conditions including the presence of heavy metals this study assessed the tolerance of thermosynechococcus sp cl 1 tcl 1 in the cultivation using swine wastewater for co2 fixation zn removal and production of lipid protein and carbohydrate addition of 113 2 mm dissolved inorganic carbon was also set for simulation of almost saturated co2 content in a chemical scrubbing wastewater after co2 absorption process experiment was conducted in a 1 l flat panel photobioreactor for 12 h periods under illumination of various light intensities and compared with the performance in modified fitzgerald medium tcl 1 cultivation under 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity provided the optimum growth condition in swine wastewater which led to high biomass productivity 55 69 mg l h and co2 fixation rate 91 8 mg l h tcl 1 in this cultivation also removed 62 5 zn content from swine wastewater and bioadsorption route was detected as the major elimination process the rapid utilization of nitrogen compounds in swine wastewater resulted in the dominant production of protein reached to 59 5 3 1 dwc graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zn removal cyanobacterium co2 fixation carbohydrate swine wastewater data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction temperature rising that reached to 6 c in some dense population area 1 is detected as the obvious sign of global warming effect elevation of atmospheric co2 content highly contributes to the increasing of surface temperature 2 the low co2 utilization 200 300 mtco2 y was not balanced by the extreme amount of its emission from large point sources 14 000 mtco2 y therefore exploration of efficient strategies for mitigation of co2 has gained high interest 3 cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms has gained high interest regarding its rapid growth high sustainability low cost and production of byproducts 4 another environmental issue is coming from discharge of immense amount of swine wastewater 5 the threat not only comes from intense volume of discharged swine wastewater but also from the high loading of organic pollutants 5 remaining of several types of heavy metals or even antibiotics 6 the pig farm owners often add copper cu and zinc zn additives into the diet to promote growth and improve the immune system of pigs 7 since the uptake rate of these added heavy metal in pig s digestive system was limited high level of cu and zn are commonly found in their excretion waste 8 the accumulated heavy metals in the soil would change the condition of the environments and have an adverse impact on crop yield and safety 9 study on heavy metals removal including ni zn cd and cu by microalgae has gained high interest and been recognized by its high recovery rate 10 several technologies in heavy metals removal have been reviewed by razzak et al 11 with the removal efficiencies in the range of 26 99 2 including electroflotation membrane filtration ion exchange adsorption and biofiltration moreover in the group of biological strategies system using algae bacteria consortium for removal of heavy metals is also considered as a durable strategy to be applied in extreme aquatic environment 12 despite the prominent performances of heavy metal degraded by cyanobacteria microalgae have been proposed there were still few studies have been conducted under real wastewater cultivation this study offered an efficient strategy for removal of heavy metal by cultivating a cyanobacterium in a swine wastewater without the sterilization process besides the great performance in co2 fixation process the high tolerance of photosynthetic microorganisms toward cultivation using wastewater are also highly acknowledged compared to the conventional technology for heavy metals removal in wastewater which requires high cost and energy 13 the cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms are advantageous with rapid uptake high capability and eco friendly process 14 thus simultaneous processes for co2 fixation and wastewater treatment are often carried out by the cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms removal of heavy metals by microorganisms involves the attachment of ions and molecules on the cells surface which is controlled by the total charge of cell walls from the presence of functional groups 15 therefore the ph value condition during cultivation process plays an important role under the alkaline conditions the elevation of negative charges on the surfaces is presented by the deprotonation of functional groups and leads to the rising of metal adsorption 16 furthermore heavy metals removal under alkaline conditions is also supported by higher ionic complexation and co precipitation however surface adsorption in heavy metals removal is a reversible reaction that carries out the possibility of a desorption process besides adsorption cellular accumulation also can be carried out by photosynthetic microorganisms even though in lower amounts 17 thermosynechococcus sp cl 1 tcl 1 a type of cyanobacteria has been reported for its excellent performance in biomass growth co2 fixation 18 and production of pigments 19 and macromolecules 20 besides cultivation of tcl 1 also can be carried out using swine wastewater 21 however even though the high tolerance to the presence of hormone pollutants has been reported the ability of tcl 1 cultivation for removal of heavy metals has not been observed this study was aiming to examine nutrient utilization co2 fixation and zn removal from the cultivation of tcl 1 using swine wastewater and under various light intensities a short extended study to assess the route in zn removal by tcl 1 was also included in this study influence on the performances would also be observed on the production of macromolecules lipid protein and carbohydrate along with the changes in tcl 1 morphology under scanning electron microscope sem analysis thus a low cost solution by cultivation of tcl 1 in swine wastewater without prior sterilization could be accomplished from this study along with various simultaneous advantages including co2 fixation zn removal and production of macromolecules 2 material and methods 2 1 tcl 1 and pre cultivation sequence a cyanobacterium tcl 1 was applied throughout this study a sequence of the pre cultivation processes according to a previous study of chu et al 22 was carried out to prepare sufficient and uniform biomass during the whole experimental study tcl 1 grew in various folds of modified fitzgerald medium mf medium depending on the phase of pre cultivation sequence supplementary a illustrated the composition of mf medium along with the implementation in each phase of the experimental sequence the single fold of mf medium contained unit in g l 0 496 nano3 alfa aesar 0 039 k2hpo4 sigma

composition as the previous study of li et al 23 besides macronutrients the prepared mf medium was also supplemented by the supply of micronutrients in the form of 3 ml l of gaffron solution g solution 113 2 mm dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the form of sodium carbonate honeywell fluka and sodium bicarbonate honeywell fluka and 29 mm dissolved inorganic nitrogen din in the form of sodium nitrate prior to sterilization process using an autoclave tm 328 tomin at 121 c for 20 min supply of din content was given to provide sufficient nitrogen source during the whole cultivation period according to previous study of li et al 23 besides the given dic concentration was to simulate the almost saturated condition of wastewater from the chemical scrubber after co2 sorption process tcl 1 pre cultivation sequence was initiated by cultivating tcl 1 from a conservation bottle into an 1 l serum bottle and then 5 l serum bottle reactor using the 1 fold mf medium the growth environment was set at 50 c 200 Î¼e m2 s light intensity and 0 5 vvm aeration through a sparging tube culture in 5 l serum bottle was then changed to the implementation of 10 l flat panel photobioreactor fpbr by separating the solid part using a centrifuge kubota 5930 at 4000 rpm for 15 min and mixing with 3 fold mf medium the same other growth conditions were applied for cultivation using the 10 l fpbr all of the culture in 10 l fpbr would be transferred to a 30 l fpbr once the biomass concentration reached 1 g l and mixed with 5 l of fresh prepared 3 folds mf medium a sufficient amount of culture in the 30 l fpbr would be harvested for implementation in the experimental test and replaced with the same amount of 3 fold mf medium every 3 days 2 2 cultivation medium the swine wastewater was taken from a wastewater treatment plant of a pig farm in tainan taiwan the used swine wastewater was collected from the tank after 4 times anoxic and 3 times aerobic treatment respectively table 1 provides the composition of collected swine wastewater in this study centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min was carried out to increase the clarity of swine wastewater due to the presence of suspended solid ss the high ammonia content limited the growth of tcl 1 therefore 3 times dilution using distilled water was applied before implementation in the experimental test the prepared swine wastewater did not undergo the sterilization process but 113 2 mm dic was supplemented as the supply of inorganic carbon in this study to be compared with cultivation using swine wastewater tcl 1 cultivation was also tested using a 5 fold mf medium in an 1 l fpbr with the same supplementation in the pre cultivation phase as the control cultivation moreover the prepared mf medium was also supplemented with zn content in the range of 60 70 Î¼g l to simulate three times zn content in the diluted swine wastewater higher concentration than that in swine wastewater was arranged in mf medium to also support the observation in the study of zn removal route 2 3 growth condition the tcl 1 biomass was prepared by harvesting sufficient culture from the 30 l fpbr in the pre cultivation phase collecting of tcl 1 biomass was carried out through centrifugation using 4000 rpm for 15 min and the experimental test was initiated by 3 g l biomass density an experimental test was carried out in a batch system of the 1 l fpbr using swine wastewater or mf medium the fpbr was equipped with an aeration system 0 5 vvm using sparging tube at the bottom of the reactor illuminated with a white led board in various light intensities 500 2000 Î¼e m2 s and placed in an incubator at 50 c for 12 h the temperature was set to imitate the condition of wastewater from a chemical scrubber after co2 absorption process while the incubator was set to provide a stable and controlled heating during the test various light intensities were set to simulate solar photon flux density in southern taiwan furthermore experimental tests were conducted in triplicate for each case of arrangements to achieve the high accuracy data 2 4 analytical method an adequate volume of culture sample was taken from the 1 l fpbr every 2 h for various analysis purposes immediate analysis of ph value was done by a ph meter sp 2200 suntex and biomass density was determined using the gravimetric method of the dry weight cell separation using a centrifuge heraeus megafuge 8r thermo at 8000 rpm for 15 min was conducted to the remaining collected sample the separated solid phase was freeze dried fdu 1200 eyela for further analysis while the liquid part was applied for measurements of din dic total organic carbon toc and zn concentration dic and din concentrations were measured using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 900 with as18 analytical column while a toc analyzer toc lcsh shimadzu was used for the analysis of toc concentration the freeze dried solid phase was applied in the elemental analysis elementar vario el iii for determination of carbon content which would be used for co2 fixation rate using eq 1 1 r co 2 c t x t c t 0 x t 0 t t 0 m co 2 m c where rco2 is the co2 fixation rate mg l h ct and ct0 are the carbon contents at the final and initial hour of cultivation respectively xt and xt0 are the biomass densities at the final and initial hour of cultivation mg l respectively t is the final time h t0 is the initial time h and m is the molecular weight g mol besides macromolecules lipid protein and carbohydrate accumulation was also analyzed from the freeze dried samples lipid content was determined from extraction using chloroform methanol solvent according to williams and merrilees 24 carbohydrate described as total sugar which determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method 25 and protein content was analyzed using a commercial protein analysis kit tp0200 and b 3934 sigma the productivity of macromolecules accumulation was defined using eq 2 2 p x t m t x t 0 m t 0 t t 0 where p is the productivity of each macromolecule component mg l h x is the biomass density mg l m is the macromolecule component content t is the final time h and t0 is the initial time h moreover the morphology change of tcl 1 surface was also observed using scanning electron microscopy sem 2 5 analysis of zn removal analysis of zn concentration was conducted by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes ultima 2000 jobin yvon using liquid and solid samples for determination of its removal mechanism preparation of the sample prior to icp analysis was carried out under standard method number 3030e about nitric acid digestion however due to the low initial zn concentration in the swine wastewater zn removal mechanism experiment was carried out using mf medium supplemented by adding zn content in the range of 60 70 Î¼g l after the sample was collected residual zn was defined as the remaining concentration in the liquid sample after centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min separated solid after centrifuge was washed with 10 ml of 2 mm edta for 10 min to detach the adsorbed zn on the surface of tcl 1 cells centrifugation with 6000 rpm for 10 min was then carried out for the mixture and the detected zn content in the supernatant was defined as the bioadsorption part the bioaccumulation portion was measured after acid digestion of the cell using hno3 and heating at 120 c the removal efficiency of zn rzn was calculated using eq 3 3 r zn z 0 z r z 0 100 where z0 is the initial zn concentration and zr is the zn concentration in the residual part mg l furthermore a blank test experiment was carried out using swine wastewater without tcl 1 biomass for the observation of zn removal portion as the effect of growth condition the setup of the blank test was placed under the same condition with additional naoh titration to follow the ph rising pattern as in the experimental test 3 results and discussion 3 1 tcl 1 biomass growth variation of tcl 1 biomass growth and ph value are presented in fig 1 with a supportive data in table 2 at the initial period 2 4 h several cases of cultivation presented decrease of tcl 1 growth that might be related to the adaptation phase for lag period of growth the biomass of tcl 1 was originally cultivated in the 3 fold mf medium for the pre cultivation process however in the experimental test the supply of nutrients was changed to 5 fold mf medium or swine wastewater thus the adaptation time was needed by tcl 1 to adjust the new condition the above mentioned cases included the cultivation using swine wastewater 500 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s and mf medium 500 Î¼e m2 s decreasing the biomass density might be used by tcl 1 to adjust the condition under low light intensity light intensity significantly influenced the photosynthesis tcl 1 presented the best growth in wastewater under the supply of 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity with 55 7 6 2 mg l h biomass productivity implementation of higher light intensity also has been reported by nzayisenga et al 26 to improve the growth of several tested microalgae chlorella vulgaris desmodesmus sp ettlia pseudoalveolaris and scenedesmus obliquus furthermore illumination of 500 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s presented much less growth during the cultivation period similarly 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity promoted the growth in mf medium and presented the best biomass productivity of 71 5 3 5 mg l h higher light intensity will increase biomass productivity 27 28 at a certain level exceeding light intensity causes photoinhibition and damages the photosynthesis system 29 therefore the biomass productivity of tcl 1 cultivated in mf medium also presented a lower value when 2000 Î¼e m2 s was applied as the light supply illumination of high light intensity might also relate with the photosynthetic process different from the low light intensity condition increasing of light energy under saturated condition does not improve photosynthetic rate in fact the excessive lighting leads to photoxodation damage to the apparatus of photosynthesis 30 furthermore the tendency of increasing ph value was detected in all cases of tcl 1 cultivation the highest measured ph value reached 11 8 tcl 1 has been reported to have a high tolerance to alkaline condition up to ph value of 12 but extremely high alkalinity led to inhibition of biomass growth 31 a similar trend also appeared in this study where a slower growth rate was detected when the ph value almost reached 12 nevertheless an overall significant increment of ph value in this study could be observed as an index of tcl 1 well growth since the trend was analogous to the performance of biomass increment 3 2 utilization of nutrients the nutrients utilizations by tcl 1 during cultivation test are presented in fig 2 along with the data in table 2 these data are also supported by the elemental analysis of freeze dried tcl 1 cells in supplementary b initial total nitrogen concentration was detected in the range of 60 103 mg l as previously reported by narindri rara winayu et al 32 ammonium is the dominant nitrogen species in wastewater with a small amount of nitrate and nitrite however in the prepared mf medium din was added in the form of sodium nitrate rapid removal of total nitrogen tn content in wastewater was detected at the first 8 h of cultivation under the illumination of 500 and 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity in the swine wastewater cultivation with 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity only 83 6 tn utilization was detected increasing of light intensity has inverse influence in nutrient utilization as reported by ahmed et al 28 moreover a much lower utilization value was detected in the mf medium cultivation which was related to the tcl 1 preference in utilization of nitrogen species ammonium is the favorable nitrogen species for cyanobacteria 33 and further supports the efficient synthesis of n products such as protein 113 2 mm dic was supplemented in both mf medium and swine wastewater as the carbon source for tcl 1 growth during cultivation in mf medium tcl 1 utilized more dic than that swine wastewater was applied as growth medium however in both types of growth mediums the higher light intensity led to a greater dic consumption in mf medium cultivation tcl 1 utilized 33 5 6 3 44 0 1 6 and 46 0 2 7 dic under 500 1000 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity respectively furthermore microalgae and cyanobacteria have been reported to be applied in removal of organic carbon with an efficiency up to 87 2 34 nevertheless removal of toc by tcl 1 did not occur in the overall experimental study fig 2b tcl 1 produced toc instead with the rate of 0 7 0 3 1 5 0 4 and 2 5 0 6 mg l h for cultivation using swine wastewater under 500 1000 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity respectively instead of removal several microalgae like nostoc piscinale nostoc sp and anabaena variabilis will release organic carbon during the biomass growth which lead to increasing of chemical oxygen demand cod 35 furthermore cyanobacteria also have the tendency to excrete extracellular polysaccharides or a large amount of carbohydrates and lead to the rising of dissolved organic carbon doc 36 3 3 co2 fixation by tcl 1 table 2 presents the content of carbon element at the 0 and 12 h of cultivation period that was applied for calculation of co2 fixation rate direct calculation of co2 fixation rate through checking of carbon content using elemental analysis is considered accurate especially for phototrophic microorganism which only has co2 as the carbon source 37 cyanobacteria have been acknowledged to have great performance in co2 fixation however the strain type of microorganism plays an important role which will be related to co2 availability for the cell and the amount of produced enzyme for photosynthesis process insignificant carbon content change of tcl 1 during all cases of cultivation in this study indicated the similar ability of tcl 1 carbon intake in both types of cultivation medium furthermore cultivation with the higher biomass productivity of tcl 1 cultivated in mf medium resulted in a higher co2 fixation rate tcl 1 presented the best performance under 1000 Î¼e m2 s for both mf medium and swine wastewater with the co2 fixation rate of 124 6 3 3 and 91 8 8 6 mg l h respectively compared to other studies tcl 1 performed more rapid co2 fixation an experiment using co culture of several microalgae types for the treatment of brewery wastewater resulted in a lower co2 fixation rate of 32 09 mg l d 38 tcl 1 owns sbta gene which is known as the high affinity bicarbonate transporter that plays an important role in improving bicarbonate uptake during co2 fixation process 39 3 4 zn removal by tcl 1 feedstock supplements containing cu and zn may be added in pig s diet for improvement of immune system however due to limited uptake rate by pigs 8 excessive concentrations of heavy metals might still remain in the feces and have the possibility to be discharged into environment 7 fig 3 presents the observation of morphology change under sem analysis zn removal performance of tcl 1 supportive data about the comparison with other studies is provided in supplementary c tcl 1 cell presented morphological changes during the cultivation test period fig 3a c in both mf medium and swine wastewater the changes might be related to the self defense mechanism or nutrient utilization by tcl 1 a long rod shape cell was presented in sem images during the pre cultivation stage however when the swine wastewater was applied as nutrient supply irregular nodule was inspected on some part of the tcl 1 surface along with the appearance of a membranous substance covering the cell a similar change was also detected in the cultivation using mf medium growth and metabolism of photosynthetic microorganisms along with changes of physiological and biochemical in cell are highly influenced by the presence of heavy metals 10 fig 3d presents the tcl 1 performance on zn removal along with data in tables 2 and 3 compared to swine wastewater tcl 1 performed greater zn removal when mf medium was applied as the nutrient source zn removals in the range of 59 9 82 8 were reached with the cultivation using mf medium differently a rapid reduction of zn content in swine wastewater was detected during the initial 4 h of tcl 1 experimental period under the illumination of 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity however implementation of 500 or 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity only performed insignificant zn removal which might be due to the adaptation process in lag phase of the growth as can be seen in fig 1 about biomass growth nevertheless drastic zn removal was achieved at the further cultivation period total zn removal of 58 8 15 8 62 5 8 8 and 7 0 23 3 from tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater under 500 1000 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity respectively the lowest and most diverse zn removal was achieved under 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity it might be due to the effect of photoinhibition and damage on the photosynthesis system which led to the change in structure of tcl 1 cell s surface zn also plays an important role in photosynthesis process especially in regulation of photosynthetic enzymes along with the detoxification of oxygen radicals from membrane damage 40 zn is known as one of important ions involved in enzymes e g carbonic anhydrases cas and the important zinc dependent metalloenzymes related to carbon fixation 41 furthermore blindauer 42 reported the cyanobacterial genomes of zn handling sequences could regulate important proteins in zn homeostases such as bmta smtb and ziar besides zn is included in the typical heavy metals that will be utilized as micro nutrients by photosynthetic microorganisms for the purpose of metabolism and enzyme related processes 10 although zn as well known is an essential element for tcl 1 the effects of uptake rate and detoxification mechanism while moving zn ion into the cell are unknown a previous study using ceratophyllum demersum l a freshwater cyanobacterium reported the zn protection on chloroplast and maintenance of photochemical processes 43 due to the low zn concentration in swine wastewater study on zn uptake mechanism by tcl 1 was carried out using mf medium with the supplementation of 60 70 Î¼g l zn fig 4a this arrangement in mf medium was arranged to simulate the 3 fold zn content in swine wastewater which presented the average value of 20 40 Î¼g l after dilution in this study greater removal rate of heavy metals will be achieved by cultivation of microorganisms in higher initial concentration of heavy metals due to the sorption isotherm 17 44 illumination of 1000 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensities led to a more intensive reduction of zn compared to 500 Î¼e m2 s light intensity heavy metal uptake by microorganisms is usually carried out under a biphasic process 45 bioadsorption initiates the first phase of heavy metal bioremoval mechanism followed by bioaccumulation and detoxification the carboxy hydroxy and some other functional groups of cell surface components are highly relevant to metals adsorption and the correlation between metals adsorption and exopolysaccharides formation on the cell surface has been widely discussed 46 nevertheless higher c element was detected after the cultivation period which indicated the formation of exopolysaccharide eps on the cell surface for both cases of mf and wastewater indication of eps formation could also lead to the detection bias in determination of zn content and determination of cell surface thickness on the other hand the intercellular accumulated zn might also support the uptaking zn mechanism by tcl 1 this result is in agreement with the previous study of novÃ¡k et al 47 that the detected zn and cu accumulation in the intercellular region of desmodesmus communis and monoraphidium pusillum within hours also exceeded the amount in extracellular adsorption at lower metal concentration photosynthetic microorganisms generated various transporters for specific heavy metals such as fe2 mn2 and zn2 in the plasma membrane for transportation of those compounds to the cytoplasm 10 furthermore an increment of zn ion concentration in liquid was detected in the blank test without tcl 1 biomass fig 4b using swine wastewater along with a slight rising in ph value from 9 to 9 7 due to the stripping of ammonia and co2 content however application of various light intensities gave insignificant differences in increasing zn concentration in liquid as ph value was conditioned in the alkaline range higher precipitation event occurred and converted zn oh 2 into salt therefore adsorbed zn declined and zn was in the form of zn2 ion moreover application of the unsterilized wastewater in this study might influence the change in zn concentration combination of microalgae and bacteria in a consortia might enhance the removal of heavy metals through its synergistic symbiosis 48 a previous study of narindri rara winayu et al 21 reported the presence of the tiny amount of other microorganism species at the end of tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater after anoxic treatment even though domination of tcl 1 still presented the major work furthermore under the high ph value zn hydroxide has lower solubility which further lead to the precipitation mechanism as the removal method moreover application of high temperature also plays important role in solubility of zn hydroxide 49 3 5 accumulation of macromolecules protein lipid and carbohydrate by tcl 1 tcl 1 has been known to accumulate various types of byproducts in this study macromolecule including carbohydrate lipid and protein was chosen as the targeted byproducts and the results are presented in fig 5 and table 4 for the content and productivity of accumulated byproducts respectively tcl 1 performed different trends of accumulated macromolecules content between the cultivations in swine wastewater and mf medium for the case of protein accumulation supply of different light intensity carried out insignificant protein content changes in the dry weight cells however protein was the dominant accumulated macromolecule during the cultivation with the highest contents of 59 5 3 1 and 64 7 6 1 dwc for cultivations in swine wastewater and mf medium respectively the protein productivities were 26 0 8 3 and 60 2 17 4 mg l h for cultivations in swine wastewater and mf medium respectively at 1000 Î¼e m2 s several other microalgae have been reported to have similar protein content levels including spirulina euglena tetraselmis synechococcus and nannochloropsis 50 which are suitable for feedstock production or the source in the pharmaceutical industry however examination of the protein quality food safety standards and management in separation extraction and recovery techniques should be considered in the application process insignificant lipid content changes were observed during the cultivation under various light intensities the best biomass growth under 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity resulted in the highest lipid productivities of 17 0 2 6 and 40 5 22 4 mg l h for cultivations in swine wastewater and mf medium respectively however different from this study higher light intensity commonly enhances the production of lipid content along with the change in its composition for several types of microalgae 51 a different trend was detected in the carbohydrate accumulation for tcl 1 cultivation in swine wastewater and mf medium that might be related to the different trends in nutrients utilization during the process cultivation using swine wastewater tended to increase accumulated carbohydrate content in tcl 1 while the cultivation in mf medium produced higher protein content rapid nitrogen utilization in tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater created the nitrogen limited condition during the late hour of cultivation period and reduced protein production however the rich nutrient level in mf medium tended to lead tcl 1 macromolecule production to lipid and protein content similar result was also reported by a previous study of cardoso et al 52 that the limited nitrogen condition would divert synthesis of protein and result in higher lipid or carbohydrates production some other studies also reported the reduction of carbohydrate and lipid contents during cultivation in nutrient rich condition 53 54 furthermore the tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater and 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity produced the highest carbohydrate content 10 8 but in the cultivation using mf medium the highest carbohydrate content was achieved under 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity 4 conclusion various advantages from tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater were assessed and compared with its performance in mf medium the results in this study indicated that swine wastewater provided sufficient nutrients to support the growth of tcl 1 besides the supply of 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity was found to be the suitable growth condition for tcl 1 growth the best biomass productivity and co2 fixation value of 55 7 6 2 mg l h and 97 9 6 2 mg l h respectively was reached by the cultivation of tcl 1 in the swine wastewater the initial zn content in the swine wastewater was in the range of 20 40 Î¼g l and was removed 62 5 8 8 by tcl 1 moreover tcl 1 performed better zn removal value 82 8 0 5 using mf medium which had higher initial zn content of 60 70 Î¼g l as the other benefit tcl 1 cultivation in swine wastewater also generated protein as the major produced macromolecules with the highest protein content of 59 5 3 1 dwc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

12408,treatment of swine wastewater via cultivation of photosynthetic microorganism is highly promising due to the benefits in nutrient utilization cost reduction high efficiency and production of various bioproducts besides photosynthetic microorganisms are also acknowledged for their high tolerance toward extreme growth conditions including the presence of heavy metals this study assessed the tolerance of thermosynechococcus sp cl 1 tcl 1 in the cultivation using swine wastewater for co2 fixation zn removal and production of lipid protein and carbohydrate addition of 113 2 mm dissolved inorganic carbon was also set for simulation of almost saturated co2 content in a chemical scrubbing wastewater after co2 absorption process experiment was conducted in a 1 l flat panel photobioreactor for 12 h periods under illumination of various light intensities and compared with the performance in modified fitzgerald medium tcl 1 cultivation under 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity provided the optimum growth condition in swine wastewater which led to high biomass productivity 55 69 mg l h and co2 fixation rate 91 8 mg l h tcl 1 in this cultivation also removed 62 5 zn content from swine wastewater and bioadsorption route was detected as the major elimination process the rapid utilization of nitrogen compounds in swine wastewater resulted in the dominant production of protein reached to 59 5 3 1 dwc graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zn removal cyanobacterium co2 fixation carbohydrate swine wastewater data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction temperature rising that reached to 6 c in some dense population area 1 is detected as the obvious sign of global warming effect elevation of atmospheric co2 content highly contributes to the increasing of surface temperature 2 the low co2 utilization 200 300 mtco2 y was not balanced by the extreme amount of its emission from large point sources 14 000 mtco2 y therefore exploration of efficient strategies for mitigation of co2 has gained high interest 3 cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms has gained high interest regarding its rapid growth high sustainability low cost and production of byproducts 4 another environmental issue is coming from discharge of immense amount of swine wastewater 5 the threat not only comes from intense volume of discharged swine wastewater but also from the high loading of organic pollutants 5 remaining of several types of heavy metals or even antibiotics 6 the pig farm owners often add copper cu and zinc zn additives into the diet to promote growth and improve the immune system of pigs 7 since the uptake rate of these added heavy metal in pig s digestive system was limited high level of cu and zn are commonly found in their excretion waste 8 the accumulated heavy metals in the soil would change the condition of the environments and have an adverse impact on crop yield and safety 9 study on heavy metals removal including ni zn cd and cu by microalgae has gained high interest and been recognized by its high recovery rate 10 several technologies in heavy metals removal have been reviewed by razzak et al 11 with the removal efficiencies in the range of 26 99 2 including electroflotation membrane filtration ion exchange adsorption and biofiltration moreover in the group of biological strategies system using algae bacteria consortium for removal of heavy metals is also considered as a durable strategy to be applied in extreme aquatic environment 12 despite the prominent performances of heavy metal degraded by cyanobacteria microalgae have been proposed there were still few studies have been conducted under real wastewater cultivation this study offered an efficient strategy for removal of heavy metal by cultivating a cyanobacterium in a swine wastewater without the sterilization process besides the great performance in co2 fixation process the high tolerance of photosynthetic microorganisms toward cultivation using wastewater are also highly acknowledged compared to the conventional technology for heavy metals removal in wastewater which requires high cost and energy 13 the cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms are advantageous with rapid uptake high capability and eco friendly process 14 thus simultaneous processes for co2 fixation and wastewater treatment are often carried out by the cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms removal of heavy metals by microorganisms involves the attachment of ions and molecules on the cells surface which is controlled by the total charge of cell walls from the presence of functional groups 15 therefore the ph value condition during cultivation process plays an important role under the alkaline conditions the elevation of negative charges on the surfaces is presented by the deprotonation of functional groups and leads to the rising of metal adsorption 16 furthermore heavy metals removal under alkaline conditions is also supported by higher ionic complexation and co precipitation however surface adsorption in heavy metals removal is a reversible reaction that carries out the possibility of a desorption process besides adsorption cellular accumulation also can be carried out by photosynthetic microorganisms even though in lower amounts 17 thermosynechococcus sp cl 1 tcl 1 a type of cyanobacteria has been reported for its excellent performance in biomass growth co2 fixation 18 and production of pigments 19 and macromolecules 20 besides cultivation of tcl 1 also can be carried out using swine wastewater 21 however even though the high tolerance to the presence of hormone pollutants has been reported the ability of tcl 1 cultivation for removal of heavy metals has not been observed this study was aiming to examine nutrient utilization co2 fixation and zn removal from the cultivation of tcl 1 using swine wastewater and under various light intensities a short extended study to assess the route in zn removal by tcl 1 was also included in this study influence on the performances would also be observed on the production of macromolecules lipid protein and carbohydrate along with the changes in tcl 1 morphology under scanning electron microscope sem analysis thus a low cost solution by cultivation of tcl 1 in swine wastewater without prior sterilization could be accomplished from this study along with various simultaneous advantages including co2 fixation zn removal and production of macromolecules 2 material and methods 2 1 tcl 1 and pre cultivation sequence a cyanobacterium tcl 1 was applied throughout this study a sequence of the pre cultivation processes according to a previous study of chu et al 22 was carried out to prepare sufficient and uniform biomass during the whole experimental study tcl 1 grew in various folds of modified fitzgerald medium mf medium depending on the phase of pre cultivation sequence supplementary a illustrated the composition of mf medium along with the implementation in each phase of the experimental sequence the single fold of mf medium contained unit in g l 0 496 nano3 alfa aesar 0 039 k2hpo4 sigma aldrich 0 075 mgso4 7h2o avantor 0 036 cacl2 2h2o avantor 0 058 na2sio3 9h2o avantor 0 0006 fec6h5o7 sigma aldrich 0 006 citric acid avantor and 0 001 edta avantor as the macronutrient supply with the composition as the previous study of li et al 23 besides macronutrients the prepared mf medium was also supplemented by the supply of micronutrients in the form of 3 ml l of gaffron solution g solution 113 2 mm dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the form of sodium carbonate honeywell fluka and sodium bicarbonate honeywell fluka and 29 mm dissolved inorganic nitrogen din in the form of sodium nitrate prior to sterilization process using an autoclave tm 328 tomin at 121 c for 20 min supply of din content was given to provide sufficient nitrogen source during the whole cultivation period according to previous study of li et al 23 besides the given dic concentration was to simulate the almost saturated condition of wastewater from the chemical scrubber after co2 sorption process tcl 1 pre cultivation sequence was initiated by cultivating tcl 1 from a conservation bottle into an 1 l serum bottle and then 5 l serum bottle reactor using the 1 fold mf medium the growth environment was set at 50 c 200 Î¼e m2 s light intensity and 0 5 vvm aeration through a sparging tube culture in 5 l serum bottle was then changed to the implementation of 10 l flat panel photobioreactor fpbr by separating the solid part using a centrifuge kubota 5930 at 4000 rpm for 15 min and mixing with 3 fold mf medium the same other growth conditions were applied for cultivation using the 10 l fpbr all of the culture in 10 l fpbr would be transferred to a 30 l fpbr once the biomass concentration reached 1 g l and mixed with 5 l of fresh prepared 3 folds mf medium a sufficient amount of culture in the 30 l fpbr would be harvested for implementation in the experimental test and replaced with the same amount of 3 fold mf medium every 3 days 2 2 cultivation medium the swine wastewater was taken from a wastewater treatment plant of a pig farm in tainan taiwan the used swine wastewater was collected from the tank after 4 times anoxic and 3 times aerobic treatment respectively table 1 provides the composition of collected swine wastewater in this study centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min was carried out to increase the clarity of swine wastewater due to the presence of suspended solid ss the high ammonia content limited the growth of tcl 1 therefore 3 times dilution using distilled water was applied before implementation in the experimental test the prepared swine wastewater did not undergo the sterilization process but 113 2 mm dic was supplemented as the supply of inorganic carbon in this study to be compared with cultivation using swine wastewater tcl 1 cultivation was also tested using a 5 fold mf medium in an 1 l fpbr with the same supplementation in the pre cultivation phase as the control cultivation moreover the prepared mf medium was also supplemented with zn content in the range of 60 70 Î¼g l to simulate three times zn content in the diluted swine wastewater higher concentration than that in swine wastewater was arranged in mf medium to also support the observation in the study of zn removal route 2 3 growth condition the tcl 1 biomass was prepared by harvesting sufficient culture from the 30 l fpbr in the pre cultivation phase collecting of tcl 1 biomass was carried out through centrifugation using 4000 rpm for 15 min and the experimental test was initiated by 3 g l biomass density an experimental test was carried out in a batch system of the 1 l fpbr using swine wastewater or mf medium the fpbr was equipped with an aeration system 0 5 vvm using sparging tube at the bottom of the reactor illuminated with a white led board in various light intensities 500 2000 Î¼e m2 s and placed in an incubator at 50 c for 12 h the temperature was set to imitate the condition of wastewater from a chemical scrubber after co2 absorption process while the incubator was set to provide a stable and controlled heating during the test various light intensities were set to simulate solar photon flux density in southern taiwan furthermore experimental tests were conducted in triplicate for each case of arrangements to achieve the high accuracy data 2 4 analytical method an adequate volume of culture sample was taken from the 1 l fpbr every 2 h for various analysis purposes immediate analysis of ph value was done by a ph meter sp 2200 suntex and biomass density was determined using the gravimetric method of the dry weight cell separation using a centrifuge heraeus megafuge 8r thermo at 8000 rpm for 15 min was conducted to the remaining collected sample the separated solid phase was freeze dried fdu 1200 eyela for further analysis while the liquid part was applied for measurements of din dic total organic carbon toc and zn concentration dic and din concentrations were measured using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 900 with as18 analytical column while a toc analyzer toc lcsh shimadzu was used for the analysis of toc concentration the freeze dried solid phase was applied in the elemental analysis elementar vario el iii for determination of carbon content which would be used for co2 fixation rate using eq 1 1 r co 2 c t x t c t 0 x t 0 t t 0 m co 2 m c where rco2 is the co2 fixation rate mg l h ct and ct0 are the carbon contents at the final and initial hour of cultivation respectively xt and xt0 are the biomass densities at the final and initial hour of cultivation mg l respectively t is the final time h t0 is the initial time h and m is the molecular weight g mol besides macromolecules lipid protein and carbohydrate accumulation was also analyzed from the freeze dried samples lipid content was determined from extraction using chloroform methanol solvent according to williams and merrilees 24 carbohydrate described as total sugar which determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method 25 and protein content was analyzed using a commercial protein analysis kit tp0200 and b 3934 sigma the productivity of macromolecules accumulation was defined using eq 2 2 p x t m t x t 0 m t 0 t t 0 where p is the productivity of each macromolecule component mg l h x is the biomass density mg l m is the macromolecule component content t is the final time h and t0 is the initial time h moreover the morphology change of tcl 1 surface was also observed using scanning electron microscopy sem 2 5 analysis of zn removal analysis of zn concentration was conducted by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes ultima 2000 jobin yvon using liquid and solid samples for determination of its removal mechanism preparation of the sample prior to icp analysis was carried out under standard method number 3030e about nitric acid digestion however due to the low initial zn concentration in the swine wastewater zn removal mechanism experiment was carried out using mf medium supplemented by adding zn content in the range of 60 70 Î¼g l after the sample was collected residual zn was defined as the remaining concentration in the liquid sample after centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min separated solid after centrifuge was washed with 10 ml of 2 mm edta for 10 min to detach the adsorbed zn on the surface of tcl 1 cells centrifugation with 6000 rpm for 10 min was then carried out for the mixture and the detected zn content in the supernatant was defined as the bioadsorption part the bioaccumulation portion was measured after acid digestion of the cell using hno3 and heating at 120 c the removal efficiency of zn rzn was calculated using eq 3 3 r zn z 0 z r z 0 100 where z0 is the initial zn concentration and zr is the zn concentration in the residual part mg l furthermore a blank test experiment was carried out using swine wastewater without tcl 1 biomass for the observation of zn removal portion as the effect of growth condition the setup of the blank test was placed under the same condition with additional naoh titration to follow the ph rising pattern as in the experimental test 3 results and discussion 3 1 tcl 1 biomass growth variation of tcl 1 biomass growth and ph value are presented in fig 1 with a supportive data in table 2 at the initial period 2 4 h several cases of cultivation presented decrease of tcl 1 growth that might be related to the adaptation phase for lag period of growth the biomass of tcl 1 was originally cultivated in the 3 fold mf medium for the pre cultivation process however in the experimental test the supply of nutrients was changed to 5 fold mf medium or swine wastewater thus the adaptation time was needed by tcl 1 to adjust the new condition the above mentioned cases included the cultivation using swine wastewater 500 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s and mf medium 500 Î¼e m2 s decreasing the biomass density might be used by tcl 1 to adjust the condition under low light intensity light intensity significantly influenced the photosynthesis tcl 1 presented the best growth in wastewater under the supply of 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity with 55 7 6 2 mg l h biomass productivity implementation of higher light intensity also has been reported by nzayisenga et al 26 to improve the growth of several tested microalgae chlorella vulgaris desmodesmus sp ettlia pseudoalveolaris and scenedesmus obliquus furthermore illumination of 500 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s presented much less growth during the cultivation period similarly 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity promoted the growth in mf medium and presented the best biomass productivity of 71 5 3 5 mg l h higher light intensity will increase biomass productivity 27 28 at a certain level exceeding light intensity causes photoinhibition and damages the photosynthesis system 29 therefore the biomass productivity of tcl 1 cultivated in mf medium also presented a lower value when 2000 Î¼e m2 s was applied as the light supply illumination of high light intensity might also relate with the photosynthetic process different from the low light intensity condition increasing of light energy under saturated condition does not improve photosynthetic rate in fact the excessive lighting leads to photoxodation damage to the apparatus of photosynthesis 30 furthermore the tendency of increasing ph value was detected in all cases of tcl 1 cultivation the highest measured ph value reached 11 8 tcl 1 has been reported to have a high tolerance to alkaline condition up to ph value of 12 but extremely high alkalinity led to inhibition of biomass growth 31 a similar trend also appeared in this study where a slower growth rate was detected when the ph value almost reached 12 nevertheless an overall significant increment of ph value in this study could be observed as an index of tcl 1 well growth since the trend was analogous to the performance of biomass increment 3 2 utilization of nutrients the nutrients utilizations by tcl 1 during cultivation test are presented in fig 2 along with the data in table 2 these data are also supported by the elemental analysis of freeze dried tcl 1 cells in supplementary b initial total nitrogen concentration was detected in the range of 60 103 mg l as previously reported by narindri rara winayu et al 32 ammonium is the dominant nitrogen species in wastewater with a small amount of nitrate and nitrite however in the prepared mf medium din was added in the form of sodium nitrate rapid removal of total nitrogen tn content in wastewater was detected at the first 8 h of cultivation under the illumination of 500 and 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity in the swine wastewater cultivation with 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity only 83 6 tn utilization was detected increasing of light intensity has inverse influence in nutrient utilization as reported by ahmed et al 28 moreover a much lower utilization value was detected in the mf medium cultivation which was related to the tcl 1 preference in utilization of nitrogen species ammonium is the favorable nitrogen species for cyanobacteria 33 and further supports the efficient synthesis of n products such as protein 113 2 mm dic was supplemented in both mf medium and swine wastewater as the carbon source for tcl 1 growth during cultivation in mf medium tcl 1 utilized more dic than that swine wastewater was applied as growth medium however in both types of growth mediums the higher light intensity led to a greater dic consumption in mf medium cultivation tcl 1 utilized 33 5 6 3 44 0 1 6 and 46 0 2 7 dic under 500 1000 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity respectively furthermore microalgae and cyanobacteria have been reported to be applied in removal of organic carbon with an efficiency up to 87 2 34 nevertheless removal of toc by tcl 1 did not occur in the overall experimental study fig 2b tcl 1 produced toc instead with the rate of 0 7 0 3 1 5 0 4 and 2 5 0 6 mg l h for cultivation using swine wastewater under 500 1000 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity respectively instead of removal several microalgae like nostoc piscinale nostoc sp and anabaena variabilis will release organic carbon during the biomass growth which lead to increasing of chemical oxygen demand cod 35 furthermore cyanobacteria also have the tendency to excrete extracellular polysaccharides or a large amount of carbohydrates and lead to the rising of dissolved organic carbon doc 36 3 3 co2 fixation by tcl 1 table 2 presents the content of carbon element at the 0 and 12 h of cultivation period that was applied for calculation of co2 fixation rate direct calculation of co2 fixation rate through checking of carbon content using elemental analysis is considered accurate especially for phototrophic microorganism which only has co2 as the carbon source 37 cyanobacteria have been acknowledged to have great performance in co2 fixation however the strain type of microorganism plays an important role which will be related to co2 availability for the cell and the amount of produced enzyme for photosynthesis process insignificant carbon content change of tcl 1 during all cases of cultivation in this study indicated the similar ability of tcl 1 carbon intake in both types of cultivation medium furthermore cultivation with the higher biomass productivity of tcl 1 cultivated in mf medium resulted in a higher co2 fixation rate tcl 1 presented the best performance under 1000 Î¼e m2 s for both mf medium and swine wastewater with the co2 fixation rate of 124 6 3 3 and 91 8 8 6 mg l h respectively compared to other studies tcl 1 performed more rapid co2 fixation an experiment using co culture of several microalgae types for the treatment of brewery wastewater resulted in a lower co2 fixation rate of 32 09 mg l d 38 tcl 1 owns sbta gene which is known as the high affinity bicarbonate transporter that plays an important role in improving bicarbonate uptake during co2 fixation process 39 3 4 zn removal by tcl 1 feedstock supplements containing cu and zn may be added in pig s diet for improvement of immune system however due to limited uptake rate by pigs 8 excessive concentrations of heavy metals might still remain in the feces and have the possibility to be discharged into environment 7 fig 3 presents the observation of morphology change under sem analysis zn removal performance of tcl 1 supportive data about the comparison with other studies is provided in supplementary c tcl 1 cell presented morphological changes during the cultivation test period fig 3a c in both mf medium and swine wastewater the changes might be related to the self defense mechanism or nutrient utilization by tcl 1 a long rod shape cell was presented in sem images during the pre cultivation stage however when the swine wastewater was applied as nutrient supply irregular nodule was inspected on some part of the tcl 1 surface along with the appearance of a membranous substance covering the cell a similar change was also detected in the cultivation using mf medium growth and metabolism of photosynthetic microorganisms along with changes of physiological and biochemical in cell are highly influenced by the presence of heavy metals 10 fig 3d presents the tcl 1 performance on zn removal along with data in tables 2 and 3 compared to swine wastewater tcl 1 performed greater zn removal when mf medium was applied as the nutrient source zn removals in the range of 59 9 82 8 were reached with the cultivation using mf medium differently a rapid reduction of zn content in swine wastewater was detected during the initial 4 h of tcl 1 experimental period under the illumination of 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity however implementation of 500 or 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity only performed insignificant zn removal which might be due to the adaptation process in lag phase of the growth as can be seen in fig 1 about biomass growth nevertheless drastic zn removal was achieved at the further cultivation period total zn removal of 58 8 15 8 62 5 8 8 and 7 0 23 3 from tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater under 500 1000 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity respectively the lowest and most diverse zn removal was achieved under 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity it might be due to the effect of photoinhibition and damage on the photosynthesis system which led to the change in structure of tcl 1 cell s surface zn also plays an important role in photosynthesis process especially in regulation of photosynthetic enzymes along with the detoxification of oxygen radicals from membrane damage 40 zn is known as one of important ions involved in enzymes e g carbonic anhydrases cas and the important zinc dependent metalloenzymes related to carbon fixation 41 furthermore blindauer 42 reported the cyanobacterial genomes of zn handling sequences could regulate important proteins in zn homeostases such as bmta smtb and ziar besides zn is included in the typical heavy metals that will be utilized as micro nutrients by photosynthetic microorganisms for the purpose of metabolism and enzyme related processes 10 although zn as well known is an essential element for tcl 1 the effects of uptake rate and detoxification mechanism while moving zn ion into the cell are unknown a previous study using ceratophyllum demersum l a freshwater cyanobacterium reported the zn protection on chloroplast and maintenance of photochemical processes 43 due to the low zn concentration in swine wastewater study on zn uptake mechanism by tcl 1 was carried out using mf medium with the supplementation of 60 70 Î¼g l zn fig 4a this arrangement in mf medium was arranged to simulate the 3 fold zn content in swine wastewater which presented the average value of 20 40 Î¼g l after dilution in this study greater removal rate of heavy metals will be achieved by cultivation of microorganisms in higher initial concentration of heavy metals due to the sorption isotherm 17 44 illumination of 1000 and 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensities led to a more intensive reduction of zn compared to 500 Î¼e m2 s light intensity heavy metal uptake by microorganisms is usually carried out under a biphasic process 45 bioadsorption initiates the first phase of heavy metal bioremoval mechanism followed by bioaccumulation and detoxification the carboxy hydroxy and some other functional groups of cell surface components are highly relevant to metals adsorption and the correlation between metals adsorption and exopolysaccharides formation on the cell surface has been widely discussed 46 nevertheless higher c element was detected after the cultivation period which indicated the formation of exopolysaccharide eps on the cell surface for both cases of mf and wastewater indication of eps formation could also lead to the detection bias in determination of zn content and determination of cell surface thickness on the other hand the intercellular accumulated zn might also support the uptaking zn mechanism by tcl 1 this result is in agreement with the previous study of novÃ¡k et al 47 that the detected zn and cu accumulation in the intercellular region of desmodesmus communis and monoraphidium pusillum within hours also exceeded the amount in extracellular adsorption at lower metal concentration photosynthetic microorganisms generated various transporters for specific heavy metals such as fe2 mn2 and zn2 in the plasma membrane for transportation of those compounds to the cytoplasm 10 furthermore an increment of zn ion concentration in liquid was detected in the blank test without tcl 1 biomass fig 4b using swine wastewater along with a slight rising in ph value from 9 to 9 7 due to the stripping of ammonia and co2 content however application of various light intensities gave insignificant differences in increasing zn concentration in liquid as ph value was conditioned in the alkaline range higher precipitation event occurred and converted zn oh 2 into salt therefore adsorbed zn declined and zn was in the form of zn2 ion moreover application of the unsterilized wastewater in this study might influence the change in zn concentration combination of microalgae and bacteria in a consortia might enhance the removal of heavy metals through its synergistic symbiosis 48 a previous study of narindri rara winayu et al 21 reported the presence of the tiny amount of other microorganism species at the end of tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater after anoxic treatment even though domination of tcl 1 still presented the major work furthermore under the high ph value zn hydroxide has lower solubility which further lead to the precipitation mechanism as the removal method moreover application of high temperature also plays important role in solubility of zn hydroxide 49 3 5 accumulation of macromolecules protein lipid and carbohydrate by tcl 1 tcl 1 has been known to accumulate various types of byproducts in this study macromolecule including carbohydrate lipid and protein was chosen as the targeted byproducts and the results are presented in fig 5 and table 4 for the content and productivity of accumulated byproducts respectively tcl 1 performed different trends of accumulated macromolecules content between the cultivations in swine wastewater and mf medium for the case of protein accumulation supply of different light intensity carried out insignificant protein content changes in the dry weight cells however protein was the dominant accumulated macromolecule during the cultivation with the highest contents of 59 5 3 1 and 64 7 6 1 dwc for cultivations in swine wastewater and mf medium respectively the protein productivities were 26 0 8 3 and 60 2 17 4 mg l h for cultivations in swine wastewater and mf medium respectively at 1000 Î¼e m2 s several other microalgae have been reported to have similar protein content levels including spirulina euglena tetraselmis synechococcus and nannochloropsis 50 which are suitable for feedstock production or the source in the pharmaceutical industry however examination of the protein quality food safety standards and management in separation extraction and recovery techniques should be considered in the application process insignificant lipid content changes were observed during the cultivation under various light intensities the best biomass growth under 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity resulted in the highest lipid productivities of 17 0 2 6 and 40 5 22 4 mg l h for cultivations in swine wastewater and mf medium respectively however different from this study higher light intensity commonly enhances the production of lipid content along with the change in its composition for several types of microalgae 51 a different trend was detected in the carbohydrate accumulation for tcl 1 cultivation in swine wastewater and mf medium that might be related to the different trends in nutrients utilization during the process cultivation using swine wastewater tended to increase accumulated carbohydrate content in tcl 1 while the cultivation in mf medium produced higher protein content rapid nitrogen utilization in tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater created the nitrogen limited condition during the late hour of cultivation period and reduced protein production however the rich nutrient level in mf medium tended to lead tcl 1 macromolecule production to lipid and protein content similar result was also reported by a previous study of cardoso et al 52 that the limited nitrogen condition would divert synthesis of protein and result in higher lipid or carbohydrates production some other studies also reported the reduction of carbohydrate and lipid contents during cultivation in nutrient rich condition 53 54 furthermore the tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater and 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity produced the highest carbohydrate content 10 8 but in the cultivation using mf medium the highest carbohydrate content was achieved under 2000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity 4 conclusion various advantages from tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater were assessed and compared with its performance in mf medium the results in this study indicated that swine wastewater provided sufficient nutrients to support the growth of tcl 1 besides the supply of 1000 Î¼e m2 s light intensity was found to be the suitable growth condition for tcl 1 growth the best biomass productivity and co2 fixation value of 55 7 6 2 mg l h and 97 9 6 2 mg l h respectively was reached by the cultivation of tcl 1 in the swine wastewater the initial zn content in the swine wastewater was in the range of 20 40 Î¼g l and was removed 62 5 8 8 by tcl 1 moreover tcl 1 performed better zn removal value 82 8 0 5 using mf medium which had higher initial zn content of 60 70 Î¼g l as the other benefit tcl 1 cultivation in swine wastewater also generated protein as the major produced macromolecules with the highest protein content of 59 5 3 1 dwc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

12409,the introduction of antibiotics into the environment leads to serious environmental problems and public health concerns along these lines in this work a facile strategy to fabricate the mxene ti membrane was developed by loading 2d ultrathin ti3c2tx nanosheets on the porous ti membrane through electrophoretic deposition which was used as anode material for the degradation of the tetracycline hydrochloride tch wastewater in the electrocatalytic membrane reactor ecmr from the acquired degradation results it was demonstrated that the removal efficiency of tch and total organic carbon toc was nearly 100 and 90 4 with the obtained mxene ti anode in the ecmr respectively under a temperature value of 20 c a current density of 0 8 ma cm 2 a residence time of 10 min an electrolyte na2so4 concentration of 15 g l 1 a tch concentration of 50 mg l 1 and a ph of 7 0 reaction conditions these values were much higher than that of pristine ti membrane anode and other reported electrochemical treatment processes such as electrocatalysis photo electrocatalysis process etc the excellent stability of the mxene ti anode was also demonstrated by performing 15 cycles test the superior removal efficiency of tch and the mineralization ability of antibiotics could be ascribed to the formation of 2d nanocomposites of ti3c2tx and tio2 our work paves the way for the utilization of mxene ti membrane electrodes and ecmr for the efficient removal of antibiotics from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ti3c2tx nanosheets mxene ti membrane electrocatalytic membrane reactor tetracycline degradation electrocatalytic oxidation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays various types of emerging contaminants ecs at low concentrations can be found in wastewater surface and drinking water such as pharmaceuticals the presence of ecs can greatly deteriorate the quality of the water due to their adverse impact on the ecosystem and humans 1 2 tetracycline antibiotics tcs as regarded as one of the most common antibiotic drugs which have been widely used for promoting animal growth and treating diseases in the world 3 however the majority of tcs has been discharged into the aqueous environment and due to their low biodegradability and chemical reactivity they pose to a serious threat to human health and ecosystems even with extremely low level 2 hence it is of outmost importance to develop an efficient and fast technique for removing tcs in wastewater to this end various techniques have been employed to remove tcs from water such as adsorption microbial degradation photocatalysis fenton oxidation and ozone oxidation 2 4 14 in recent years the electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop for pollutant degradation has emerged as a promising strategy in the field of water treatment due to its environmentally friendly and economic advantages 15 24 during the application of the eaop method the electrons as clean reagents can be used for the redox reaction without the addition of a strong oxidant several ti based electrodes with metal oxides as active layers have been already reported in the literature for the removal of tcs via the eaop such as sno2 sb 25 26 pbo2 27 ti4o7 28 and iro2 29 30 however this method still faces several challenges including the low removal rate of tcs the reduced mineralization rate the complicated electrode preparation and poor stability which significantly limit its wide application recently the electrocatalytic membrane reactor ecmr via coupling the membrane separation technology coupled with electrochemical methods has been reported by our group which exhibits excellent degradation performance for organic electrosynthesis and organic pollutants e g phenol dyes in wastewater 31 43 more importantly the mass transfer limitation can be overcome by using a flow through configuration owing to convection enhanced mass transfer and thus dramatically improve the catalytic performance of ecmr can be dramatically improved 36 41 hence it is much more desirable to design and prepare highly efficient membrane electrodes which would affect the performance of ecmr on the other hand 2d materials have attracted extensive attention from the scientific community owing to their fascinating physicochemical properties and unique structural features since the successful exfoliation of graphene in 2004 44 45 recently mxenes as one of the most typical 2d nanomaterials referred to as 2d transition metal carbides nitrides and carbonitrides have also demonstrated superior performance in various fields such as catalysis energy storage and water treatment since the first report of ti3c2 in 2011 46 47 mxenes possess good electrical conductivity hydrophilicity and a functionalizable surface rendering them a promising choice for electrocatalyst applications 45 46 to the best of knowledge the degradation of antibiotics with the utilization of mxene modified membrane electrodes via eaop has not been reported in the literature under this perspective in this work a facile strategy to fabricate mxene ti membrane anode ti3c2tx ti through electrophoretic deposition for the degradation of antibiotics was developed more specifically ti3c2tx nanosheets were first prepared from ti3alc2 precursor powder the ti3c2tx nanosheets were then anchored on the flat ti membrane electrode via the electrophoretic deposition process the obtained mxene ti membrane was systematically investigated by performing field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem transmission electron microscope tem x ray diffraction xrd and electrochemical measurements tetracycline hydrochloride tch was also studied as one of the most typical tcs for the elimination of tcs from an aqueous solution with the mxene ti membrane anode in the ecmr the extracted superior removal rate of tch high mineralization rate of tch and excellent stability of the membrane electrode demonstrated the great potential application of ecmr with mxenes ti membrane for efficient removal of tcs in wastewater 2 experimental section 2 1 materials the flat microporous

reagent technology co ltd all reagents were analytical grade reagents and no further purification was required 2 2 preparation of the mxene ti membrane electrodes the ti3c2tx nanosheets were first prepared according to the reported protocols see the supporting information 48 and they were supported on the titanium membrane electrodes via electrophoretic deposition the solution concentration of ti3c2tx nanosheets was controlled at about 2 8 mg ml 1 during the deposition process moreover ti membrane electrodes were used as anode and cathode which were immersed in 80 ml of ti3c2tx colloidal solution as depicted in fig 1 a direct current dc power supply maynuo m8811 was used for carrying out the electrophoretic deposition the distance was fixed at 3 5 cm between the two electrodes different deposition times were was adopted e g 5 10 15 and 20 min termed as epd5 mxene ti epd10 mxene ti epd15 mxene ti epd20 mxene ti respectively at a constant voltage of 5 v the obtained membrane was dried under vacuum at the temperature value of 40 c and then placed in a tube furnace under ar gas with a heating rate of 1 c min 1 to 100 c and 3 c min 1 to 400 c after holding at 400 c for 1 h the mxene ti membrane electrode was obtained the loading amount of mxene on the membrane was estimated through the weight method 2 3 characterizations the surface morphology and structure of the membrane electrodes were investigated by conducting field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem zeiss gemini sem500 germany transmission electron microscope tem hitachi h7650 japan and x ray

frequency sweep range of 10 2 105 hz with 5 0 mv amplitude while the ca test was operated at 1 5 v voltage for 30 min 2 5 degradation of tch in the ecmr the obtained mxene ti membrane electrode and the stainless steel mesh were used as anode and cathode materials in the ecmr respectively similar to our previouly reported works fig s1 see supporting information 35 the electrolyte solutions containing na2so4 15 g l 1 were used the removal rate of tch in solution was determined by using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1100 shanghai meproda instruments shanghai the removal of the toc was

and permeate solution mg l 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of mxene the ti3c2tx nanosheets were prepared with the ti3alc2 as raw powder by using wet chemical etching and delamination procedures 49 50 the morphology and structure of the max phase ti3alc2 and the etched multilayer ti3c2tx nanosheets were investigated with sem and tem imaging as shown in fig s2 the ti3alc2 exhibited granular morphology with an average diameter of about 4 5 Î¼m fig s2a the aluminum component in the ti3alc2 was selectively etched in a solution containing both hydrochloric acid and lithium fluoride to produce accordion like multilayer mxene fig s2b the multilayer ti3c2tx nanosheets were characterized by performing energy dispersive spectroscopy eds measurements to confirm the removal of the al interlayer fig s3 the crystal structures of the ti3alc2 and ti3c2tx powders were also investigated by the recorded xrd patterns fig s4 the obvious diffraction peaks of the max phase were observed at about 9 and 39 belonging to the 002 and 104 crystal planes of ti3alc2 jcpdf 52 0875 after the selective etching process the 002 diffraction peak was shifted to a small angle indicating the increase in the interlayer spacing the sharp decline of the peak at 39 indicated that the al layer in ti3alc2 was removed 49 a large number of end groups such as o oh f further expanded the layer spacing owing to the reaction with the acid etching solution the colloidal solution of fewer layer ti3c2tx nanosheets was obtained through ultrasonication for further delamination of the multilayer mxene fig s2c as can be observed fig s2c the size of ti3c2tx nanosheets was about 500 600 nm besides the thickness of the ti3c2tx nanosheets was about 1 5 nm according to the afm result fig s5 confirming the successful preparation of a single layer or few layers of mxene the chemical composition and structure of ti3c2tx nanosheets were discerned by analyzing the xps spectra fig 2a c and e as shown in fig 2a the ti 2p region of the as prepared ti3c2tx nanosheets was fit by four doublets which represent tic at 455 1 and 461 0 ev c ti oh at 455 8 and 461 7 ev c ti o at 457 0 and 462 7 ev and tio2 at 459 0 and 463 8 ev 51 52 the data show that the obtained ti3c2tx nanosheets have 11 6 tio2 indicating slight oxidation of ti3c2tx the strong intensity of the cti peaks at 282 1 ev confirms also the presence of tic bonds in the ti3c2tx as can be seen in fig 2e 3 2 preparation and characterization of the mxene ti membrane the ti3c2tx nanosheets were supported on the titanium membrane by using the electrophoretic deposition method the initial titanium membrane exhibited a porous structure and smooth surface as shown in fig 3a b after being treated with the colloidal solution of the ti3c2tx nanosheets via electrophoretic deposition the layered nanosheets were observed on the surface of membrane pores indicating successful loading of the ti3c2tx nanosheets the loading amount of mxene of epd15 mxene ti was about 0 21 wt the crystalline structures of the pristine ti membrane and mxene ti membrane electrodes were also investigated via the xrd spectra fig 4 two weak peaks at about 9 and 17 were discerned which can be attributed attributing to the 002 and 004 plane of ti3c2tx nanosheets respectively confirming the successful formation of the mxene ti membrane the chemical states and surface groups of the epd mxene ti membrane were also investigated by the acquired xps spectra as displayed in fig 2b the surface composition of the obtained epd15 mxene ti membrane contained 31 1 tio2 which was much higher than that of the pristine ti3c2tx nanosheets demonstrating an obvious increase in the tio2 content fig 2c d show the o 1 s spectra of the pristine ti3c2tx nanosheets and epd15 mxene ti membrane respectively the tio2 component sharply increased after loading on the ti membrane as a result of the oxidation moreover the weak intensity of the tic bond in the c 1 s region demonstrated the obvious oxidation of the ti3c2tx flakes on the surface of the epd15 mxene ti membrane fig 2f 53 3 3 electrochemical measurements of the mxene ti membrane a three electrode system was employed for carrying out the electrochemical measurements of the mxene ti membrane electrode the mxene ti membrane and platinum sheet were employed as the working and counter electrodes respectively a mixture of 1 mm k3 fe cn 6 and 500 mm kcl was also used as the electrolyte solution according to the measured cv curves depicted in fig 5a a pair of fe3 fe2 redox peaks can be found in the range of 0 1 0 3 v with the mxene ti membrane electrode compared with the pristine titanium membrane the oxidation peak current over the mxene ti membrane dramatically increased indicating the existence of higher oxidation activity and rapid kinetics of the electron transfer of the ti membrane after the functionalization with the ti3c2tx nanosheets the peak currents values for the epd5 mxene ti epd10 mxene ti epd15 mxene ti and epd20 mxene ti membrane electrodes achieved 1 19 ma cm 2 1 64 ma cm 2 1 88 ma cm 2 and 1 85 ma cm 2 respectively the active surface areas of the membrane electrode were calculated through the slope of ipa versus v 1 2 plot according to the randles sevcik equation 37 1 i p 2 69 10 5 n 3 2 a d 1 2 Ï 1 2 c where n refers to the electron transfer number a denotes the electrode surface area d is the diffusion coefficient of the electroactive molecules on the electrode surface c represents the indicator molecule concentration and Î½ stands for the scan rate for the k3 fe cn 6 system the values of n and d were 1 and 7 6 10 6 cm2 s 1 respectively according to eq 1 the electrochemically active areas per unit area cm2 of the mxene ti membranes were 0 53 cm2 0 55 cm2 0 69 cm2 and 0 67 cm2 for the mxene ti membrane electrodes with 5 min 10 min 15 min and 20 min deposition time respectively the epd15 mxene ti membrane electrode revealed the highest oxidation current and electrochemically active area suggesting the fastest kinetics of the electron transfer and the best electrocatalytic oxidation activity eis measurements were also performed to systematically investigate the electron transfer kinetics and interface impedances of the membranes figs 5c and s6 present the impedance nyquist plots of the mxene ti membrane and pristine titanium membrane electrodes in alkaline media 0 1 m naoh respectively the semicircles could be attributed to charge transfer resistance rct in the high frequency region the existence of a semicircle with a small diameter indicates a small value of rct obviously the rct value 21 Ï dramatically decreased compared to that of the pristine titanium membrane 180 Ï after the loading of ti3c2tx nanosheets confirming the successful loading of the ti3c2tx nanosheets and the enhancement of electrochemical kinetics of the ti membrane electrode in the low frequency region the mxene ti membrane electrode exhibited a more ideal straight line implying a more efficient diffusion of the electrolyte and charge especially for the mxene ti membrane obtained with 15 min and 20 min deposition time these results may be because the loading of mxene can greatly enhance the electrical conductivity of the membrane electrode facilitate the diffusion of charge or ions and thus improve the charge transfer properties 3 4 degradation of tch in wastewater the as prepared mxene ti membrane electrodes were used as anode in the ecmr to examine the degradation performance of antibiotic wastewater the concentration of tch wastewater was 50 mg l 1 and the degradation results are displayed in fig 6 the removal rate of tch with the epd5 mxene ti epd10 mxene ti epd15 mxene ti epd20 mxene ti membrane electrodes reached 90 9 97 4 98 7 and 98 6 respectively more importantly the removal rate of toc with the epd5 mxene ti epd10 mxene ti epd15 mxene ti and epd20 mxene ti membrane electrodes achieved 70 2 82 4 87 1 and 86 7 removal of toc respectively by contrast the removal rates of tch and toc with the pristine ti membrane were 58 1 and 21 1 respectively clearly the higher removal rates of tch and toc indicate the superior degradation and mineralization of the tch via the eaop with the electrocatalytic mxene ti membrane electrode moreover a flow through configuration in the ecmr could overcome the limitation of mass transfer with the traditional plate electrodes thereby remarkably improving the catalytic performance of the eaop process the epd15 mxene ti membrane electrode as anode exhibited the best degradation performance in the ecmr which can be ascribed to the high electrochemically active area elevated electrocatalytic oxidation activity and superior kinetics of electron transfer to improve the degradation performance the influence of various parameters of ecmr with epd15 mxene ti anode was further investigated including ph and initial concentration of tch in the feed solution current density residence time fig 7 as can be ascertained from fig 7a the ph of the feed solution had a significant impact on the removal rate of tch and toc when the ph increased from 3 0 to 7 0 the removal rate of toc increased from 70 9 to 90 4 one possible interpretation for this effect is that at a ph value of 7 0 enhanced production of hydroxyl radical than with ph of 3 0 and 5 0 takes place when the ph value was 9 0 the removal of toc decreased to 76 mainly due to the inhibition of the hydroxyl radical production 55 therefore the optimal ph for tetracycline hydrochloride removal in ecmr was 7 0 as shown in fig 7b the removal rate of toc revealed an increasing trend when the current density raised from 0 4 ma cm 2 to 0 8 ma cm 2 if the current density raise was higher than 0 8 ma cm 2 the removal rate of tch and toc decreased owing to the competition reaction of oer when the current density was 0 8 ma cm 2 the removal of tch reached the optimal values namely 99 7 removal rate of tch and 90 4 removal rate of toc the increase in the residence time can further extend the reaction time between the reactant molecules in the feed solution and the active sites on the membrane surface and thus improve the degradation performance as can be observed in fig 7c when the residence time was raised from 6 0 min to 10 0 min the removal rate of tch increased from 90 2 to 99 2 however when the residence time was 12 0 min the removal rate of toc lowered to 83 8 the flow rate of the permeate solution can be also controlled by the resident time which would have a significant influence on the contact time and turbulence 55 the oh radicals generated from the electrode surface can oxidize the organic pollutants which can be generated with available contact time and turbulence that promote the organic molecules reaching the electrode surface to be oxidized by the radicals therefore when the resident time increased from 6 min to 10 min the removal rate of tch and toc also increased however if the residence time was further increased from 10 min to 12 min the removal rate of tch and toc decreased due to the slow desorption of the intermediate species and the limited mass diffusion of the reactant resulting from longer contact time and less turbulence as displayed in fig 7d when the tch concentration increased from 50 mg l 1 to 250 mg l 1 the removal rate of toc decreased from 90 4 to 78 5 mainly due to the limitation of the active sites on the surface of mxene ti membrane in order to evaluate the stability of the mxene ti membrane electrode in the ecmr cycle tests were carried out with epd15 mxene ti membrane for the degradation of tch under the following reaction conditions temperature value of 20 c current density of 0 8 ma cm 2 residence time of 10 min an electrolyte na2so4 concentration of 15 g l 1 ph value of 7 0 tch concentration of 50 mg l 1 and each reaction time of 4 h after carrying 15 times cycle tests the removal rates of tch and toc were 96 9 and 85 4 respectively much close to the initial results suggesting excellent long term stability of mxene ti membrane anode in the ecmr fig 8a b 3 5 degradation pathway of tch to further investigate the reaction mechanism and degradation pathway of tch the intermediate products were discerned through the uplc qtof ms analysis fig s7 the major compounds were found at a mass to charge ratio m z of 430 415 274 and 226 respectively according to the literature work 56 a possible degradation pathway of tch was proposed in the ecmr as shown in fig 9 tc can be broken into small molecules by the process of dealkylation ring opening and other ways finally the intermediates are further mineralized to co2 and h2o based on these results it can be concluded that the construction of mxene ti membrane electrodes with ti3c2tx nanosheets is an efficient strategy to remarkably improve the degradation performance and mineralization degree of antibiotic wastewater via the eaop in the ecmr obviously compared with the other reported previous methods such as the conventional electrooxidation process photo fenton and photo electrocatalysis process the proposed electrocatalytic process via ecmr exhibits much better degradation performance as presented in table 1 the exceptional degradation performance of the mxene ti membrane electrode could be attributed to the formation of 2d nanocomposites with ti3c2 and tio2 as was confirmed by the xps spectra 57 actually tio2 is also an active electrocatalyst to degrade antibiotic wastewater which can be confirmed by the degradation performance of the pristine ti membrane electrode with a partial cover of tio2 resulting from the annealing preparation of the ti membrane meanwhile ti3c2tx nanosheets with strong metallic properties can serve as a co catalyst which could change the band structure and electronic structure of tio2 and thereby significantly enhance the electrocatalytic oxidation activity of the membrane electrode 57 in addition the incorporation of the ti3c2tx nanosheets on the surface of the membrane pores can improve the conductivity and accelerate the production of hydroxyl radicals which facilitate the mineralization of antibiotics to co2 and h2o 35 36 4 conclusions in summary the novel mxene ti electrocatalytic membrane electrode was developed which was through the electrophoretic deposition method with the flat porous ti microfiltration membrane as substrate and 2d ti3c2tx nanosheets as catalytic active sites this membrane can be employed as an anode in the ecmr for the effective treatment of tch antibiotic wastewater under the optimal reaction conditions of 0 8 ma cm 2 current density 10 min residence time 15 g l 1 electrolyte na2so4 concentration 50 mg l 1 concentration of tch wastewater and ph 7 0 the ecmr fabricated with mxene ti membrane anode demonstrated outstanding degradation performance and enhanced mineralization for tch i e 99 7 removal rate of tch and 90 4 removal rate of toc moreover it also exhibited good long term stability the superior degradation performance and well stability of the mxene ti membrane electrode can be ascribed to the formation of 2d nanocomposites with ti3c2 and tio2 furthermore the loading of the ti3c2tx nanosheets can improve the conductivity and accelerate the production of hydroxyl radicals which facilitates the mineralization of antibiotics to co2 and h2o our present work paves the way for the development and application of electrocatalytic membrane and ecmr with mxene based electrocatalysts for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12409,the introduction of antibiotics into the environment leads to serious environmental problems and public health concerns along these lines in this work a facile strategy to fabricate the mxene ti

hydrochloride tch wastewater in the electrocatalytic membrane reactor ecmr from the acquired degradation results it was demonstrated that the removal efficiency of tch and total organic carbon toc was nearly 100 and 90 4 with the obtained mxene ti anode in the ecmr respectively under a temperature value of 20 c a current density of 0 8 ma cm 2 a residence time of 10 min an electrolyte na2so4 concentration of 15 g l 1 a tch concentration of 50 mg l 1 and a ph of 7 0 reaction conditions these values were much higher than that of pristine ti membrane anode and other reported electrochemical treatment processes such as electrocatalysis photo electrocatalysis process etc the excellent stability of the mxene ti anode was also demonstrated by performing 15 cycles test the superior removal efficiency of tch and the mineralization ability of antibiotics could be ascribed to the formation of 2d nanocomposites of ti3c2tx and tio2 our work paves the way for the utilization of mxene ti membrane electrodes and ecmr for the efficient removal of antibiotics from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ti3c2tx nanosheets mxene ti membrane electrocatalytic membrane reactor tetracycline degradation electrocatalytic oxidation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays various types of emerging contaminants ecs at low concentrations can be found in wastewater surface and drinking water such as pharmaceuticals the presence of ecs can greatly deteriorate the quality of the water due to their adverse impact on the ecosystem and humans 1 2 tetracycline antibiotics tcs as regarded as one of the most common antibiotic drugs which have been widely used for promoting animal growth and treating diseases in the world 3 however the majority of tcs has been discharged into the aqueous environment and due to their low biodegradability and chemical reactivity they pose to a serious threat to human health and ecosystems even with extremely low level 2 hence it is of outmost importance to develop an efficient and fast technique for removing tcs in wastewater to this end various techniques have been employed to remove tcs from water such as adsorption microbial degradation photocatalysis fenton oxidation and ozone oxidation 2 4 14 in recent years the electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop for pollutant degradation has emerged as a promising strategy in the field of water treatment due to its environmentally friendly and economic advantages 15 24 during the application of the eaop method the electrons as clean reagents can be used for the redox reaction without the addition of a strong oxidant several ti based electrodes with metal oxides as active layers have been already reported in the literature for the removal of tcs via the eaop such as sno2 sb 25 26 pbo2 27 ti4o7 28 and iro2 29 30 however this method still faces several challenges including the low removal rate of tcs the reduced mineralization rate the complicated electrode preparation and poor stability which significantly limit its wide application recently the electrocatalytic membrane reactor ecmr via coupling the membrane separation technology coupled with electrochemical methods has been reported by our group which exhibits excellent degradation performance for organic electrosynthesis and organic pollutants e g phenol dyes in wastewater 31 43 more importantly the mass transfer limitation can be overcome by using a flow through configuration owing to convection enhanced mass transfer and thus dramatically improve the catalytic performance of ecmr can be dramatically improved 36 41 hence it is much more desirable to design and prepare highly efficient membrane electrodes which would affect the performance of ecmr on the other hand 2d materials have attracted extensive attention from the scientific community owing to their fascinating physicochemical properties and unique structural features since the successful exfoliation of graphene in 2004 44 45 recently mxenes as one of the most typical 2d nanomaterials referred to as 2d transition metal carbides nitrides and carbonitrides have also demonstrated superior performance in various fields such as catalysis energy storage and water treatment since the first report of ti3c2 in 2011 46 47 mxenes possess good electrical conductivity hydrophilicity and a functionalizable surface rendering them a promising choice for electrocatalyst applications 45 46 to the best of knowledge the degradation of antibiotics with the utilization of mxene modified membrane electrodes via eaop has not been reported in the literature under this perspective in this work a facile strategy to fabricate mxene ti membrane anode ti3c2tx ti through

microscope fe sem transmission electron microscope tem x ray diffraction xrd and electrochemical measurements tetracycline hydrochloride tch was also studied as one of the most typical tcs for the elimination of tcs from an aqueous solution with the mxene ti membrane anode in the ecmr the extracted superior removal rate of tch high mineralization rate of tch and excellent stability of the

prepared according to the reported protocols see the supporting information 48 and they were supported on the titanium membrane electrodes via electrophoretic deposition the solution concentration of ti3c2tx nanosheets was controlled at about 2 8 mg ml 1 during the deposition process moreover ti membrane electrodes were used as anode and cathode which were immersed in 80 ml of ti3c2tx colloidal solution as depicted in fig 1 a direct current dc power supply maynuo m8811 was used for carrying out the electrophoretic deposition the distance was fixed at 3 5 cm between the two electrodes different deposition times were was adopted e g 5 10 15 and 20 min termed as epd5 mxene ti epd10 mxene ti epd15 mxene ti epd20 mxene ti respectively at a constant voltage of 5 v the obtained membrane

the mxene ti membrane electrode was obtained the loading amount of mxene on the membrane was estimated through the weight method 2 3 characterizations the surface morphology and structure of the

the stainless steel mesh were used as anode and cathode materials in the ecmr respectively similar to our previouly reported works fig s1 see supporting information 35 the electrolyte solutions containing na2so4 15 g l 1 were used the removal rate of tch in solution was determined by using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1100 shanghai meproda instruments shanghai the removal of the toc was

and permeate solution mg l 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of mxene the ti3c2tx nanosheets were prepared with the ti3alc2 as raw powder by using wet chemical etching and delamination procedures 49 50 the morphology and structure of the max phase ti3alc2 and the etched multilayer ti3c2tx nanosheets were investigated with sem and tem imaging as shown in fig s2 the ti3alc2 exhibited granular morphology with an average diameter of about 4 5 Î¼m fig s2a the aluminum component in the ti3alc2 was selectively etched in a solution containing both hydrochloric acid and lithium fluoride to produce accordion like multilayer mxene fig s2b the multilayer ti3c2tx nanosheets were characterized by performing energy dispersive spectroscopy eds measurements to confirm the removal of the al interlayer fig s3 the crystal structures of the ti3alc2 and ti3c2tx powders were also investigated by the recorded xrd patterns fig s4 the obvious diffraction peaks of the max phase were observed at about 9 and 39 belonging to the 002 and 104 crystal planes of ti3alc2 jcpdf 52 0875 after the selective etching process the 002 diffraction peak was shifted to a small angle indicating the increase in the interlayer spacing the sharp decline of the peak at 39 indicated that the al layer in ti3alc2 was removed 49 a large number of end groups such as o oh f further expanded the layer spacing owing to the reaction with the acid etching solution the colloidal solution of fewer layer ti3c2tx nanosheets was obtained through ultrasonication for further delamination of the multilayer mxene fig s2c as can be observed fig s2c the size of ti3c2tx nanosheets was about 500 600 nm besides the thickness of the ti3c2tx nanosheets was about 1 5 nm according to the afm result fig s5 confirming the successful preparation of a single layer or few layers of mxene the chemical composition and structure of ti3c2tx nanosheets were discerned by analyzing the xps spectra fig 2a c and e as shown in fig 2a the ti 2p region of the as prepared ti3c2tx nanosheets was fit by four doublets which represent tic at 455 1 and 461 0 ev c ti oh at 455 8 and 461 7 ev c ti o at 457 0 and 462 7 ev and tio2 at 459 0 and 463 8 ev 51 52 the data show that the obtained ti3c2tx nanosheets have 11 6 tio2 indicating slight oxidation of ti3c2tx the strong intensity of the cti peaks at 282 1 ev confirms also the presence of tic bonds in the ti3c2tx as can be seen in fig 2e 3 2 preparation and characterization of the mxene ti membrane the ti3c2tx nanosheets were supported on the titanium membrane by using the electrophoretic deposition method the initial titanium membrane exhibited a porous structure and smooth surface as shown in fig 3a b after being treated with the colloidal solution of the ti3c2tx nanosheets via electrophoretic deposition the layered nanosheets were observed on the surface of membrane pores indicating successful loading of the ti3c2tx nanosheets the loading amount of mxene of epd15 mxene ti was about 0 21 wt the crystalline structures of the pristine ti membrane and mxene ti membrane electrodes were also investigated via the xrd spectra fig 4 two weak peaks at about 9 and 17 were discerned which can be attributed attributing to the 002 and 004 plane of ti3c2tx nanosheets respectively confirming the successful formation of the mxene ti membrane the chemical states and surface groups of the epd mxene ti membrane were also investigated by the acquired xps spectra as displayed in fig 2b the surface composition of the obtained epd15 mxene ti membrane contained 31 1 tio2 which was much higher than that of the pristine ti3c2tx nanosheets demonstrating an obvious increase in the tio2 content fig 2c d show the o 1 s spectra of the pristine ti3c2tx nanosheets and epd15 mxene ti membrane respectively the tio2 component sharply increased after loading on the ti membrane as a result of the oxidation moreover the weak intensity of the tic bond in the c 1 s region demonstrated the obvious oxidation of the ti3c2tx flakes on the surface of the epd15 mxene ti membrane fig 2f 53 3 3 electrochemical measurements of the mxene ti membrane a three electrode system was employed for carrying out the electrochemical measurements of the mxene ti membrane electrode the mxene ti membrane and platinum sheet were employed as the working and counter electrodes respectively a mixture of 1 mm k3 fe cn 6 and 500 mm kcl was also used as the electrolyte solution according to the measured cv curves depicted in fig 5a a pair of fe3 fe2 redox peaks can be found in the range of 0 1 0 3 v with the mxene ti membrane electrode compared with the pristine titanium membrane the oxidation peak current over the mxene ti membrane dramatically increased indicating the existence of higher oxidation activity and rapid kinetics of the electron transfer of the ti membrane after the functionalization with the ti3c2tx nanosheets the peak currents values for the epd5 mxene ti epd10 mxene ti epd15 mxene ti and epd20 mxene ti membrane electrodes achieved 1 19 ma cm 2 1 64 ma cm 2 1 88 ma cm 2 and 1 85 ma cm 2 respectively the active surface areas of the membrane electrode were calculated through the slope of ipa versus v 1 2 plot according to the randles sevcik equation 37 1 i p 2 69 10 5 n 3 2 a d 1 2 Ï 1 2 c where n refers to the electron transfer number a denotes the electrode surface area d is the diffusion coefficient of the electroactive molecules on the electrode surface c represents the indicator molecule concentration and Î½ stands for the scan rate for the k3 fe cn 6 system the values of n and d were 1 and 7 6 10 6 cm2 s 1 respectively according to eq 1 the electrochemically active areas per unit area cm2 of the mxene ti membranes were 0 53 cm2 0 55 cm2 0 69 cm2 and 0 67 cm2 for the mxene ti membrane electrodes with 5 min 10 min 15 min and 20 min deposition time respectively the epd15 mxene ti membrane electrode revealed the highest oxidation current and electrochemically active area suggesting the fastest kinetics of the electron transfer and the best electrocatalytic oxidation activity eis measurements were also performed to systematically investigate the electron transfer kinetics and interface impedances of the membranes figs 5c and s6 present the impedance nyquist plots of the mxene ti membrane and pristine titanium membrane electrodes in alkaline media 0 1 m naoh respectively the semicircles could be attributed to charge transfer resistance rct in the high frequency region the existence of a semicircle with a small diameter indicates a small value of rct obviously the rct value 21 Ï dramatically decreased compared to that of the pristine titanium membrane 180 Ï after the loading of ti3c2tx nanosheets confirming the successful loading of the ti3c2tx nanosheets and the enhancement of electrochemical kinetics of the ti membrane electrode in the low frequency region the mxene ti membrane electrode exhibited a more ideal straight line implying a more efficient diffusion of the electrolyte and charge especially for the mxene ti membrane obtained with 15 min and 20 min deposition time these results may be because the loading of mxene can greatly enhance the electrical conductivity of the membrane electrode facilitate the diffusion of charge or ions and thus improve the charge transfer properties 3 4 degradation of tch in wastewater the as prepared mxene ti membrane electrodes were used as anode in the ecmr to examine the degradation performance of antibiotic wastewater the concentration of tch wastewater was 50 mg l 1 and the degradation results are displayed in fig 6 the removal rate of tch with the epd5 mxene ti epd10 mxene ti epd15 mxene ti epd20 mxene ti membrane electrodes reached 90 9 97 4 98 7 and 98 6 respectively more importantly the removal rate of toc with the epd5 mxene ti epd10 mxene ti epd15 mxene ti and epd20 mxene ti membrane electrodes achieved 70 2 82 4 87 1 and 86 7 removal of toc respectively by contrast the removal rates of tch and toc with the pristine ti membrane were 58 1 and 21 1 respectively clearly the higher removal rates of tch and toc indicate the superior degradation and mineralization of the tch via the eaop with the electrocatalytic mxene ti membrane electrode moreover a flow through configuration in the ecmr could overcome the limitation of mass transfer with the traditional plate electrodes thereby remarkably improving the catalytic performance of the eaop process the epd15 mxene ti membrane electrode as anode exhibited the best degradation performance in the ecmr which can be ascribed to the high electrochemically active area elevated electrocatalytic oxidation activity and superior kinetics of electron transfer to improve the degradation performance the influence of various parameters of ecmr with epd15 mxene ti anode was further investigated including ph and initial concentration of tch in the feed solution current density residence time fig 7 as can be ascertained from fig 7a the ph of the feed solution had a significant impact on the removal rate of tch and toc when the ph increased from 3 0 to 7 0 the removal rate of toc increased from 70 9 to 90 4 one possible interpretation for this effect is that at a ph value of 7 0 enhanced production of hydroxyl radical than with ph of 3 0 and 5 0 takes place when the ph value was 9 0 the removal of toc decreased to 76 mainly due to the inhibition of the hydroxyl radical production 55 therefore the optimal ph for tetracycline hydrochloride removal in ecmr was 7 0 as shown in fig 7b the removal rate of toc revealed an increasing trend when the current density raised from 0 4 ma cm 2 to 0 8 ma cm 2 if the current density raise was higher than 0 8 ma cm 2 the removal rate of tch and toc decreased owing to the competition reaction of oer when the current density was 0 8 ma cm 2 the removal of tch reached the optimal values namely 99 7 removal rate of tch and 90 4 removal rate of toc the increase in the residence time can further extend the reaction time between the reactant molecules in the feed solution and the active sites on the membrane surface and thus improve the degradation performance as can be observed in fig 7c when the residence time was raised from 6 0 min to 10 0 min the removal rate of tch increased from 90 2 to 99 2 however when the residence time was 12 0 min the removal rate of toc lowered to 83 8 the flow rate of the permeate solution can be also controlled by the resident time which would have a significant influence on the contact time and turbulence 55 the oh radicals generated from the electrode surface can oxidize the organic pollutants which can be generated with available contact time and turbulence that promote the organic molecules reaching the electrode surface to be oxidized by the radicals therefore when the resident time increased from 6 min to 10 min the removal rate of tch and toc also increased however if the residence time was further increased from 10 min to 12 min the removal rate of tch and toc decreased due to the slow desorption of the intermediate species and the limited mass diffusion of the reactant resulting from longer contact time and less turbulence as displayed in fig 7d when the tch concentration increased from 50 mg l 1 to 250 mg l 1 the removal rate of toc decreased from 90 4 to 78 5 mainly due to the limitation of the active sites on the surface of mxene ti membrane in order to evaluate the stability of the mxene ti membrane electrode in the ecmr cycle tests were carried out with epd15 mxene ti membrane for the degradation of tch under the following reaction conditions temperature value of 20 c current density of 0 8 ma cm 2 residence time of 10 min an electrolyte na2so4 concentration of 15 g l 1 ph value of 7 0 tch concentration of 50 mg l 1 and each reaction time of 4 h after carrying 15 times cycle tests the removal rates of tch and toc were 96 9 and 85 4 respectively much close to the initial results suggesting excellent long term stability of mxene ti membrane anode in the ecmr fig 8a b 3 5 degradation pathway of tch to further investigate the reaction mechanism and degradation pathway of tch the intermediate products were discerned through the uplc qtof ms analysis fig s7 the major compounds were found at a mass to charge ratio m z of 430 415 274 and 226 respectively according to the literature work 56 a possible degradation pathway of tch was proposed in the ecmr as shown in fig 9 tc can be broken into small molecules by the process of dealkylation ring opening and other ways finally the intermediates are further mineralized to co2 and h2o based on these results it can be concluded that the construction of mxene ti membrane electrodes with ti3c2tx nanosheets is an efficient strategy to remarkably improve the degradation performance and mineralization degree of antibiotic wastewater via the eaop in the ecmr obviously compared with the other reported previous methods such as the conventional electrooxidation process photo fenton and photo electrocatalysis process the proposed electrocatalytic process via ecmr exhibits much better degradation performance as presented in table 1 the exceptional degradation performance of the mxene ti membrane electrode could be attributed to the formation of 2d nanocomposites with ti3c2 and tio2 as was confirmed by the xps spectra 57 actually tio2 is also an active electrocatalyst to degrade antibiotic wastewater which can be confirmed by the degradation performance of the pristine ti membrane electrode with a partial cover of tio2 resulting from the annealing preparation of the ti membrane meanwhile ti3c2tx nanosheets with strong metallic properties can serve as a co catalyst which could change the band structure and electronic structure of tio2 and thereby significantly enhance the electrocatalytic oxidation activity of the membrane electrode 57 in addition the incorporation of the ti3c2tx nanosheets on the surface of the membrane pores can improve the conductivity and accelerate the production of hydroxyl radicals which facilitate the mineralization of antibiotics to co2 and h2o 35 36 4 conclusions in summary the novel mxene ti electrocatalytic membrane electrode was developed which was through the electrophoretic deposition method with the flat porous ti microfiltration membrane as substrate and 2d ti3c2tx nanosheets as catalytic active sites this membrane can be employed as an anode in the ecmr for the effective treatment of tch antibiotic wastewater under the optimal reaction conditions of 0 8 ma cm 2 current density 10 min residence time 15 g l 1 electrolyte na2so4 concentration 50 mg l 1 concentration of tch wastewater and ph 7 0 the ecmr fabricated with mxene ti membrane anode demonstrated outstanding degradation performance and enhanced mineralization for tch i e 99 7 removal rate of tch and 90 4 removal rate of toc moreover it also exhibited good long term stability the superior degradation performance and well stability of the mxene ti membrane electrode can be ascribed to the formation of 2d nanocomposites with ti3c2 and tio2 furthermore the loading of the ti3c2tx nanosheets can improve the conductivity and accelerate the production of hydroxyl radicals which facilitates the mineralization of antibiotics to co2 and h2o our present work paves the way for the development and application of electrocatalytic membrane and ecmr with mxene based electrocatalysts for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
