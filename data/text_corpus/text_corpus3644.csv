18220,the aim of this study was to investigate the use of biogas production rate kinetics for the monitoring of anaerobic co digestion recent extensive studies of degradation pathways showed that acetoclastic methanogenesis is not always the main pathway hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation can also dominate mostly for operating conditions with high concentrations of ammonia or volatile fatty acids these conditions are also known to cause instability in the digester s operation especially in co digestion due to substrate variability therefore co digestion experiments were conducted with several co substrates using a continuously stirred 35 l tank reactor degradation pathways and their potential shifts were identified by monitoring variations in biogas production rate kinetics using a principal component analysis model the shifts in the degradation pathways were used to monitor the process these shift points were found to provide early warnings of

microbial degradation of complex organic matter producing a biogas mainly composed of methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 and a digestate it is a multi stage bioprocess that requires the interaction of at least four trophic groups of microorganisms associated with steps such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the last step methanogenesis is the most critical part of anaerobic degradation with respect to inhibition and variations in the process conditions ph temperature alkalinity hydraulic retention time hrt substrate etc rajagopal et al 2013 methanogens strict anaerobes classified as archaea allow the production of methane from acetate or hydrogen h2 and carbon dioxide according to two main metabolic pathways hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis the efficient conversion of organic matter into methane in ad depends on the mutual and syntrophic interactions of functionally distinct microorganisms akuzawa et al 2011 for a stable operation the process must be well balanced for a successful use of the intermediate by products by the bacterial consortia of each stage however failures do occur in anaerobic digesters and are mainly due to these variations in the process conditions and the accumulation of inhibitors volatile fatty acids vfa ammonia the microbiological mechanisms underlying these inhibitions have been the subject of numerous studies ch4 can be produced by acetotrophic methanogens am and hydrogenotrophic methanogens hm as illustrated in fig 1 ch4 formation from h2 co2 produced by the previous steps is promoted by the activity of hm whereas ch4 formation from acetate can be achieved through two different mechanisms i direct cleavage of acetate by am or ii syntrophic acetate oxidation sao to h2 co2 by syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob followed by the subsequent conversion of these products into methane by hm de vrieze et al 2012 it was generally accepted that the acetoclastic pathway is responsible for 60 70 of methane production in a digester however well established molecular methods indicated that the microbial population structure in a digester depends on environmental conditions and on the characteristics of the substrate as well as on the temperature in the digester karakashev et al 2006 nettmann et al 2010 franke whittle et al 2014 accurate dynamic quantification of the prevailing microbial activity showed that at high vfa and ammonia concentrations the main acetate degradation mechanism was sao gehring et al 2015 goux et al 2015 frank et al 2016 mosbæk et al 2016 westerholm et al 2016 these results were obtained using different substrates and digestion conditions a reactor fed with sugar beet pulp with vfa accumulation up to 10 589 mg l goux et al 2015 or a reactor spiked with acetate at 5900 mg l mosbæk et al 2016 frank et al 2016 also reported a reactor fed with slaughterhouse and municipal waste containing 1300 mg l of vfa and 360 mg l of nh3 a review of conditions favoring the sao mechanism reported several and different ranges of nh3 nh4 and vfa depending on the experimental conditions used in the study westerholm et al 2016 these conditions caused a shift from the acetoclastic degradation pathway to sao followed by hydrogenotrophic pathway sao hm the shift from am to sao hm in ammonia induced digestion was even found to maintain stability and compensate for biogas production in digesters werner et al 2014 it was shown that from 60 to 75 of methane was produced via the sao hm pathway during mesophilic digestion of samples with high ammonia content 244 1214 mgn nh3 l jiang et al 2018 up to 89 of methane was derived from co2 and h2 reduction in a thermophilic reactor containing high levels of acetate 3840 5900 mg l hao et al 2011 indeed high abundance of saob in different digesters despite differences in their operating parameters and conditions demonstrated that they are an enduring and important component of biogas producing consortia sun et al 2014 a particular case is lipid rich substrate digestion which leads to degradation of long chain fatty acids lcfa ma et al 2015 although sao was not found to contribute to acetate degradation in a reactor fed with fats oils and grease 70 vs kurade et al 2019 a shift from am to hm activity was reported in lipid enriched reactors 1 5 2 g of oleate added in the feed due to the prevalence of hm along with hydrogen consuming bacteria in these thermophilic baserba et al 2012 amha et al 2017 and mesophilic regueiro et al 2016 reactors different threshold tolerances to ammonia vfa or lcfa found in the literature during the pathway shift were highly dependent on the substrate and on digester operation several studies highlighted a temporary adaptation of the prevailing microbial community to ammonia westerholm et al 2016 vfa li y et al 2018 and lcfa amha et al 2017 am are reported to be more severely affected by these conditions than hm which have a similar or in some cases higher tolerance to high ammonia levels than saob wang et al 2015 in all cases a decrease of am microbial activity always affects ad process all these results show that three pathways am hm and sao hm pathways could occur in a digester to produce methane however even if they probably co exist in digesters only one is responsible for most of the methane production depending on the process conditions when these digestion conditions change a shift between pathways could occur and could cause instabilities and eventually failures of the digester anaerobic co digestion acod which entails the simultaneous digestion of two or more feedstocks is widespread in several countries allows biogas production enhancement and maximizes waste valorization in acod cases the characteristics of co substrates type quality and quantity generally vary over time therefore the variations in the feedstocks induce variations in the process conditions which favor pathway shifts in the digester monitoring the microbial populations along with their activity and or growth could be used to monitor acod processes and provide an early warning of imbalances poirier et al 2016 a recent study showed that conventional or innovative early warning indicators varied among different types of ad systems with different operating conditions and mainly focused on biogas and its associated parameters and digestate compositions inside digesters wu d et al 2019 these indicators are ph vfa total and individuals vfa alkalinity partial total and bicarbonate biogas composition methane yield the concentration of specific intermediate metabolites ammonia glycerol aromatic compounds h2 carbon monoxide etc the composition of the microbial community and enzyme activity lebuhn et al 2015 li et al 2017 poirier et al 2016 there are also coupled indicators such as ratios between intermediate and partial alkalinities vfa and alkalinity vfa alk or vfa and total inorganic carbon that performed better than individual indicators lebuhn et al 2015 a recent review exploring the effectiveness of these indicators as well as an extensive study of their threshold values showed that no unique indicator and threshold value were applicable to all biogas plants li l et al 2018 moreover the proposed indicators were only effective for specific substrates and specific operating conditions because of their sensitivity to the process conditions and substrate compositions li et al 2017 wu et al 2019b in addition the specificities of the determination of some parameters also made it difficult to use them at full scale plants therefore several studies focused on developing online sensors for vfa ammonia and hydrogen determination mainly using spectroscopy chromatography or automatic titration for vfa alk nguyen et al 2015 however experience in using these sensors in full scale plants is limited robustness simplicity accuracy and reliability are some of the key parameters that any operator will look for when choosing one of these sensors and or indicators for process monitoring as none of these indicators was universally valid for all ad systems more work is needed to design an indicator and monitoring tool that meet ad plant operators requirements a shift in metabolic pathway appears to be a relevant indicator of the state of the process determination of the pathway shift could be used as a monitoring strategy of the process however the existing methods for the determination of metabolic pathways carbon isotope analysis molecular methods etc and subsequent pathway shifts are complex and time consuming in this context the aim of this study was to develop a monitoring tool to diagnose imbalances in methanogens activity as early as possible in order to avoid failures of the digester as biogas and methane production are directly impacted by changes in methanogens their dynamics could reflect methanogens activity the tool developed in the present study is therefore based on biogas production rate bpr and associated kinetics a principal component analysis pca model was built based on bpr kinetics obtained during normal operating conditions of the digester this model was evaluated during the unstable periods of the experiments to determine its ability to rapidly identify the shift between degradation pathways and hence to provide early warnings 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale digester the pilot scale digester was a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr with a working volume of 35 l and was maintained under mesophilic conditions 38 c the reactor was mounted on a scale for the monitoring of its weight therefore enabling control and recording of the doses of feed the feed substrate prepared every week was kept in a refrigerator 4 c containing a hopper placed above the reactor to allow gravity feeding before each feed the mixed substrate was recirculated from the bottom to the top inside the hopper with a pump watson marlow 701 type fb r for the purpose of homogenization a thermo regulator huber pilotone was used to recirculate hot water in the double wall of the reactor to maintain the temperature at 38 c the pneumatic system of the reactor was managed by an agilent 34970a acquisition control unit with a specially designed program with labview 2014 the reactor gas flow meter used to determine biogas quantity was also connected to the acquisition program the exhaust biogas pipe was fitted with a sampling point for biogas quality determination 2 2 operating conditions and substrate co digestion experiments were conducted on the pilot with pig slurry ps as base substrate to ensure liquid digestion conditions and to provide nutrients co substrates such as horse feed residues hf fruit waste fw food fats f and protein waste pw were added in different proportions with ps with an organic load rate olr varying between 0 9 and 2 5 kgvs m 3 d 1 and an hrt varying between 20 and 27 days table 1 commercial horse feed apples butter and casein were used to simulate hf fw f and pw respectively these substrates were all mixed together along with ps depending on the experiment concerned table 1 in all experiments the reactor was fed once a day in the morning two experiments a1 and a2 were first performed under normal conditions at two different olr 0 9 and 1 7 kgvs m 3 d 1 and no inhibition was observed in either experiment experiment a3 immediately followed with the addition of fats in the feed mixture this co substrate increased the olr from 1 7 to 2 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 and led to the failure of the digester feeding was stopped for several days and the digester was partially emptied to recover from the disturbance experiment b1 was performed later with a similar olr 1 1 kgvs m 3 d 1 as in experiment a1 in experiment b2 pw was next added as co substrate which also increased the olr up to 2 5 kgvs m 3 d 1 and led to another failure prior to these two series of experiments the digester was inoculated with digestate coming from a well established lab scale digester treating ps hf hrt 27 days olr 1 01 kgvs m 3 d 1 at a ph of 7 43 0 1 and a ts of 19 2 2 2 g l and a vs of 11 1 1 2 g l table s1 supplementary material lists the characteristics of the mixture of substrates used in this study as expected ts increased from 2 7 in experiment a1 containing only ps hf to 3 6 4 1 in experiments a2 and b1 when fw was added ts also increased to 5 4 and 6 5 in experiments a3 and b2 respectively due to the addition of f and pw these specific co substrates f and pw also induced variations in total cod tkn and bmp of the substrate mixture total cod varied between 28 1 and 102 8 go2 kg 1 between 2000 and 7500 mgn l 1 for tkn and between 348 4 and 468 4 nlch4 kgvs 1 for bmp 2 3

ph were determined using standard methods apha 2012 volatile fatty acids vfahplc and lcfa contents were analyzed respectively by high performance liquid chromatography hplc varian u3000 and gas chromatography mass selective gc ms agilent technologies 7890 b 5977 a for lcfa an extraction with hexane isopropanol 3 2 solvent was first performed with an accelerated solvent extractor dionex ase 350 followed by a concentration step the main indicator used on biogas plants vfatit alkalinity ratio vfa alk was determined by titrimetry titralab at1000 hach lange on digestate samples biochemical methane potential bmp tests were performed on each feed mixture according to vedrenne et al 2008 each sample was tested in triplicate with an inoculum to substrate ratio of 1 gvs gvs 1 and was incubated at 38 c for 40 days biogas quality ch4 co2 was monitored daily and determined with gas chromatography equipped with flame ionization detector gc fid agilent technologies 6890 n usa in all experiments 2 3 2 sampling the feed mixture used in each experiment was monitored once a week bmp tests were performed on substrate mixture of each experiment digestates were taken daily prior to each feeding first in experiments a1 and a2 digestates were monitored once a week in experiments a3 b1 and b2 parameters such as ph nh4 vfahplc vfa alk and lcfa were monitored daily while other parameters were monitored weekly 2 4 biogas production rate biogas production was measured using a wet tipping gas meter massé et al 2010 the operating of these gas meters is based on the tipping bucket principle in which liquid is displaced by gas in a specially designed chamber walker et al 2009 in this study an inverted container placed in water was used and was continuously filled by the biogas produced when the inverted container was completely full corresponding to 36 4 ml of biogas the container tipped and the biogas escaped and water filled the container again this gas meter allowed the measurement of each tipping of the container bpr was calculated by dividing the volume of biogas 36 4 ml by the time elapsed since the previous tipping considering that the volume and the temperature of the headspace of the digester remained constant each bpr obtained is termed instantaneous bpr and all bprs obtained between two feedings corresponding to a day in our case represented the evolution of the instantaneous bpr and is termed daily bpr kinetics these daily bpr kinetics were always linearly interpolated with a time step of 0 001 day to have the same number of points 1001 for each day 2 5 pca model as a multivariate method pca makes it possible to reduce the size and to extract pertinent information from experimental datasets x by preserving the maximum variance of the original space according to equation 1 below 1 x tpt e where t is the matrix of the scores pt is the transpose of the loadings matrix which explains the relationship between the variables and principal components pcs and e is the residual matrix pca can reveal the underlying phenomena of a system through the scores matrix or multivariate parameters hotelling s distance in general process monitoring with pca is implemented in two steps calibration a model is built with a training set acquired under normal conditions bpr kinetics collected in experiments a1 and a2 maintained at a cautious olr for a steady state reactor were used to define the in control process baseline through a pca model using the r2013b statistics toolbox of matlab a smoothing algorithm savitzky and golay 1964 was performed on the data as well as mean centering to comply with the needs of the pca method standard normal variate snv barnes et al 1989 a function used to remove scatter and scale data was also performed to create a linear metric the pca model through its pcs highlights a metric or indicator for the normal operation of the digester pc score plots were built with their corresponding loadings prediction new data scaled using the mean of the training set are projected onto the pca model to evaluate whether they behave like the training set the built pca model and its parameters were then applied as such to all kinetics data acquired in experiments a3 b1 and b2 3 results and discussion 3 1 digestate characteristics the characteristics of digestate samples collected from each experiment are listed in table 2 ts were similar in each series of experiments 1 5 2 1 despite variations in the ts of the substrate mixture 2 7 6 5 this indicates the high biodegradability of the co substrates added to ps there was no significant accumulation of matter in the digester tkn and nh4 showed similar variations a significant increase in tkn and nh4 was observed during experiment b2 due to the addition of pw in the feed tkn accumulation in the digester was related to the initial tkn in the feed mixture 7500 500 mg l while nh4 accumulation originated from degradation of organic nitrogen proteins in the digester variations in total cod depended on the substrate used there were significant variations in experiments with high olr a3 b2 however it remained difficult to differentiate variations due to the feed substrate from actual cod accumulation in the digester finally variations in ts vs tkn and cod were not very useful in identifying failures along with nh4 ph vfahplc lcfa vfa alk biogas and methane production provided interesting dynamics related to the digester s stability consequently digester operations are discussed based on these parameters 3 2 digester operations in experiments a1 to a3 experiments a1 a2 and a3 were carried out continuously for 140 days a1 and a2 were performed cautiously to avoid failures of the digester by using ps hf in experiment a1 and adding fw in experiment a2 the digester showed good degradation performances in both experiments fig 2 with biogas production maintained at a good flow rate of 1 3 0 5 and 4 3 0 3 nl gvs day in a1 and a2 respectively depending on the substrates indeed biogas production was on average 76 and 88 of the bmp value of the substrate mixture in a1 and a2 respectively ch4 was on average 50 1 7 5 of biogas production in a1 and was correlated with biogas production fig s1a in a2 ch4 quickly stabilized and was on average 60 2 1 3 of biogas no warning was detected by state indicators such as ph and vfa alk fig 3 in both experiments and no vfa and lcfa accumulated in the digester fig 2 nh4 varied between 1400 and 1 900mgn nh4 l in both experiments nh3 concentrations calculated considering ph 7 5 on average for a1 a2 and temperature 38 c according to hansen et al 1998 were 82 and 55 mgn nh3 l at steady state in a1 and a2 respectively during experiment a3 the digester was exposed to food fats added to the previous feed mixture used in a2 with an increase in olr from 1 7 to 2 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 the digester appeared to work correctly at this new olr of 2 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 until day 122 fig s1 then biogas production dropped starting from day 123 in parallel lcfa started accumulating at day 113 followed by vfa accumulation from day 120 fig 2 mainly with the accumulation of acetate and propionate fig s2a vfa alk and ph reacted weakly to the inhibition and later than the drop in biogas production fig 3 indeed from day 126 vfa alk increased from 0 27 to 0 43 while ph decreased from 7 3 to 7 1 according to recent studies digesters are in critical state when vfa alk ratio exceeds 0 5 lossie and pütz 2008 or 0 45 lebuhn et al 2015 similarly the optimal ph range for a digester is between 6 5 and 8 5 li et al 2017 ph dropped below 6 5 at day 132 and vfa alk exceeded 0 45 at day 127 during the first 20 days of experiment a3 biogas production was at 5 2 nl gvs day for 62 9 2 3 of methane corresponding to 89 of the bmp of the feed mixture after a slight increase in the daily biogas production between days 120 123 a huge drop was observed at the end of the experiment the digester was totally inhibited by lcfa accumulation up to 1 868 mg l and vfa accumulation up to 7 880 mg l along with a drop in ph lcfa accumulation was a better state indicator than vfa as it occurred earlier in the process while vfa accumulation can be detected on site using a titrimetric method only laboratory analytical tools could detect lcfa accumulation additionally daily biogas production increased slightly from day 120 at the beginning of the inhibition which made the inhibition difficult to detect this increase in biogas production is discussed below based on bpr kinetics consequently additional on site parameters are required for a better diagnosis among potential on site parameters monitored in this study were bpr kinetics acquired in all the experiments 3 3 bpr kinetics in experiments a1 to a3 fig 4 shows bpr kinetics acquired at different days in experiments a1 a2 and a3 and the corresponding states of the process from these data a pattern fig 5 was constructed from bpr kinetics data acquired during experiments a1 and a2 illustrated by days 50 and 80 fig 4a and b three steps can be distinguished in these curves step 1 a rapid decreasing phase of biogas production step 2 constant high biogas production and step 3 constant low biogas production there is a transition stage between the last two steps the first step occurred directly after feeding and probably corresponded to the rapid hydrolysis of soluble components and easily hydrolysable compounds producing mainly co2 and h2 followed by ch4 formation by hm the second step was assumed to correspond to biogas production from acetate initially present in the feed substrate and continuously produced by hydrolysis and acidogenesis moreover during this step bpr kinetics were not limited by acetate which was present in sufficient quantity in the reactor but rather by methanogens activity the transition stage indicated that acetate production became slower than acetate consumption until reaching a low acetate concentration in the reactor this transition occurred respectively at 0 15 and 0 4 days in experiments a1 day 50 and a2 day80 fig 4a and b which is correlated with the olr of these experiments after this transition step acetate concentration was close to 0 and bpr kinetic was limited by acetate production coming from slowly biodegradable compounds while all bpr kinetic profiles appeared to be similar in experiments a1 and a2 and at the beginning of experiment a3 changes in the bpr kinetics were noted later in experiment a3 for the 20 first days of experiment a3 the transition stage occurred around 0 5 days due to the increase in olr fig 4c day 110 at day 120 bpr kinetics clearly showed an extension of step 2 with a transition occurring at 0 6 days fig 4d moreover a decrease in bpr reached during the second step was observed from day 120 finally at acidosis state day 130 no second step was observed and the third step was reached directly after the first one fig 4e these gradual changes in the bpr kinetics suggested increasing inhibition of methanogens activity am mainly from day 120 leading to a lower bpr and a longer second step however despite the increasing inhibition of methanogenesis from day 120 biogas production increased slightly until day 122 ch4 also increased and reached a high value 67 4 at day 122 this brief increase was probably due to compensation of the acetoclastic pathway by another degradation pathway allowing a higher daily cumulative biogas production these results suggest a pathway shift from am to another degradation pathway from day 123 daily biogas production decreased due to severe am inhibition leading to a drop in ph finally all these conditions resulted in a total inhibition of all methanogens according to these data the weakness of ad process monitoring using daily biogas production was highlighted as the daily biogas production increased during this experiment when the inhibition started probably due to the shift in pathways as shown changes in bpr kinetic profiles with the probable pathway shift appeared to signal the digester s instabilities early however a visual approach might not be easy and sufficient to determine this shift point therefore a multivariate approach such as pca was needed to first create a model on bpr kinetics acquired during normal operation and then to apply and evaluate the model on other experiments 3 4 pca model and process stability indicators pca reduces the information contained in a high number of individual process variables to a small number of composite indexes representing pcs the pca model was built with bpr kinetics from experiments a1 a2 using two pcs explaining respectively 86 1 and 8 3 of variance fig 6 shows the scores and loadings associated with the pca model concerning pc1 the shape of the loading curve is similar to the bpr kinetics with the 3 steps pc1 scores were very constant during the first experiment a1 and then increased quickly to reach another constant value from the beginning of experiment a2 concerning pc2 the loadings obtained highlighted the first step and mainly the transition between steps 2 and 3 consequently pc2 scores varied mainly at the beginning of experiment a2 when the length of the second step evolved due to changes in substrates and olr as explained above these first bpr kinetics curves were believed to describe a digester working with acetoclastic methanogenesis as the main methanogenic pathway this entire step is the calibration step of the model the monitoring of subsequent experiments is conducted using the two projected pcs scores the pca model built from experiments a1 and a2 was used to monitor bpr kinetics acquired during experiment a3 these new data were projected onto the defined pca subspace after undergoing the same preprocessing the scores were predicted from the scaling parameters of the calibration dataset projected score dynamics pc1 2 were compared to biogas production fig 7 pc1 started dropping from day 119 possibly related to the beginning of acetate accumulation in the digester fig s2a this drop also suggested an early decline in am activity followed by a gradual shift from the main acetoclastic pathway to another degradation path as shown in fig 7 the production peak due to the compensation was reached when another state was highlighted by the bpr kinetics meanwhile pc2 clearly showed the changes of the transition stage during the experiment first pc2 showed a constant increase mirroring olr and biogas production followed by a gradual drop until day 119 confirming the inhibition of am activity next the transition stage abruptly increased highlighting the importance of the compensating pathway for biogas production finally pc2 gradually dropped indicating that all methanogens activity was completely inhibited as the mechanisms behind lcfa pathway degradation are not clearly defined it remains difficult to qualify what kind of shift occurred in the digester lcfa can only be degraded by syntrophic interaction based on β oxidation with anaerobic communities sousa et al 2009 but there are contrasting opinions regarding lcfa degradation pathway although hydrogen consuming bacteria were found in abundance in lcfa stressed digestion long et al 2012 and were significantly correlated with methane production amha et al 2017 versatile methanogens methanosarcina which can perform both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic degradation were the most abundant archaea palatsi et al 2011 one study concluded that absence or relatively low abundance of saob and hm in parallel with am dominance suggested that methane formed from lcfa digestion was predominantly conducted with acetoclastic pathway led by methanosarcina kurade et al 2019 another study reported the prevalence of methanosarcina and methanococcus strictly hydrogenotrophic methanogens along with low abundance of the strict am methanosaetacea in reactors exposed to oleate fast growing of strict hm methanococcus was triggered by oleate continuous addition shifting them into the dominant archaeal population this suggests that hm was an important pathway for methane formation in these reactors baserba et al 2012 an anaerobic reactor co digesting agro industrial waste with abrupt and gradual changes in lcfa concentrations showed that these perturbations resulted in greater variations in the archaeal domain from methanosaeta dominance in steady state to hydrogenotrophic pathway during the disturbance periods regueiro et al 2016 regardless of the shift lcfa accumulation in a digester remains harmful to the process stability as the inhibition will gradually lead to a total failure of the process by keeping the olr at 2 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 with fats as co substrate the process was completely inhibited by lcfa accumulation and biogas production dropped very low using the pathway shift as an early sign of imbalance might help to prevent inhibition indeed at the shift point determined by the pc1 scores day 119 lcfa was at 522 mg l and vfa at 187 mg l in the digester these concentrations are low and biogas production has not even been affected yet a recovery at this point would be much easier for the process therefore the pca model built based on bpr kinetics seems to be a valuable tool to monitor the process and prevent lipid inhibition of a digester an evaluation of this model in other cases will assess its robustness for the process monitoring it is worth noting that several studies have already used pca to monitor the ad process pca was used on data consisting of physicochemical parameters and biogas composition to monitor reactors fed with different substrates leite et al 2018 or exposed to organic overload lemaigre et al 2016 pca was also used on near infrared derived chemical data to detect disturbances in ad process behavior reed et al 2013 these studies used control charts made with hotelling s distance and residuals which require confidence intervals and control limits to highlight the digester failures in the different systems studied however the main difference between those studies and the present study is the type of data and indicators used while the other studies collected several chemical data to build the model and perform the monitoring the present study only requires bpr kinetics this instantaneous measurement will be cheaper and less time consuming than models developed with chemical parameters 3 5 evaluation of the model using experiments b1 and b2 3 5 1 digester operations for b1 and b2 in order to evaluate the robustness of the method two additional experiments b1 and b2 were performed first the digester was fed with ps hf fw with a gradual increase of the olr 0 5 1 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 during two weeks experiment b1 days 1 13 then pw was added to the feed mixture to reach an olr of 2 5 kgvs m 3 d 1 and maintained for two additional weeks experiment b2 days 13 29 in experiment b1 biogas production increased gradually from 0 9 to 3 3 nl gvs day as shown in fig 8 ch4 remained constant and on average 63 5 3 5 of biogas production in parallel no accumulation of either lcfa or vfa was observed nh4 concentration was on average 1950 mgn nh4 l and nh3 concentration calculated considering ph and temperature was 173 mgn nh3 l on average all these results including ph which remained constant around 7 9 and vfa alk at 0 18 fig 9 a and b suggest that the digester worked fine during experiment b1 during experiment b2 biogas production first increased 4 02 nl gvs day 65 2 of ch4 at the same time as vfa started accumulating mainly acetate and propionate fig s2b day 15 this initial increase was mainly due to pw addition in the feed mixture then vfa accumulated up to 13 500 mg l day 29 while vfa alk tended to remain at 1 due to an established balance between the acidity of the medium vfa and the buffer capacity alkalinity fig 8 this buffer capacity was mainly due to ammonium ions nh4 produced by protein degradation nh4 concentrations increased from 1950 mg n nh4 l in b1 to 4090 mgn nh4 l in b2 fig 8 ph decreased slowly from 7 9 and then remained constant around 7 5 fig 9a biogas production decreased to 2 5 nl gvs day at day 19 and remained constant and significant despite vfa accumulation ch4 also decreased to 50 of biogas production the balance established in the digester hints at the pathway shift from am to sao hm this shift is also suggested by nh4 accumulation inducing the accumulation of the toxic form nh3 up to 185 mg n nh3 l at day 29 it should be noted that ammonia inhibition in ad process depends on important factors initial concentrations process temperature ph olr and acclimation of inoculum which have direct or indirect effects on inhibitory concentrations yenigün and demirel 2013 as previously discussed on site parameters ph daily biogas production and vfa alk were not sufficient for early detection of inhibition in experiment a3 indeed daily biogas production increased simultaneously with vfa accumulation moreover in this case vfa alk remained low at the beginning of the inhibition 0 26 at day 17 due to the buffer capacity of proteins and ph remained around 7 5 despite the increasing vfa concentration vfa alk only reached a critical value at day 21 fig 9b 3 5 2 pca model application to experiments b1 and b2 the built pca model was then used to monitor bpr kinetics acquired during both experiments b1 and b2 fig 10 illustrates the obtained projected scores with b1 and b2 a first warning was shown in experiment b1 by pc1 at day 9 due to an accidental olr increase 1 1 1 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 it was also highlighted by pc2 which showed an early change in the transition stage this shows that the model could detect small overloads that are not highlighted by chemical parameters the digester recovered after the feed was slightly reduced this first warning is a false alarm as it did not affect the process in this study pca model calibration was performed using experiments with low amplitude variations in olr to prevent such false alarms additional calibrations are required and should include experiments with higher amplitude variations in olr without inhibition as snv was performed after pca these deviations would have been included in the in control scheme for the monitoring in addition the combination of control charts is a methodology that effectively reduces the occurrence of false alarm in statistical process control chen 2010 in the present study as two indicators were defined these false alarms can be distinguished by requiring that both indicators simultaneously demonstrate out of control behavior to confirm a warning indeed the transition stage pc1 should be sufficiently affected to trigger a change in the global bpr kinetic form pc2 or inversely this monitoring technique still needs to be tested in different cases and conditions before being used in full scale applications a second warning appeared at day 16 corresponding to bpr kinetics obtained after two days of pw addition in the feed substrate pc1 first dropped at day 15 and slightly increased after but remained at low values pc2 also behaved in the same way as in experiment a3 by dropping first at day 16 and increasing slowly to reach a new balance the abrupt drop and the establishment of a new state by pc1 2 clearly highlighted the gradual pathway shift occurring in the digester a third decrease was observed at day 25 due to the addition of pw in the feed mixture these results confirm the important contribution of the sao hm pathway during anaerobic digestion of nitrogen rich substrates such as protein waste indeed the extent of sao and the levels of known saob hm and am were determined in sludge from 13 industrial biogas production plants the results showed that high abundance of saob was positively correlated with relatively low abundance of am and high concentrations of ammonia and vfa sun et al 2014 the shift might be a consequence of the inhibitive effect of ammonia and vfa on am activity as hm and saob have been reported to adapt to high concentrations of nh3 hansen et al 1998 westerholm et al 2016 li y et al 2018 nevertheless this adaptation does not always allow a complete recovery of the original methane yield of anaerobic digesters rajagopal et al 2013 as the pathway shift occurred and biogas production dropped by 30 the digester was no longer working in optimal conditions the pathway shift from am to sao hm was determined based on the second warning at 1800 mg l of nh4 and 159 mg l of nh3 combined analysis of the microbial community and biogas production in mesophilic processes have shown that imbalances in digesters at ammonia levels exceeding 150 mgn nh3 l can be due to an ammonia induced shift from the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway to the sao hm pathway westerholm et al 2011 2016 this is in agreement with the results obtained in the present study complete inhibition due to ammonia was reported at 3000 mg l of nh4 at any ph rajagopal et al 2013 and around 200 400 mg l for nh3 westerholm et al 2016 in mesophilic operations therefore the low concentrations of ammonium and ammonia at the shift point demonstrate the quality of the model and its ability to indicate early signs of imbalances in the digester it represents a relevant indicator in the process state and will help to quickly adjust the feed and maintain good degradation conditions in the digester 3 6 improvement of recovery strategies of the digester recovery strategies in the ad process differ depending on the inhibition that occurs in the digester several general recovery actions are possible such as observing a feed stop period using feeding patterns or dilution with new inoculums specific recovery actions also consist in adding materials such as trace elements for vfa inhibition zhang et al 2018 or adsorbents such as bentonite for lcfa inhibition palatsi et al 2009 and glauconite or phosphorite for nh3 inhibition nielsen and angelidaki 2008 in biogas plants the most widely used recovery strategy is to observe a feed stop period however this method is not always economically feasible as vfa inhibition requires a long feed stop period zhang et al 2018 moreover feed stop was shown to be the least effective recovery strategy in the case of lcfa inhibition palatsi et al 2009 regardless of the strategy chosen the recovery of a digester depends on the efficiency of the early warning indicator used also the more advanced the inhibition stage is in the digester the less efficient and economically feasible the recovery of the digester will be zhang et al 2018 therefore with early warnings the concentrations of inhibitors will be low so feed stop periods will be short and more effective in experiments a3 and b2 the stability indicators which could have been used in biogas plants daily biogas production ph and vfa alk indicated different days of warning in experiment a3 the earliest significant instability indicator was vfa alk at day 127 when vfa was at 3185 mg l and lcfa at 1245 mg l in experiment b2 vfa alk reached a critical value at day 21 with vfa at 4722 mg l based on our methodology considering pcs 1 2 warnings were identified at day 119 and day 16 respectively in experiments a3 and b2 vfa was at 522 mg l at day 119 and 274 mg l at day 16 considering existing strategies recovering a digester at 500 mg l of vfa or less would be easier than recovering a digester at 3000 4000 mg l for example in these cases a feed stop period of 1 or 2 days should be sufficient whereas a longer period would be necessary with traditional stability indicators indeed methanogens activity would be less affected by low vfa concentrations and would allow their rapid consumption and biogas production would not suffer at these low concentrations 4 conclusion methanogenic pathway shifts occurred in digesters at high concentrations of lcfa vfa and ammonia this study was conducted in order to detect these shifts as an early sign of instability in acod processes a pca model was built based on the bpr kinetics of a digester operating under normal conditions and the acetoclastic methanogenesis was therefore the dominant pathway the model pcs scores were used to evaluate its accuracy in predicting instabilities in two inhibition induced experiments changes in the dominant pathway either from am to hm or from am to sao hm occurred as expected early warnings were given in each experiment at very low concentrations of lcfa vfa and ammonium ammonia these low concentrations could be easily recovered by the digester this monitoring strategy is therefore appropriate for ad process monitoring especially in the context of co digestion and will enhance its stability and biogas production the results presented in this study were obtained with a digester fed once a day in controlled conditions further studies are required to evaluate the impact of different feeding frequencies additionally these results were obtained using a lab scale pilot which allowed a precise monitoring of the bpr with no disturbance caused by changes in the headspace volume or temperature changes in conclusion despite these promising results further studies are required to make this monitoring strategy applicable on full scale digesters funding source l awhangbo is the beneficiary of a phd scholarship funded by irstea and the bretagne region this project was also funded by the

18220,the aim of this study was to investigate the use of biogas production rate kinetics for the monitoring of anaerobic co digestion recent extensive studies of degradation pathways showed that acetoclastic methanogenesis is not always the main pathway hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation can also dominate mostly for operating conditions with high concentrations of ammonia or volatile fatty acids these conditions are also known to cause instability in the digester s operation especially in co digestion due to substrate variability therefore co digestion experiments were conducted with several co substrates using a continuously stirred 35 l tank reactor degradation pathways and their potential shifts were identified by monitoring variations in biogas production rate kinetics using a principal component analysis model the shifts in the degradation pathways were used to monitor the process these shift points were found to provide early warnings of

microbial degradation of complex organic matter producing a biogas mainly composed of methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 and a digestate it is a multi stage bioprocess that requires the interaction of at least four trophic groups of microorganisms associated with steps such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the last step methanogenesis is the most critical part of anaerobic degradation with respect to inhibition and variations in the process conditions ph temperature alkalinity hydraulic retention time hrt substrate etc rajagopal et al 2013 methanogens strict anaerobes classified as archaea allow the production of methane from acetate or hydrogen h2 and carbon dioxide according to two main metabolic pathways hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis the efficient conversion of organic matter into methane in ad depends on the mutual and syntrophic interactions of functionally distinct microorganisms akuzawa et al 2011 for a stable operation the process must be well balanced for a successful use of the intermediate by products by the bacterial consortia of each stage however failures do occur in anaerobic digesters and are mainly due to these variations in the process conditions and the accumulation of inhibitors volatile fatty acids vfa ammonia the microbiological mechanisms underlying these inhibitions have been the subject of numerous studies ch4 can be produced by acetotrophic methanogens am and hydrogenotrophic methanogens hm as illustrated in fig 1 ch4 formation from h2 co2 produced by the previous steps is promoted by the activity of hm whereas ch4 formation from acetate can be achieved through two different mechanisms i direct cleavage of acetate by am or ii syntrophic acetate oxidation sao to h2 co2 by syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob followed by the subsequent conversion of these products into methane by hm de vrieze et al 2012 it was generally accepted that the acetoclastic pathway is responsible for 60 70 of methane production in a digester however well established molecular methods indicated that the microbial population structure in a digester depends on environmental conditions and on the characteristics of the substrate as well as on the temperature in the digester karakashev et al 2006 nettmann et al 2010 franke whittle et al 2014 accurate dynamic quantification of the prevailing microbial activity showed that at high vfa and ammonia concentrations the main acetate degradation mechanism was sao gehring et al 2015 goux et al 2015 frank et al 2016 mosbæk et al 2016 westerholm et al 2016 these results were obtained using different substrates and digestion conditions a reactor fed with sugar beet pulp with vfa accumulation up to 10 589 mg l goux et al 2015 or a reactor spiked with acetate at 5900 mg l mosbæk et al 2016 frank et al 2016 also reported a reactor fed with slaughterhouse and municipal waste containing 1300 mg l of vfa and 360 mg l of nh3 a review of conditions favoring the sao mechanism reported several and different ranges of nh3 nh4 and vfa depending on the experimental conditions used in the study westerholm et al 2016 these conditions caused a shift from the acetoclastic degradation pathway to sao followed by hydrogenotrophic pathway sao hm the shift from am to sao hm in ammonia induced digestion was even found to maintain stability and compensate for biogas production in digesters werner et al 2014 it was shown that from 60 to 75 of methane was produced via the sao hm pathway during mesophilic digestion of samples with high ammonia content 244 1214 mgn nh3 l jiang et al 2018 up to 89 of methane was derived from co2 and h2 reduction in a thermophilic reactor containing high levels of acetate 3840 5900 mg l hao et al 2011 indeed high abundance of saob in different digesters despite differences in their operating parameters and conditions demonstrated that they are an enduring and important component of biogas producing consortia sun et al 2014 a particular case is lipid rich substrate digestion which leads to degradation of long chain fatty acids lcfa ma et al 2015 although sao was not found to contribute to acetate degradation in a reactor fed with fats oils and grease 70 vs kurade et al 2019 a shift from am to hm activity was reported in lipid enriched reactors 1 5 2 g of oleate added in the feed due to the prevalence of hm along with hydrogen consuming bacteria in these thermophilic baserba et al 2012 amha et al 2017 and mesophilic regueiro et al 2016 reactors different threshold tolerances to ammonia vfa or lcfa found in the literature during the pathway shift were highly dependent on the substrate and on digester operation several studies highlighted a temporary adaptation of the prevailing microbial community to ammonia westerholm et al 2016 vfa li y et al 2018 and lcfa amha et al 2017 am are reported to be more severely affected by these conditions than hm which have a similar or in some cases higher tolerance to high ammonia levels than saob wang et al 2015 in all cases a decrease of am microbial activity always affects ad process all these results show that three pathways am hm and sao hm pathways could occur in a digester to produce methane however even if they probably co exist in digesters only one is responsible for most of the methane production depending on the process conditions when these digestion conditions change a shift between pathways could occur and could cause instabilities and eventually failures of the digester anaerobic co digestion acod which entails the simultaneous digestion of two or more feedstocks is widespread in several countries allows biogas production enhancement and maximizes waste valorization in acod cases the characteristics of co substrates type quality and quantity generally vary over time therefore the variations in the feedstocks induce variations in the process conditions which favor pathway shifts in the digester monitoring the microbial populations along with their activity and or growth could be used to monitor acod processes and provide an early warning of imbalances poirier et al 2016 a recent study showed that conventional or innovative early warning indicators varied among different types of ad systems with different operating conditions and mainly focused on biogas and its associated parameters and digestate compositions inside digesters wu d et al 2019 these indicators are ph vfa total and individuals vfa alkalinity partial total and bicarbonate biogas composition methane yield the concentration of specific intermediate metabolites ammonia glycerol aromatic compounds h2 carbon monoxide etc the composition of the microbial community and enzyme activity lebuhn et al 2015 li et al 2017 poirier et al 2016 there are also coupled indicators such as ratios between intermediate and partial alkalinities vfa and alkalinity vfa alk or vfa and total inorganic carbon that performed better than individual indicators lebuhn et al 2015 a recent review exploring the effectiveness of these indicators as well as an extensive study of their threshold values showed that no unique indicator and threshold value were applicable to all biogas plants li l et al 2018 moreover the proposed indicators were only effective for specific substrates and specific operating conditions because of their sensitivity to the process conditions and substrate compositions li et al 2017 wu et al 2019b in addition the specificities of the determination of some parameters also made it difficult to use them at full scale plants therefore several studies focused on developing online sensors for vfa ammonia and hydrogen determination mainly using spectroscopy chromatography or automatic titration for vfa alk nguyen et al 2015 however experience in using these sensors in full scale plants is limited robustness simplicity accuracy and reliability are some of the key parameters that any operator will look for when choosing one of these sensors and or indicators for process monitoring as none of these indicators was universally valid for all ad systems more work is needed to design an indicator and monitoring tool that meet ad plant operators requirements a shift in metabolic pathway appears to be a relevant indicator of the state of the process determination of the pathway shift could be used as a monitoring strategy of the process however the existing methods for the determination of metabolic pathways carbon isotope analysis molecular methods etc and subsequent pathway shifts are complex and time consuming in this context the aim of this study was to develop a monitoring tool to diagnose imbalances in methanogens activity as early as possible in order to avoid failures of the digester as biogas and methane production are directly impacted by changes in methanogens their dynamics could reflect methanogens activity the tool developed in the present study is therefore based on biogas production rate bpr and associated kinetics a principal component analysis pca model was built based on bpr kinetics obtained during normal operating conditions of the digester this model was evaluated during the unstable periods of the experiments to determine its ability to rapidly identify the shift between degradation pathways and hence to provide early warnings 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale digester the pilot scale digester was a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr with a working volume of 35 l and was maintained under mesophilic conditions 38 c the reactor was mounted on a scale for the monitoring of its weight therefore enabling control and recording of the doses of feed the feed substrate prepared every week was kept in a refrigerator 4 c containing a hopper placed above the reactor to allow gravity feeding before each feed the mixed substrate was recirculated from the bottom to the top inside the hopper with a pump watson marlow 701 type fb r for the purpose of homogenization a thermo regulator huber pilotone was used to recirculate hot water in the double wall of the reactor to maintain the temperature at 38 c the pneumatic system of the reactor was managed by an agilent 34970a acquisition control unit with a specially designed program with labview 2014 the reactor gas flow meter used to determine biogas quantity was also connected to the acquisition program the exhaust biogas pipe was fitted with a sampling point for biogas quality determination 2 2 operating conditions and substrate co digestion experiments were conducted on the pilot with pig slurry ps as base substrate to ensure liquid digestion conditions and to provide nutrients co substrates such as horse feed residues hf fruit waste fw food fats f and protein waste pw were added in different proportions with ps with an organic load rate olr varying between 0 9 and 2 5 kgvs m 3 d 1 and an hrt varying between 20 and 27 days table 1 commercial horse feed apples butter and casein were used to simulate hf fw f and pw respectively these substrates were all mixed together along with ps depending on the experiment concerned table 1 in all experiments the reactor was fed once a day in the morning two experiments a1 and a2 were first performed under normal conditions at two different olr 0 9 and 1 7 kgvs m 3 d 1 and no inhibition was observed in either experiment experiment a3 immediately followed with the addition of fats in the feed mixture this co substrate increased the olr from 1 7 to 2 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 and led to the failure of the digester feeding was stopped for several days and the digester was partially emptied to recover from the disturbance experiment b1 was performed later with a similar olr 1 1 kgvs m 3 d 1 as in experiment a1 in experiment b2 pw was next added as co substrate which also increased the olr up to 2 5 kgvs m 3 d 1 and led to another failure prior to these two series of experiments the digester was inoculated with digestate coming from a well established lab scale digester treating ps hf hrt 27 days olr 1 01 kgvs m 3 d 1 at a ph of 7 43 0 1 and a ts of 19 2 2 2 g l and a vs of 11 1 1 2 g l table s1 supplementary material lists the characteristics of the mixture of substrates used in this study as expected ts increased from 2 7 in experiment a1 containing only ps hf to 3 6 4 1 in experiments a2 and b1 when fw was added ts also increased to 5 4 and 6 5 in experiments a3 and b2 respectively due to the addition of f and pw these specific co substrates f and pw also induced variations in total cod tkn and bmp of the substrate mixture total cod varied between 28 1 and 102 8 go2 kg 1 between 2000 and 7500 mgn l 1 for tkn and between 348 4 and 468 4 nlch4 kgvs 1 for bmp 2 3

chromatography mass selective gc ms agilent technologies 7890 b 5977 a for lcfa an extraction with hexane isopropanol 3 2 solvent was first performed with an accelerated solvent extractor dionex ase

methane potential bmp tests were performed on each feed mixture according to vedrenne et al 2008 each sample was tested in triplicate with an inoculum to substrate ratio of 1 gvs gvs 1 and was incubated at 38 c for 40 days biogas quality ch4 co2 was monitored daily and determined with gas chromatography equipped with flame ionization detector gc fid agilent technologies 6890 n usa in all experiments 2 3 2 sampling the feed mixture used in each experiment was monitored once a week bmp tests were performed on substrate mixture of each experiment digestates were taken daily prior to each feeding first in experiments a1 and a2 digestates were monitored once a week in experiments a3 b1 and b2 parameters such as ph nh4 vfahplc vfa alk and lcfa were monitored daily while other parameters were monitored weekly 2 4 biogas production rate biogas production was measured using a wet tipping gas meter massé et al 2010 the operating of these gas meters is based on the tipping bucket principle in which liquid is displaced by gas in a specially designed chamber walker et al 2009 in this study an inverted container placed in water was used and was continuously filled by the biogas produced when the inverted container was completely full corresponding to 36 4 ml of biogas the container tipped and the biogas escaped and water filled the container again this gas meter allowed the measurement of each tipping of the container bpr was calculated by dividing the volume of biogas 36 4 ml by the time elapsed since the previous tipping considering that the volume and the temperature of the headspace of the digester remained constant each bpr obtained is termed instantaneous bpr and all bprs obtained between two feedings corresponding to a day in our case represented the evolution of the instantaneous bpr and is termed daily bpr kinetics these daily bpr kinetics were always linearly interpolated with a time step of 0 001 day to have the same number of points 1001 for each day 2 5 pca model as a multivariate method pca makes it possible to reduce the size and to extract pertinent information from experimental datasets x by preserving the maximum variance of the original space according to equation 1 below 1 x tpt e where t is the matrix of the scores pt is the transpose of the loadings matrix which explains the relationship between the variables and principal components pcs and e is the residual matrix pca can reveal the underlying phenomena of a system through the scores matrix or multivariate parameters hotelling s distance in general process monitoring with pca is implemented in two steps calibration a model is built with a training set acquired under normal conditions bpr kinetics collected in experiments a1 and a2 maintained at a cautious olr for a steady state reactor were used to define the in control process baseline through a pca model using the r2013b statistics toolbox of matlab a smoothing algorithm savitzky and golay 1964 was performed on the data as well as mean centering to comply with the needs of the pca method standard normal variate snv barnes et al 1989 a function used to remove scatter and scale data was also performed to create a linear metric the pca model through its pcs highlights a metric or indicator for the normal operation of the digester pc score plots were built with their corresponding loadings prediction new data scaled using the mean of the training set are projected onto the pca model to evaluate whether they behave like the training set the built pca model and its parameters were then applied as such to all kinetics data acquired in experiments a3 b1 and b2 3 results and discussion 3 1 digestate characteristics the characteristics of digestate samples collected from each experiment are listed in table 2 ts were similar in each series of experiments 1 5 2 1 despite variations in the ts of the substrate mixture 2 7 6 5 this indicates the high biodegradability of the co substrates added to ps there was no significant accumulation of matter in the digester tkn and nh4 showed similar variations a significant increase in tkn and nh4 was observed during experiment b2 due to the addition of pw in the feed tkn accumulation in the digester was related to the initial tkn in the feed mixture 7500 500 mg l while nh4 accumulation originated from degradation of organic nitrogen proteins in the digester variations in total cod depended on the substrate used there were significant variations in experiments with high olr a3 b2 however it remained difficult to differentiate variations due to the feed substrate from actual cod accumulation in the digester finally variations in ts vs tkn and cod were not very useful in identifying failures along with nh4 ph vfahplc lcfa vfa alk biogas and methane production provided interesting dynamics related to the digester s stability consequently digester operations are discussed based on these parameters 3 2 digester operations in experiments a1 to a3 experiments a1 a2 and a3 were carried out continuously for 140 days a1 and a2 were performed cautiously to avoid failures of the digester by using ps hf in experiment a1 and adding fw in experiment a2 the digester showed good degradation performances in both experiments fig 2 with biogas production maintained at a good flow rate of 1 3 0 5 and 4 3 0 3 nl gvs day in a1 and a2 respectively depending on the substrates indeed biogas production was on average 76 and 88 of the bmp value of the substrate mixture in a1 and a2 respectively ch4 was on average 50 1 7 5 of biogas production in a1 and was correlated with biogas production fig s1a in a2 ch4 quickly stabilized and was on average 60 2 1 3 of biogas no warning was detected by state indicators such as ph and vfa alk fig 3 in both experiments and no vfa and lcfa accumulated in the digester fig 2 nh4 varied between 1400 and 1 900mgn nh4 l in both experiments nh3 concentrations calculated considering ph 7 5 on average for a1 a2 and temperature 38 c according to hansen et al 1998 were 82 and 55 mgn nh3 l at steady state in a1 and a2 respectively during experiment a3 the digester was exposed to food fats added to the previous feed mixture used in a2 with an increase in olr from 1 7 to 2 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 the digester appeared to work correctly at this new olr of 2 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 until day 122 fig s1 then biogas production dropped starting from day 123 in parallel lcfa started accumulating at day 113 followed by vfa accumulation from day 120 fig 2 mainly with the accumulation of acetate and propionate fig s2a vfa alk and ph reacted weakly to the inhibition and later than the drop in biogas production fig 3 indeed from day 126 vfa alk increased from 0 27 to 0 43 while ph decreased from 7 3 to 7 1 according to recent studies digesters are in critical state when vfa alk ratio exceeds 0 5 lossie and pütz 2008 or 0 45 lebuhn et al 2015 similarly the optimal ph range for a digester is between 6 5 and 8 5 li et al 2017 ph dropped below 6 5 at day 132 and vfa alk exceeded 0 45 at day 127 during the first 20 days of experiment a3 biogas production was at 5 2 nl gvs day for 62 9 2 3 of methane corresponding to 89 of the bmp of the feed mixture after a slight increase in the daily biogas production between days 120 123 a huge drop was observed at the end of the experiment the digester was totally inhibited by lcfa accumulation up to 1 868 mg l and vfa accumulation up to 7 880 mg l along with a drop in ph lcfa accumulation was a better state indicator than vfa as it occurred earlier in the process while vfa accumulation can be detected on site using a titrimetric method only laboratory analytical tools could detect lcfa accumulation additionally daily biogas production increased slightly from day 120 at the beginning of the inhibition which made the inhibition difficult to detect this increase in biogas production is discussed below based on bpr kinetics consequently additional on site parameters are required for a better diagnosis among potential on site parameters monitored in this study were bpr kinetics acquired in all the experiments 3 3 bpr kinetics in experiments a1 to a3 fig 4 shows bpr kinetics acquired at different days in experiments a1 a2 and a3 and the corresponding states of the process from these data a pattern fig 5 was constructed from bpr kinetics data acquired during experiments a1 and a2 illustrated by days 50 and 80 fig 4a and b three steps can be distinguished in these curves step 1 a rapid decreasing phase of biogas production step 2 constant high biogas production and step 3 constant low biogas production there is a transition stage between the last two steps the first step occurred directly after feeding and probably corresponded to the rapid hydrolysis of soluble components and easily hydrolysable compounds producing mainly co2 and h2 followed by ch4 formation by hm the second step was assumed to correspond to biogas production from acetate initially present in the feed substrate and continuously produced by hydrolysis and acidogenesis moreover during this step bpr kinetics were not limited by acetate which was present in sufficient quantity in the reactor but rather by methanogens activity the transition stage indicated that acetate production became slower than acetate consumption until reaching a low acetate concentration in the reactor this transition occurred respectively at 0 15 and 0 4 days in experiments a1 day 50 and a2 day80 fig 4a and b which is correlated with the olr of these experiments after this transition step acetate concentration was close to 0 and bpr kinetic was limited by acetate production coming from slowly biodegradable compounds while all bpr kinetic profiles appeared to be similar in experiments a1 and a2 and at the beginning of experiment a3 changes in the bpr kinetics were noted later in experiment a3 for the 20 first days of experiment a3 the transition stage occurred around 0 5 days due to the increase in olr fig 4c day 110 at day 120 bpr kinetics clearly showed an extension of step 2 with a transition occurring at 0 6 days fig 4d moreover a decrease in bpr reached during the second step was observed from day 120 finally at acidosis state day 130 no second step was observed and the third step was reached directly after the first one fig 4e these gradual changes in the bpr kinetics suggested increasing inhibition of methanogens activity am mainly from day 120 leading to a lower bpr and a longer second step however despite the increasing inhibition of methanogenesis from day 120 biogas production increased slightly until day 122 ch4 also increased and reached a high value 67 4 at day 122 this brief increase was probably due to compensation of the acetoclastic pathway by another degradation pathway allowing a higher daily cumulative biogas production these results suggest a pathway shift from am to another degradation pathway from day 123 daily biogas production decreased due to severe am inhibition leading to a drop in ph finally all these conditions resulted in a total inhibition of all methanogens according to these data the weakness of ad process monitoring using daily biogas production was highlighted as the daily biogas production increased during this experiment when the inhibition started probably due to the shift in pathways as shown changes in bpr kinetic profiles with the probable pathway shift appeared to signal the digester s instabilities early however a visual approach might not be easy and sufficient to determine this shift point therefore a multivariate approach such as pca was needed to first create a model on bpr kinetics acquired during normal operation and then to apply and evaluate the model on other experiments 3 4 pca model and process stability indicators pca reduces the information contained in a high number of individual process variables to a small number of composite indexes representing pcs the pca model was built with bpr kinetics from experiments a1 a2 using two pcs explaining respectively 86 1 and 8 3 of variance fig 6 shows the scores and loadings associated with the pca model concerning pc1 the shape of the loading curve is similar to the bpr kinetics with the 3 steps pc1 scores were very constant during the first experiment a1 and then increased quickly to reach another constant value from the beginning of experiment a2 concerning pc2 the loadings obtained highlighted the first step and mainly the transition between steps 2 and 3 consequently pc2 scores varied mainly at the beginning of experiment a2 when the length of the second step evolved due to changes in substrates and olr as explained above these first bpr kinetics curves were believed to describe a digester working with acetoclastic methanogenesis as the main methanogenic pathway this entire step is the calibration step of the model the monitoring of subsequent experiments is conducted using the two projected pcs scores the pca model built from experiments a1 and a2 was used to monitor bpr kinetics acquired during experiment a3 these new data were projected onto the defined pca subspace after undergoing the same preprocessing the scores were predicted from the scaling parameters of the calibration dataset projected score dynamics pc1 2 were compared to biogas production fig 7 pc1 started dropping from day 119 possibly related to the beginning of acetate accumulation in the digester fig s2a this drop also suggested an early decline in am activity followed by a gradual shift from the main acetoclastic pathway to another degradation path as shown in fig 7 the production peak due to the compensation was reached when another state was highlighted by the bpr kinetics meanwhile pc2 clearly showed the changes of the transition stage during the experiment first pc2 showed a constant increase mirroring olr and biogas production followed by a gradual drop until day 119 confirming the inhibition of am activity next the transition stage abruptly increased highlighting the importance of the compensating pathway for biogas production finally pc2 gradually dropped indicating that all methanogens activity was completely inhibited as the mechanisms behind lcfa pathway degradation are not clearly defined it remains difficult to qualify what kind of shift occurred in the digester lcfa can only be degraded by syntrophic interaction based on β oxidation with anaerobic communities sousa et al 2009 but there are contrasting opinions regarding lcfa degradation pathway although hydrogen consuming bacteria were found in abundance in lcfa stressed digestion long et al 2012 and were significantly correlated with methane production amha et al 2017 versatile methanogens methanosarcina which can perform both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic degradation were the most abundant archaea palatsi et al 2011 one study concluded that absence or relatively low abundance of saob and hm in parallel with am dominance suggested that methane formed from lcfa digestion was predominantly conducted with acetoclastic pathway led by methanosarcina kurade et al 2019 another study reported the prevalence of methanosarcina and methanococcus strictly hydrogenotrophic methanogens along with low abundance of the strict am methanosaetacea in reactors exposed to oleate fast growing of strict hm methanococcus was triggered by oleate continuous addition shifting them into the dominant archaeal population this suggests that hm was an important pathway for methane formation in these reactors baserba et al 2012 an anaerobic reactor co digesting agro industrial waste with abrupt and gradual changes in lcfa concentrations showed that these perturbations resulted in greater variations in the archaeal domain from methanosaeta dominance in steady state to hydrogenotrophic pathway during the disturbance periods regueiro et al 2016 regardless of the shift lcfa accumulation in a digester remains harmful to the process stability as the inhibition will gradually lead to a total failure of the process by keeping the olr at 2 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 with fats as co substrate the process was completely inhibited by lcfa accumulation and biogas production dropped very low using the pathway shift as an early sign of imbalance might help to prevent inhibition indeed at the shift point determined by the pc1 scores day 119 lcfa was at 522 mg l and vfa at 187 mg l in the digester these concentrations are low and biogas production has not even been affected yet a recovery at this point would be much easier for the process therefore the pca model built based on bpr kinetics seems to be a valuable tool to monitor the process and prevent lipid inhibition of a digester an evaluation of this model in other cases will assess its robustness for the process monitoring it is worth noting that several studies have already used pca to monitor the ad process pca was used on data consisting of physicochemical parameters and biogas composition to monitor reactors fed with different substrates leite et al 2018 or exposed to organic overload lemaigre et al 2016 pca was also used on near infrared derived chemical data to detect disturbances in ad process behavior reed et al 2013 these studies used control charts made with hotelling s distance and residuals which require confidence intervals and control limits to highlight the digester failures in the different systems studied however the main difference between those studies and the present study is the type of data and indicators used while the other studies collected several chemical data to build the model and perform the monitoring the present study only requires bpr kinetics this instantaneous measurement will be cheaper and less time consuming than models developed with chemical parameters 3 5 evaluation of the model using experiments b1 and b2 3 5 1 digester operations for b1 and b2 in order to evaluate the robustness of the method two additional experiments b1 and b2 were performed first the digester was fed with ps hf fw with a gradual increase of the olr 0 5 1 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 during two weeks experiment b1 days 1 13 then pw was added to the feed mixture to reach an olr of 2 5 kgvs m 3 d 1 and maintained for two additional weeks experiment b2 days 13 29 in experiment b1 biogas production increased gradually from 0 9 to 3 3 nl gvs day as shown in fig 8 ch4 remained constant and on average 63 5 3 5 of biogas production in parallel no accumulation of either lcfa or vfa was observed nh4 concentration was on average 1950 mgn nh4 l and nh3 concentration calculated considering ph and temperature was 173 mgn nh3 l on average all these results including ph which remained constant around 7 9 and vfa alk at 0 18 fig 9 a and b suggest that the digester worked fine during experiment b1 during experiment b2 biogas production first increased 4 02 nl gvs day 65 2 of ch4 at the same time as vfa started accumulating mainly acetate and propionate fig s2b day 15 this initial increase was mainly due to pw addition in the feed mixture then vfa accumulated up to 13 500 mg l day 29 while vfa alk tended to remain at 1 due to an established balance between the acidity of the medium vfa and the buffer capacity alkalinity fig 8 this buffer capacity was mainly due to ammonium ions nh4 produced by protein degradation nh4 concentrations increased from 1950 mg n nh4 l in b1 to 4090 mgn nh4 l in b2 fig 8 ph decreased slowly from 7 9 and then remained constant around 7 5 fig 9a biogas production decreased to 2 5 nl gvs day at day 19 and remained constant and significant despite vfa accumulation ch4 also decreased to 50 of biogas production the balance established in the digester hints at the pathway shift from am to sao hm this shift is also suggested by nh4 accumulation inducing the accumulation of the toxic form nh3 up to 185 mg n nh3 l at day 29 it should be noted that ammonia inhibition in ad process depends on important factors initial concentrations process temperature ph olr and acclimation of inoculum which have direct or indirect effects on inhibitory concentrations yenigün and demirel 2013 as previously discussed on site parameters ph daily biogas production and vfa alk were not sufficient for early detection of inhibition in experiment a3 indeed daily biogas production increased simultaneously with vfa accumulation moreover in this case vfa alk remained low at the beginning of the inhibition 0 26 at day 17 due to the buffer capacity of proteins and ph remained around 7 5 despite the increasing vfa concentration vfa alk only reached a critical value at day 21 fig 9b 3 5 2 pca model application to experiments b1 and b2 the built pca model was then used to monitor bpr kinetics acquired during both experiments b1 and b2 fig 10 illustrates the obtained projected scores with b1 and b2 a first warning was shown in experiment b1 by pc1 at day 9 due to an accidental olr increase 1 1 1 3 kgvs m 3 d 1 it was also highlighted by pc2 which showed an early change in the transition stage this shows that the model could detect small overloads that are not highlighted by chemical parameters the digester recovered after the feed was slightly reduced this first warning is a false alarm as it did not affect the process in this study pca model calibration was performed using experiments with low amplitude variations in olr to prevent such false alarms additional calibrations are required and should include experiments with higher amplitude variations in olr without inhibition as snv was performed after pca these deviations would have been included in the in control scheme for the monitoring in addition the combination of control charts is a methodology that effectively reduces the occurrence of false alarm in statistical process control chen 2010 in the present study as two indicators were defined these false alarms can be distinguished by requiring that both indicators simultaneously demonstrate out of control behavior to confirm a warning indeed the transition stage pc1 should be sufficiently affected to trigger a change in the global bpr kinetic form pc2 or inversely this monitoring technique still needs to be tested in different cases and conditions before being used in full scale applications a second warning appeared at day 16 corresponding to bpr kinetics obtained after two days of pw addition in the feed substrate pc1 first dropped at day 15 and slightly increased after but remained at low values pc2 also behaved in the same way as in experiment a3 by dropping first at day 16 and increasing slowly to reach a new balance the abrupt drop and the establishment of a new state by pc1 2 clearly highlighted the gradual pathway shift occurring in the digester a third decrease was observed at day 25 due to the addition of pw in the feed mixture these results confirm the important contribution of the sao hm pathway during anaerobic digestion of nitrogen rich substrates such as protein waste indeed the extent of sao and the levels of known saob hm and am were determined in sludge from 13 industrial biogas production plants the results showed that high abundance of saob was positively correlated with relatively low abundance of am and high concentrations of ammonia and vfa sun et al 2014 the shift might be a consequence of the inhibitive effect of ammonia and vfa on am activity as hm and saob have been reported to adapt to high concentrations of nh3 hansen et al 1998 westerholm et al 2016 li y et al 2018 nevertheless this adaptation does not always allow a complete recovery of the original methane yield of anaerobic digesters rajagopal et al 2013 as the pathway shift occurred and biogas production dropped by 30 the digester was no longer working in optimal conditions the pathway shift from am to sao hm was determined based on the second warning at 1800 mg l of nh4 and 159 mg l of nh3 combined analysis of the microbial community and biogas production in mesophilic processes have shown that imbalances in digesters at ammonia levels exceeding 150 mgn nh3 l can be due to an ammonia induced shift from the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway to the sao hm pathway westerholm et al 2011 2016 this is in agreement with the results obtained in the present study complete inhibition due to ammonia was reported at 3000 mg l of nh4 at any ph rajagopal et al 2013 and around 200 400 mg l for nh3 westerholm et al 2016 in mesophilic operations therefore the low concentrations of ammonium and ammonia at the shift point demonstrate the quality of the model and its ability to indicate early signs of imbalances in the digester it represents a relevant indicator in the process state and will help to quickly adjust the feed and maintain good degradation conditions in the digester 3 6 improvement of recovery strategies of the digester recovery strategies in the ad process differ depending on the inhibition that occurs in the digester several general recovery actions are possible such as observing a feed stop period using feeding patterns or dilution with new inoculums specific recovery actions also consist in adding materials such as trace elements for vfa inhibition zhang et al 2018 or adsorbents such as bentonite for lcfa inhibition palatsi et al 2009 and glauconite or phosphorite for nh3 inhibition nielsen and angelidaki 2008 in biogas plants the most widely used recovery strategy is to observe a feed stop period however this method is not always economically feasible as vfa inhibition requires a long feed stop period zhang et al 2018 moreover feed stop was shown to be the least effective recovery strategy in the case of lcfa inhibition palatsi et al 2009 regardless of the strategy chosen the recovery of a digester depends on the efficiency of the early warning indicator used also the more advanced the inhibition stage is in the digester the less efficient and economically feasible the recovery of the digester will be zhang et al 2018 therefore with early warnings the concentrations of inhibitors will be low so feed stop periods will be short and more effective in experiments a3 and b2 the stability indicators which could have been used in biogas plants daily biogas production ph and vfa alk indicated different days of warning in experiment a3 the earliest significant instability indicator was vfa alk at day 127 when vfa was at 3185 mg l and lcfa at 1245 mg l in experiment b2 vfa alk reached a critical value at day 21 with vfa at 4722 mg l based on our methodology considering pcs 1 2 warnings were identified at day 119 and day 16 respectively in experiments a3 and b2 vfa was at 522 mg l at day 119 and 274 mg l at day 16 considering existing strategies recovering a digester at 500 mg l of vfa or less would be easier than recovering a digester at 3000 4000 mg l for example in these cases a feed stop period of 1 or 2 days should be sufficient whereas a longer period would be necessary with traditional stability indicators indeed methanogens activity would be less affected by low vfa concentrations and would allow their rapid consumption and biogas production would not suffer at these low concentrations 4 conclusion methanogenic pathway shifts occurred in digesters at high concentrations of lcfa vfa and ammonia this study was conducted in order to detect these shifts as an early sign of instability in acod processes a pca model was built based on the bpr kinetics of a digester operating under normal conditions and the acetoclastic methanogenesis was therefore the dominant pathway the model pcs scores were used to evaluate its accuracy in predicting instabilities in two inhibition induced experiments changes in the dominant pathway either from am to hm or from am to sao hm occurred as expected early warnings were given in each experiment at very low concentrations of lcfa vfa and ammonium ammonia these low concentrations could be easily recovered by the digester this monitoring strategy is therefore appropriate for ad process monitoring especially in the context of co digestion and will enhance its stability and biogas production the results presented in this study were obtained with a digester fed once a day in controlled conditions further studies are required to evaluate the impact of different feeding frequencies additionally these results were obtained using a lab scale pilot which allowed a precise monitoring of the bpr with no disturbance caused by changes in the headspace volume or temperature changes in conclusion despite these promising results further studies are required to make this monitoring strategy applicable on full scale digesters funding source l awhangbo is the beneficiary of a phd scholarship funded by irstea and the bretagne region this project was also funded by the

the models but also dependent on the parameters in data set chosen for training the learning models moreover the key water parameters should also be identified by the learning models in order to further reduce prediction costs and improve prediction efficiency here we endeavored for the first time to compare the water quality prediction performance of 10 learning models 7 traditional and 3 ensemble models using big data 33 612 observations from the major rivers and lakes in china from 2012 to 2018 based on the precision recall f1 score weighted f1 score and explore the potential key

benefiting various works of our life for examples face recognition technologies based on deep learning models are able to track the criminals precisely and timely lecun et al 2015 other sought after applications including artificial intelligence driving technologies in some complex driving environment aeberhard et al 2015 and global mega size medical data analyses using deep learning esteva et al 2019 gurovich et al 2019 in the environmental monitoring fields especially hydrological monitoring ai technologies have also started to be successfully applied using various learning algorithm models for instance the real time radar derived rainfall forecasting were proposed by some machine learning models yu et al 2017 moreover an intelligent water regimen monitoring system were recently tried to established to solve measuring accuracy problem and increase working efficiency fan et al 2018 additionally application of ai dealing with large scale environmental medium monitoring data have also gradually gained interests with regards to hydrological monitoring a great number of environmental monitoring data have traditionally been collected worldwide by individual environmental departments and agencies dunbabin and marques 2012 consolidating these huge environmental data sets would provide valuable resources for training machine learning models in order to identify patterns and markers for understanding for instance water quality moreover although the environmental quality water or air could be classified and reported real time by monitoring reference parameters according to the guidelines of environmental classification they are unable to provide early warning of future environmental pollution importantly machine learning models could be trained starting with a few key environmental quality parameters and the final environmental outcomes using the current archived data then to predict the future outcomes after inputting new parameters this suggested the possibility of using some environmental parameters to quickly predict future environmental consequences ghahramani 2015 it is of great significance to be able to provide accurate environmental early warning with minimum possible environmental parameters yet maximum prediction precision of the learning models despite the great potential of machine learning in the area of environmental medium quality monitoring the relevant research and applications of machine learning models are still lacking surface water is a kind of non renewable resource and of great significance in our human daily life however with the development of the economy surface water quality continues to be compromised and deteriorate posing threats to human health especially in some developing countries vörösmarty et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 as the largest developing country in the world in the last decades many parts of china were facing have induced severe water stress as well as the health risks water contamination after ever growing demands and misuse of surface water resources over the last decades sun et al 2016 therefore it is particularly crucial to monitor and predict surface water quality precisely and timely indeed a few machine learning methods were created and implemented to monitor and predict water quality after reviewing related previous studies in the past decade table s1 however most of them used relatively small training and validation datasets more importantly these traditional models demonstrated relatively low prediction precision and unbalanced prediction abilities for different levels of water qualities for example the highest prediction precision of water quality for succeeding weeks in the above avila et al study was 92 00 for green acceptable 0 00 for amber alert and 95 00 for red action predicted from bayesian network model avila et al 2018 indeed the prediction precision for green acceptable and red action action may be satisfied for the governors however the prediction precision for amber alert is not acceptable for environmental protection agencies they often should take some measures as soon as possible when facing the alert of water quality deterioration undoubtedly the water quality prediction precision of these older models would be limited them for application in the future and the precision of those learning models may be limited by few training data in these previous studies nevertheless the relation between surface water quality performance and the amount of training data was still largely unknown recently an emerging class of machine learning models named ensemble methods were proposed which consisted of multiple learning algorithms zhang and ma 2012 importantly they often had better predictive performance than any one of the constituent learning algorithms alone qiu et al 2017 singh et al 2013 random forest rf as one of the most famous representatives have been proposed and applied in various areas belgiu and drăguţ 2016 boulesteix et al 2012 notably gcforest a decision tree ensemble method proposed by zhou et al in 2017 also attracted much attention zhou and feng 2018 it was a new deep learning model called deep cascade forest dcf by cascading several random forests using the idea of ensemble learning compared to the earlier ensemble and deep learning models dcf could adaptively determine the number of cascade levels and set the model complexity automatically enabling excellent performance even on small scale data zhou and feng 2018 so users could control training costs according to the available computational resources furthermore the performance of dcf is quite robust in hyper parameter settings when changing different data from different domains however the other deep learning models such as deep neural networks was deeply required tuning network structure and hyper parameters zhou and feng 2018 surprisingly there was limited information on the prediction of surface water quality using dcf moreover there was little information about the comparative analysis of the prediction performance from different ensemble learning models based on the same big data notably the water quality prediction performance of machine learning models may be not only dependent on the models per se and the amount of data set but also dependent on the water parameters in data set chosen for training the learning models it is vital to identify some key water parameters for training learning models without significantly reducing predictive performance because they could remarkably increase prediction efficiency and decrease the prediction cost however few studies have evaluated the surface water quality prediction performance of learning models to identify key water parameters from big training data sets singh and kaur 2017 the aims of this study were to i based on the precision recall f1 score and weighted f1 socre investigate whether the big data could improve the water prediction

water quality monitoring stations in 10 national large rivers and lakes from china national environmental monitoring centre from 2012 to 2018 http www mee gov cn hjzl shj dbszdczb the 10 national large rivers and lakes were distribution throughout the country including songhua river liaohe river haihe river huaihe river yellow river yangtze river pearl river taihu lake chaohu lake and dianchi lake and their geographical locations were presented in fig s1 four selected water quality parameters including chemical oxygen demand codmn dissolved oxygen do ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and hydrogen ion concentration ph and their overall water quality classification results were adopted directly from china national environmental monitoring centre and were used for constructing water quality prediction models based on the national environmental quality standards for surface water of china gb3838 2002 water quality was classified into five levels i ii iii iv and v additionally the water quality worse than v was also considered in this study hence here the level of water quality was classified and predicted using six levels from good to bad i ii iii iv v and worse than v wv respectively here 33 612 water quality data sets were obtained after data clean remove the data sets with missing values additionally in order to keep the all water parameters with the same degree of influence on final outcomes here we performed z score standardization on the water parameters barboza et al 2017 fig 1 2 2 seven traditional machine learning models in order to evaluate whether big training data could improve the water quality prediction performance by machine learning models the seven traditional machine learning models dt nb lr lda crt knn and svm with higher frequency in previous studies table s1 were selected in this study fig 1 and the detailed information about these seven older models were presented in the supporting information 2 3 three ensemble learning models for the comprehensive comparing the water quality prediction performance between traditional and ensemble learning models and identifying the potential models for further water quality monitoring rf crf and dcf as the representatives of ensemble learning models were selected in this study fig 1 2 3 1 rf rf is an ensemble learning model based on dt as base models breiman 2001 in the rf each tree uses a sample obtained by bootstrap gislason et al 2006 each node has d features of the base dt it randomly selects d features from the feature set which has d features as a new subset and then selects the optimal feature by g i n i value from the subset for split strobl et al 2008 by voting all the decision trees output we get the final output fig s2 where c k i is the predictive class of t r e e i after using majority voting class c k is the final predictive class of x the process of majority voting is as follows if there are k classes to be predicted the prediction of x by t r e e i in rf is represented as an k dimensional vector c i h i 1 h i 2 h i k where h i k 0 1 indicates the predictive probability of class c k of t r e e i briefly the voting method used by rf with t decision trees is defined as 1 y c k if i 1 t h i k 0 5 k 1 k i 1 t h i k reject otherwise the prediction will take effect only if more than half of the trees predict the same result and here 10 dt were selected in the forest 2 3 2 crf similar to rf the crf was an ensemble learning model based on crt as base models breiman 2001 and the 10 crt were selected to construct the crf in this study 2 3 3 dcf as a highly ensemble method deep cascade forest can be constructed by many random forests zhou and feng 2018 in each layer of deep cascade forest we can also add other traditional machine learning models and ensemble models to improve the ensemble performance each level of cascade receives feature information processed by its preceding level and outputs its processing result to the next level in addition to reduce the risk of over fitting all the base models in each layer use k fold cross validation when a layer is trained we achieved the predictive accuracy on a validation set the model will continue to construct the next layer until the accuracy can be no longer improved consequently the number of cascade levels can be automatically determined by the termination of the training process the adaptive adjustment of model complexity enables deep cascade forest to be applied to training data sets of different scales here we increased the diversity at full stretch firstly we selected two different types of forests 2 rf and 2 crf to encourage the diversity in each layer of dcf fig s3 so that the input feature perturbation and data sample perturbation could be increased next we voted to combine all the individual output together and generated the final output that increases the data sample perturbation based on different amounts of input features we also increased the input feature perturbation since the input of next layer came from the output of previous layer and the raw features in our model we definitely increased the output representation perturbation in all dcf is a decision tree ensemble model with high diversity and low generalization error 2 4 model operation and evaluation 2 4 1 model operation the all 10 model operation was carried out in python 3 6 with different packages fig 1 for dt nb lr lda crt knn svm rf and crf were built by package of scikit learn v 019 pedregosa et al 2011 using big training data 33612 sets of 4 water parameters dcf was built by package of gcforest v 1 1 1 zhou and feng 2018 it has been well demonstrated that the two packages could be used to successfully build the all 10 learning models with high level performance pedregosa et al 2011 zhou and feng 2018 after building models the main structures functions and hyper parameters were obtained and presented in table 1 2 4 2 model evaluation the precision and recall were selected for evaluating the prediction performances of learning models fig 1 moreover f1 score and their weighted average value weighed f1 score were also selected for better assessing this multi classification problem fig 1 these 4 metrics were defined as the precision was defined as 2 p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p the recall was defined as 3 r e c a l l t p t p f n the f1 score was defined as 4 f 1 s c o r e 2 p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l the weighted f1 score was defined as 5 w e i g h t e d f 1 s c o r e 1 k i 1 k β i f 1 i where tp is true positive positive class is predicted as positive class fp is false positive negative class is predicted as positive class fn is false positive positive class is predicted as negative class k is the number of classes and β i i is the proportion of the number of samples in class i to the total number of samples f1 i is the f1 score of x in class i additionally a stratified k fold k 5 cross validation was used to estimate the prediction performance of models fig 1 the advantage of this method is that all observations are used for both training and validation 3 results 3 1 the training

110 80 and 0 to 30 1 respectively fig 2b each water parameter was standardized using their respective z score prior to inputting training models in order to keep all the 4 parameters possessing the same degree of influence on final water quality prediction fig 2c 3 2 water quality prediction performances after increasing training data in order to evaluate whether better water quality perdition performances of each learning models could be observed after increasing training data here the data sets were firstly divided into two parts including training 80 26890 observations and validation sets 20 6722 observations fig 1 the training set was further divided into subsets of different proportions 1 269 observations 10 2689 observations 50 13455 observations and 100 26890 observations for training these 10 models subsequently fig 3 a while the validation data set remained the same the main functions and hyper parameters of these 10 models were presented in table 1 in the training process the traditional learning models including knn and svm presented better performance after increasing training data whereas water quality prediction performance of 3 ensemble learning models did not show any improvement with increasing training data in the training process based on precision recall and f1 socre fig s4 and table s2 importantly here the all learning models expect for lda showed improved prediction performance in the validation process after inputting more training data fig s5 and table s3 notably the highest improvement for prediction performance of all 9 models were through inputting 10 of the training data compared with the performance of these 9 models trained by 1 training data based on the weighted f1 socre fig 3b and the improving prediction performance of these 9 models were form 1 87 lr to 22 76 knn interestingly the higher average improvement of water quality prediction were identified in 6 traditional models 11 62 compared to that in 3 ensemble models 7 30 fig 3b although the prediction performance of these 9 models were still increasing there were limited improvement of these 9 models after further increasing training data from 10 to 100 fig 3b 3 3 the ensemble learning models presented better water quality prediction performance compared to traditional learning models in order to identify the potential suitable models for future water quality monitoring we further compared the performance of 7 traditional learning models with 3 ensemble learning models fig 1 we used four water fundamental parameters based on the maximum training data 80 26890 observations because most learning models had better performance after increasing training data the main functions and hyper parameters of these 10 models were kept the same with the above experiments table 1 the performance of 10 learning models for all 6 levels of water qualities in both training and validation processes were evaluated by precision recall f1 score and weighted f1 score fig 1 additionally a stratified 5 fold cross validation was also used to estimate the stability of prediction performance of models figs 1 and 4 a 3 3 1 the training process in the training process amongst 7 traditional models the dt and crt had the highest precision 1 00 0 00 for dt 1 00 0 00 for crt fig 4b and table s4 recall 1 00 0 00 for dt 1 00 0 00 for crt fig 4b and table s4 and f1 score 1 00 0 00 for dt 1 00 0 00 for crt fig 4b and table s4 in predicting water quality at all 6 levels however the lr lda svm nb and knn presented unbalanced abilities for predicting 6 levels of water qualities fig 4b and table s4 specially the lr and lda failed to predict the level v and level i water respectively the svm presented significantly worse performance for predicting the level i water than other 5 levels water p 0 001 whereas nb presented significantly worse performance for predicting the level v water than other 5 levels water p 0 001 interestingly knn also showed significant reduction in performance for predicting the level i and level v water than other 3 levels water p 0 001 next the 3 ensemble learning models including rf crf and dcf were also trained by the same data sets overall all 3 ensemble learning models in this study showed satisfactory performance for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities in training processes fig 4b and table s4 similar to dt and crt crf showed better performance than rf and dcf did in the processes of training which were with the highest precision 1 00 0 00 recall 1 00 0 00 and f1 score 1 00 0 00 for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities notably all 3 ensemble learning models showed balanced and comprehensive abilities for predicting 6 levels of water qualities fig 4b and table s4 which were better than the above lr lda svm nb and knn importantly the rf crtf and dcf showed significantly better performance for predicting level i and level v water than lr lda svm nb and knn p 0 001 additionally no more significant difference was observed between rf and dcf predicted all 6 levels of water qualities during the training process 3 3 2 the validating process after training the 20 additional data were selected for validation the 10 learning models figs 1 and 4a compared to other 6 tradition learning models dt still showed remarkably better performance for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities water in validation process p 0 001 fig 4c and table s5 the lr and lda presented unacceptable performance for predicting level i and level v water in validating process fig 4c and table s5 notably the performance of crt presented different trend between the processes of validating and training although it had the best performance during training process crt presented significant worse performance for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities water in validating process p 0 001 fig 4c and table s5 additionally the performance of other 3 learning models including svm nb and knn in validating process was similar with their did in training process which also showed significantly worse performance for predicting the level i and level v water than other 3 levels water p 0 01 fig 4c and table s5 compared to these 7 traditional learning models the all 3 ensemble learning models in our study shown excellent performance for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities in validating processes fig 4c and table s5 among the 3 ensemble learning models rf and dcf presented better performance than crf for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities especially in predicting the level v and level wv water p 0 001 notably rf crf and dcf presented significantly better predicting performance of all 6 levels of water qualities compared to all 7 traditional learning models except that dt selected in this study more importantly rf and dcf showed satisfactorily performance for predicting the level v and level wv water which had highest precision 0 98 0 01 level v 0 99 0 00 level wv for rf 0 99 0

level v 0 99 0 01 level wv for dcf finally based on the weighted f1 score the dcf and crf shown the significant better water quality prediction performance compared to these 7 traditional learning models except dt fig 5 3 4 the water quality prediction performance of dt rf and dcf based on different water quality parameters sets for identify the key water parameters here the dt rf and dcf would be selected again for training and validating the prediction these water qualities based on any 3 and 2 of the 4 water quality parameters fig 1 due to dt rf and dcf has best performance for prediction all 6 levels of water qualities based on 4 water quality parameters 3 4 1 any 3 of 4 water quality parameters generally the performance of dt rf and dcf for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities in both training fig s6 and table s6 and validating processes fig 6 and table s7 based on any 3 water parameters were worse than that dcf trained by 4 water quality parameters nevertheless the dt rf and dcf trained by do codmn and nh3 n still presented acceptable performance for prediction water qualities which shown highest precision recall and f1 score for predicting the water qualities form level i to v in validating processes fig 6 and table s7 although the performance for predicting the level wv water from these 3 models trained by do codmn and nh3 n was not significant higher than the 3 models trained by the other 3 parameter sets ph codmn nh3 n ph do nh3 n ph do codmn the lowest precision recall f1 score from dt were 0 83 0 02 0 85 0 07 0 84 0 03 fig 6d and table s7 respectively which were also accepted in water quality prediction additionally the weighted f1 score of dt rf and dcf trained by do codmn and nh3 n were 0 97 0 00 0 98 0 01 0 98 0 01 and significant higher p 0 001 that of these 3 models trained by the other 3 water parameter sets fig 7 3 4 2 any 2 of 4 water quality parameters dt rf and dcf were then selected for training fig s7 and table s8 and validation of the prediction these water qualities using any 2 of the 4 water quality parameters similarly the performance of dt rf and dcf based on any 2 water parameters in validation process were worse than that these 3 models trained by 3 or 4 water quality parameters fig 8 and table s9 the performance of dt rf and dcf trained by codmn and nh3 n was significantly better than that these 3 models trained by other 5 training sets ph do ph codmn ph nh3 n do codmn and do nh3 n and their weighted f1 score was 0 86 0 01 0 86 0 01 0 88 0 01 fig 9 4 discussion it has been well established that surface water quality depends on multiple water conditions such as codmn do nh3 n ph temperature total phosphorus metal ion and other toxic chemicals simeonov et al 2003 meanwhile chlorophyll α and e coli were also chosen as direct biological indicators for evaluating the water quality avila et al 2018 park et al 2015 because they can characterize the ecological state and illness risks of the tested water however they were simplistic and couldn t provide the direct factors deteriorated water quality therefore a set of fundamental water parameters including the above codmn do nh3 n ph water temperature total phosphorus metal ion and serval toxic organic chemicals have been recommended for assessing water quality by several national government departments alabaster and lloyd 2013 for example 24 fundamental water parameters were selected for classifying the water quality according to the guideline of national environmental quality standards of surface water of china gb3838 2002 meeprc 2002 based on the results of all 24 basic water parameters it could classify water quality accurately and quickly by some lookup procedures however it is costly and time consuming to measure all 24 water parameters on all kinds of surface water due to the various experimental requirements therefore it is more practical to measure key parameters indicative of water quality rather than completely following the guideline of gb3838 2002 to understand water quality hence it is of great significance to predict water quality with fewer but more indicative fundamental water parameters increasing number of studies have tried to predict the surface water quality by machine learning models using a few water parameters and of the reported water quality di et al 2019 tan et al 2012 however the relatively poor prediction precision of these learning models still limits their further application it is most likely that these learning models used relatively small amount of training data because recent studies have shown that better performance could be achieved with more data used during the training process in each of the learning models chen et al 2016 zhu et al 2012 in our study improving performance of water quality prediction using 9 different learning models were observed after increasing training data notably the greatest improvement of prediction performance in these models were identified when the training data increased from 1 269 observations to 10 2689 observations interestingly the minimum training subset 1 were similar to the amount of training data set used in many previous studies and the prediction performance of 10 models based the minimum training subset in this study were similar with the results in these previous studies walley and džeroski 1996 consequently the surface water quality prediction performance of learning models could be improved significantly by increasing the training data furthermore we observed diverse prediction performances by machine learning models based on the same big data set especially those 7 traditional learning models the underlying reason was probably the inherently different structures of those learning models for 7 traditional machine learning models dt and crt showed better performance compared to other 5 learning models especially dt with the highest precision recall f1 score and weighted fl score for predicting all 6 levels of water quality this was because dt is a nonlinear classifier which is optimal for dealing with the nonlinear classification problems including water quality prediction kim 2016 another reason was that dt does not require information on the prior probability of the feature distribution and had better adaptability to sample imbalance issues liu et al 2010 imbalanced data sets can also have significant impact on the performance of lr and lda models brown and mues 2012 reed and wu 2013 which is confirmed in our result as a class of new learning models aims to improve over traditional models ensemble learning models have been demonstrated to have better performance over many traditional learning models zhou 2015 this is mostly because these ensemble learning models are optimized based on some traditional learning models whilst retaining their advantages zhou 2015 therefore rf crtf and dcf presented excellent prediction performance compared to all traditional learning models except for dt dcf had the best performance for predicting all 6 levels of water quality compared to other 9 machine learning models in this study on the one hand as a new kind of deep forest dcf was an ensemble of the ensemble which could further decrease the generalization error zhou and feng 2018 on the other hand dcf has a hierarchical structure which plays a key role in improving performance by increasing the final voting accuracy zhou and feng 2018 moreover dcf has the advantage of dealing with data of all sizes due to dt and rf were selected to construct dcf in this study and the better water quality prediction performance of dt and rf also were observed in this study the three learning models especially dcf identified as the best learning model for water quality monitoring also could be potentially applied in the field of other environmental medium quality monitoring such as air quality monitoring similar to water quality monitoring the air quality also depended on the air quality parameters i e nitrogen oxide ozone and particulate matter additionally these air parameters also monitored by environmental protection agencies around the world which means the dig data of air quality was also available however dcf was unable to learn directly from the big raw data which need do some work of feature engineering the relationship between different water parameters for learning models especially ensemble models and final prediction performance were identified for the first time in this study with the decrease in the number of water parameters used the prediction performance of dt rf and dcf begun to deteriorate however the prediction performance for all 6 levels of water qualities of dt rf dcf trained by do codmn and nh3 n still was acceptable similarly the better water quality performance of the 2 traditional models artificial neural networks and genetic programming trained by the same 3 fundamental water parameters were also observed muttil and chau 2007 however in our study the performance of dt rf and dcf trained by these 3 water parameters were significantly better compared with this pervious study due to bigger amount of training data moreover the prediction performance for all 6 levels of water qualities of dt rf and dcf trained by any 2 of 4 water parameters were also evaluated in our study although the decreased performance of the 3 models trained by 2 water parameters were identified compared with that trained by 3 and 4 water parameters the codmn and nh3 n still could be selected for future timely water quality prediction based on the relative higher weighed f1 score consequently do codmn and nh3 n as key water parameters identified and validated by dt rf and dcf would be recommend for future water quality prediction and monitor using learning models which would significantly reduce prediction costs in other words the government administration could precisely issue water quality warning using least water parameters and spare more time for environmental experts to improve the water quality the 2 parameter scenario using codmn and nh3 n could be applicated in cases such as the need for rapid prediction of water quality although corresponding performance was lower than that trained by do codmn and nh3 n combined for examples when facing the cases of sudden environmental pollution the quickest possible prediction of the level of surface water contamination using the minimum possible measurements would be highly desirable nevertheless future works are still needed to focus on identifying and validating other potential key water parameters among the available water parameters i e water temperature total phosphorus metal ion toxic organic chemicals as well as identifying the key air parameters for air quality monitoring using different learning models based on this work 5 conclusions the main aims of this study were to evaluate whether available big data could improve the performance of machine learning models in the prediction of surface water quality and identify the best models and key water parameters serving timely and precisely water quality monitoring here the surface water quality prediction performance of 7 traditional and 3 ensemble learning models using big data were comprehensively compared and the potential key water parameters were also identified and validated through this study the major conclusions are follows 1 available big data could improve the performance of both traditional and ensemble learning models in the prediction of surface water quality 2 compared to other 7 learning models dt rf and dcf presented significantly better prediction performance for all six levels of water quality defined by chinese government 3 two key water parameter sets do codmn and nh3 n codmn and nh3 n were identified and validated by learning models to sum up the three learning models with two key water parameter sets identified and validated by big data in this study should be recommended for future surface water quality monitoring because they not only could provide timely and precisely environmental warning but also could further

the models but also dependent on the parameters in data set chosen for training the learning models moreover the key water parameters should also be identified by the learning models in order to further reduce prediction costs and improve prediction efficiency here we endeavored for the first time to compare the water quality prediction performance of 10 learning models 7 traditional and 3 ensemble models using big data 33 612 observations from the major rivers and lakes in china from 2012 to 2018 based on the precision recall f1 score weighted f1 score and explore the potential key

benefiting various works of our life for examples face recognition technologies based on deep learning models are able to track the criminals precisely and timely lecun et al 2015 other sought after applications including artificial intelligence driving technologies in some complex driving environment aeberhard et al 2015 and global mega size medical data analyses using deep learning esteva et al 2019 gurovich et al 2019 in the environmental monitoring fields especially hydrological monitoring ai technologies have also started to be successfully applied using various learning algorithm models for instance the real time radar derived rainfall forecasting were proposed by some machine learning models yu et al 2017 moreover an intelligent water regimen monitoring system were recently tried to established to solve measuring accuracy problem and increase working efficiency fan et al 2018 additionally application of ai dealing with large scale environmental medium monitoring data have also gradually gained interests with regards to hydrological monitoring a great number of environmental monitoring data have traditionally been collected worldwide by individual environmental departments and agencies dunbabin and marques 2012 consolidating these huge environmental data sets would provide valuable resources for training machine learning models in order to identify patterns and markers for understanding for instance water quality moreover although the environmental quality water or air could be classified and reported real time by monitoring reference parameters according to the guidelines of environmental classification they are unable to provide early warning of future environmental pollution importantly machine learning models could be trained starting with a few key environmental quality parameters and the final environmental outcomes using the current archived data then to predict the future outcomes after inputting new parameters this suggested the possibility of using some environmental parameters to quickly predict future environmental consequences ghahramani 2015 it is of great significance to be able to provide accurate environmental early warning with minimum possible environmental parameters yet maximum prediction precision of the learning models despite the great potential of machine learning in the area of environmental medium quality monitoring the relevant research and applications of machine learning models are still lacking surface water is a kind of non renewable resource and of great significance in our human daily life however with the development of the economy surface water quality continues to be compromised and deteriorate posing threats to human health especially in some developing countries vörösmarty et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 as the largest developing country in the world in the last decades many parts of china were facing have induced severe water stress as well as the health risks water contamination after ever growing demands and misuse of surface water resources over the last decades sun et al 2016 therefore it is particularly crucial to monitor and predict surface water quality precisely and timely indeed a few machine learning methods were created and implemented to monitor and predict water quality after reviewing related previous studies in the past decade table s1 however most of them used relatively small training and validation datasets more importantly these traditional models demonstrated relatively low prediction precision and unbalanced prediction abilities for different levels of water qualities for example the highest prediction precision of water quality for succeeding weeks in the above avila et al study was 92 00 for green acceptable 0 00 for amber alert and 95 00 for red action predicted from bayesian network model avila et al 2018 indeed the prediction precision for green acceptable and red action action may be satisfied for the governors however the prediction precision for amber alert is not acceptable for environmental protection agencies they often should take some measures as soon as possible when facing the alert of water quality deterioration undoubtedly the water quality prediction precision of these older models would be limited them for application in the future and the precision of those learning models may be limited by few training data in these previous studies nevertheless the relation between surface water quality performance and the amount of training data was still largely unknown recently an emerging class of machine learning models named ensemble methods were proposed which consisted of multiple learning algorithms zhang and ma 2012 importantly they often had better predictive performance than any one of the constituent learning algorithms alone qiu et al 2017 singh et al 2013 random forest rf as one of the most famous representatives have been proposed and applied in various areas belgiu and drăguţ 2016 boulesteix et al 2012 notably gcforest a decision tree ensemble method proposed by zhou et al in 2017 also attracted much attention zhou and feng 2018 it was a new deep learning model called deep cascade forest dcf by cascading several random forests using the idea of ensemble learning compared to the earlier ensemble and deep learning models dcf could adaptively determine the number of cascade levels and set the model complexity automatically enabling excellent performance even on small scale data zhou and feng 2018 so users could control training costs according to the available computational resources furthermore the performance of dcf is quite robust in hyper parameter settings when changing different data from different domains however the other deep learning models such as deep neural networks was deeply required tuning network structure and hyper parameters zhou and feng 2018 surprisingly there was limited information on the prediction of surface water quality using dcf moreover there was little information about the comparative analysis of the prediction performance from different ensemble learning models based on the same big data notably the water quality prediction performance of machine learning models may be not only dependent on the models per se and the amount of data set but also dependent on the water parameters in data set chosen for training the learning models it is vital to identify some key water parameters for training learning models without significantly reducing predictive performance because they could remarkably increase prediction efficiency and decrease the prediction cost however few studies have evaluated the surface water quality prediction performance of learning models to identify key water parameters from big training data sets singh and kaur 2017 the aims of this study were to i based on the precision recall f1 score and weighted f1 socre investigate whether the big data could improve the water prediction

water quality monitoring stations in 10 national large rivers and lakes from china national environmental monitoring centre from 2012 to 2018 http www mee gov cn hjzl shj dbszdczb the 10 national large rivers and lakes were distribution throughout the country including songhua river liaohe river haihe river huaihe river yellow river yangtze river pearl river taihu lake chaohu lake and dianchi lake and their geographical locations were presented in fig s1 four selected water quality parameters including chemical oxygen demand codmn dissolved oxygen do ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and hydrogen ion concentration ph and their overall water quality classification results were adopted directly from china national environmental monitoring centre and were used for constructing water quality prediction models based on the national environmental quality standards for surface water of china gb3838 2002 water quality was classified into five levels i ii iii iv and v additionally the water quality worse than v was also considered in this study hence here the level of water quality was classified and predicted using six levels from good to bad i ii iii iv v and worse than v wv respectively here 33 612 water quality data sets were obtained after data clean remove the data sets with missing values additionally in order to keep the all water parameters with the same degree of influence on final outcomes here we performed z score standardization on the water parameters barboza et al 2017 fig 1 2 2 seven traditional machine learning models in order to evaluate whether big training data could improve the water quality prediction performance by machine learning models the seven traditional machine learning models dt nb lr lda crt knn and svm with higher frequency in previous studies table s1 were selected in this study fig 1 and the detailed information about these seven older models were presented in the supporting information 2 3 three ensemble learning models for the comprehensive comparing the water quality prediction performance between traditional and ensemble learning models and identifying the potential models for further water quality monitoring rf crf and dcf as the representatives of ensemble learning models were selected in this study fig 1 2 3 1 rf rf is an ensemble learning model based on dt as base models breiman 2001 in the rf each tree uses a sample obtained by bootstrap gislason et al 2006 each node has d features of the base dt it randomly selects d features from the feature set which has d features as a new subset and then selects the optimal feature by g i n i value from the subset for split strobl et al 2008 by voting all the decision trees output we get the final output fig s2 where c k i is the predictive class of t r e e i after using majority voting class c k is the final predictive class of x the process of majority voting is as follows if there are k classes to be predicted the prediction of x by t r e e i in rf is represented as an k dimensional vector c i h i 1 h i 2 h i k where h i k 0 1 indicates the predictive probability of class c k of t r e e i briefly the voting method used by rf with t decision trees is defined as 1 y c k if i 1 t h i k 0 5 k 1 k i 1 t h i k reject otherwise the prediction will take effect only if more than half of the trees predict the same result and here 10 dt were selected in the forest 2 3 2 crf similar to rf the crf was an ensemble learning model based on crt as base models breiman 2001 and the 10 crt were selected to construct the crf in this study 2 3 3 dcf as a highly ensemble method deep cascade forest can be constructed by many random forests zhou and feng 2018 in each layer of deep cascade forest we can also add other traditional machine learning models and ensemble models to improve the ensemble performance each level of cascade receives feature information processed by its preceding level and outputs its processing result to the next level in addition to reduce the risk of over fitting all the base models in each layer use k fold cross validation when a layer is trained we achieved the predictive accuracy on a validation set the model will continue to construct the next layer until the accuracy can be no longer improved consequently the number of cascade levels can be automatically determined by the termination of the training process the adaptive adjustment of model complexity enables deep cascade forest to be applied to training data sets of different scales here we increased the diversity at full stretch firstly we selected two different types of forests 2 rf and 2 crf to encourage the diversity in each layer of dcf fig s3 so that the input feature perturbation and data sample perturbation could be increased next we voted to combine all the individual output together and generated the final output that increases the data sample perturbation based on different amounts of input features we also increased the input feature perturbation since the input of next layer came from the output of previous layer and the raw features in our model we definitely increased the output representation perturbation in all dcf is a decision tree ensemble model with high diversity and low generalization error 2 4 model operation and evaluation 2 4 1 model operation the all 10 model operation was carried out in python

validation was used to estimate the prediction performance of models fig 1 the advantage of this method is that all observations are used for both training and validation 3 results 3 1 the training data used in this study after reviewing the all clean data 33 612 observations the level i i ii iii iv v wv were 7 25 2438 observations 39 49 13 272 observations 26 17 8797 observations 16 28 5472 observations 4 42 1487 observations and 6 38 2146 observations fig 2 a notably the water quality including level iv v wv was 33 47 9105 observations which means the water quality prediction for chinese larger rivers was necessary for the four fundamental water parameters ph 7 68 0 54 do 8 10 2 60 mg l codmn 4 26 3 35 mg l and nh3 n 0 56 1 42 mg l ranged from 5 79 to 10 19 0 02 to 123 0 to 110 80 and 0 to 30 1 respectively fig 2b each water parameter was standardized using their respective z score prior to inputting training models in order to keep all the 4 parameters possessing the same degree of influence on final water quality prediction fig 2c 3 2 water quality prediction performances after increasing training data in order to evaluate whether better water quality perdition performances of each learning models could be observed after increasing training data here the data sets were firstly divided into two parts including training 80 26890 observations and validation sets 20 6722 observations fig 1 the training set was further divided into subsets of different proportions 1 269 observations 10 2689 observations 50 13455 observations and 100 26890 observations for training these 10 models subsequently fig 3 a while the validation data set remained the same the main functions and hyper parameters of these 10 models were presented in table 1 in the training process the traditional learning models including knn and svm presented better performance after increasing training data whereas water quality prediction performance of 3 ensemble learning models did not show any improvement with increasing training data in the training process based on precision recall and f1 socre fig s4 and table s2 importantly here the all learning models expect for lda showed improved prediction performance in the validation process after inputting more training data fig s5 and table s3 notably the highest improvement for prediction performance of all 9 models were through inputting 10 of the training data compared with the performance of these 9 models trained by 1 training data based on the weighted f1 socre fig 3b and the improving prediction performance of these 9 models were form 1 87 lr to 22 76 knn interestingly the higher average improvement of water quality prediction were identified in 6 traditional models 11 62 compared to that in 3 ensemble models 7 30 fig 3b although the prediction performance of these 9 models were still increasing there were limited improvement of these 9 models after further increasing training data from 10 to 100 fig 3b 3 3 the ensemble learning models presented better water quality prediction performance compared to traditional learning models in order to identify the potential suitable models for future water quality monitoring we further compared the performance of 7 traditional learning models with 3 ensemble learning models fig 1 we used four water fundamental parameters based on the maximum training data 80 26890 observations because most learning models had better performance after increasing training data the main functions and hyper parameters of these 10 models were kept the same with the above experiments table 1 the performance of 10 learning models for all 6 levels of water qualities in both training and validation processes were evaluated by precision recall f1 score and weighted f1 score fig 1 additionally a stratified 5 fold cross validation was also used to estimate the stability of prediction performance of models figs 1 and 4 a 3 3 1 the training process in the training process amongst 7 traditional models the dt and crt had the highest precision 1 00 0 00 for dt 1 00 0 00 for crt fig 4b and table s4 recall 1 00 0 00 for dt 1 00 0 00 for crt fig 4b and table s4 and f1 score 1 00 0 00 for dt 1 00 0 00 for crt fig 4b and table s4 in predicting water quality at all 6 levels however the lr lda svm nb and knn presented unbalanced abilities for predicting 6 levels of water qualities fig 4b and table s4 specially the lr and lda failed to predict the level v and level i water respectively the svm presented significantly worse performance for predicting the level i water than other 5 levels water p 0 001 whereas nb presented significantly worse performance for predicting the level v water than other 5 levels water p 0 001 interestingly knn also showed significant reduction in performance for predicting the level i and level v water than other 3 levels water p 0 001 next the 3 ensemble learning models including rf crf and dcf were also trained by the same data sets overall all 3 ensemble learning models in this study showed satisfactory performance for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities in training processes fig 4b and table s4 similar to dt and crt crf showed better performance than rf and dcf did in the processes of training which were with the highest precision 1 00 0 00 recall 1 00 0 00 and f1 score 1 00 0 00 for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities notably all 3 ensemble learning models showed balanced and comprehensive abilities for predicting 6 levels of water qualities fig 4b and table s4 which were better than the above lr lda svm nb and knn importantly the rf crtf and dcf showed significantly better performance for predicting level i and level v water than lr lda svm nb and knn p 0 001 additionally no more significant difference was observed between rf and dcf predicted all 6 levels of water qualities during the training process 3 3 2 the validating process after training the 20 additional data were selected for validation the 10 learning models figs 1 and 4a compared to other 6 tradition learning models dt still showed remarkably better performance for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities water in validation process p 0 001 fig 4c and table s5 the lr and lda presented unacceptable performance for predicting level i and level v water in validating process fig 4c and table s5 notably the performance of crt presented different trend between the processes of validating and training although it had the best performance during training process crt presented significant worse performance for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities water in validating process p 0 001 fig 4c and table s5 additionally the performance of other 3 learning models including svm nb and knn in validating process was similar with their did in training process which also showed significantly worse performance for predicting the level i and level v water than other 3 levels water p 0 01 fig 4c and table s5 compared to these 7 traditional learning models the all 3 ensemble learning models in our study shown excellent performance for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities in validating processes fig 4c and table s5 among the 3 ensemble learning models rf and dcf presented better performance than crf for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities especially in predicting the level v and level wv water p 0 001 notably rf crf and dcf presented significantly better predicting performance of all 6 levels of water qualities compared to all 7 traditional learning models except that dt selected in this study more importantly rf and dcf showed satisfactorily performance for predicting the level v and level wv water which had highest precision 0 98 0 01 level v 0 99 0 00 level wv for rf 0 99 0 01 level v 0 99 0 01 level wv for dcf recall 0 99 0 01 level v 0 99 0 01 level wv for rf 0 99 0 01 level v 0 99 0 01 level wv for dcf and f1 score 0 98 0 01 level v 0 99 0 01 level wv for rf 0 99 0 01 level v 0 99 0 01 level wv for dcf finally based on the weighted f1 score the dcf and crf shown the significant better water quality prediction performance compared to these 7 traditional learning models except dt fig 5 3 4 the water quality prediction performance of dt rf and dcf based on different water quality parameters sets for identify the key water parameters here the dt rf and dcf would be selected again for training and validating the prediction these water qualities based on any 3 and 2 of the 4 water quality parameters fig 1 due to dt rf and dcf has best performance for prediction all 6 levels of water qualities based on 4 water quality parameters 3 4 1 any 3 of 4 water quality parameters generally the performance of dt rf and dcf for predicting all 6 levels of water qualities in both training fig s6 and table s6 and validating processes fig 6 and table s7 based on any 3 water parameters were worse than that dcf trained by 4 water quality parameters nevertheless the dt rf and dcf trained by do codmn and nh3 n still presented acceptable performance for prediction water qualities which shown highest precision recall and f1 score for predicting the water qualities form level i to v in validating processes fig 6 and table s7 although the performance for predicting the level wv water from these 3 models trained by do codmn and nh3 n was not significant higher than the 3 models trained by the other 3 parameter sets ph codmn nh3 n ph do nh3 n ph do codmn the lowest precision recall f1 score from dt were 0 83 0 02 0 85 0 07 0 84 0 03 fig 6d and table s7 respectively which were also accepted in water quality prediction additionally the weighted f1 score of dt rf and dcf trained by do codmn and nh3 n were 0 97 0 00 0 98 0 01 0 98 0 01 and significant higher p 0 001 that of these 3 models trained by the other 3 water parameter sets fig 7 3 4 2 any 2 of 4 water quality parameters dt rf and dcf were then selected for training fig s7 and table s8 and validation of the prediction these water qualities using any 2 of the 4 water quality parameters similarly the performance of dt rf and dcf based on any 2 water parameters in validation process were worse than that these 3 models trained by 3 or 4 water quality parameters fig 8 and table s9 the performance of dt rf and dcf trained by codmn and nh3 n was significantly better than that these 3 models trained by other 5 training sets ph do ph codmn ph nh3 n do codmn and do nh3 n and their weighted f1 score was 0 86 0 01 0 86 0 01 0 88 0 01 fig 9 4 discussion it has been well established that surface water quality depends on multiple water conditions such as codmn do nh3 n ph temperature total phosphorus metal ion and other toxic chemicals simeonov et al 2003 meanwhile chlorophyll α and e coli were also chosen as direct biological indicators for evaluating the water quality avila et al 2018 park et al 2015 because they can characterize the ecological state and illness risks of the tested water however they were simplistic and couldn t provide the direct factors deteriorated water quality therefore a set of fundamental water parameters including the above codmn do nh3 n ph water temperature total phosphorus metal ion and serval toxic organic chemicals have been recommended for assessing water quality by several national government departments alabaster and lloyd 2013 for example 24 fundamental water parameters were selected for classifying the water quality according to the guideline of national environmental quality standards of surface water of china gb3838 2002 meeprc 2002 based on the results of all 24 basic water parameters it could classify water quality accurately and quickly by some lookup procedures however it is costly and time consuming to measure all 24 water parameters on all kinds of surface water due to the various experimental requirements therefore it is more practical to measure key parameters indicative of water quality rather than completely following the guideline of gb3838 2002 to understand water quality hence it is of great significance to predict water quality with fewer but more indicative fundamental water parameters increasing number of studies have tried to predict the surface water quality by machine learning models using a few water parameters and of the reported water quality di et al 2019 tan et al 2012 however the relatively poor prediction precision of these learning models still limits their further application it is most likely that these learning models used relatively small amount of training data because recent studies have shown that better performance could be achieved with more data used during the training process in each of the learning models chen et al 2016 zhu et al 2012 in our study improving performance of water quality prediction using 9 different learning models were observed after increasing training data notably the greatest improvement of prediction performance in these models were identified when the training data increased from 1 269 observations to 10 2689 observations interestingly the minimum training subset 1 were similar to the amount of training data set used in many previous studies and the prediction performance of 10 models based the minimum training subset in this study were similar with the results in these previous studies walley and džeroski 1996 consequently the surface water quality prediction performance of learning models could be improved significantly by increasing the training data furthermore we observed diverse prediction performances by machine learning models based on the same big data set especially those 7 traditional learning models the underlying reason was probably the inherently different structures of those learning models for 7 traditional machine learning models dt and crt showed better performance compared to other 5 learning models especially dt with the highest precision recall f1 score and weighted fl score for predicting all 6 levels of water quality this was because dt is a nonlinear classifier which is optimal for dealing with the nonlinear classification problems including water quality prediction kim 2016 another reason was that dt does not require information on the prior probability of the feature distribution and had better adaptability to sample imbalance issues liu et al 2010 imbalanced data sets can also have significant impact on the performance of lr and lda models brown and mues 2012 reed and wu 2013 which is confirmed in our result as a class of new learning models aims to improve over traditional models ensemble learning models have been demonstrated to have better performance over many traditional learning models zhou 2015 this is mostly because these ensemble learning models are optimized based on some traditional learning models whilst retaining their advantages zhou 2015 therefore rf crtf and dcf presented excellent prediction performance compared to all traditional learning models except for dt dcf had the best performance for predicting all 6 levels of water quality compared to other 9 machine learning models in this study on the one hand as a new kind of deep forest dcf was an ensemble of the ensemble which could further decrease the generalization error zhou and feng 2018 on the other hand dcf has a hierarchical structure which plays a key role in improving performance by increasing the final voting accuracy zhou and feng 2018 moreover dcf has the advantage of dealing with data of all sizes due to dt and rf were selected to construct dcf in this study and the better water quality prediction performance of dt and rf also were observed in this study the three learning models especially dcf identified as the best learning model for water quality monitoring also could be potentially applied in the field of other environmental medium quality monitoring such as air quality monitoring similar to water quality monitoring the air quality also depended on the air quality parameters i e nitrogen oxide ozone and particulate matter additionally these air parameters also monitored by environmental protection agencies around the world which means the dig data of air quality was also available however dcf was unable to learn directly from the big raw data which need do some work of feature engineering the relationship between different water parameters for learning models especially ensemble models and final prediction performance were identified for the first time in this study with the decrease in the number of water parameters used the prediction performance of dt rf and dcf begun to deteriorate however the prediction performance for all 6 levels of water qualities of dt rf dcf trained by do codmn and nh3 n still was acceptable similarly the better water quality performance of the 2 traditional models artificial neural networks and genetic programming trained by the same 3 fundamental water parameters were also observed muttil and chau 2007 however in our study the performance of dt rf and dcf trained by these 3 water parameters were significantly better compared with this pervious study due to bigger amount of training data moreover the prediction performance for all 6 levels of water qualities of dt rf and dcf trained by any 2 of 4 water parameters were also evaluated in our study although the decreased performance of the 3 models trained by 2 water parameters were identified compared with that trained by 3 and 4 water parameters the codmn and nh3 n still could be selected for future timely water quality prediction based on the relative higher weighed f1 score consequently do codmn and nh3 n as key water parameters identified and validated by dt rf and dcf would be recommend for future water quality prediction and monitor using learning models which would significantly reduce prediction costs in other words the government administration could precisely issue water quality warning using least water parameters and spare more time for environmental experts to improve the water quality the 2 parameter scenario using codmn and nh3 n could be applicated in cases such as the need for rapid prediction of water quality although corresponding performance was lower than that trained by do codmn and nh3 n combined for examples when facing the cases of sudden environmental pollution the quickest possible prediction of the level of surface water contamination using the minimum possible measurements would be highly desirable nevertheless future works are still needed to focus on identifying and validating other potential key water parameters among the available water parameters i e water temperature total phosphorus metal ion toxic organic chemicals as well as identifying the key air parameters for air quality monitoring using different learning models based on this work 5 conclusions the main aims of this study were to evaluate whether available big data could improve the performance of machine learning models in the prediction of surface water quality and identify the best models and key water parameters serving timely and precisely water quality monitoring here the surface water quality prediction performance of 7 traditional and 3 ensemble learning models using big data were comprehensively compared and the potential key water parameters were also identified and validated through this study the major conclusions are follows 1 available big data could improve the performance of both traditional and ensemble learning models in the prediction of surface water quality 2 compared to other 7 learning models dt rf and dcf presented significantly better prediction performance for all six levels of water quality defined by chinese government 3 two key water parameter sets do codmn and nh3 n codmn and nh3 n were identified and validated by learning models to sum up the three learning models with two key water parameter sets identified and validated by big data in this study should be recommended for future surface water quality monitoring because they not only could provide timely and precisely environmental warning but also could further increase prediction efficiency and decrease the prediction cost in future surface water quality monitoring declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18222,this paper discusses the abiotic and biotic processes in the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide generated from microbial sulfate reduction by ferric feiii hydr oxides feooh granules in the sediments of polluted urban waters granular ferric hydroxide gfh β feooh and granular ferric oxide gfo α feooh dosed in the organic and sulfate rich sediments had 180 and 19 higher sulfide removal capacities than those used for the purely abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide respectively the enhancement was attributable to the involvement of the biotic pathways besides the abiotic pathways mainly sulfide oxidation the feooh granules stimulated the microbial reduction of surface feiii by iron reducing bacteria e g desulfovibrio and carnobacterium and increased the microbial sulfate reduction by 24 30 under an organic rich condition likely due to the enhanced organic fermentation the microbial iron reduction significantly enhanced the removal of the formed biogenic hydrogen sulfide through increasing sulfide precipitation because it remarkably promoted the release of fe2 ions from the granule surface likely due to the involvement of siderophores as ligands this biotic pathway led to the formation of amorphous fes s as a major sulfur product 56 81 instead of elemental sulfur the enhancement in the sulfide control performance was much more pronounced when the poorly ordered gfh was used because of the faster fe2 release compared to the highly ordered gfo the abiotic and biotic mechanisms elucidated in this study provide insights into the iron sulfur chemistry in the sediments of various polluted waters e g storm drains urban rivers and estuary where the manually dosed and naturally occurring feiii hydr oxides control biogenic hydrogen sulfide graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban waters sediment ferric hydr oxides hydrogen sulfide microbial iron reduction feii release 1 introduction biogenic hydrogen sulfide which is mainly generated from microbial sulfate reduction by sulfate reducing bacteria srb is a worldwide concern in numerous aquatic systems such as sanitary sewers aquaculture ponds marine and polluted urban rivers kim et al 2012 liu et al 2015b shi et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 in many densely populated urban areas such as the pearl river delta and the yangtze river delta in china the discharges of untreated or partially treated wastewater rich in organics polluted the urban waters e g storm drains rivers and lakes and remarkably boost the formation of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments sun et al 2013 hydrogen sulfide is toxic to aquatic organisms and its emission induces serious odor nuisance and human health hazards jiang et al 2015 besides hydrogen sulfide has been considered as a key pollutant in black and odorous waters in china sheng et al 2013 sun et al 2019b therefore the effective control of the biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of the polluted urban waters is necessary our recent studies developed a granular iron cycling technology for the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediment systems sun et al 2013 2014 2019b yin et al 2018 it has been demonstrated that ferric feiii hydr oxides feooh in granular form such as ferric hydroxide gfh granular ferric oxide gfo and rusted iron granules containing feooh persistently retain in the sediments and effectively control the biogenic hydrogen sulfide slowly generated with nearly no iron loss into the water phase at near neutral ph more importantly the used feooh granules can be regenerated via oxidizing the surface feii products using oxygen or chemical oxidants e g persulfate and hydrogen peroxide and then are reused repeatedly the granular iron cycling technology is a long lasting renewable and chemical saving alternative for the control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of polluted waters compared to the addition of soluble chemicals e g biocides metal precipitants and chemical oxidants that are commonly used to control sulfide in wastewater sewage networks and treatment plants ganigue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 khanal and huang 2003 zhang et al 2008 the soluble chemicals dosed in sediments can be easily released into the surrounding aqueous environments before they exert an effect which leads to the chemical waste and imposes a threat to the surrounding aquatic ecosystems lahav et al 2004 yin et al 2018 the mechanisms of the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by feooh granules in the organic and sulfate containing sediments are less clear but could be hypothesized and built from a few aspects reported in the relevant literature the abiotic interactions of dissolved sulfide with feooh in powder form have been recognized to be a surface mediated process that proceeds through a sequence of reactions including the formation of sulfide surface complexes electron transfer release of oxidized products and feii detachment peiffer et al 1992 yao and millero 1996 the ultimate products of the reactions include elemental sulfur s0 thiosulfate sulfate iron sulfide precipitates fes s surface associated feii and fe2 ions however the speciation and distribution of the products are significantly influenced by several factors such as ph and characteristics of minerals i e crystal structure and particle size poulton et al 2004 therefore the quantitative investigations are needed to elucidate the abiotic reactions of dissolved sulfide with feooh granules furthermore biotic pathways may also contribute to the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by the feooh granules in the organic and sulfate containing sediments the feooh granules influenced the generation of hydrogen sulfide by srb feooh powders and feiii salts have been reported to inhibit the biological sulfate reduction in marine sediments and anoxic paddy soils achtnich et al 1995 king 1990 lovley and phillips 1987 rusted iron granules containing feooh dosed in the river sediments in which limited organics were derived from the polluted river water doc 50 mg c l also partially suppressed the microbial sulfate reduction sun et al 2019b the inhibition was attributable to the competitive consumption of the limited organics by iron reducing bacteria irb which utilize electron donors e g glucose and acetate to reduce solid phase feiii into feii lloyd et al 2003 on the other hand zhang et al 2013 reported that the biological sulfate reduction in an acidogenic sulfate reducing reactor at an influent cod of 2500 mg l increased after addition of fe2o3 powders these inconsistent findings suggest that further investigation is needed to elucidate the roles of the biotic processes in the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by the feooh granules in the organic and sulfate containing sediments this study thus aims to reveal the involvement of abiotic and biotic processes in the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by feooh granules including gfh and gfo in the organic and sulfate containing sediments of polluted urban waters column tests and batch tests were conducted and the sulfur and iron containing products were quantified the effect on the microbial sulfate reduction was evaluated besides the compositions of the microbial community were also analyzed using 16s rrna gene sequencing to evaluate the influences of the feooh granules on the microbial community in the sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials gfh geh 101 and gfo bayeroxide e33 were provided by geh wasserchemie germany and severn trent

ray diffraction spectrometer pw 1830 philips france with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å over the 2θ range of 10 80 2 4 statistical analysis the data were expressed as mean standard deviation of at least two parallel experiments the statistical analysis was conducted using one way analysis of variance anova on origin 8 0 software and the significance was determined at 95 confidence limits p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by feooh granules and product speciation column tests were conducted to evaluate the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by feooh granules in the sediments rich in organics and sulfate and to quantify the corresponding sulfur and iron products generated with respect to the hydrogen sulfide control performance the addition of gfh and gfo in the sediments decreased the sulfide concentrations in the effluents to less than 0 5 mg s l which was about 99 lower than those in the control without the addition of feooh granule fig 1 a according to the accumulative amounts of hydrogen sulfide removed from the sediments in comparison to the control the sulfide removal capacities of gfh and gfo were calculated to be 84 2 mg s g gfh and 41 6 mg s g gfo respectively the good sulfide control performances observed can be partially attributable to the conversion of biogenic hydrogen sulfide generated from the microbial sulfate reduction into s0 and fes s by feooh granules through oxidation and precipitation poulton et al 2004 sun et al 2014 the sulfur and iron products formed during the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by gfh and gfo were quantified after the addition of gfh and gfo and before their exhaustion the concentrations of s0 and avs thiosulfate and feii in the effluents of the two reactors with the addition of feooh granules were negligible less than 0 2 mg l data are not shown meanwhile the significant accumulation of solid products including s0 avs and feii in the sediments was observed fig 1b the solid sulfur containing products detected in the sediments dosed with gfh and gfo were mainly avs 56 81 and s0 19 44 and the sums of two species showed good mass balances 97 and 93 respectively with the amounts of total sulfide removed meanwhile a large amount of feii was also generated the detected avs should be associated with feii in the form of fes s which is often formed from the sulfide precipitation by ferrous ions fe2 peiffer et al 1992 poulton et al 2004 the xrd patterns of solid products collected after the exhaustion of feooh granules see fig s2a show that there was no ordered sulfide crystal detected the captioned peaks indicate the presence of sodium chloride halite confirming that the avs was mainly amorphous fes s the high proportions of fes s 81 and 56 for gfh and gfo respectively in the total sulfur containing products suggest that the sulfide precipitation was an important process for the in situ control of biogenic sulfide in the organic and sulfate rich sediments the contributions of abiotic sulfide oxidation and precipitation to the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide will be further elucidated in section 3 3 it is also worth noticing that the recorded sulfide removal capacities of gfh and gfo were 180 84 2 30 30 and 19 41 6 35 35 higher than those used for the purely abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide 30 mg s g gfh and 35 mg s g gfo respectively sun et al 2013 2014 the results suggest that the in situ control of biogenic sulfide by feooh granules in the organic and sulfate rich sediments may be achieved via other mechanisms besides the purely abiotic conversion of sulfide for instance microbial iron reduction may also play an important role the microbial iron reduction which often naturally occurs in the organic rich marine and freshwater sediments containing feiii hydr oxides and organics thamdrup 2000 can competitively consume organics and inhibit the microbial sulfate reduction interestingly the sulfate consumption was enhanced by about 30 after the addition of gfh p 0 05 and it increased by around 24 after the addition of gfo p 0 05 compared to the control fig s3a meanwhile the significant enhanced doc consumption was also observed after the addition of gfh about 24 and gfo about 18 p 0 05 fig s3b likely due to the additional consumption of doc by the microbial iron reduction sun et al 2019b these findings suggest that the feooh granules did not inhibit the microbial sulfate reduction in the organic and sulfate rich sediments and the microbial iron reduction stimulated by the feooh addition may enhance the sulfide control performance via other pathways which will be discussed in section 3 4 3 2 influences of feooh granules on the microbial community compositions the changes in the composition of the microbial community in the sediments before the feooh addition 20 d after gfh addition and 10 d after gfo addition were evaluated to reveal the influences of feooh granules on the biochemical processes in the sediments the rarefaction analysis shows that the sequencing depth of the sediment samples collected can well reflect the diversity of the microbial community fig s4a as shown in fig s4b the addition of feooh granules caused the remarkable shifts in the microbial community compositions at the genus level relative abundance 0 5 fig 2 shows the changes in seven representative genera which were related to the microbial reduction of sulfate and feiii before the feooh addition two obligate sulfate reducing genera desulfotignum and desulfofustis three facultative sulfate iron reducing genera desulfobacter desulfovibrio and dethiosulfatibacter and two fermentative iron reducing genera carnobacterium and proteiniclasticum were identified in the sediments lovley 1997 warren et al 2005 gfh and gfo did not change the relative abundances of obligate sulfate iron reducing genera while they increased the relative abundances of facultative sulfate iron reducing genera by up to 95 106 meanwhile the relative abundances of fermentative iron reducing genera also increased by about 100 the growth of the facultative sulfate iron reducing genera was probably responsible for the enhanced sulfate reduction and doc consumption in the feooh laden sediments the results also ascertain that the addition of gfh and gfo stimulated the microbial iron reduction which may alter the pathways of biogenic hydrogen sulfide removal in the sediments further investigation can be conducted using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays targeting the functional genes to reveal the detailed influences of feooh granules on the bio chemical processes in the sediments 3 3 abiotic processes in the control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide to elucidate the contributions of abiotic processes i e sulfide oxidation and precipitation to the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the organic and sulfate containing sediments by feooh granules batch tests were conducted to evaluate the reactions of feooh granules with dissolved sulfide under various conditions in the absence of organics and bacteria fig 3 a shows that after 24 h reaction at ph 8 0 and a gfh dosage of 2 5 g l all dissolved sulfide 19 8 0 6 mg l was converted to s0 up to 88 and avs about 10 with negligible formation of thiosulfate and sulfate over 90 of s0 and avs detected here accumulated on the gfh surface while the rest were suspended in the bulk solution meanwhile all feii products generated were in the solid form on the gfh surface according to the low crystallinity shown by the xrd patterns fig s2a the measured avs should be associated with feii in the form of amorphous iron sulfide fes s at a low gfh dosage of 0 5 g l and in the presence of excessive dissolved sulfide the major sulfur containing product was still s0 82 in addition at three phs tested 7 2 8 0 and 9 0 the product speciation remained similar and s0 comprised 85 92 of sulfur containing products fig 3b when 2 5 g l gfo was used at phs 7 2 9 0 about 91 of the sulfur containing product was s0 fig 3c the mechanisms of abiotic transformation of dissolved sulfide by the feooh granules can be proposed based on the results of product speciation above and the scheme of dissolved sulfide reacting with feiii hydro oxide powders available in the literature peiffer et al 1992 poulton et al 2004 dissolved sulfide is oxidized into s0 by the surface feiii with concurrent formation of surface associated feii feiio eq 1 which is then released into the bulk solution in the form of fe2 ions eq 2 and reacted with additional dissolved sulfide to form fes s eq 3 a portion of s0 and fes s is released and suspended in the bulk solution and the rest is deposited on the granule surface and their gradual accumulation resulted in the ultimate exhaustion of feooh granules the accumulation of solid products on the granule surface was observed during the repeated use of the feooh granules fig s5 1 hs aq 2 f e iii ooh s h 2 fe ii o s s s 0 2 h 2 o 2 2 h f e ii o s fe aq 2 h 2 o 3 fe aq 2 hs aq fes s h aq the molar ratios of feii to s0 measured during the abiotic reactions of dissolved sulfide with gfh and gfo under various test conditions fig 3 were 1 93 2 14 which were very close to the stoichiometric ratio of reaction 1 eq 1 the results confirm that almost all feii was derived from the oxidation of sulfide into s0 by feiii it is worth noticing that the corresponding molar ratios of feii to s0 measured during the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by gfh and gfo in the sediments were 5 0 and 4 6 respectively fig 1b since the average molar ratios of feii to s0 during the abiotic reduction of feooh by sulfide was 2 0 the corresponding amount of feii derived from the abiotic sulfide removal can be calculated from the amount of s0 the differences suggest that only about 40 of the measured feii was derived from the abiotic reduction of feiii by sulfide and the rest should be derived from the microbial iron reduction by irb in the sediments in addition the high proportions of s0 82 92 in the sulfur containing products demonstrate that the sulfide oxidation was the dominant pathway for the abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide by gfh and gfo the limited contribution of sulfide precipitation was mainly due to the slow feii release from the sulfide reduced granule surface which was found to be 5 15 times slower than that of the sulfide oxidation poulton et al 2004 the minor feii release less than 0 8 mg l from the surface of feooh granules which reacted with 20 mg s l sulfide for 1 d was also observed in a 3 d batch trial fig s6 the slow feii release from the sulfide reduced surface limited the availability of feii for the sulfide precipitation and resulted in the lower sulfide removal capacities of feooh granules used for the abiotic sulfide removal compared to those used in the sediments the feii in the form of fes s only comprised 3 2 9 8 of total feii generated during the abiotic sulfide removal and most of feii was still associated with granule surface fig 3d while the corresponding proportions were 26 9 gfo and 87 5 gfh when feooh granules were used in the sediments fig 1b we can thus hypothesize that certain biotic processes such as microbial iron reduction may also be involved in the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments and promote the feii release from the feooh granule surface which significantly increased the availability of the generated feii for the sulfide precipitation 3 4 biotic processes in the control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide 3 4 1 influences of feooh granules on sulfate reduction batch tests in the presence of organics and the sediments were performed to elucidate the influences of feooh granules on the biochemical processes including microbial sulfate reduction and organic consumption in the sediments as shown in fig s7 the adsorption of sulfate by gfo and gfh was less than 4 within 3 d and the adsorption of doc was also less than 6 indicating that the adsorption of sulfate and doc by the feooh granules was insignificant fig 4 a shows that at an initial doc concentration of 120 mg c l and in presence of sediments gfo increased the sulfate reduction by up to 20 in the first two days p 0 05 but it did not change the sulfate reduction in day 3 compared to that without any feooh granules meanwhile gfo increased the doc consumption by 25 540 p 0 05 when gfh was dosed the sulfate reduction increased by 17 97 in the first two days but decreased by about 16 in days 3 and 4 p 0 05 compared to that without any feooh granules see fig 4b the doc consumption was persistently increased by gfh 29 490 p 0 05 the enhancement in the doc consumption by the feooh granules dosed in the sediments was due to the consumption of organics by the microbial iron reduction our previous study found that the microbial iron reduction was stimulated by the addition of rusted iron granules containing feooh in the river sediments sun et al 2019b the significant growth of irb e g desulfovibrio dethiosulfatibacter and carnobacterium in the feooh dosed sediments fig 2 and the remarkable doc consumption in the presence of feooh granules alone fig 4 well demonstrated the involvement of the microbial iron reduction these irb are capable of oxidizing organics using feooh as electron acceptors under anaerobiotic conditions taking acetate as an example eq 4 lovley 1997 warren et al 2005 4 8 f e iii ooh s ch 3 cooh 2 h 2 o irb 8 fe ii o s 8 h 2 o 2 co 2 the influences of the feooh granules on the microbial sulfate reduction may be dependent on the availability of doc although irb competed with srb for doc the iron reduction required 87 5 fewer electron donors compared to the sulfate reduction eq 5 in the first two days of batch tests the doc concentrations were still higher than 30 mg c l fig 4a and b under such an organic rich condition the microbial iron reduction hardly influenced the microbial sulfate reduction instead it could increase the microbial sulfate reduction via enhancing the fermentation of organics the fermentative irb identified in the sediments carnobacterium and proteiniclasticum are capable of fermenting complex organics e g long chain fatty acids into low molecular weight organics and hydrogen eq 6 lovley 1997 which are more thermodynamically favorable electron donors for srb liamleam and annachhatre 2007 lovley 1987 feooh powders e g ferrihydrite have been found to accelerate the organic fermentation and promoted the microbial sulfate reduction in subsurface systems kwon et al 2014 and in the sulfate reducing reactors zhang et al 2013 liu et al 2015a these findings can well explain the enhanced sulfate reduction observed in the column tests of this study 5 ch 3 cooh so 4 2 srb hs 2 co 2 oh h 2 o 6 fermentable substrate n f e iii ooh s n h firb n fe ii o s n h 2 o fermentation products e g acetate however under an organic limited condition the competitive consumption of limited organics by the microbial iron reduction can inhibit the microbial sulfate reduction in days 3 and 4 of the batch tests the doc concentration decreased to a low level below 20 mg c l see fig 4b when the initial doc concentration decreased to 20 mg c l the sulfate reduction was persistently inhibited by gfh 25 90 fig 4c inhibition of sulfate reduction by amorphous ferric hydroxide powders under doc limited conditions in the marine sediments has also been reported king 1990 lovley and phillips 1987 our recent study also demonstrated that the addition of rusted iron granules containing feooh partially suppressed the sulfate reduction in the river sediments where limited organics were derived from the polluted river water doc 50 mg c l sun et al 2019b the influence of feooh granules on the microbial sulfate reduction was different from that of ferric salts which have been widely used for the sulfide control in the sewer systems zhang et al 2008 the addition of ferric salts was found to suppress the srb activity in the biofilm and sediments of sewers due to the toxicity of fe3 the elevated orp values and the deposition of fes s on the srb cells zhang et al 2009 cao et al 2019 therefore the influences of the feiii hydr oxide granules powders on the microbial sulfate reduction was dependent on the availability when they were used in various systems in the organic rich systems such as the sediments of the heavily polluted urban waters and the acidogenic sulfate reducing reactors liu et al 2015a sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 the microbial sulfate reduction would be increased while it would be inhibited in the organic limited systems such as the sediments of slightly polluted rivers lakes and marine king 1990 lovley and phillips 1987 sun et al 2019b 3 4 2 enhanced sulfide precipitation by fe2 derived from the microbial iron reduction besides influencing the microbial sulfate reduction the microbial iron reduction stimulated by the feooh granules may also change the pathways of biogenic hydrogen sulfide removal in the sediments the results of batch tests show that avs comprised 66 and 78 of the sulfur containing products in the reactors dosed with gfo and gfh respectively fig 5 a 5c which ascertains the substantial contribution of sulfide precipitation to the removal of biogenic hydrogen sulfide correspondingly the percentages of the feii associated with avs in the form of fes s in the total feii were 30 and 45 respectively fig 5c the findings suggest that most of the feii for the sulfide precipitation should be derived from the microbial iron reduction because only small portions 3 2 9 8 of feii generated from the abiotic reduction of feooh granules by dissolved sulfide served for the sulfide precipitation fig 3d the significant microbial iron reduction and feii release were responsible for the enhanced sulfide precipitation during the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments according to the feii s0 molar ratios of 6 6 7 9 during the control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by gfo and gfh fig 5a and b the percentages of the feii derived from the microbial iron reduction in the total feii generated were estimated to be 69 74 furthermore the significant formation of feii products and release of dissolved feii up to 10 mg l in the batch reactors with organics and feooh granules but without sulfate fig 5d also demonstrated that the microbial iron reduction can contribute a large amount of dissolved feii to the sulfide precipitation it is also worth noticing that the feii release during the microbial reduction of feooh granules was 13 16 times higher compared to that during the abiotic reduction of feooh granules by dissolved sulfide fig s6 the promoted feii release during the microbial reduction of feooh granules was likely due to the different mechanisms from the abiotic feiii reduction by dissolved sulfide feooh can be reduced by irb via both direct and indirect pathways the indirect pathways are often more important because the direct iron reduction is remarkably limited by the reactive surface sites in close contact with irb cells taillefert et al 2007 the indirect reduction of feooh can be mediated by the electron carriers e g c type cytochromes shi et al 2016 and small molecule ligands called siderophores e g desferrioxamine which contain chelating moieties e g amino and carbonyl groups lovley 1997 the siderophores enhance the microbial iron reduction and the release of fe2 ions via converting solid feiii into soluble feiii siderophore complexes eq 7 and eq 8 andrews et al 2003 miethke 2013 as shown in fig s8 soluble microbial by products were identified in the eem fluorescence spectra of the pore water of sediments dosed with gfh and gfo chen et al 2003 and some may serve as siderophores fig s9 further shows that peaks at 1242 1396 1542 and 1643 cm 1 were identified in the ftir spectra which corresponded to n h bending c n stretching vibrations co stretching in coo n h bending and cooh stretching respectively wang et al 2012 these functional groups which are typical chelating moieties with high affinity towards feiii indicate the possible presence of the siderophores in the sediment pore water 7 siderophore aq fe iii ooh s 3 h siderophore fe aq iii 2 h 2 o 8 siderophore fe aq iii organic irb fe aq 2 siderophore aq the siderophore mediated indirect reduction was expected to be one major pathway of the microbial reduction of feooh granules the involvement of siderophores could significantly increase the availability of feooh granules for the irb cells and accelerate the feii release which enhanced the removal of the formed biogenic hydrogen sulfide through precipitation compared to that during the abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide furthermore the faster feii release could also liberate more reactive feiii surface sites for the subsequent reactions and increase the overall sulfide removal capacities of feooh granules the superior sulfide control performance of gfh to gfo can be due to the faster microbial iron reduction and feii release fig 5d the microbial reduction and dissolution of highly ordered feooh e g goethite and hematite are found to be much slower than those of poorly ordered ones e g ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite taillefert et al 2007 compared to gfo gfh had a larger surface area table s1 and lower crystallinity which are known to enhance the feii release from iron hydr oxides cornell and schwertmann 2003 this well explains the better sulfide control performances of regenerated feooh granules because the feooh formed from the oxidation of feii products by oxygen during the regeneration are mainly the amorphous crystals sun et al 2013 2019b these findings also suggest that the poorly ordered feooh granules powders e g lepidocrocite and β feooh instead of ordered crystals should be used for the in situ hydrogen sulfide control in the sediments of the polluted waters such as storm drains and black and odorous urban rivers 3 5 proposed abiotic and biotic mechanisms of the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide based on the findings obtained above the abiotic and biotic mechanisms of the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the organic and sulfate containing sediments by the feooh granules can be proposed as shown in fig 6 the feooh granules dosed in the sediments stimulate the microbial iron reduction by irb e g desulfovibrio and carnobacterium which may be mediated by the siderophores ligands present in the sediments the microbial iron reduction increases the microbial sulfate reduction under an organic rich condition likely due to the enhanced organic fermentation while it competitively consumes organics and partially inhibits the microbial sulfate reduction under an organic limited condition the biogenic hydrogen sulfide once it is generated by srb is removed through abiotic oxidation of sulfide into s0 19 44 by surface feiii and also through precipitation as amorphous fes s 56 81 by fe2 ions derived from the microbial iron reduction and abiotic iron oxidation by sulfide between the two pathways to produce fe2 the microbial iron reduction that remarkably promotes the feii release is much more important the accumulation of s0 and fes s on the granule surface ultimately leads to the exhaustion of feooh granules the involvement of the microbial iron reduction significantly promotes the sulfide precipitation and results in the superior performance of feooh granules during the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments compared to those used for the purely abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide 4 conclusions the experimental results demonstrated that gfh and gfo dosed in organic and sulfate containing sediments had 180 and 19 higher sulfide removal capacities than those used for the purely abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide respectively due to the involvement of the biotic pathways besides the abiotic pathways mainly sulfide oxidation the feooh granules stimulated the microbial reduction of surface feiii by irb and increased the microbial sulfate reduction under an organic rich condition but suppressed the microbial sulfate reduction under an organic limited condition more importantly the microbial iron reduction significantly promoted the release of fe2 ions from the granule surface likely due to the involvement of siderophores ligands and it remarkably enhanced the precipitation of the biogenic hydrogen sulfide leading to the formation of fes s as a major product 56 81 the enhancement was much more pronounced when the poorly ordered gfh was used because of the faster fe2 release compared to the highly ordered gfo the findings suggest that the less ordered feooh minerals instead of the ordered ones should be used for the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediment systems the abiotic and biotic mechanisms elucidated here provide the fundamentals for the sulfide control practice in the engineered and partially engineered aquatic systems aquaculture ponds and polluted urban waters where feiii hydr oxides and ferric salts to be converted to feiii hydr oxides via hydrolysis are often dosed to control biogenic hydrogen sulfide generated in the sediments the mechanisms also provide insights into the iron sulfur chemistry in the natural aquatic systems such as lakes estuary and marine where the naturally occurring iron oxides regulate the biogenic hydrogen sulfide generated in the sediments partially or completely declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18222,this paper discusses the abiotic and biotic processes in the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide generated from microbial sulfate reduction by ferric feiii hydr oxides feooh granules in the sediments of polluted urban waters granular ferric hydroxide gfh β feooh and granular ferric oxide gfo α feooh dosed in the organic and sulfate rich sediments had 180 and 19 higher sulfide removal capacities than those used for the purely abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide respectively the enhancement was attributable to the involvement of the biotic pathways besides the abiotic pathways mainly sulfide oxidation the feooh granules stimulated the microbial reduction of surface feiii by iron reducing bacteria e g desulfovibrio and carnobacterium and increased the microbial sulfate reduction by 24 30 under an organic rich condition likely due to the enhanced organic fermentation the microbial iron reduction significantly enhanced the removal of the formed biogenic hydrogen sulfide through increasing sulfide precipitation because it remarkably promoted the release of fe2 ions from the granule surface likely due to the involvement of siderophores as ligands this biotic pathway led to the formation of amorphous fes s as a major sulfur product 56 81 instead of elemental sulfur the enhancement in the sulfide control performance was much more pronounced when the poorly ordered gfh was used because of the faster fe2 release compared to the highly ordered gfo the abiotic and biotic mechanisms elucidated in this study provide insights into the iron sulfur chemistry in

abstract image 1 keywords urban waters sediment ferric hydr oxides hydrogen sulfide microbial iron reduction feii release 1 introduction biogenic hydrogen sulfide which is mainly generated from microbial sulfate reduction by sulfate reducing bacteria srb is a worldwide concern in numerous aquatic systems such as sanitary sewers aquaculture ponds marine and polluted urban rivers kim et al 2012 liu et al 2015b shi et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 in many densely populated urban areas such as the pearl river delta and the yangtze river delta in china the discharges of untreated or partially treated wastewater rich in organics polluted the urban waters e g storm drains rivers and lakes and remarkably boost the formation of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments sun et al 2013 hydrogen sulfide is toxic to aquatic organisms and its emission induces serious odor nuisance and human health hazards jiang et al 2015 besides hydrogen sulfide has been considered as a key pollutant in black and odorous waters in china sheng et al 2013 sun et al 2019b therefore the effective control of the biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of the polluted urban waters is necessary our recent studies developed a granular iron cycling technology for the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediment systems sun et al 2013 2014 2019b yin et al 2018 it has been demonstrated that ferric feiii hydr oxides feooh in granular form such as ferric hydroxide gfh granular ferric oxide gfo and rusted iron granules containing feooh persistently retain in the sediments and effectively control the biogenic hydrogen sulfide slowly generated with nearly no iron loss into the water phase at near neutral ph more importantly the used feooh granules can be regenerated via oxidizing the surface feii products using oxygen or chemical oxidants e g persulfate and hydrogen peroxide and then are reused repeatedly the granular iron cycling technology is a long lasting renewable and chemical saving alternative for the control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of polluted waters compared to the addition of soluble chemicals e g biocides metal precipitants and chemical oxidants that are commonly used to control sulfide in wastewater sewage networks and treatment plants ganigue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 khanal and huang 2003 zhang et al 2008 the soluble chemicals dosed in sediments can be easily released into the surrounding aqueous environments before they exert an effect which leads to the chemical waste and imposes a threat to the surrounding aquatic ecosystems lahav et al 2004 yin et al 2018 the mechanisms of the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by feooh granules in the organic and sulfate containing sediments are less clear but could be hypothesized and built from a few aspects reported in the relevant literature the abiotic interactions of dissolved sulfide with feooh in powder form have been recognized to be a surface mediated process that proceeds through a sequence of reactions including the formation of sulfide surface complexes electron transfer release of oxidized products and feii detachment peiffer et al 1992 yao and millero 1996 the ultimate products of the reactions include elemental sulfur s0 thiosulfate sulfate iron sulfide precipitates fes s surface associated feii and fe2 ions however the speciation and distribution of the products are significantly influenced by several factors such as ph and characteristics of minerals i e crystal structure and particle size poulton et al 2004 therefore the quantitative investigations are needed to elucidate the abiotic reactions of dissolved sulfide with feooh granules furthermore biotic pathways may also contribute to the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by the feooh granules in the organic and sulfate containing sediments the feooh granules influenced the generation of hydrogen sulfide by srb feooh powders and feiii salts have been reported to inhibit the biological sulfate reduction in marine sediments and anoxic paddy soils achtnich et al 1995 king 1990 lovley and phillips 1987 rusted iron granules containing feooh dosed in the river sediments in which limited organics were derived from the polluted river water doc 50 mg c l also partially suppressed the microbial sulfate reduction sun et al 2019b the inhibition was attributable to the competitive consumption of the limited organics by iron reducing bacteria irb which utilize electron donors e g glucose and acetate to reduce solid phase feiii into feii lloyd et al 2003 on the other hand zhang et al 2013 reported that the biological sulfate reduction in an acidogenic sulfate reducing reactor at an influent cod of 2500 mg l increased after addition of fe2o3 powders these inconsistent findings suggest that further investigation is needed to elucidate the roles of the biotic processes in the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by the feooh granules in the organic and sulfate containing sediments this study thus aims to reveal the involvement of abiotic and biotic processes in the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by feooh granules including gfh and gfo in the organic and sulfate containing sediments of polluted urban waters column tests and batch tests were conducted and the sulfur and iron containing products were quantified the effect on the microbial sulfate reduction was evaluated besides the compositions of the microbial community were also analyzed using 16s rrna gene sequencing to evaluate the influences

elucidate the contributions of abiotic processes to the in situ control of biogenic sulfide by feooh granules batch tests without the presence of sediments were performed headspace free in 310 ml glass bottles wheaton usa sealed with teflon lined caps dissolved sulfide solutions 19 8 0 6 mg s l buffered with 50 mm tris at ph 7 2 9 0 were added into the bottles with feooh granules at dosages of 0 5 and 2 5 g l and end over end agitated by a heavy duty rotator environmental express inc usa at 12 rpm and 22 1 c in the dark tris has no significant influence on the reactions of iron hydr oxides with dissolved sulfide sun et al 2014 after 24 h reaction followed by 15 min settling the supernatants were carefully collected without disturbing the settled solids and then subjected to the analysis of dissolved and suspended sulfur and feii products the solid samples were collected to measure avs s0 and feii accumulated on the granule surface also supplementary tests were conducted using the feooh granules after 24 h reaction with dissolved sulfide the release of fe2 ions from the sulfide reduced feooh granules at ph 8 0 was determined 2 2 4 evaluation of biotic processes in the control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide and product quantification to evaluate the contributions of biotic mechanisms to the in situ control of biogenic sulfide batch tests were also conducted 2 5 g l feooh granules and the synthetic sewage ph 8 0 sulfate 300 mg s l and doc 120 mg c l were added in 310 ml reaction bottles with 20 ml sediment samples which were rinsed with deoxygenated nacl solution 0 85 w w to remove pre existing sulfide and sulfate the synthetic sewage was prepared using the diluted synthetic seawater table s3 the reactors were end over end mixed at 12 rpm the solution and solid samples were collected at predetermined intervals to analyze doc sulfur and feii species aliquots of the solution samples were collected to characterize the compositions of dissolved organic matter in the sediment pore water text s1 tests at an initial doc concentration of 20 mg c l were also performed to evaluate the influences of feooh granules on the microbial sulfate reduction at different organic availability also supplementary tests in the absence of feooh granules or sulfate were performed for comparison 2 3 analytical methods ph was monitored with a multi parameter meter multi 3420 wtw germany solution samples were withdrawn with syringes and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for the measurement of dissolved species determination of doc was performed using a total organic carbon analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu japan sulfate and thiosulfate were determined using an ion chromatograph 100 dionex usa equipped with a conductivity detector and an ionpac as9 hc analytical column dissolved sulfide was measured by the methylene blue method apha 2005 dissolved feii was measured by the phenanthroline method apha 2005 the extraction and analysis of solid feii avs and s0 that were suspended in the solution and accumulated on the feooh granule surface are presented in text s2 x ray diffraction xrd patterns of products formed on the feooh granules and sediments were obtained an x ray diffraction spectrometer pw 1830 philips france with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å over the 2θ range of 10 80 2 4 statistical analysis the data were expressed as mean standard deviation of at least two parallel experiments the statistical analysis was conducted using one way analysis of variance anova on origin 8 0 software and the significance was determined at 95 confidence limits p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by feooh granules and product speciation column tests were conducted to evaluate the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by feooh granules in the sediments rich in organics and sulfate and to quantify the corresponding sulfur and iron products generated with respect to the hydrogen sulfide control performance the addition of gfh and gfo in the sediments decreased the sulfide concentrations in the effluents to less than 0 5 mg s l which was about 99 lower than those in the control without the addition of feooh granule fig 1 a according to the accumulative amounts of hydrogen sulfide removed from the sediments in comparison to the control the sulfide removal capacities of gfh and gfo were calculated to be 84 2 mg s g gfh and 41 6 mg s g gfo respectively the good sulfide control performances observed can be partially attributable to the conversion of biogenic hydrogen sulfide generated from the microbial sulfate reduction into s0 and fes s by feooh granules through oxidation and precipitation poulton et al 2004 sun et al 2014 the sulfur and iron products formed during the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by gfh and gfo were quantified after the addition of gfh and gfo and before their exhaustion the concentrations of s0 and avs thiosulfate and feii in the effluents of the two reactors with the addition of feooh granules were negligible less than 0 2 mg l data are not shown meanwhile the significant accumulation of solid products including s0 avs and feii in the sediments was observed fig 1b the solid sulfur containing products detected in the sediments dosed with gfh and gfo were mainly avs 56 81 and s0 19 44 and the sums of two species showed good mass balances 97 and 93 respectively with the amounts of total sulfide removed meanwhile a large amount of feii was also generated the detected avs should be associated with feii in the form of fes s which is often formed from the sulfide precipitation by ferrous ions fe2 peiffer et al 1992 poulton et al 2004 the xrd patterns of solid products collected after the exhaustion of feooh granules see fig s2a show that there was no ordered sulfide crystal detected the captioned peaks indicate the presence of sodium chloride halite confirming that the avs was mainly amorphous fes s the high proportions of fes s 81 and 56 for gfh and gfo respectively in the total sulfur containing products suggest that the sulfide precipitation was an important process for the in situ control of biogenic sulfide in the organic and sulfate rich sediments the contributions of abiotic sulfide oxidation and precipitation to the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide will be further elucidated in section 3 3 it is also worth noticing that the recorded sulfide removal capacities of gfh and gfo were 180 84 2 30 30 and 19 41 6 35 35 higher than those used for the purely abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide 30 mg s g gfh and 35 mg s g gfo respectively sun et al 2013 2014 the results suggest that the in situ control of biogenic sulfide by feooh granules in the organic and sulfate rich sediments may be achieved via other mechanisms besides the purely abiotic conversion of sulfide for instance microbial iron reduction may also play an important role the microbial iron reduction which often naturally occurs in the organic rich marine and freshwater sediments containing feiii hydr oxides and organics thamdrup 2000 can competitively consume organics and inhibit the microbial sulfate reduction interestingly the sulfate consumption was enhanced by about 30 after the addition of gfh p 0 05 and it increased by around 24 after the addition of gfo p 0 05 compared to the control fig s3a meanwhile the significant enhanced doc consumption was also observed after the addition of gfh about 24 and gfo about 18 p 0 05 fig s3b likely due to the additional consumption of doc by the microbial iron reduction sun et al 2019b these findings suggest that the feooh granules did not inhibit the microbial sulfate reduction in the organic and sulfate rich sediments and the microbial iron reduction stimulated by the feooh addition may enhance the sulfide control performance via other pathways which will be discussed in section 3 4 3 2 influences of feooh granules on the microbial community compositions the changes in the composition of the microbial community in the sediments before the feooh addition 20 d after gfh addition and 10 d after gfo addition were evaluated to reveal the influences of feooh granules on the biochemical processes in the sediments the rarefaction analysis shows that the sequencing depth of the sediment samples collected can well reflect the diversity of the microbial community fig s4a as shown in fig s4b the addition of feooh granules caused the remarkable shifts in the microbial community compositions at the genus level relative abundance 0 5 fig 2 shows the changes in seven representative genera which were related to the microbial reduction of sulfate and feiii before the feooh addition two obligate sulfate reducing genera desulfotignum and desulfofustis three facultative sulfate iron reducing genera desulfobacter desulfovibrio and dethiosulfatibacter and two fermentative iron reducing genera carnobacterium and proteiniclasticum were identified in the sediments lovley 1997 warren et al 2005 gfh and gfo did not change the relative abundances of obligate sulfate iron reducing genera while they increased the relative abundances of facultative sulfate iron reducing genera by up to 95 106 meanwhile the relative abundances of fermentative iron reducing genera also increased by about 100 the growth of the facultative sulfate iron reducing genera was probably responsible for the enhanced sulfate reduction and doc consumption in the feooh laden sediments the results also ascertain that the addition of gfh and gfo stimulated the microbial iron reduction which may alter the pathways of biogenic hydrogen sulfide removal in the sediments further investigation can be conducted using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays targeting the functional genes to reveal the detailed influences of feooh granules on the bio chemical processes in the sediments 3 3 abiotic processes in the control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide to elucidate the contributions of abiotic processes i e sulfide oxidation and precipitation to the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the organic and sulfate containing sediments by feooh granules batch tests were conducted to evaluate the reactions of feooh granules with dissolved sulfide under various conditions in the absence of organics and bacteria fig 3 a shows that after 24 h reaction at ph 8 0 and a gfh dosage of 2 5 g l all dissolved sulfide 19 8 0 6 mg l was converted to s0 up to 88 and avs about 10 with negligible formation of thiosulfate and sulfate over 90 of s0 and avs detected here accumulated on the gfh surface while the rest were suspended in the bulk solution meanwhile all feii products generated were in the solid form on the gfh surface according to the low crystallinity shown by the xrd patterns fig s2a the measured avs should be associated with feii in the form of amorphous iron sulfide fes s at a low gfh dosage of 0 5 g l and in the presence of excessive dissolved sulfide the major sulfur containing product was still s0 82 in addition at three phs tested 7 2 8 0 and 9 0 the product speciation remained similar and s0 comprised 85 92 of sulfur containing products fig 3b when 2 5 g l gfo was used at phs 7 2 9 0 about 91 of the sulfur containing product was s0 fig 3c the mechanisms of abiotic transformation of dissolved sulfide by the feooh granules can be proposed based on the results of product speciation above and the scheme of dissolved sulfide reacting with feiii hydro oxide powders available in the literature peiffer et al 1992 poulton et al 2004 dissolved sulfide is oxidized into s0 by the surface feiii with concurrent formation of surface associated feii feiio eq 1 which is then released into the bulk solution in the form of fe2 ions eq 2 and reacted with additional dissolved sulfide to form fes s eq 3 a portion of s0 and fes s is released and suspended in the bulk solution and the rest is deposited on the granule surface and their gradual accumulation resulted in the ultimate exhaustion of feooh granules the accumulation of solid products on the granule surface was observed during the repeated use of the feooh granules fig s5 1 hs aq 2 f e iii ooh s h 2 fe ii o s s s 0 2 h 2 o 2 2 h f e ii o s fe aq 2 h 2 o 3 fe aq 2 hs aq fes s h aq the molar ratios of feii to s0 measured during the abiotic reactions of dissolved sulfide with gfh and gfo under various test conditions fig 3 were 1 93 2 14 which were very close to the stoichiometric ratio of reaction 1 eq 1 the results confirm that almost all feii was derived from the oxidation of sulfide into s0 by feiii it is worth noticing that the corresponding molar ratios of feii to s0 measured during the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by gfh and gfo in the sediments were 5 0 and 4 6 respectively fig 1b since the average molar ratios of feii to s0 during the abiotic reduction of feooh by sulfide was 2 0 the corresponding amount of feii derived from the abiotic sulfide removal can be calculated from the amount of s0 the differences suggest that only about 40 of the measured feii was derived from the abiotic reduction of feiii by sulfide and the rest should be derived from the microbial iron reduction by irb in the sediments in addition the high proportions of s0 82 92 in the sulfur containing products demonstrate that the sulfide oxidation was the dominant pathway for the abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide by gfh and gfo the limited contribution of sulfide precipitation was mainly due to the slow feii release from the sulfide reduced granule surface which was found to be 5 15 times slower than that of the sulfide oxidation poulton et al 2004 the minor feii release less than 0 8 mg l from the surface of feooh granules which reacted with 20 mg s l sulfide for 1 d was also observed in a 3 d batch trial fig s6 the slow feii release from the sulfide reduced surface limited the availability of feii for the sulfide precipitation and resulted in the lower sulfide removal capacities of feooh granules used for the abiotic sulfide removal compared to those used in the sediments the feii in the form of fes s only comprised 3 2 9 8 of total feii generated during the abiotic sulfide removal and most of feii was still associated with granule surface fig 3d while the corresponding proportions were 26 9 gfo and 87 5 gfh when feooh granules were used in the sediments fig 1b we can thus hypothesize that certain biotic processes such as microbial iron reduction may also be involved in the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments and promote the feii release from the feooh granule surface which significantly increased the availability of the generated feii for the sulfide precipitation 3 4 biotic processes in the control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide 3 4 1 influences of feooh granules on sulfate reduction batch tests in the presence of organics and the sediments were performed to elucidate the influences of feooh granules on the biochemical processes including microbial sulfate reduction and organic consumption in the sediments as shown in fig s7 the adsorption of sulfate by gfo and gfh was less than 4 within 3 d and the adsorption of doc was also less than 6 indicating that the adsorption of sulfate and doc by the feooh granules was insignificant fig 4 a shows that at an initial doc concentration of 120 mg c l and in presence of sediments gfo increased the sulfate reduction by up to 20 in the first two days p 0 05 but it did not change the sulfate reduction in day 3 compared to that without any feooh granules meanwhile gfo increased the doc consumption by 25 540 p 0 05 when gfh was dosed the sulfate reduction increased by 17 97 in the first two days but decreased by about 16 in days 3 and 4 p 0 05 compared to that without any feooh granules see fig 4b the doc consumption was persistently increased by gfh 29 490 p 0 05 the enhancement in the doc consumption by the feooh granules dosed in the sediments was due to the consumption of organics by the microbial iron reduction our previous study found that the microbial iron reduction was stimulated by the addition of rusted iron granules containing feooh in the river sediments sun et al 2019b the significant growth of irb e g desulfovibrio dethiosulfatibacter and carnobacterium in the feooh dosed sediments fig 2 and the remarkable doc consumption in the presence of feooh granules alone fig 4 well demonstrated the involvement of the microbial iron reduction these irb are capable of oxidizing organics using feooh as electron acceptors under anaerobiotic conditions taking acetate as an example eq 4 lovley 1997 warren et al 2005 4 8 f e iii ooh s ch 3 cooh 2 h 2 o irb 8 fe ii o s 8 h 2 o 2 co 2 the influences of the feooh granules on the microbial sulfate reduction may be dependent on the availability of doc although irb competed with srb for doc the iron reduction required 87 5 fewer electron donors compared to the sulfate reduction eq 5 in the first two days of batch tests the doc concentrations were still higher than 30 mg c l fig 4a and b under such an organic rich condition the microbial iron reduction hardly influenced the microbial sulfate reduction instead it could increase the microbial sulfate reduction via enhancing the fermentation of organics the fermentative irb identified in the sediments carnobacterium and proteiniclasticum are capable of fermenting complex organics e g long chain fatty acids into low molecular weight organics and hydrogen eq 6 lovley 1997 which are more thermodynamically favorable electron donors for srb liamleam and annachhatre 2007 lovley 1987 feooh powders e g ferrihydrite have been found to accelerate the organic fermentation and promoted the microbial sulfate reduction in subsurface systems kwon et al 2014 and in the sulfate reducing reactors zhang et al 2013 liu et al 2015a these findings can well explain the enhanced sulfate reduction observed in the column tests of this study 5 ch 3 cooh so 4 2 srb hs 2 co 2 oh h 2 o 6 fermentable substrate n f e iii ooh s n h firb n fe ii o s n h 2 o fermentation products e g acetate however under an organic limited condition the competitive consumption of limited organics by the microbial iron reduction can inhibit the microbial sulfate reduction in days 3 and 4 of the batch tests the doc concentration decreased to a low level below 20 mg c l see fig 4b when the initial doc concentration decreased to 20 mg c l the sulfate reduction was persistently inhibited by gfh 25 90 fig 4c inhibition of sulfate reduction by amorphous ferric hydroxide powders under doc limited conditions in the marine sediments has also been reported king 1990 lovley and phillips 1987 our recent study also demonstrated that the addition of rusted iron granules containing feooh partially suppressed the sulfate reduction in the river sediments where limited organics were derived from the polluted river water doc 50 mg c l sun et al 2019b the influence of feooh granules on the microbial sulfate reduction was different from that of ferric salts which have been widely used for the sulfide control in the sewer systems zhang et al 2008 the addition of ferric salts was found to suppress the srb activity in the biofilm and sediments of sewers due to the toxicity of fe3 the elevated orp values and the deposition of fes s on the srb cells zhang et al 2009 cao et al 2019 therefore the influences of the feiii hydr oxide granules powders on the microbial sulfate reduction was dependent on the availability when they were used in various systems in the organic rich systems such as the sediments of the heavily polluted urban waters and the acidogenic sulfate reducing reactors liu et al 2015a sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 the microbial sulfate reduction would be increased while it would be inhibited in the organic limited systems such as the sediments of slightly polluted rivers lakes and marine king 1990 lovley and phillips 1987 sun et al 2019b 3 4 2 enhanced sulfide precipitation by fe2 derived from the microbial iron reduction besides influencing the microbial sulfate reduction the microbial iron reduction stimulated by the feooh granules may also change the pathways of biogenic hydrogen sulfide removal in the sediments the results of batch tests show that avs comprised 66 and 78 of the sulfur containing products in the reactors dosed with gfo and gfh respectively fig 5 a 5c which ascertains the substantial contribution of sulfide precipitation to the removal of biogenic hydrogen sulfide correspondingly the percentages of the feii associated with avs in the form of fes s in the total feii were 30 and 45 respectively fig 5c the findings suggest that most of the feii for the sulfide precipitation should be derived from the microbial iron reduction because only small portions 3 2 9 8 of feii generated from the abiotic reduction of feooh granules by dissolved sulfide served for the sulfide precipitation fig 3d the significant microbial iron reduction and feii release were responsible for the enhanced sulfide precipitation during the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments according to the feii s0 molar ratios of 6 6 7 9 during the control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide by gfo and gfh fig 5a and b the percentages of the feii derived from the microbial iron reduction in the total feii generated were estimated to be 69 74 furthermore the significant formation of feii products and release of dissolved feii up to 10 mg l in the batch reactors with organics and feooh granules but without sulfate fig 5d also demonstrated that the microbial iron reduction can contribute a large amount of dissolved feii to the sulfide precipitation it is also worth noticing that the feii release during the microbial reduction of feooh granules was 13 16 times higher compared to that during the abiotic reduction of feooh granules by dissolved sulfide fig s6 the promoted feii release during the microbial reduction of feooh granules was likely due to the different mechanisms from the abiotic feiii reduction by dissolved sulfide feooh can be reduced by irb via both direct and indirect pathways the indirect pathways are often more important because the direct iron reduction is remarkably limited by the reactive surface sites in close contact with irb cells taillefert et al 2007 the indirect reduction of feooh can be mediated by the electron carriers e g c type cytochromes shi et al 2016 and small molecule ligands called siderophores e g desferrioxamine which contain chelating moieties e g amino and carbonyl groups lovley 1997 the siderophores enhance the microbial iron reduction and the release of fe2 ions via converting solid feiii into soluble feiii siderophore complexes eq 7 and eq 8 andrews et al 2003 miethke 2013 as shown in fig s8 soluble microbial by products were identified in the eem fluorescence spectra of the pore water of sediments dosed with gfh and gfo chen et al 2003 and some may serve as siderophores fig s9 further shows that peaks at 1242 1396 1542 and 1643 cm 1 were identified in the ftir spectra which corresponded to n h bending c n stretching vibrations co stretching in coo n h bending and cooh stretching respectively wang et al 2012 these functional groups which are typical chelating moieties with high affinity towards feiii indicate the possible presence of the siderophores in the sediment pore water 7 siderophore aq fe iii ooh s 3 h siderophore fe aq iii 2 h 2 o 8 siderophore fe aq iii organic irb fe aq 2 siderophore aq the siderophore mediated indirect reduction was expected to be one major pathway of the microbial reduction of feooh granules the involvement of siderophores could significantly increase the availability of feooh granules for the irb cells and accelerate the feii release which enhanced the removal of the formed biogenic hydrogen sulfide through precipitation compared to that during the abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide furthermore the faster feii release could also liberate more reactive feiii surface sites for the subsequent reactions and increase the overall sulfide removal capacities of feooh granules the superior sulfide control performance of gfh to gfo can be due to the faster microbial iron reduction and feii release fig 5d the microbial reduction and dissolution of highly ordered feooh e g goethite and hematite are found to be much slower than those of poorly ordered ones e g ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite taillefert et al 2007 compared to gfo gfh had a larger surface area table s1 and lower crystallinity which are known to enhance the feii release from iron hydr oxides cornell and schwertmann 2003 this well explains the better sulfide control performances of regenerated feooh granules because the feooh formed from the oxidation of feii products by oxygen during the regeneration are mainly the amorphous crystals sun et al 2013 2019b these findings also suggest that the poorly ordered feooh granules powders e g lepidocrocite and β feooh instead of ordered crystals should be used for the in situ hydrogen sulfide control in the sediments of the polluted waters such as storm drains and black and odorous urban rivers 3 5 proposed abiotic and biotic mechanisms of the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide based on the findings obtained above the abiotic and biotic mechanisms of the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the organic and sulfate containing sediments by the feooh granules can be proposed as shown in fig 6 the feooh granules dosed in the sediments stimulate the microbial iron reduction by irb e g desulfovibrio and carnobacterium which may be mediated by the siderophores ligands present in the sediments the microbial iron reduction increases the microbial sulfate reduction under an organic rich condition likely due to the enhanced organic fermentation while it competitively consumes organics and partially inhibits the microbial sulfate reduction under an organic limited condition the biogenic hydrogen sulfide once it is generated by srb is removed through abiotic oxidation of sulfide into s0 19 44 by surface feiii and also through precipitation as amorphous fes s 56 81 by fe2 ions derived from the microbial iron reduction and abiotic iron oxidation by sulfide between the two pathways to produce fe2 the microbial iron reduction that remarkably promotes the feii release is much more important the accumulation of s0 and fes s on the granule surface ultimately leads to the exhaustion of feooh granules the involvement of the microbial iron reduction significantly promotes the sulfide precipitation and results in the superior performance of feooh granules during the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediments compared to those used for the purely abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide 4 conclusions the experimental results demonstrated that gfh and gfo dosed in organic and sulfate containing sediments had 180 and 19 higher sulfide removal capacities than those used for the purely abiotic removal of dissolved sulfide respectively due to the involvement of the biotic pathways besides the abiotic pathways mainly sulfide oxidation the feooh granules stimulated the microbial reduction of surface feiii by irb and increased the microbial sulfate reduction under an organic rich condition but suppressed the microbial sulfate reduction under an organic limited condition more importantly the microbial iron reduction significantly promoted the release of fe2 ions from the granule surface likely due to the involvement of siderophores ligands and it remarkably enhanced the precipitation of the biogenic hydrogen sulfide leading to the formation of fes s as a major product 56 81 the enhancement was much more pronounced when the poorly ordered gfh was used because of the faster fe2 release compared to the highly ordered gfo the findings suggest that the less ordered feooh minerals instead of the ordered ones should be used for the in situ control of biogenic hydrogen sulfide in the sediment systems the abiotic and biotic mechanisms elucidated here provide the fundamentals for the sulfide control practice in the engineered and partially engineered aquatic systems aquaculture ponds and polluted urban waters where feiii hydr oxides and ferric salts to be converted to feiii hydr oxides via hydrolysis are often dosed to control biogenic hydrogen sulfide generated in the sediments the mechanisms also provide insights into the iron sulfur chemistry in the natural aquatic systems such as lakes estuary and marine where the naturally occurring iron oxides regulate the biogenic hydrogen sulfide generated in the sediments partially or completely declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

life cycle cost analysis biosolids organic fraction of municipal solid waste high solids anaerobic co digestion 1 introduction biosolids waste sewage sludge management is a major environmental and economic challenge for many municipal utilities according to seiple et al 2017 u s wastewater treatment plants wwtps generated approximately 13 84 megatonne mt of dry biosolids per year the amount of biosolids is increasing with increasing volumes of wastewater treated and more stringent effluent water quality regulations seiple et al 2017 land application composting incineration liquid anaerobic digestion l ad aerobic digestion and landfilling are the most commonly used biosolids management methods to recover energy and nutrients from biosolids thermal based technologies such as pyrolysis and gasification have been studied liu et al 2017 shaddel et al 2019 among these methods l ad provides both biosolids stabilization and energy recovery in the form of biogas as well as nutrient recovery however only 21 of biosolids is managed by l ad in the u s due to the limited installed anaerobic digester capacity seiple et al 2017 l ad implementation is economically challenging for many municipal utilities due to the low biogas production from biosolids high bioreactor heating requirements hanum et al 2019 and generation of sidestreams that can upset mainstream wastewater treatment processes when recycled back to the plant headworks yuan et al 2012 therefore many municipal utilities seek alternatives for sustainable biosolids management that include energy and nutrient recovery seiple et al 2017 recently hs ad systems which are operated at a high total solids ts content 15 40 have gained attention as an alternative to l ad ts 10 because of their smaller digester size lower materials handling requirements lower heating requirements and higher biogas methane content than l ad hinds et al 2016 lee et al 2019 in addition due to the low moisture content of the digestate hs ad produces very little sidestream wastewater leachate and the digestate can be readily utilized as a fertilizer or pelletized fuel yan et al 2015 li et al 2017 thus hs ad could be a viable solution for managing biosolids in small or medium scale wwtps where l ad is not feasible duan et al 2012 despite these advantages hs ad is susceptible to microbial inhibition caused by volatile fatty acids and ammonia accumulation due to the low moisture content in the digester high solids anaerobic co digestion hs acd of biosolids with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw is a promising option to overcome this problem by increasing the carbon to nitrogen c n ratio and buffering capacity co digestion can reduce inhibition leading to improved methane yields and volatile solids vs reduction kim

high organic carbon content making it a suitable co substrate for hs acd therefore hs acd could offer a sustainable waste management alternative for both biosolids and ofmsw several prior studies have investigated the potential for biogas production via hs acd of ofmsw with biosolids ahmadi pirlou et al 2017 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2016 however an assessment of the environmental and economic sustainability of hs acd as a biosolids and ofmsw management technology is lacking life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost analysis lcca are widely used tools to assess the environmental and

incineration land application and l ad lombardi et al 2017 lishan et al 2018 yoshida et al 2013 past studies have shown that l ad is a sustainable waste to energy option which reduced the environmental burden of biosolids management cartes et al 2018 dong et al 2014 li et al 2017 compared hs ad of biosolids with l ad and found that hs ad provided greater environmental and economic benefits than l ad a few studies have assessed the environmental impact of liquid anaerobic co digestion l acd of biosolids and fw and found that the co digestion had lower impacts than single substrate digestion becker et al 2017 edwards et al 2017a however no prior study has investigated the environmental and economic impacts of hs acd of biosolids and ofmsw compared with other waste management alternatives this study conducted a comparative lca and lcca to determine the environmental and economic impacts and benefits of hs acd of biosolids fw and yw with different waste compositions the lca and lcca results of hs acd were compared with four waste management options 1 incineration 2 composting 3 landfilling with landfill gas lfg use and 4 landfilling without lfg use variations in land acquisition costs on life cycle costs for each waste management option were evaluated using monte carlo simulation in this study hillsborough county florida in the u s was used as a case study area to obtain waste generation rates waste composition transportation distances climate and other factors in particular the high biosolids and ofmsw availability high local energy demands warm climate and lack of l ad infrastructure make this region an appealing location for hs acd implementation the result of this study can provide insights into tradeoffs of different waste management

eight wastewater treatment facilities with one aerobic digestion system for biosolids treatment fig 1 due to limited capacity for biosolids treatment approximately 66 of biosolids are sent to landfills ergas et al 2018 in 2015 the county produced approximately 2 million tonnes of municipal solids waste msw ofmsw including fw yw and paper cardboard accounted for 38 of msw fw and yw were approximately 0 13 and 0 14 million tonnes respectively while biosolids produced was about 0 05 million tonnes ergas et al 2018 100 of fw and 39 of yw are sent for incineration ergas et al 2018 even though these wastes reduce the efficiency of energy recovery from incineration due to their high moisture content and low calorific values per unit of weight zhang et al 2015 note that fw from residential sources was not considered because there is no separate collection system for residential fw in hillsborough county therefore only commercial fw from warehouses industry supermarkets and schools was considered in this study based on lee et al 2019 two waste compositions were considered fw yw bisolids 1 1 1 and 0 8 1 7 0 5 basis of total solids the fw yw biosolids 1 1 1 is referred to hereafter as the equal mass fraction composition the composition of fw yw bisolids 0 8 1 7 0 5 was based on the following criteria ergas et al 2018 i fw composition in the co substrate 0 4 volatile solids basis ii waste availability in hillsborough county based on quantities that went to landfill incineration or composting from the 2016 hillsborough county waste production and management flow and iii achieving a carbon to nitrogen ratio in the substrate close to the optimal ratio 20 30 the fw yw bisolids 0 8 1 7 0 5 is hereafter referred to as the hillsborough composition 2 2 scenario descriptions this study evaluated six waste management scenarios hs acd with two different waste compositions equal mass fraction and hillsborough landfill with lfg use landfill without lfg use composting and incineration all scenarios included the management system s construction and operation waste collection and waste transportation fig 2 as shown in fig 2 this study considered energy and waste biosolids fw and yw as inputs while emissions to air and water waste slags ash and sludge and beneficial or avoided products electricity heat and compost or digestate were considered as the final products 2 2 1 collection and transportation average distances of waste collection and transportation were estimated based on existing facilities in hillsborough county e g transfer stations incineration composting and landfilling facilities using arcgis software for fw and yw collection single unit refuse trucks full capacity 10 tons fueled by diesel eia 2017 were used with an average travel distance of 340 km day vehicle 211 miles day vehicle for the collection the worst case was assumed that the trucks travelled at their maximum capacity for the entire distance and the collection trucks ran five days per week transportation data were estimated based on travel distances of trailer trucks full capacity 20 tons for fw and yw and 32 tons for biosolids the average transportation distance was 93 km 58 miles from transfer stations or wastewater treatment facilities to landfilling or composting facilities since there is no hs acd system in hillsborough county it was assumed that the average distance from transfer stations or wastewater treatment facilities to hs acd were the same as the distance from transfer stations or wastewater treatment facilities to the incineration facility which was about 45 km 28 miles 2 2 2 hs acd the hs acd system layout was based on commercial hs ad digester facilities bioferm 2017 zwe 2018 with an annual waste capacity of 81 258 wet tonnes a block flow diagram of the plant is presented in the supplementary material the facility consisted of insulated concrete batch garage type reactors in parallel 21 and 20 reactors for hillsborough and equal mass fraction respectively leachate tanks biogas storage capable of storing 0 2 0 5 of the annual biogas production 1 000 kw electrical combined heat and power chp units to convert biogas to electricity and heat and a biofilter unit to remove h2s from the plant s exhaust gas note that exhaust gas is the gas removed prior to opening the digester s doors to maintain safe breathing conditions bioferm 2017 since the majority of installed hs ad systems in the u s are batch type systems hinds et al 2017 this study considered the batch type digesters ancillary materials considered included gas pipelines for biogas exhaust gas and air liquid pipelines for water and leachate and electricity to power pumps and compressors for operation of the hs acd facility energy required to heat the waste to mesophilic condition 38 c and compensate for heat losses and for machinery operation to transport waste into and out of the reactors was considered the hs acd process had a 12 hr aeration phase at the beginning to partially pre heat the waste and a 5 hr aeration phase at end of the process to establish safe conditions for entry into the bioreactors zwe 2018 the reactor is kept sealed during the pre aeration step so that the gases produced are emitted along with biogas as anaerobic conditions start as for the post aeration step the exhaust gas is flared until the methane content is reduced to 1 2 zwe 2014 thereafter the exhaust gas is scrubbed in the biofilter to remove h2s and is released to the atmosphere leachate recirculation was assumed to be applied every 2 h at a ratio of 0 75 l of leachate kg of waste rico et al 2015 the digester was assumed to be operated at a 28 day retention time data for biogas methane content of the biogas digestate production and nutrient quality were based on experiments carried out in our laboratory under mesophilic conditions at a 28 day retention time with both waste compositions lee et al 2019 ergas et al 2018 it was assumed that biogas is fed to the chp units to produce heat and electricity the digestate remaining after the hs acd process can be used as fertilizer after it is dried to 90 dry solids ds to reduce transportation costs emissions from the hs acd system include direct emissions from the chp units calculated using the inventory from li et al 2017 and the pre and post aeration phases calculated based on data from phong 2012 and from other indirect processes such as construction materials production and transportation freight estimated from bureau of transportation statistics u s census bureau 2015 table 1 shows the inventory and design basis for the hs acd system more detailed descriptions of the inventory can be found in the supplementary materials 2 2 3 landfills landfilling of ofmsw and biosolids was assumed to occur at an existing facility in hillsborough county lfg is currently flared at that facility fldep 2017 since 25 of the open landfills in the us operate under a lfg energy project epa 2018 this study included two landfill options with and without lfg utilization for both landfill scenarios a lfg collection efficiency of 85 epa 2017 was assumed for the landfill scenario without lfg utilization all the collected lfg was flared with no energy recovered while in the landfill option with lfg utilization all lfg collected was sent to a chp unit for energy production construction including transportation of construction material construction machinery operation and energy for construction of the landfill was included with data from doka 2003a landfill operation included fuel consumption for dump trucks bulldozers and compactors for the landfill scenario with lfg utilization the construction of the chp unit was included in the system based on the inventory of wernet et al 2016 direct air and water emissions were considered as well as the indirect emissions direct air emissions from the landfill process were computed using the landgem software epa 2005 with rate parameters estimated from jeon et al 2007 and epa 2017 2016b and additional data for ammonia emissions from epa 2004 for the landfill scenario with lfg utilization emissions from the chp units were taken from li et al 2017 direct water emissions were estimated using emission factors from doka 2003a leachate production rates from camba et al 2014 and edwards et al 2017a with precipitation rates for tampa us climate data 2018 and evapotranspiration rates for the state of florida douglas et al 2009 indirect emissions stemmed from machinery operation during construction inventory from doka 2003a a and operation machinery type from epa 2011 machinery average speeds from hawthorne caterpillar 2014 sandhu et al 2015 and bomag n d fig 2 shows the systems for landfill with and without lfg utilization 2 2 4 composting the composting system was assumed to be a windrow system which is the type of system currently in use in hillsborough county beattie 2014 construction of the composting facility included materials materials transportation machinery operation energy and maintenance construction data was taken from brogaard et al 2015 operation of the composting plant considered electricity fuel for machinery operation and other resources such as water operational data were obtained from cadena et al 2009 the compost remaining at the end of the composting process can be used as fertilizer after drying to 90 ds to establish a fair comparison with the hs acd scenario for windrow composting 0 52 kg of compost fertilizer are produced per kg of ofmsw composted cadena et al 2009 it was assumed that 70 of the compost produced would replace nitrogen based fertilizers and the remaining compost would replace non nitrogen based fertilizers direct air and water emissions and indirect emissions were included for the composting system the emission factors for fw yw and biosolids were based on edwards et al 2017b and amlinger et al 2008 leachate production was estimated based on data from roy et al 2018 2 2 5 incineration direct combustion known as incineration is the most common technology for msw incineration funk et al 2013 in direct combustion wastes are directly burned to generate heat which is converted to electrical energy construction of the incineration facility included materials materials transportation energy doka 2003b and machinery operation peters and manley 2012 during the operation of the incineration facility energy e g electricity is consumed but is also recovered as heat and electricity direct and indirect air and water emissions from the incineration plant were included in addition final waste flows in the form of slags ash and sludge were considered the inventory for an incineration facility was obtained from doka 2003b who used data compiled by zimmermann et al 1996 additional information on waste elemental composition was taken from sliusar and armisheva 2013 rostagno and sosebee 2001 and torri and alberti 2012 since emission factors in doka 2003b were given on an elemental basis 2 3 life cycle assessment the lca followed iso 14044 iso 2006 standards the goal was to assess the environmental impacts and benefits of hs acd in hillsborough county and compare its environmental impacts and benefits with different organic waste management strategies including composting incineration and landfilling with and without lfg utilization the functional unit fu was one tonne of wet waste fw yw biosolids mixture treated over a 20 year lifespan the system boundary was cradle to gate including system construction waste collection and transportation and operation table 1 shows the major life cycle inventory for the hs acd system major life cycle inventories for other systems tables s4 s6 detailed inventory data descriptions and assumptions associated with the construction and operation phases are available in the supplementary materials simapro phd software version 8 0 by pré consultants and the tool for reduction and assessment of chemicals and other environmental impacts traci 2 1 v1 01 by us epa were used for the impact assessment among the impact assessment categories in traci global warming potential kg co2 eq acidification kg so2 eq eutrophication kg n eq and ecotoxicity ctue were considered in this study global warming potential was selected as an indicator for global impact while the other three categories were indicators for regional impacts these impacts were normalized with respect to the fu 2 4 life cycle cost analysis life cycle cost analysis lcca was conducted using the present value method the lcca was based on full scale scenarios in hillsborough county fl with a total annual capacity of 81 258 wet tonnes the fu of the lcca was the same as the fu of lca which was one wet tonne treated over a 20 year life span the lcca included infrastructure operation and maintenance o m collection and transportation c t costs tipping fee and revenues from beneficial products i e electricity heat and digestate or compost the life cycle cost lcc was computed as follows eq 1 l c c c i c o m u p v c c t u p v c r t u p v c r h u p v c r d c u p v c r e u p v fu where c i is the initial cost excluded land acquisition cost c o m is the o m cost c c t is the c t cost c r t is the tipping fee c r h is the revenue from heat sales c r d c is the revenue from digestate or compost and c r e is the revenue from electricity sale upv is a uniform present value factor and upv is a non uniform present value factor the discount or interest rate and the escalation rate used to calculate upv and upv were assumed to be 1 89 the average rate for 10 years and 0 65 respectively eerc 2017 usir 2017 the lcc factors for the waste management systems considered in this study were estimated based on data from existing facilities and literature as shown in table 2 also uncertainty analysis of the lcc for the hillsborough composition was performed by varying land acquisition costs using monte carlo simulation with 1 000 iterations for uncertainty analysis lcc included the land acquisition cost as the initial cost detailed assumptions and calculations for the costs are described in the supplemental material 3 results and discussion 3 1 life cycle environmental impacts for two hs acd waste compositions results for the hs acd scenarios with two different waste compositions are shown in fig 3 positive values are environmental burdens and negative values are environmental benefits similar trends were obtained regarding net impacts across impact categories both scenarios resulted in net environmental benefits in the global warming potential and acidification categories but net environmental burdens for the eutrophication and ecotoxicity categories for global warming potential and acidification categories the largest overall benefits were due to production of electricity heat and digestate labeled avoided products in fig 3 while the major burden was from waste collection for eutrophication and ecotoxicity waste collection was the largest contributor followed by avoided products as shown in fig 3 waste collection was a major contributor to all impact categories for global warming potential this could be due to emissions of carbon dioxide co2 and carbon monoxide co during combustion of diesel fuel in waste collection trucks which are about 0 10 and 7 35e 6 kg tkm respectively spielmann et al 2007 the high nitrogen oxides nox emissions during diesel combustion 3 42e 4 kg tkm spielmann et al 2007 could account for the significant contribution of waste collection to acidification and eutrophication impacts another compound emitted during combustion of diesel that can have impacts on acidification is sulfur dioxide so2 3 29e 6 kg tkm from spielmann et al 2007 air emissions from chp units are another major contributor to global warming potential due to emission of greenhouse gases such as co2 and co for the hs acd scenario only air emissions are considered because leachate was assumed to be recirculated to the bioreactor construction was the least contributor to global warming potential acidification and eutrophication for ecotoxicity the impact from air emissions was negligible since emissions from the chp units consist of co2 co nox so2 and non methane volatile organic compounds nmvocs which have low ecotoxicity factors li et al 2017 ryberg et al 2013 waste collection and transportation were the main burdens for the ecotoxicity impact this is due to high heavy metal emissions which occur during vehicle tire break wear and burning of diesel fuel which contains trace amounts of heavy metals spielmann et al 2007 wernet et al 2016 the hillsborough mixture had higher impacts in the eutrophication and ecotoxicity categories than those of the equal mass fraction mixture the hillsborough mixture had more fw and yw that required transport than the equal mass fraction mixture additional 12 300 tonnes per year on a wet basis resulting in higher impacts regarding the avoided products the hillsborough mixture had a higher offset than the equal mass fraction mixture e g global warming potential of 1 017 kg co2 eq versus 736 kg co2 eq this can be explained by the quality of beneficial products based on the experimental data lee et al 2019 the hillsborough mixture resulted in a higher biogas yield and methane content than the equal mass fraction mixture over the 28 day retention time in addition digestate from the hillsborough mixture was richer in nutrients such as n k and p table 1 which allows for greater fertilizer offset than the equal mass fraction mixture although hs acd with the hillsborough mixture provided greater benefits from avoided products than the equal mass fraction mixture for all impact categories the benefits could not offset the burden associated with waste collection for the eutrophication and ecotoxicity categories to improve environmental performance of hs acd with the hillsborough mixture the impact from waste collection should be reduced replacing diesel powered trucks with compressed natural gas powered trucks could be an option rose et al 2013 in addition since the results of environmental impacts for two different compositions were different our study shows that the use of the realistic waste composition data is important to obtain accurate lca results 3 2 life cycle environmental impacts for different waste management options lca results for the five waste management scenarios using hillsborough waste composition are shown in fig 4 for global warming potential the composting scenario had a slightly higher offset environmental benefit than the hs acd scenario followed by incineration and landfilling with lfg use the scenarios with the highest impact environmental burden for global warming potential were the two landfill scenarios followed by incineration composting and hs acd considering both benefits and burden hs acd had the best performance lowest net value for global warming potential among all scenarios with a net value of 500 kg co2 eq whereas the net value for the composting scenario was 413 kg co2 eq comparing hs acd to composting the composting scenario had a slightly larger offset about 13 kg co2 eq however it also had larger impacts from emissions possibly due to the open operation of windrow composting where the waste is open to the atmosphere and fugitive emissions cannot be controlled as well as in the sealed hs acd reactors the ability to replace commercially produced fertilizers is an important benefit of these two alternatives because industrial production of fertilizers especially ammonia and urea has a high global warming impact due to nitrous oxide n2o emissions and high energy demands skowronska and filipek 2014 comparing hs acd to landfilling hs acd resulted in lower impacts and higher offsets for global warming potential for landfilling scenarios air emissions were the most significant contributor in particular utilization of lfg for energy production reduced the impact of global warming from emissions by 7 comparing hs acd to incineration hs acd had lower impacts on global warming potential due to lower energy requirements during hs acd operation lower air emissions and larger offsets from avoided products indeed incineration is the most energy intensive of the processes considered and while energy can be recovered from the hot flue gases the global warming offset from incineration was only 37 of that of hs acd which has offsets resulting from both energy and fertilizer recovery lishan et al 2018 found that incineration was the worst alternative for biosolids management among incineration landfilling pyrolysis and composting due to high resource consumption during the incineration process as shown in fig 4 emissions and collection were the stages with higher global warming impacts for all scenarios it is interesting to note that for all waste treatment options collection had a much higher impact than transportation due to long travel distances with constant stops during waste collection acidification is mainly caused by nox so2 and ammonia emissions eea 2015 as shown in fig 4 hs acd was the only scenario with a net environmental benefit for acidification due to avoided products hs acd had lower acidification impacts burdens than composting and incineration scenarios but higher than landfilling with and without lfg use hs acd is more energy intensive than landfilling because energy is required to maintain mesophilic temperatures and dewater the digestate while landfilling occurs at ambient temperatures as a result hs acd had a higher acidification burden than landfilling with and without lfg use for the operational phase about 0 41 kg so2 eq for hs acd and 0 03 kg so2 eq for landfill however hs acd recovered more energy from biogas than landfilling hs acd 73 75 methane by volume landfill with lfg use 50 methane by volume in addition hs acd had significant environmental benefits from digestate fertilizer replacement as discussed previously skowronska and filipek 2014 due to a larger offset hs acd had lower net acidification impact than landfilling with lfg use this large offset was also observed in the composting and incineration scenarios the composting scenario offset however could not compensate for the burden due to the high level of direct air emissions during operation for the incineration scenario the large offset for acidification larger than 2 kg so2 eq was due to energy recovery for eutrophication hs acd had the lowest net impact followed by incineration composting landfilling with lfg use and landfilling without lfg use fig 4 the largest contributors to eutrophication were direct emissions to air and water for landfilling and composting scenarios and collection for hs acd and incineration scenarios the scenarios with landfilling and composting generated significant amounts of leachate which resulted in high eutrophication impact for hs acd however it was assumed that leachate was recirculated which can explain why the net eutrophication impact for hs acd was not as large about 0 08 kg n as for the other technologies for the incineration scenario almost all of the produced nitrogen was emitted to the air while most of the produced phosphorus was present in solid outputs ash doka 2003b therefore emissions to water contained very little nitrogen or phosphorus doka 2003b which could explain why incineration had lower eutrophication than landfilling and composting the net eutrophication impact from incineration about 0 16 kg n eq fu was twice as large as that from hs acd 0 08 kg n eq fu which is in agreement with a study from a swedish research company profu 2004 who reported that anaerobic digestion was a better alternative than incineration regarding eutrophication when the biogas from anaerobic digestion was used for district heating and electricity profu 2004 for ecotoxicity the hs acd scenario had the lowest net impact followed by landfilling with lfg use landfilling without lfg use composting and incineration fig 4 the scenarios with hs acd landfilling with lfg use and incineration had offsets for ecotoxicity by replacing the fossil fuel based energy with bioenergy according to laurent and espinosa martinez 2015 current electricity production which relies heavily on fossil fuels has an ecotoxicity impact of 7 45e 3 ctue year person for all scenarios considered a significant amount of the ecotoxicity impact came from collection and transportation due to the heavy metal emissions of the collection and transportation trucks wernet et al 2016 it is also worth mentioning that transportation has a larger share of the total impact for ecotoxicity than any of the other impact categories as shown in fig 4 incineration has a larger contribution from the construction and operation stages than any of the other scenarios this is related to the larger infrastructure required to build and operate an incineration facility compared with the other technologies as can be seen in the amounts of materials and energy listed in the tables s4 s6 supplementary material a similar result was also reported for the operation phase by jeswani and azapagic 2016 among the scenarios to manage biosolids fw and yw in hillsborough county the hs acd system had the lowest regional and global environmental impacts composting was the second best option for global warming impact however it had one of the highest net impacts in the eutrophication and ecotoxicity categories as expected the landfill without lfg use was the worst scenario with the greatest global and regional environmental impacts except in ecotoxicity for which the largest impact was from incineration lfg utilization in landfill could provide environmental benefits but these benefits were not greater than those of other technologies incineration could be an unfavorable option to manage biosolids fw and yw because the environmental impacts except acidification category significantly exceeded the environmental benefits ahamed et al 2016 who investigated the environmental impacts of incineration l ad and biodiesel production via thermal process for fw management also found similar trends with incineration having greater impacts for global warming potential eutrophication and acidification than l ad when hs acd is applied to manage biosolids from wwtps with fw and yw in the u s hs acd could efficiently recover energy from these wastes with lower environmental impacts than the other options considered 3 3 life cycle cost impact lccs for the hs acd scenarios with two different waste compositions had similar trends fig 5 the initial cost and revenue from avoided product sale i e electricity and compost sale were the major contributors the hs acd system with the hillsborough mixture required larger reactor sizes due to larger volume of the substrate compared to the system with the equal mass fraction mixture leading to a higher initial and o m costs also the hs acd scenario for the hillsborough mixture had slightly higher collection and transportation costs because more trucks were needed to collect and transfer yw and fw to the hs acd system for hs acd systems revenue associated with biogas and digestate is highly affected by organic content in the substrate li et al 2017 the hillsborough mixture with a higher organic matter content e g carbon and nitrogen ratio 22 resulted in higher methane yields and better quality of digestate compost therefore the hillsborough mixture had greater revenue from electricity heat and compost than the equal mass fraction mixture this compensated for the slightly higher collection transportation initial and o m costs for the hillsborough mixture when comparing hs acd with other options based on the hillsborough mixture incineration had the greatest revenue from electricity but it only offset 47 of the total cost this is because the system had the highest initial and o m costs in particular the initial cost accounted for 71 of the total cost of incineration although composting had low revenues low initial and o m costs made the system economically favorable the composting system was based on a windrow system which is a low cost technology wei et al 2001 in the landfilling scenarios the largest contributor was the tipping fees followed by initial and o m costs landfilling with lfg use provided economic benefits from electricity and heat but this offset only about 27 of the total cost landfill without lfg use had only economic burdens with higher recurring costs e g o m tipping which accounted for 66 of the total cost due to this landfilling without lfg use was the least economical option hs acd has similar initial and o m costs as landfilling scenarios but the profits could considerably offset the total cost of hs acd as a result the most economical option was the hs acd system followed by composting landfilling with lfg use incineration and landfilling without lfg use land acquisition costs are an important factor in the lcc due to its large portion of the initial cost wei et al 2001 each waste management scenario requires a different land area for example composting and landfilling scenarios have larger land area requirements compared with hs acd and incineration wei et al 2001 to understand the impact of land acquisition costs on the lcc for the five waste management systems with the hillsborough mixture uncertainty analysis was performed fig 6 by comparing mean values of the lccs the most economical option was hs acd followed by composting unlike the results of lcc without land acquisition cost it was found that there was a larger difference between the average lccs of composting and hs acd when land acquisition was considered this is because hs acd required a relatively smaller land area compared with the composting system on the other hand a smaller difference in lcc mean value was observed between the composting and incineration scenarios because the composting system required a larger land area which caused an increase in the lcc value for this scenario as expected the lcc variations for composting and landfilling scenarios were larger compared to the other options because they required larger land area thus the lccs for the composting and landfilling scenarios are greatly influenced by the one time land acquisition cost while land acquisition cost had the least impact on the lccs of hs acd and incineration 4 conclusions this study investigated and compared the environmental and economic impacts and benefits of hs acd of biosolids fw and yw to four different management options including landfilling with and without lfg use composting and incineration hillsborough county fl usa which has high waste availability and a warm climate was used as a case study two potential waste compositions for biosolids fw and yw were applied to assess the effect of waste composition on environmental and economic impacts the waste mixture with higher ratios of fw and yw exhibited better environmental and economic performance among all waste management options the hs acd system had the lowest environmental impacts across all categories because substantial environmental benefits from avoided product e g electricity heat and compost could offset the environmental impacts in terms of economic performance the hs acd resulted in the lowest lcc due to high profits from heat electricity and fertilizer sale with low o m cost hs acd system was shown to be an appealing alternative for managing ofmsw and biosolids in hillsborough county in terms of both environmental and economic sustainability considering the ability to recover energy and nutrients from waste and its environmental and economic benefits the application of hs acd could also be a sustainable ofmsw and biosolids management solution for areas that have similar ofmsw and biosolids production rates waste compositions and climate conditions technically hs acd can effectively recover energy and nutrients from the waste e g biosolids and ofmsw with lower energy and material requirements environmentally hs acd can offset greenhouse gas emissions by the substitution of fossil fuel derived energy with biomethane which can be used for heating and electricity generation economically hs acd can be feasible due to high profits from heat electricity and fertilizer sale with low

18223,high solids anaerobic co digestion hs acd of sewage sludge biosolids with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste is a promising waste management alternative due to high methane yields lower reactor volume requirements lower energy inputs and less leachate production than liquid anaerobic digestion this study evaluated the environmental and economic burdens and benefits of hs acd of biosolids food waste fw and yard waste yw using life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost analysis lcca methods using hillsborough county florida in the u s as a case study results for hs acd were compared with incineration composting and landfilling with and without landfill gas use the results showed that hs acd of a mixture of biosolids fw and yw had the lowest environmental impacts in all categories analyzed global warming potential acidification eutrophication and ecotoxicity in terms of economics hs acd had the lowest life cycle cost with or without considering land acquisition the results show that hs acd is the best choice to manage biosolids and the organic waste in hillsborough county in terms of both environmental and economic sustainability keywords life cycle assessment life cycle cost analysis biosolids organic fraction of municipal solid waste high solids anaerobic co digestion 1 introduction biosolids waste sewage sludge management is a major environmental and economic challenge for many municipal utilities according to seiple et al 2017 u s wastewater treatment plants wwtps generated approximately 13 84 megatonne mt of dry biosolids per year the amount of biosolids is increasing with increasing volumes of wastewater treated and more stringent effluent water quality regulations seiple et al 2017 land application composting incineration liquid anaerobic digestion l ad aerobic digestion and landfilling are the most commonly used biosolids management methods to recover energy and nutrients from biosolids thermal based technologies such as pyrolysis and gasification have been studied liu et al 2017 shaddel et al 2019 among these methods l ad provides both biosolids stabilization and energy recovery in the form of biogas as well as nutrient recovery however only 21 of biosolids is managed by l ad in the u s due to the limited installed anaerobic digester capacity seiple et al 2017 l ad implementation is economically challenging for many municipal utilities due to the low biogas production from biosolids high bioreactor heating requirements hanum et al 2019 and generation of sidestreams that can upset mainstream wastewater treatment processes when recycled back to the plant headworks yuan et al 2012 therefore many municipal utilities seek alternatives for sustainable biosolids management that include energy and nutrient recovery seiple et al 2017 recently hs ad systems which are operated at a high total solids ts content 15 40 have gained attention as an alternative to l ad ts 10 because of their smaller digester size lower materials handling requirements lower heating requirements and higher biogas methane content than l ad hinds et al 2016 lee et al 2019 in addition due to the low moisture content of the digestate hs ad produces very little sidestream wastewater leachate and the digestate can be readily utilized as a fertilizer or pelletized fuel yan et al 2015 li et al 2017 thus hs ad could be a viable solution for managing biosolids in small or medium scale wwtps where l ad is not feasible duan et al 2012 despite these advantages hs ad is susceptible to microbial inhibition caused by volatile fatty acids and ammonia accumulation due to the low moisture content in the digester high solids anaerobic co digestion hs acd of biosolids with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw is a promising option to overcome this problem by increasing the carbon to nitrogen c n ratio and buffering capacity co digestion can reduce inhibition leading to improved methane yields and volatile solids vs reduction kim and oh 2011 lee et al 2019 ofmsw includes food waste fw yard waste yw and paper cardboard in 2015 the usepa reported that 144 million tonnes of ofmsw were produced in the u s us epa 2018 ofmsw has a high organic carbon content making it a suitable co substrate for hs acd therefore hs acd could offer a sustainable waste management alternative for both biosolids and ofmsw several prior studies have investigated the potential for biogas production via hs acd of ofmsw with biosolids ahmadi pirlou et al 2017 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2016 however an assessment of the environmental and economic sustainability of hs acd as a biosolids and ofmsw management technology is lacking life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost analysis lcca are widely used tools to assess the environmental and economic impacts of the whole life cycle of a product process or service various lca and lcca studies have focused on different types of biosolids management technologies including composting incineration land application and l ad lombardi et al 2017 lishan et al 2018 yoshida et al 2013 past studies have shown that l ad is a sustainable waste to energy option which reduced the environmental burden of biosolids management cartes et al 2018 dong et al 2014 li et al 2017 compared hs ad of biosolids with l ad and found that hs ad provided greater environmental and economic benefits than l ad a few studies have assessed the environmental impact of liquid anaerobic co digestion l acd of biosolids and fw and found that the co digestion had lower impacts than single substrate digestion becker et al 2017 edwards et al 2017a however no prior study has investigated the environmental and economic impacts of hs acd of biosolids and ofmsw compared with other waste management alternatives this study conducted a comparative lca and lcca to determine the environmental and economic impacts and benefits of hs acd of biosolids fw and yw with different waste compositions the lca and lcca results of hs acd were compared with four waste management options 1 incineration 2 composting 3 landfilling with landfill gas lfg use and 4 landfilling without lfg use variations in land acquisition costs on life cycle costs for each waste management option were evaluated using monte carlo simulation in this study hillsborough county florida in the u s was used as a case study area to obtain waste generation rates waste composition transportation distances climate and other factors in particular the high biosolids and ofmsw availability high local energy demands warm climate and lack of l ad infrastructure make this region an appealing location for hs acd implementation the result of this study can provide insights into tradeoffs of different waste management alternatives for regulators municipal utilities and waste management industries seeking sustainable organic waste management methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and organic waste production hillsborough county is located in west central florida usa the county is the economic hub of the tampa bay metropolitan region which has an area of 3 280 km2 19 4 of the area is covered by water and a population of approximately 1 4 million there are five waste transfer stations in the county two incineration facilities with energy recovery one biosolids and yw composting facility one landfill and eight wastewater treatment facilities with one aerobic digestion system for biosolids treatment fig 1 due to limited capacity for biosolids treatment approximately 66 of biosolids are sent to landfills ergas et al 2018 in 2015 the county produced approximately 2 million tonnes of municipal solids waste msw ofmsw including fw yw and paper cardboard accounted for 38 of msw fw and yw were approximately 0 13 and 0 14 million tonnes respectively while biosolids produced was about 0 05 million tonnes ergas et al 2018 100 of fw and 39 of yw are sent for incineration ergas et al 2018 even though these wastes reduce the efficiency of energy recovery from incineration due to their high moisture content and low calorific values per unit of weight zhang et al 2015 note that fw from residential sources was not considered because there is no separate collection system for residential fw in hillsborough county therefore only commercial fw from warehouses industry supermarkets and schools was considered in this study based on lee et al 2019 two waste compositions were considered fw yw bisolids 1 1 1 and 0 8 1 7 0 5 basis of total solids the fw yw biosolids 1 1 1 is referred to hereafter as the equal mass fraction composition the composition of fw yw bisolids 0 8 1 7 0 5 was based on the following criteria ergas et al 2018 i fw composition in the co substrate 0 4 volatile solids basis ii waste availability in hillsborough county based on quantities that went to landfill incineration or composting from the 2016 hillsborough county waste production and management flow and iii achieving a carbon to nitrogen ratio in the substrate close to the optimal ratio 20 30 the fw yw bisolids 0 8 1 7 0 5 is hereafter referred to as the hillsborough composition 2 2 scenario descriptions this study evaluated six waste management scenarios hs acd with two different waste compositions equal mass fraction and hillsborough landfill with lfg use landfill without lfg use composting and incineration all scenarios included the management system s construction and operation waste collection and waste transportation fig 2 as shown in fig 2 this study considered energy and waste biosolids fw and yw as inputs while emissions to air and water waste slags ash and sludge and beneficial or avoided products electricity heat and compost or digestate were considered as the final products 2 2 1 collection and transportation average distances of waste collection and transportation were estimated based on existing facilities in hillsborough county e g transfer stations incineration composting and landfilling facilities using arcgis software for fw and yw collection single unit refuse trucks full capacity 10 tons fueled by diesel eia 2017 were used with an average travel distance of 340 km day vehicle 211 miles day vehicle for the collection the worst case was assumed that the trucks travelled at their maximum capacity for the entire distance and the collection trucks ran five days per week transportation data were estimated based on travel distances of trailer trucks full capacity 20 tons for fw and yw and 32 tons for biosolids the average transportation distance was 93 km 58 miles from transfer stations or wastewater treatment facilities to landfilling or composting facilities since there is no hs acd system in hillsborough county it was assumed that the average distance from transfer stations or wastewater treatment facilities to hs acd were the same as the distance from transfer stations or wastewater treatment facilities to the incineration facility which was about 45 km 28 miles 2 2 2 hs acd the hs acd system layout was based on commercial hs ad digester facilities bioferm 2017 zwe 2018 with an annual waste capacity of 81 258 wet tonnes a block flow diagram of the plant is presented in the supplementary material the facility consisted of insulated concrete batch garage type reactors in parallel 21 and 20 reactors for hillsborough and equal mass fraction respectively leachate tanks biogas storage capable of storing 0 2 0 5 of the annual biogas production 1 000 kw electrical combined heat and power chp units to convert biogas to electricity and heat and a biofilter unit to remove h2s from the plant s exhaust gas note that exhaust gas is the gas removed prior to opening the digester s doors to maintain safe breathing conditions bioferm 2017 since the majority of installed hs ad systems in the u s are batch type systems hinds et al 2017 this study considered the batch type digesters ancillary materials considered included gas pipelines for biogas exhaust gas and air liquid pipelines for water and leachate and electricity to power pumps and compressors for operation of the hs acd facility energy required to heat the waste to mesophilic condition 38 c and compensate for heat losses and for machinery operation to transport waste into and out of the reactors was considered the hs acd process had a 12 hr aeration phase at the beginning to partially pre heat the waste and a 5 hr aeration phase at end of the process to establish safe conditions for entry into the bioreactors zwe 2018 the reactor is kept sealed during the pre aeration step so that the gases produced are emitted along with biogas as anaerobic conditions start as for the post aeration step the exhaust gas is flared until the methane content is reduced to 1 2 zwe 2014 thereafter the exhaust gas is scrubbed in the biofilter to remove h2s and is released to the atmosphere leachate recirculation was assumed to be applied every 2 h at a ratio of 0 75 l of leachate kg of waste rico et al 2015 the digester was assumed to be operated at a 28 day retention time data for biogas methane content of the biogas digestate production and nutrient quality were based on experiments carried out in our laboratory under mesophilic conditions at a 28 day retention time with both waste compositions lee et al 2019 ergas et al 2018 it was assumed that biogas is fed to the chp units to produce heat and electricity the digestate remaining after the hs acd process can be used as fertilizer after it is dried to 90 dry solids ds to reduce transportation costs emissions from the hs acd system include direct emissions from the chp units calculated using the inventory from li et al 2017 and the pre and post aeration phases calculated based on data from phong 2012 and from other indirect processes such as construction materials production and transportation freight estimated from bureau of transportation statistics u s census bureau 2015 table 1 shows the inventory and design basis for the hs acd system more detailed descriptions of the inventory can be found in the supplementary materials 2 2 3 landfills landfilling of ofmsw and biosolids was assumed to occur at an existing facility in hillsborough county lfg is currently flared at that facility fldep 2017 since 25 of the open landfills in the us operate under a lfg energy project epa 2018 this study included two landfill options with and without lfg utilization for both landfill scenarios a lfg collection efficiency of 85 epa 2017 was assumed for the landfill scenario without lfg utilization all the collected lfg was flared with no energy recovered while in the landfill option with lfg utilization all lfg collected was sent to a chp unit for energy production construction including transportation of construction material construction machinery operation and energy for construction of the landfill was included with data from doka 2003a landfill operation included fuel consumption for dump trucks bulldozers and compactors for the landfill scenario with lfg utilization the construction of the chp unit was included in the system based on the inventory of wernet et al 2016 direct air and water emissions were considered as well as the indirect emissions direct air emissions from the landfill process were computed using the landgem software epa 2005 with rate parameters estimated from jeon et al 2007 and epa 2017 2016b and additional data for ammonia emissions from epa 2004 for the landfill scenario with lfg utilization emissions from the chp units were taken from li et al 2017 direct water emissions were estimated using emission factors from doka 2003a leachate production rates from camba et al 2014 and edwards et al 2017a with precipitation rates for tampa us climate data 2018 and evapotranspiration rates for the state of florida douglas et al 2009 indirect emissions stemmed from machinery operation during construction inventory from doka 2003a a and operation machinery type from epa 2011 machinery average speeds from hawthorne caterpillar 2014 sandhu et al 2015 and bomag n d fig 2 shows the systems for landfill with and without lfg utilization 2 2 4 composting the composting system was assumed to be a windrow system which is the type of system currently in use in hillsborough county beattie 2014 construction of the composting facility included materials materials transportation machinery operation energy and maintenance construction data was taken from brogaard et al 2015 operation of the composting plant considered electricity fuel for machinery operation and other resources such as water operational data were obtained from cadena et al 2009 the compost remaining at the end of the composting process can be used as fertilizer after drying to 90 ds to establish a fair comparison with the hs acd scenario for windrow composting 0 52 kg of compost fertilizer are produced per kg of ofmsw composted cadena et al 2009 it was assumed that 70 of the compost produced would replace nitrogen based fertilizers and the remaining compost would replace non nitrogen based fertilizers direct air and water emissions and indirect emissions were included for the composting system the emission factors for fw yw and biosolids were based on edwards et al 2017b and amlinger et al 2008 leachate production was estimated based on data from roy et al 2018 2 2 5 incineration direct combustion known as incineration is the most common technology for msw incineration funk et al 2013 in direct combustion wastes are directly burned to generate heat which is converted to electrical energy construction of the incineration facility included materials materials transportation energy doka 2003b and machinery operation peters and manley 2012 during the operation of the incineration facility energy e g electricity is consumed but is also recovered as heat and electricity direct and indirect air and water emissions from the incineration plant were included in addition final waste flows in the form of slags ash and sludge were considered the inventory for an incineration facility was obtained from doka 2003b who used data compiled by zimmermann et al 1996 additional information on waste elemental composition was taken from sliusar and armisheva 2013 rostagno and sosebee 2001 and torri and alberti 2012 since emission factors in doka 2003b were given on an elemental basis 2 3 life cycle assessment the lca followed iso 14044 iso 2006 standards the goal was to assess the environmental impacts and benefits of hs acd in hillsborough county and compare its environmental impacts and benefits with different organic waste management strategies including composting incineration and landfilling with and without lfg utilization the functional unit fu was one tonne of wet waste fw yw biosolids mixture treated over a 20 year lifespan the system boundary was cradle to gate including system construction waste collection and transportation and operation table 1 shows the major life cycle inventory for the hs acd system major life cycle inventories for other systems tables s4 s6 detailed inventory data descriptions and assumptions associated with the construction and operation phases are available in the supplementary materials simapro phd software version 8 0 by pré consultants and the tool for reduction and assessment of chemicals and other environmental impacts traci 2 1 v1 01 by us epa were used for the impact assessment among the impact assessment categories in traci global warming potential kg co2 eq acidification kg so2 eq eutrophication kg n eq and ecotoxicity ctue were considered in this study global warming potential was selected as an indicator for global impact while the other three categories were indicators for regional impacts these impacts were normalized with respect to the fu 2 4 life cycle cost analysis life cycle cost analysis lcca was conducted using the present value method the lcca was based on full scale scenarios in hillsborough county fl with a total annual capacity of 81 258 wet tonnes the fu of the lcca was the same as the fu of lca which was one wet tonne treated over a 20 year life span the lcca included infrastructure operation and maintenance o m collection and transportation c t costs tipping fee and revenues from beneficial products i e electricity heat and digestate or compost the life cycle cost lcc was computed as follows eq 1 l c c c i c o m u p v c c t u p v c r t u p v c r h u p v c r d c u p v c r e u p v fu where c i is the initial cost excluded land acquisition cost c o m is the o m cost c c t is the c t cost c r t is the tipping fee c r h is the revenue from heat sales c r d c is the revenue from digestate or compost and c r e is the revenue from electricity sale upv is a uniform present value factor and upv is a non uniform present value factor the discount or interest rate and the escalation rate used to calculate upv and upv were assumed to be 1 89 the average rate for 10 years and 0 65 respectively eerc 2017 usir 2017 the lcc factors for the waste management systems considered in this study were estimated based on data from existing facilities and literature as shown in table 2 also uncertainty analysis of the lcc for the hillsborough composition was performed by varying land acquisition costs using monte carlo simulation with 1 000 iterations for uncertainty analysis lcc included the land acquisition cost as the initial cost detailed assumptions and calculations for the costs are described in the supplemental material 3 results and discussion 3 1 life cycle environmental impacts for two hs acd waste compositions results for the hs acd scenarios with two different waste compositions are shown in fig 3 positive values are environmental burdens and negative values are environmental benefits similar trends were obtained regarding net impacts across impact categories both scenarios resulted in net environmental benefits in the global warming potential and acidification categories but net environmental burdens for the eutrophication and ecotoxicity categories for global warming potential and acidification categories the largest overall benefits were due to production of electricity heat and digestate labeled avoided products in fig 3 while the major burden was from waste collection for eutrophication and ecotoxicity waste collection was the largest contributor followed by avoided products as shown in fig 3 waste collection was a major contributor to all impact categories for global warming potential this could be due to emissions of carbon dioxide co2 and carbon monoxide co during combustion of diesel fuel in waste collection trucks which are about 0 10 and 7 35e 6 kg tkm respectively spielmann et al 2007 the high nitrogen oxides nox emissions during diesel combustion 3 42e 4 kg tkm spielmann et al 2007 could account for the significant contribution of waste collection to acidification and eutrophication impacts another compound emitted during combustion of diesel that can have impacts on acidification is sulfur dioxide so2 3 29e 6 kg tkm from spielmann et al 2007 air emissions from chp units are another major contributor to global warming potential due to emission of greenhouse gases such as co2 and co for the hs acd scenario only air emissions are considered because leachate was assumed to be recirculated to the bioreactor construction was the least contributor to global warming potential acidification and eutrophication for ecotoxicity the impact from air emissions was negligible since emissions from the chp units consist of co2 co nox so2 and non methane volatile organic compounds nmvocs which have low ecotoxicity factors li et al 2017 ryberg et al 2013 waste collection and transportation were the main burdens for the ecotoxicity impact this is due to high heavy metal emissions which occur during vehicle tire break wear and burning of diesel fuel which contains trace amounts of heavy metals spielmann et al 2007 wernet et al 2016 the hillsborough mixture had higher impacts in the eutrophication and ecotoxicity categories than those of the equal mass fraction mixture the hillsborough mixture had more fw and yw that required transport than the equal mass fraction mixture additional 12 300 tonnes per year on a wet basis resulting in higher impacts regarding the avoided products the hillsborough mixture had a higher offset than the equal mass fraction mixture e g global warming potential of 1 017 kg co2 eq versus 736 kg co2 eq this can be explained by the quality of beneficial products based on the experimental data lee et al 2019 the hillsborough mixture resulted in a higher biogas yield and methane content than the equal mass fraction mixture over the 28 day retention time in addition digestate from the hillsborough mixture was richer in nutrients such as n k and p table 1 which allows for greater fertilizer offset than the equal mass fraction mixture although hs acd with the hillsborough mixture provided greater benefits from avoided products than the equal mass fraction mixture for all impact categories the benefits could not offset the burden associated with waste collection for the eutrophication and ecotoxicity categories to improve environmental performance of hs acd with the hillsborough mixture the impact from waste collection should be reduced replacing diesel powered trucks with compressed natural gas powered trucks could be an option rose et al 2013 in addition since the results of environmental impacts for two different compositions were different our study shows that the use of the realistic waste composition data is important to obtain accurate lca results 3 2 life cycle environmental impacts for different waste management options lca results for the five waste management scenarios using hillsborough waste composition are shown in fig 4 for global warming potential the composting scenario had a slightly higher offset environmental benefit than the hs acd scenario followed by incineration and landfilling with lfg use the scenarios with the highest impact environmental burden for global warming potential were the two landfill scenarios followed by incineration composting and hs acd considering both benefits and burden hs acd had the best performance lowest net value for global warming potential among all scenarios with a net value of 500 kg co2 eq whereas the net value for the composting scenario was 413 kg co2 eq comparing hs acd to composting the composting scenario had a slightly larger offset about 13 kg co2 eq however it also had larger impacts from emissions possibly due to the open operation of windrow composting where the waste is open to the atmosphere and fugitive emissions cannot be controlled as well as in the sealed hs acd reactors the ability to replace commercially produced fertilizers is an important benefit of these two alternatives because industrial production of fertilizers especially ammonia and urea has a high global warming impact due to nitrous oxide n2o emissions and high energy demands skowronska and filipek 2014 comparing hs acd to landfilling hs acd resulted in lower impacts and higher offsets for global warming potential for landfilling scenarios air emissions were the most significant contributor in particular utilization of lfg for energy production reduced the impact of global warming from emissions by 7 comparing hs acd to incineration hs acd had lower impacts on global warming potential due to lower energy requirements during hs acd operation lower air emissions and larger offsets from avoided products indeed incineration is the most energy intensive of the processes considered and while energy can be recovered from the hot flue gases the global warming offset from incineration was only 37 of that of hs acd which has offsets resulting from both energy and fertilizer recovery lishan et al 2018 found that incineration was the worst alternative for biosolids management among incineration landfilling pyrolysis and composting due to high resource consumption during the incineration process as shown in fig 4 emissions and collection were the stages with higher global warming impacts for all scenarios it is interesting to note that for all waste treatment options collection had a much higher impact than transportation due to long travel distances with constant stops during waste collection acidification is mainly caused by nox so2 and ammonia emissions eea 2015 as shown in fig 4 hs acd was the only scenario with a net environmental benefit for acidification due to avoided products hs acd had lower acidification impacts burdens than composting and incineration scenarios but higher than landfilling with and without lfg use hs acd is more energy intensive than landfilling because energy is required to maintain mesophilic temperatures and dewater the digestate while landfilling occurs at ambient temperatures as a result hs acd had a higher acidification burden than landfilling with and without lfg use for the operational phase about 0 41 kg so2 eq for hs acd and 0 03 kg so2 eq for landfill however hs acd recovered more energy from biogas than landfilling hs acd 73 75 methane by volume landfill with lfg use 50 methane by volume in addition hs acd had significant environmental benefits from digestate fertilizer replacement as discussed previously skowronska and filipek 2014 due to a larger offset hs acd had lower net acidification impact than landfilling with lfg use this large offset was also observed in the composting and incineration scenarios the composting scenario offset however could not compensate for the burden due to the high level of direct air emissions during operation for the incineration scenario the large offset for acidification larger than 2 kg so2 eq was due to energy recovery for eutrophication hs acd had the lowest net impact followed by incineration composting landfilling with lfg use and landfilling without lfg use fig 4 the largest contributors to eutrophication were direct emissions to air and water for landfilling and composting scenarios and collection for hs acd and incineration scenarios the scenarios with landfilling and composting generated significant amounts of leachate which resulted in high eutrophication impact for hs acd however it was assumed that leachate was recirculated which can explain why the net eutrophication impact for hs acd was not as large about 0 08 kg n as for the other technologies for the incineration scenario almost all of the produced nitrogen was emitted to the air while most of the produced phosphorus was present in solid outputs ash doka 2003b therefore emissions to water contained very little nitrogen or phosphorus doka 2003b which could explain why incineration had lower eutrophication than landfilling and composting the net eutrophication impact from incineration about 0 16 kg n eq fu was twice as large as that from hs acd 0 08 kg n eq fu which is in agreement with a study from a swedish research company profu 2004 who reported that anaerobic digestion was a better alternative than incineration regarding eutrophication when the biogas from anaerobic digestion was used for district heating and electricity profu 2004 for ecotoxicity the hs acd scenario had the lowest net impact followed by landfilling with lfg use landfilling without lfg use composting and incineration fig 4 the scenarios with hs acd landfilling with lfg use and incineration had offsets for ecotoxicity by replacing the fossil fuel based energy with bioenergy according to laurent and espinosa martinez 2015 current electricity production which relies heavily on fossil fuels has an ecotoxicity impact of 7 45e 3 ctue year person for all scenarios considered a significant amount of the ecotoxicity impact came from collection and transportation due to the heavy metal emissions of the collection and transportation trucks wernet et al 2016 it is also worth mentioning that transportation has a larger share of the total impact for ecotoxicity than any of the other impact categories as shown in fig 4 incineration has a larger contribution from the construction and operation stages than any of the other scenarios this is related to the larger infrastructure required to build and operate an incineration facility compared with the other technologies as can be seen in the amounts of materials and energy listed in the tables s4 s6 supplementary material a similar result was also reported for the operation phase by jeswani and azapagic 2016 among the scenarios to manage biosolids fw and yw in hillsborough county the hs acd system had the lowest regional and global environmental impacts composting was the second best option for global warming impact however it had one of the highest net impacts in the eutrophication and ecotoxicity categories as expected the landfill without lfg use was the worst scenario with the greatest global and regional environmental impacts except in ecotoxicity for which the largest impact was from incineration lfg utilization in landfill could provide environmental benefits but these benefits were not greater than those of other technologies incineration could be an unfavorable option to manage biosolids fw and yw because the environmental impacts except acidification category significantly exceeded the environmental benefits ahamed et al 2016 who investigated the environmental impacts of incineration l ad and biodiesel production via thermal process for fw management also found similar trends with incineration having greater impacts for global warming potential eutrophication and acidification than l ad when hs acd is applied to manage biosolids from wwtps with fw and yw in the u s hs acd could efficiently recover energy from these wastes with lower environmental impacts than the other options considered 3 3 life cycle cost impact lccs for the hs acd scenarios with two different waste compositions had similar trends fig 5 the initial cost and revenue from avoided product sale i e electricity and compost sale were the major contributors the hs acd system with the hillsborough mixture required larger reactor sizes due to larger volume of the substrate compared to the system with the equal mass fraction mixture leading to a higher initial and o m costs also the hs acd scenario for the hillsborough mixture had slightly higher collection and transportation costs because more trucks were needed to collect and transfer yw and fw to the hs acd system for hs acd systems revenue associated with biogas and digestate is highly affected by organic content in the substrate li et al 2017 the hillsborough mixture with a higher organic matter content e g carbon and nitrogen ratio 22 resulted in higher methane yields and better quality of digestate compost therefore the hillsborough mixture had greater revenue from electricity heat and compost than the equal mass fraction mixture this compensated for the slightly higher collection transportation initial and o m costs for the hillsborough mixture when comparing hs acd with other options based on the hillsborough mixture incineration had the greatest revenue from electricity but it only offset 47 of the total cost this is because the system had the highest initial and o m costs in particular the initial cost accounted for 71 of the total cost of incineration although composting had low revenues low initial and o m costs made the system economically favorable the composting system was based on a windrow system which is a low cost technology wei et al 2001 in the landfilling scenarios the largest contributor was the tipping fees followed by initial and o m costs landfilling with lfg use provided economic benefits from electricity and heat but this offset only about 27 of the total cost landfill without lfg use had only economic burdens with higher recurring costs e g o m tipping which accounted for 66 of the total cost due to this landfilling without lfg use was the least economical option hs acd has similar initial and o m costs as landfilling scenarios but the profits could considerably offset the total cost of hs acd as a result the most economical option was the hs acd system followed by composting landfilling with lfg use incineration and landfilling without lfg use land acquisition costs are an important factor in the lcc due to its large portion of the initial cost wei et al 2001 each waste management scenario requires a different land area for example composting and landfilling scenarios have larger land area requirements compared with hs acd and incineration wei et al 2001 to understand the impact of land acquisition costs on the lcc for the five waste management systems with the hillsborough mixture uncertainty analysis was performed fig 6 by comparing mean values of the lccs the most economical option was hs acd followed by composting unlike the results of lcc without land acquisition cost it was found that there was a larger difference between the average lccs of composting and hs acd when land acquisition was considered this is because hs acd required a relatively smaller land area compared with the composting system on the other hand a smaller difference in lcc mean value was observed between the composting and incineration scenarios because the composting system required a larger land area which caused an increase in the lcc value for this scenario as expected the lcc variations for composting and landfilling scenarios were larger compared to the other options because they required larger land area thus the lccs for the composting and landfilling scenarios are greatly influenced by the one time land acquisition cost while land acquisition cost had the least impact on the lccs of hs acd and incineration 4 conclusions this study investigated and compared the environmental and economic impacts and benefits of hs acd of biosolids fw and yw to four different management options including landfilling with and without lfg use composting and incineration hillsborough county fl usa which has high waste availability and a warm climate was used as a case study two potential waste compositions for biosolids fw and yw were applied to assess the effect of waste composition on environmental and economic impacts the waste mixture with higher ratios of fw and yw exhibited better environmental and economic performance among all waste management options the hs acd system had the lowest environmental impacts across all categories because substantial environmental benefits from avoided product e g electricity heat and compost could offset the environmental impacts in terms of economic performance the hs acd resulted in the lowest lcc due to high profits from heat electricity and fertilizer sale with low o m cost hs acd system was shown to be an appealing alternative for managing ofmsw and biosolids in hillsborough county in terms of both environmental and economic sustainability considering the ability to recover energy and nutrients from waste and its environmental and economic benefits the application of hs acd could also be a sustainable ofmsw and biosolids management solution for areas that have similar ofmsw and biosolids production rates waste compositions and climate conditions technically hs acd can effectively recover energy and nutrients from the waste e g biosolids and ofmsw with lower energy and material requirements environmentally hs acd can offset greenhouse gas emissions by the substitution of fossil fuel derived energy with biomethane which can be used for heating and electricity generation economically hs acd can be feasible due to high profits from heat electricity and fertilizer sale with low

18224,perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoate pfoa acids are ubiquitous in the oceans including remote regions and are toxic to fish and mammals the impact to the lowest trophic levels of the food web however remains unknown we challenged natural bacterial communities inhabiting antarctic coastal waters deception island with pfos and pfoa concentrations ranging from 2 ng l to 600 ng l that selected for tolerant taxa after 48 h concentrations of pfos decreased by more than 50 and sulfur metabolism related transcripts were significantly enriched in the treatments suggesting desulfurization of pfos conversely no significant differences were found between initial and final pfoa concentrations gammaproteobacteria and roseobacter two abundant groups of marine bacteria increased their relative activity after 24 h of incubation whereas flavobacteriia became the main contributor in the treatments after 6 days community activities extracellular enzyme activity and absolute number of transcripts were higher in the treatments than in the controls while bacterial abundances were lower in the treatments suggesting a selection of pfos and pfoa tolerant community in the exposed treatments our results show a direct effect of pfos and pfoa exposure on the composition and functionality of natural antarctic marine microbial communities while no evidence of

deposition is also a potential source of pfaas to remote regions martin et al 2006 del vento et al 2012 young and mabury 2010 pfaas have been reported to be ubiquitous in remote areas such as antarctic waters wei et al 2007 ahrens et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 cai et al 2012 casal et al 2017a long range transport persistence and toxicity are proprieties that these substances share with other persistent organic pollutants pops pfos has been the first pfaa to have a global restriction but not a ban on its production and use being added to annex b of the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants pops paul et al 2009 exposure to pfaas by microorganisms can originate an increased permeability of cell membranes alteration of membrane fluidity xie et al 2010 hu et al 2003 and membrane disruption by pfaa penetration into the membrane bilayer nouhi et al 2018 these effects are compound and concentration dependent a recent study investigating the toxicity of high concentrations of pfaas to escherichia coli determined a half inhibitory concentration ic50 of 10 6 1 0 mg l for pfoa and 374 3 mg l for pfos liu et al 2016 at lower concentrations it has been demonstrated that 10 μg l of pfos was sufficient for increasing the sensitivity of the quorum sensing response in aliivibrio fischeri fitzgerald et al 2018 most of these studies have been performed under standardized laboratory experiments using model cultures effects might change between individual strains and the mix of species found in microbiomes in mice gut microbiome for instance pfos exposure caused potentially harmful interactions between pfos and microbial and animal metabolisms lai et al 2018 unfortunately no studies have attempted to check the effects of pfaas on environmental microbiomes despite the high stability of the c f bound dehalogenation of fluoroacetate by microorganisms was first reported by goldman 1965 some previous studies suggest that pfos and pfoa dehalogenation is a favorable thermodynamic reaction under reductive conditions and is thus expected to occur in anaerobic environments such as in soils sediments or in some wastewater treatment plant wwtp compartments however few studies have been able to actually detect degradation in field studies beškoski et al 2018 assumed that metabolites determined by lc ms in microbial consortia isolated from river sediments and incubated with pfos and pfoa were associated with unsaturated monofluorinated fatty acids and hydrocarbons with multiple unsaturated bonds or ring structures other studies have observed the decrease of pfos and pfoa concentrations under incubations with microorganisms isolated from contaminated soils yi et al 2016 2018 chetverikov et al 2017 chetverikov and loginov 2019 river sediments beškoski et al 2018 and wastewater treatment sludge kwon et al 2014 mejia avendaño et al 2015 however defluorination products of pfos or pfoa were not detected this study aimed to analyze the effects of pfos and pfoa to pristine remote microorganisms given that pfaas have been introduced in the environment during the last fifty years and their distant resemblance to natural products we wanted to test whether microbial communities have already evolved the capacity to degrade these compounds if any potential degradation due to co metabolism occurs or if toxic effects were predominant as a microbial response to pfaas dose response assays and short versus long term exposure experiments with a mix of pfos and pfoa were performed under in situ conditions with coastal antarctic microbial communities potential biodegradation and sub lethal effects were detected by using a combination of chemical physiological molecular and metatranscriptomic techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experiments experiments were carried out in january february 2017 using surface seawater collected by submerging a rinsed polypropylene bottle 20 l an arm length into the water from a zodiac in port foster bay 62 59 386 s 60 37 115 w the inner bay of deception island south shetland islands antarctica three experiments were performed by challenging marine in situ natural populations with a mix of pfoa and pfos hereafter called pfaas mix at different concentrations and exposure times pfoa and pfos in the mix were at a 1 0 6 proportion to mirror natural relative occurrence in seawater as previously reported casal et al 2017a all experiments were run in duplicate under aerobic conditions ensured by daily opening of the incubation bottles 2 1 1 dose response experiments microbial communities were exposed at four different concentrations of the pfaas mix no addition control 2 ng l low 60 ng l mid and 600 ng l high incubations were carried out in polypropylene 50 ml falcon centrifuge tubes that were spiked with the pfaas mix and let the solvent to evaporate during 2 h under the hood at room temperature before seawater addition control tubes were prepared following the same protocol and with the same volume of solvent but without any pollutant addition incubations were done in the dark and at in situ temperature for 48 h changes in community composition were monitored by quantifying bacterial abundance ba by flow cytometry at initial time point and after 3 h 24 h and 48 h of incubation and by card fish at initial and final time points changes in community activity were monitored by bio orthogonal non canonical amino acid tagging boncat and specific extracellular enzymatic activity specific eea measurements at the initial and final time points 2 2 short and long term exposure experiments short term exposure experiments consisted of 24 h incubations at three different concentrations of the pfaas mix no addition control 2 ng

reconstituted with 100 μl of an injection standard solution containing 13c8 pfoa and 13c8 pfos at 5 pg μl in 30 70 water methanol pfos and pfoa identification and quantification was performed by uplc ms ms using a waters acquity uplc system coupled with a waters xevo tqs triple quadrupole operating in the multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode and using an electrospray ionization esi source waters milford ma usa pfos and pfoa separation was achieved using an acquity uplc beh c18 column 1 7 μm 2 1 50 mm waters with a gradient mobile phase of water and methanol with a constant 1 of acetonitrile buffer at a flow rate of 400 μl min injection and instrumental conditions as well as ms ms parameters for the target compounds can be found in gonzález gaya et al 2014 quantification was based on a linear eight point calibration curve 0 01 10 pg μl those samples that showed pfos or pfoa concentrations above the curve range were diluted using the injection standard to match the calibration range fluorinated materials were avoided during field and lab work field and lab blanks covering the whole sampling and analytical procedure were conducted field blanks were stored and transported from antarctica to test for possible external contamination limits of detection lod were calculated as the analyte mean concentration corresponding to the sample blanks plus three standard deviations being 7 25 and 3 29 pg l for pfoa and pfos respectively target compounds were identified based on similar retention times and a ratio between the monitored ions of 20 of the mean values obtained for the calibration standards recoveries of spiked pfaas were satisfactory for both pfos mean sd 119 33 and pfoa 103 26 2 4 bacterial abundance ba ba was determined by flow cytometry using a facscalibur becton dickinson flow cytometer as described elsewhere gasol and moran 2015 high and low nucleic acid content cells hna and lna respectively were counted separately in order to track differences between the different taxonomical groups that compose each fraction that are assumed to have different ecological significance vila costa et al 2012 2 5 taxonomical identification by catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization card fish specific taxonomical bacterial groups were detected by card fish using group specific phylogenetic probes aliquots of 9 ml water from

dried and frozen until their processing in the laboratory whole cell in situ hybridizations of sections from the filters were performed as described by pernthaler et al 2002 using the oligonucleotide probes listed in table s1 filter pieces were counterstained with 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi 10 μg ml final concentration percentages of the positive hybridized cells to total prokaryotic cells

barcelona spain at 630x magnification through the axiovision software and analyzed using the automated image analysis software acmetool all images at least 10 fields filter were acquired using 20 ms exposure time 2 6 bio orthogonal non canonical amino acid tagging boncat boncat was used to determine the percentage of active cells within each card fish group following the protocol described in leizeaga et al 2017 briefly 9 ml of each sample were incubated during 2 h at in situ temperature and dark conditions with 0 5 μm of the methionine analog l homopropargylglycine hpg and cells were fixed with 0 2 μm filtered formaldehyde final concentration 1 v v overnight at 4 c the samples were then gently filtered through a 0 2 μm pore size polycarbonate filter and frozen at 20 c until further processing after thawing the filters were immersed in 0 1 agarose dried at 37 c for 10 30 min and then dehydrated with 95 ethanol cell walls were permeabilized with lysozyme solution 100 mg

filter was cut into 1 10 slices using a sterile razor blade cu i catalyzed click chemistry was later performed using azide dye cr110 following hatzenpichler and orphan 2015 the card fish probes were subsequently hybridized as described before using the alexa488 labeled tyramide filters were mounted with 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi sigma aldrich dapi boncat and card fish stained cells were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy and images were acquired using the same procedure as described in card fish section 2 7 extracellular enzyme activity eea the activity of four extracellular enzymes β glucosidase β glc l leucyl aminopeptidase leu amp alkaline phosphatase apa and chitobiase chit was determined using fluorogenic substrates that emit fluorescence after cleavage of the molecule by the specific enzyme hoppe 1983 following the protocol described elsewhere sala et al 2010 2016 briefly 350 μl of samples in triplicates were mixed with 50 μl of four different substrates 4 methylumbelliferyl phosphate apa 4 methylumbelliferyl β d glucoside β glc 4 methylumbelliferyl n acetyl β d glucosaminide chit or l leucine 7 amino 4 methylcoumarin leu amp in black microplates plates were incubated at 4 c and dark conditions fluorescence was measured at 0 15 min and 24 h after incubation at 365 excitation and 450 emission wavelengths with a modulus microplate dismed turner biosystems the increase in fluorescence in each well was converted into activity using a standard curve prepared with the fluorophores 4 methylumbelliferone muf or 4 methylcoumarinyl 7 amide 4 specific eea was calculated dividing eea by bacterial abundance as estimated by flow cytometry 2 8 genetic biomass collection and processing for metatranscriptomics and taxonomy rdna 16s at each corresponding incubation time 2 l of seawater was first pre filtered through a 3 μm pore size 47 mm diameter polycarbonate filter and then filtered through a 0 2 μm pore size 25 mm diameter polycarbonate filter for 20 min to minimize rna degradation approx 1 l the 0 2 μm filter was placed in 2 ml cryotubes containing 1 ml rnalater sigma aldrich saint louis mo and stored at 20 c until rna processing in the lab the remaining volume approx 1 l was filtered using a 0 2 μm pore size sterivex filters millipore sterivex filters were stored dry at 20 c until dna extraction see below a metatranscriptomic approach was performed following the protocol used by poretsky et al 2010 with minor modifications described in cerro galvez et al 2019a briefly total rna was extracted dna removed rrna depleted and mrna enriched by amplification three mrna standards were synthesized gifford et al 2011 by in vitro transcription from plasmids with restriction enzyme ptxb1 vector new england biolabs ipswich ma with ncoi restriction enzyme promega madison wi pfn18k halotag t7 flexi vector promega madison wi with bamhi restriction enzyme promega madison wi and pgem 4z promega madison wi with scal restriction enzyme promega madison wi these artificial mrnas were added after rna extraction but before mrna enrichment as in cerro gálvez et al 2019a and used as an internal standard moran et al 2013 satinsky et al 2013 relative standard error of internal standards was 22 5 final amplified rnas were sequenced at the national center for genomic analysis cnag barcelona spain using illumina high output mode hs200 2x100bp v4 sterivex filters for dna analysis were filled with lysis buffer 50 mm tris hcl 40 mm edta 0 75 m sucrose and incubated at 37 c for 45 min with a 5 mg ml lysozyme solution then 0 5 mg ml proteinase k and 100 μl of 10 sodium dodecyl sulfate were added and further incubated at 55 c for 1 h dna was extracted twice with phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol 25 24 1 and once with chloroform isoamyl alcohol 24 1 the resulting solution was concentrated to 200 μl using an amicon ultra 10 kda filter unit millipore partial bacterial 16s gene fragments of dna were amplified using a mix of 515f 926r primers parada et al 2016 and mytaq dna polymerase pcr conditions were as follows 3 min at 94 c followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 c for 15 s annealing at

sequencing was of rdna 16s conducted at the pompeu fabra university sequencing service 2 9 bioinformatics cdna sequences were quality trimmed and internal standards and any remaining stable rna was quantified and removed using the bowtie2 mapping program langmead and salzberg 2012 against the internal standard sequences and an in house database of marine bacterial stable rna sequences rrna and trna respectively subsequently read pairs were joined using the pear program https www h its org en research sco software joined pairs as well as separate reads not corresponding to joined pairs were aligned to the ncbi refseq database downloaded october 2016 using the diamond aligner v0 8 25 buchfink et al 2014 in blastx mode with default parameters the resulting alignments were taxonomically and functionally classified with megan 6 5 10 huson et al 2016 and exported for further analysis in r tidyverse sequences belonging to archaea and eukaryotic cells were excluded due to low abundances a total of 14 metatranscriptomes samples were recovered ranging in size from 48 to 98 million paired end reads of 101 bp per dataset table s2 among the close to one billion total reads 460 million were possible protein encoding sequences after quality trimming an average of 23 3 9 1 of the protein coding reads had a functional annotation based on seed database and subcategories and an average of 21 2 4 9 were taxonomically annotated see below for details on transcript annotation 16s reads were trimmed denoised merged and bimera checked with dada2 callahan et al 2016 version 1 10 0 taxonomical annotation was performed with the qiime 2 naive bayesian algorithm version 2018 8 0 bokulich et al 2018 against the silva database quast et al 2012 version 132 2 10 statistical analyses all data analyses were performed in r software significant differences between treatments and controls were analyzed with student s t test non metric multidimensional scaling nmds or analysis of variance anova using the vegan package oksanen et al 2018 the threshold for significance was set at p 0 05 analysis of differential gene abundances was performed with the edger package dimont et al 2015 temporal variation of pfos and pfoa in long term experiments were evaluated by means of multiple linear regression analysis including concentration as dependent variable and the abundance of high and low dna bacteria chlorophyll a nutrient concentrations and the enzymatic activities as independent variables only those variables that were significant were left at the final regression text s1 the degradation rate of pfos was determined by a linear regression between the logarithm of concentration pfos pfoa as we used the benchmarking approach and time 0 24 48 96 144 h as predictor all regressions were performed using spss statistics version 25 0 ibm corp concentrations were ln transformed when necessary to satisfy normal distribution and variance homogeneity criteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 dose response assays no statistically significant differences anova test p 0 05 were observed in neither community composition nor functional profile between controls and treatments after 48 h with pfaa concentrations up to 600 ng l highest concentration tested fig 1 this is consistent with previous studies showing significant changes in marine community composition at pfaa concentrations higher than those used in our exposure experiments 1000 ng l zhang et al 2019 cerro gálvez et al 2019b minor effects of pfaas on river delta marine community composition were observed when compared with the roles of geochemical parameters and phytoplankton chen et al 2019 when exposed to in situ concentrations whereas no trends were distinguished in the structure of the communities increased boncat activities were observed in the gammaproteobacteria and roseobacter groups in treatments with pfaas gammaproteobacteria and roseobacter displayed maximum increases of 1 7 and 1 6 fold respectively compared with the controls at the mid concentration 60 ng l of pfaas mix fig 1 in agreement with this these two phylogenetic groups were the main responders to increasing additions of pfos in mediterranean marine communities although gammaproteobacteria showed opposite patterns decrease and increase in relative abundances in coastal and offshore communities cerro gálvez et al 2019b we observed a decline of eea of chit with increasing pfaa concentrations fig 1 although chitobiase enzymatic activities are not apparently linked to pfas exposure increased chit activities were observed in offshore mediterranean waters at high pfos concentrations concomitant with increased relative abundances of flavobacteriia cerro gálvez et al 2019b this group is known to have a high affinity to degrade high molecular weight compounds including biopolymers thus potentially linked to chitinolytic activities kirchman 2002 veliz et al 2017 in our incubations pfaa addition stimulated proteobacteria mainly gammaproteobacteria and roseobacter within alphaproteobacteria rather than the other phyla such as flavobacteriia without major differences between doses supporting the observed decline of chit activities in pfaas amendments low and mid concentrations from dose response bioassays were selected for short term 24 h experiments while mid concentrations were chosen for long term 6 days exposure experiments responses were detailed at the transcriptional level for short and long term experiments while chemical concentrations were analyzed for long term experiments at different times of exposure 3 2 concentrations of pfaas in long term experiment in situ seawater concentrations of pfos and pfoa were 36 pg l and 27 pg l respectively comparable to the low concentrations measured in antarctic coastal seawaters and offshore regions wei et al 2007 ahrens et al 2010 cai et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 for example concentrations are close to those measured in coastal waters from livingston island south shetland islands antarctica that averaged 20 35 pg l of pfos and 69 39 pg l of pfoa casal et al 2017a dissolved phase concentrations of pfos at the end of the long term experiment were significantly lower than the initial nominal concentrations t test p 0 005 table s3 and notably lower than in the first measurement after 24 h of incubation conversely pfoa concentrations did not decrease significantly during the 6 days of the long term experiment t test p 0 13 in this work pfos and pfoa were measured in the dissolved phase only it is well known that when performing incubations using hydrophobic pops in microcosms small volumes there are losses due to adsorption to the bottle walls among others fernández pinos et al 2017 cerro gálvez et al 2019a even though this issue is of lower magnitude for the less hydrophobic pfas in addition a fraction of pfos and pfoa will partition to phytoplankton bacteria and the dissolved organic carbon present in seawater during the incubations the bioaccumulation factor bcf cplankton cwater or plankton water partition coefficients for pfos in antarctic waters log bcf 3 0 6 is not significantly different than that for pfoa log bcf 3 8 0 3 casal et al 2017a the bacteria water partition coefficients for pfaas have never been reported before but are higher than those of phytoplankton due to a larger surface to volume ratio of the cells text s1 therefore a significant fraction of pfaas can be sorbed into onto cells during the time course of the experiments and this fraction may vary over time due to changes in cell abundance and community composition therefore the mesured concentrations in the dissolved phase will not only reflect a potential degradation but also the partitioning of a variable fraction to cells and doc this variability of concentrations was similar for pfos and pfoa and could be explained by the abundance of hna bacteria and other variables related to doc text s1 in order to block the variability of concentrations due to sorption to the organic matter pools during the time course of the experiment and thus being able to determine the degradation rate of pfos we used chemical benchmarking this approach allows to improve the quantification of degradation in field and laboratory experiments mclachlan et al 2017 with this approach the degradation of a chemical is measured relative to another chemical of known persistence and the degradation is then assessed using not the absolute concentrations but the relative concentrations ratio of the target analyte over the benchmark chemical therefore the benchmark chemical is used as internal standard of the experimental set up in this work we used pfoa as a benchmark chemical and pfos as the target chemical for which biodegradation was assessed this is consistent with pfos showing a notable decrease of concentrations during the long term assay while pfoa lacking such a decrease fig 2 shows the ratio of concentrations of pfos over pfoa during the time course of the experiment thus pfos concentrations in relative abundances and shows a clear exponential decay as the ratio of pfos and pfoa is evaluated instead of absolute concentrations of pfos alone this approach blocks the variability in dissolved concentrations due to sorption to bottle walls cells and doc as both chemicals have similar hydrophobicity similar bcf fitting ln pfos versus time resulted in a regression r2 0 42 p 0 05 with a degradation constant of 0 016 h 1 corresponding to a half life of pfos in the long term experiment of 43 h that is a disappearance of more than 50 after 48 h fig 2 similar fast pfos degradation rates have been observed in cultures of specific consumers e g pseudomonas aeruginosa strain hj4 kwon et al 2014 and pseudomonas plecoglossicida strain 2 4 d chetverikov et al 2017 in terms of environmental relevance of these degradation rates for the occurrence of pfos in oceanic waters it would be surprising that such fast degradation occurs in the global oceans as pfos is ubiquitously found in seawater benskin et al 2012 gonzález gaya et al 2014 first it is possible that antarctic or polar microbial communities are especially suited for such degradation secondly it could happen that the biogeochemical conditions in antarctic coastal waters favor this process see discussion below for potential use of sulfur from pfos enzyme mediated degradation rates are dependent on the chemical substrate concentration a consequence of michaelis menten kinetics in laboratory experiments it has been shown that pollutant biodegradation is activated by the addition of high concentrations of substrate li and mclachlan 2019 as it could have happened in our spiked treatments in controls containing field in situ concentrations of pfaas concentrations of pfos also decreased by 31 during the long term experiment not significant while this decrease was of 85 in the treatments with pfaas significant p 0 05 thus with pfos concentrations 100 fold those found in situ the ubiquity of pfos in oceans provides evidence that it is slowly degraded and remains in the surface ocean for long periods as estimated previously for tropical and subtropical oceans gonzález gaya et al 2014 casal et al 2017b in most oceanic regions pfos concentrations are higher than those of pfoa wei et al 2007 ahrens et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 gonzález gaya et al 2014 casal et al 2017a the median in the ratio pfos pfoa is 4 0 in temperate oceanic waters with values of 4 2 in the atlantic 4 0 in the indian and 3 8 in the pacific oceans gonzález gaya et al 2014 lower ratios have been observed in antarctic waters ranging from 0 3 to 2 2 in several sites including offshore and coastal areas wei et al 2007 zhao et al 2012 casal et al 2017a the ratio measured in our samples 1 3 falls in the range of antarctic samples these results suggest a potential of pfos degradation by polar microorganisms higher than in temperate seawater gonzález gaya et al 2014 in order to identify potential pfos degraders and degradation pathways we turned to molecular analyses 3 3 community composition profiles in short and long term experiment in general bacterial abundances in the treatments were higher than in the controls over the time course of the experiments without distinction between hna and lna cells however after 6 days bacterial abundances significantly dropped in the pfaa exposed communities fig 3 and table s4 community composition varied over the time course of the experiments based on 16s rdna sequencing analyses although no significant changes were recorded at higher taxonomic levels between treatments and controls bacterial communities after 6 days of pfaas exposure fig s1 fig s2 some specific taxa got significantly enriched after 24 h and after 6 days table s5 the larger number of taxa increasing in the pfaas mix enrichments belonged to gammaproteobacteria especially alteromonadales and flavobacteriia mainly flavobacteriales these results were in agreement with card fish counts in which gammaproteobacteria and flavobacteriia increased in relative abundance in the treatments after 24 h and after 6 days respectively fig 3 in concordance with our results the few pfos and pfoa biodegraders isolated so far belong to the proteobacteria phylum especially to the gammaproteobacteria class and the genus pseudomonas table s6 both pseudomonas and alteromonas are closely related genera common in the marine environment baumann et al 1983 in the environment few communities have been analyzed in relation to pfaa concentrations in freshwater sediments betaproteobacteria and epsilonproteobacteria are recognized tolerant classes to high pfaa concentrations table s6 sun et al 2016 li et al 2017 but these studies did not report degradation of any pfaa interestingly in surface seawaters bacteroidetes have been reported to have positive correlations to in situ concentrations of pfaas chen et al 2019 3 4 functional profiles in short and long term experiment generally specific eea decreased in the pfaa exposed treatments after 24 h with significant decreases in leu amp and apa fig 3 this decrease after a short exposure contrast with the eea increases observed after 6 days being significant for β glc this is consistent with the observed changes in communities but also suggests that potential toxic effects were overcome by gammaproteobacteria after 6 days of exposure which may have contributed to this response in terms of eea the lower abundance of cells but higher specific eea activities after 6 days suggests the development of a tolerant community including gammaproteobacteria these results are in agreement with boncat percentages and that absolute number of transcripts were generally lower in the pfaas treatments than in the controls after 24 h but higher after 6 days figs 3 and s3 taxonomy of the metatranscriptomic reads indicated a higher relative abundance of transcripts harbored by gammaproteobacteria and rhodobacterales after 24 h and bacteroidetes including flavobacteriia after 6 days fig 4 in agreement with boncat trends in dose response bioassays differences in sar11 activities low in metatranscriptomes high in boncat figs 3 and 4 can be due to the already described divergences between card fish probes and 16s primers especially in the sar11 group from antarctic waters cerro gálvez et al 2019a individual significantly deferentially expressed genes in the treatments than in the controls edger test fdr 0 05 showed a higher transcriptional activity of flavobacteriia after 6 days accounting for most of the up regulated genes along with sar11 table s7 interestingly as many as 19 individual transcripts in the respiration seed category increased indicating a rising of heterotrophic activity by the pfoa tolerant community fig 5 bacteroidetes and proteobacteria have been reported to be the selected resistant bacteria in lab scale sequencing batch reactor continuously exposed to high pfoa concentrations in the order of mg l yu et al 2018 seed functional categories dna metabolism and sulfur metabolism got significantly enriched after 24 h t test p 0 05 but not after 6 days fig 5 consistent with the sharp decrease of pfos concentrations in the short term incubation and suggesting a linkage of pfos consumption to the sulfur cycle in taxonomic groups able to actively grow on pfos desulfurization figs 2 and s4 several significant more than 2 fold increases of genes in different sulfur related categories in pfaa treatments were observed after 24 h including genes related to dimethylsulfoniopropionate dmsp metabolism and sulfur oxidation fig 6 the higher the concentrations of pfaas the higher number of up regulated sulfur related genes individual significant differentially expressed sulfur related genes in the pfaa treatments were also more abundant after 24 h than after 6 days table s7 the enriched genes were classified into three main categories firstly release of sulfite group encoding lyases of the carbon so3 bond three different gene families were identified potentially encoding this process sulfonate and alkanesulfonate monooxygenases potentially forming perfluorooctanol as transformation product dmsp related genes encoding the first step of dmsp degradation both dmsp lyases dddp dddd etc and dmsp demethylase dmda and sulfatase genes which are sulfohydrolases secondly oxidation of sulfite to sulfate mostly encoded by sox family genes showing the use of pfos as source of reducing power and a third category including reduction of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide encoded by the bidirectional enzyme sulfite reductase and incorporation of sulfur pfos in bacterial biomass through homocysteine and cysteine metabolism figs 7 and s5 and table s7 consistent with metatranscriptomes and boncat results most of these genes were encoded by gammaproteobacteria flavobacteriia sar11 and rhodobacterales figs 1 4 s5 and table s7 these groups are known degraders of reduced sulfur in the oceans so far described mainly for dmsp and main players in the inorganic sulfur metabolism gonzález et al 1999 yoch 2002 vila costa et al 2006 2010 unfortunately the absence of identified genes specifically encoding pfos degradation pathways hampers a direct comparison of our results with previously reported metatranscriptomic data for pfos degradation in addition the fact that differentially expressed genes belonged to the sulfur metabolism seed category further confirms that degradation was related to desulfurization but not to defluorination in fact no evidence of formation of perfluoroheptanoic acid fig 7 as suggested elsewhere chetverikov et al 2017 was found in this work while formation of perfluoroctanol was feasible perfluorooctanol must have a very high henry s law constant as polyfluorinated telomers have and thus if perfluorooctanol was formed it was either lost by volatilization or sorbed to cells during the incubations and could not be detected in the dissolved phase conversely perfluoroheptanoic acid was analyzed in controls and treatments results not shown but it did not show a significant increase of comparable magnitude with the decrease of pfos the potential linkage between pfos desulfurization and the sulfur biogeochemical cycle suggested by our data should be further explored for instance the few groups identified at sites with high concentrations of pfaas correspond to species directly related to sulfur metabolism such as thiobacillus and sulfurimonas in freshwater sediments table s6 sun et al 2016 li et al 2017 3 5 potential impact of pfos desulfurization to the sulfur biogeochemical cycle sulfate is at mm concentrations in seawater and bacteria have the capability to reduce it so that they never get limited by this element muyzer and stams 2008 however the use of sulfur available in a reduced form is energetically advantageous molecules containing reduced sulfur are hence actively and preferentially consumed in the marine environment due to the energetic advantage they confer to build cell proteins the main reduced sulfur containing molecule in the oceans is dmsp a ubiquitous compound in the upper layers of the water column it is produced by many species of phytoplankton in the euphotic ocean keller et al 1989 where it represents a major pool of reduced sulfur bates et al 1994 at the global scale dmsp and its breakdown product dimethylsufide dms can supply most of the sulfur and part of the carbon requirements of marine microbial communities kiene and linn 2000 simó et al 2009 dmsp degradation genes have been identified mostly in alphaproteobacteria mainly sar11 and roseobacter which can explain the absence of these genes in our treatments where flavobacteriia and gammaproteobacteria harbored most of the transcripts related to sulfur metabolism until now nobody has put into the equation the presence of synthetic compounds containing reduced sulfur in the oceans however our results point to a very efficient use of the reduced sulfur from pfos molecules the fast desulfurization of pfos more than 50 after 48 h can be a feature of polar environments specially stressed in port foster bay deception island thanks to the hydrothermal venting activity and underwater volcanism possibly selecting for microorganisms suited to live in the presence of several forms of sulfur containing molecules somoza et al 2004 pfos desulfurization promoted the expression of genes related to sulfur oxidation sulfur incorporation and dmsp degradation pointing to the use of pfos as a reducing power source sulfur source for bacterial biomass a direct interference to dmsp cycling in the oceans concentrations of pfos are low in oceanic waters compared with those of dmsp however there are other poly and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates in antarctic waters casal et al 2017a and other anthropogenic organic chemicals containing sulfur such as dibenzothiophenes among others casal et al 2018 that substantially increase the concentration of anthropogenic organic sulfur compounds how widespread this interaction between the unquantified pool of anthropogenic organosulfur compounds and sulfur cycle is in polar environments a matter of future research 4 conclusions dose response assays and short versus long term exposure experiments with a mix of pfos and pfoa performed under in situ conditions with coastal antarctic microbial communities deception island showed fast biodegradation rates of pfos with a half life of 43 h while pfoa remained undegraded gene expression profiles of the pfos degrading bacterial communities showed a significant increase of transcripts encoding for sulfur metabolisms after pfos pfoa addition suggesting desulfurization of pfos molecules the sulfite functional moiety of the pfos molecule was used as a source of reducing power and sulfur for building cell biomass by specific bacterial groups namely gammaproteobacteria agreeing with the few bacteria that are known so far as pfaas degraders and flavobacteriia which has been previously reported to have positive correlation to pfaas tolerant this study suggests the potential of antarctic microbial communities to consume pfos in seawater under aerobic conditions and opens

18224,perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoate pfoa acids are ubiquitous in the oceans including remote regions and are toxic to fish and mammals the impact to the lowest trophic levels of the food web however remains unknown we challenged natural bacterial communities inhabiting antarctic coastal waters deception island with pfos and pfoa concentrations ranging from 2 ng l to 600 ng l that selected for tolerant taxa after 48 h concentrations of pfos decreased by more than 50 and sulfur metabolism related transcripts were significantly enriched in the treatments suggesting desulfurization of pfos conversely no significant differences were found between initial and final pfoa concentrations gammaproteobacteria and roseobacter two abundant groups of marine bacteria increased their relative activity after 24 h of incubation whereas flavobacteriia became the main contributor in the treatments after 6 days community activities extracellular enzyme activity and absolute number of transcripts were higher in the treatments than in the controls while bacterial abundances were lower in the treatments suggesting a selection of pfos and pfoa tolerant community in the exposed treatments our results show a direct effect of pfos and pfoa exposure on the composition and functionality of natural antarctic marine microbial communities while no evidence of defluorination of pfos or pfoa was detected probable desulfurization of pfos depicts a direct link with the sulfur biogeochemistry of the ocean graphical abstract image 1 keywords marine bacteria

others is a matter of increasing concern as it has been observed in both fish and mammals corsini et al 2014 dewitt et al 2008 2016 pfos and pfoa are globally transported by oceanic currents and by sea salt aerosols ahrens et al 2010 benskin et al 2012 gonzález gaya et al 2014 johansson et al 2019 in addition atmospheric transport of volatile neutral precursors and subsequent oxidation and deposition is also a potential source of pfaas to remote regions martin et al 2006 del vento et al 2012 young and mabury 2010 pfaas have been reported to be ubiquitous in remote areas such as antarctic waters wei et al 2007 ahrens et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 cai et al 2012 casal et al 2017a long range transport persistence and toxicity are proprieties that these substances share with other persistent organic pollutants pops pfos has been the first pfaa to have a global restriction but not a ban on its production and use being added to annex b of the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants pops paul et al 2009 exposure to pfaas by microorganisms can originate an increased permeability of cell membranes alteration of membrane fluidity xie et al 2010 hu et al 2003 and

concentrations of pfaas to escherichia coli determined a half inhibitory concentration ic50 of 10 6 1 0 mg l for pfoa and 374 3 mg l for pfos liu et al 2016 at lower concentrations it has been demonstrated that 10 μg l of pfos was sufficient for increasing the sensitivity of the quorum sensing response in aliivibrio fischeri fitzgerald et al 2018 most of these studies have been performed under standardized laboratory experiments using model cultures effects might change between individual strains and the mix of species found in microbiomes in mice gut microbiome for instance pfos exposure caused potentially harmful interactions between pfos and microbial and animal metabolisms lai et al 2018 unfortunately no studies have attempted to check the effects of pfaas on environmental microbiomes despite the high stability of the c f bound dehalogenation of fluoroacetate by microorganisms was first reported by goldman 1965 some previous studies suggest that pfos and pfoa dehalogenation is a favorable thermodynamic reaction under reductive conditions and is thus expected to occur in anaerobic environments such as in soils sediments or in some wastewater treatment plant wwtp compartments however few studies have been able to actually detect degradation in field studies beškoski et al 2018 assumed that metabolites determined by lc ms in microbial consortia isolated from river sediments and incubated with pfos and pfoa were associated with unsaturated monofluorinated fatty acids and hydrocarbons with multiple unsaturated bonds or ring structures other studies have observed the decrease of pfos and pfoa concentrations under incubations with microorganisms isolated from contaminated soils yi et al 2016 2018 chetverikov et al 2017 chetverikov and loginov 2019 river sediments beškoski et al 2018 and wastewater treatment sludge kwon et al 2014 mejia avendaño et al 2015 however defluorination products of pfos or pfoa were not detected this study aimed to analyze the effects of pfos and pfoa to pristine remote microorganisms given that pfaas have been introduced in the environment during the last fifty years and their distant resemblance to natural products we wanted to test whether microbial communities have already evolved the capacity to degrade these compounds if any potential degradation due to co metabolism occurs or if toxic effects were predominant as a microbial response to pfaas dose response assays and short versus long term exposure experiments with a mix of pfos and pfoa were performed under in situ conditions with coastal antarctic microbial communities potential biodegradation and sub lethal effects were detected by using a combination of chemical physiological molecular and metatranscriptomic techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experiments experiments were carried out in january february 2017 using surface seawater collected by submerging a rinsed polypropylene bottle 20 l an arm length into the water from a zodiac in port foster bay 62 59 386 s 60 37 115 w the inner bay of deception island south shetland islands antarctica three experiments were performed by challenging marine in situ natural populations with a mix of pfoa and pfos hereafter called pfaas mix at different concentrations and exposure times pfoa and pfos in the mix were at a 1 0 6 proportion to mirror natural relative occurrence in seawater as previously reported casal et al 2017a all experiments were run in duplicate under aerobic conditions ensured by daily opening of the incubation bottles 2 1 1 dose response experiments microbial communities were exposed at four different concentrations of the pfaas mix no addition control 2 ng l low 60 ng l mid and 600 ng l high incubations were carried out in polypropylene 50 ml falcon centrifuge tubes that were spiked with the pfaas mix and let the solvent to evaporate during 2 h under the hood at room temperature before seawater addition control tubes were prepared following the same protocol and with the same volume of solvent but without any pollutant addition incubations were done in the dark and at in situ temperature for 48 h changes in community composition were monitored by quantifying bacterial abundance ba by flow cytometry at initial time point and after 3 h 24 h and 48 h of incubation and by card fish at initial and final time

buffer at a flow rate of 400 μl min injection and instrumental conditions as well as ms ms parameters for the target compounds can be found in gonzález gaya et al 2014 quantification was based on a linear eight point calibration curve 0 01 10 pg μl those samples that showed pfos or pfoa concentrations above the curve range were diluted using the injection standard to match the calibration range fluorinated materials were avoided during field and lab work field and lab blanks covering the whole sampling and analytical procedure were conducted field blanks were stored and transported from antarctica to test for possible external contamination limits of detection lod were calculated as the analyte mean concentration corresponding to the sample blanks plus three standard deviations being 7 25 and 3 29 pg l for pfoa and pfos respectively target compounds were identified based on similar retention times and a ratio between the monitored ions of 20 of the mean values obtained for the

processing in the lab the remaining volume approx 1 l was filtered using a 0 2 μm pore size sterivex filters millipore sterivex filters were stored dry at 20 c until dna extraction see below a metatranscriptomic approach was performed following the protocol used by poretsky et al 2010 with minor modifications described in cerro galvez et al 2019a briefly total rna was extracted dna removed rrna depleted and mrna enriched by amplification three mrna standards were synthesized gifford et al 2011 by in vitro transcription from plasmids with restriction enzyme ptxb1 vector new england biolabs ipswich ma with ncoi restriction enzyme promega madison wi pfn18k halotag t7 flexi vector promega madison wi with bamhi restriction enzyme promega madison wi and pgem 4z promega madison wi with scal restriction enzyme promega madison wi these artificial mrnas were added after rna extraction but before mrna enrichment as in cerro gálvez et al 2019a and used as an internal standard moran et al 2013 satinsky et al 2013 relative standard error of internal standards was 22 5 final amplified rnas were sequenced at the national center for genomic analysis cnag barcelona spain using illumina high output mode hs200 2x100bp v4 sterivex filters for dna analysis were filled with lysis buffer 50 mm tris hcl 40 mm edta 0 75 m sucrose and incubated at 37 c for 45 min with a 5 mg ml

sequencing was of rdna 16s conducted at the pompeu fabra university sequencing service 2 9 bioinformatics cdna sequences were quality trimmed and internal standards and any remaining stable rna was quantified and removed using the bowtie2 mapping program langmead and salzberg 2012 against the internal standard sequences and an in house database of marine bacterial stable rna sequences rrna and trna respectively subsequently read pairs were joined using the pear program https www h its org en research sco software joined pairs as well as separate reads not corresponding to joined pairs were aligned to the ncbi refseq database downloaded october 2016 using the diamond aligner v0 8 25 buchfink et al 2014 in blastx mode with default parameters the resulting alignments were taxonomically and functionally classified with megan 6 5 10 huson et al 2016 and exported for further analysis in r tidyverse sequences belonging to archaea and eukaryotic cells were excluded due to low abundances a total of 14 metatranscriptomes samples were recovered ranging in size from 48 to 98 million paired end reads of 101 bp per dataset table s2 among the close to one billion total reads 460 million were possible protein encoding sequences after quality trimming an average of 23 3 9 1 of the protein coding reads had a functional annotation based on seed database and subcategories and an average of 21 2 4 9 were taxonomically annotated see below for details on transcript annotation 16s reads were trimmed denoised merged and bimera checked with dada2 callahan et al 2016 version 1 10 0 taxonomical annotation was performed with the qiime 2 naive bayesian algorithm version 2018 8 0 bokulich et al 2018 against the silva database quast et al 2012 version 132 2 10 statistical analyses all data analyses were performed in r software significant differences between treatments and controls were analyzed with student s t test non metric multidimensional scaling nmds or analysis of variance anova using the vegan package oksanen et al 2018 the threshold for significance was set at p 0 05 analysis of differential gene abundances was performed with the edger package dimont et al 2015 temporal variation of pfos and pfoa in long term experiments were evaluated by means of multiple linear regression analysis including concentration as dependent variable and the abundance of high and low dna bacteria chlorophyll a nutrient concentrations and the enzymatic activities as independent variables only those variables that were significant were left at the final regression text s1 the degradation rate of pfos was determined by a linear regression between the logarithm of concentration pfos pfoa as we used the benchmarking approach and time 0 24 48 96 144 h as predictor all regressions were performed using spss statistics version 25 0 ibm corp concentrations were ln transformed when necessary to satisfy normal distribution and variance homogeneity criteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 dose response assays no statistically significant differences anova test p 0 05 were observed in neither community composition nor functional profile between controls and treatments after 48 h with pfaa concentrations up to 600 ng l highest concentration tested fig 1 this is consistent with previous studies showing significant changes in marine community composition at pfaa concentrations higher than those used in our exposure experiments 1000 ng l zhang et al 2019 cerro gálvez et al 2019b minor effects of pfaas on river delta marine community composition were observed when compared with the roles of geochemical parameters and phytoplankton chen et al 2019 when exposed to in situ concentrations whereas no trends were distinguished in the structure of the communities increased boncat activities were observed in the gammaproteobacteria and roseobacter groups in treatments with pfaas gammaproteobacteria and roseobacter displayed maximum increases of 1 7 and 1 6 fold respectively compared with the controls at the mid concentration 60 ng l of pfaas mix fig 1 in agreement with this these two phylogenetic groups were the main responders to increasing additions of pfos in mediterranean marine communities although gammaproteobacteria showed opposite patterns decrease and increase in relative abundances in coastal and offshore communities cerro gálvez et al 2019b we observed a decline of eea of chit with increasing pfaa concentrations fig 1 although chitobiase enzymatic activities are not apparently linked to pfas exposure increased chit activities were observed in offshore mediterranean waters at high pfos concentrations concomitant with increased relative abundances of flavobacteriia cerro gálvez et al 2019b this group is known to have a high affinity to degrade high molecular weight compounds including biopolymers thus potentially linked to chitinolytic activities kirchman 2002 veliz et al 2017 in our incubations pfaa addition stimulated proteobacteria mainly gammaproteobacteria and roseobacter within alphaproteobacteria rather than the other phyla such as flavobacteriia without major differences between doses supporting the observed decline of chit activities in pfaas amendments low and mid concentrations from dose response bioassays were selected for short term 24 h experiments while mid concentrations were chosen for long term 6 days exposure experiments responses were detailed at the transcriptional level for short and long term experiments while chemical concentrations were analyzed for long term experiments at different times of exposure 3 2 concentrations of pfaas in long term experiment in situ seawater concentrations of pfos and pfoa were 36 pg l and 27 pg l respectively comparable to the low concentrations measured in antarctic coastal seawaters and offshore regions wei et al 2007 ahrens et al 2010 cai et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 for example concentrations are close to those measured in coastal waters from livingston island south shetland islands antarctica that averaged 20 35 pg l of pfos and 69 39 pg l of pfoa casal et al 2017a dissolved phase concentrations of pfos at the end of the long term experiment were significantly lower than the initial nominal concentrations t test p 0 005 table s3 and notably lower than in the first measurement after 24 h of incubation conversely pfoa concentrations did not decrease significantly during the 6 days of the long term experiment t test p 0 13 in this work pfos and pfoa were measured in the dissolved phase only it is well known that when performing incubations using hydrophobic pops in microcosms small volumes there are losses due to adsorption to the bottle walls among others fernández pinos et al 2017 cerro gálvez et al 2019a even though this issue is of lower magnitude for the less hydrophobic pfas in addition a fraction of pfos and pfoa will partition to phytoplankton bacteria and the dissolved organic carbon present in seawater during the incubations the bioaccumulation factor bcf cplankton cwater or plankton water partition coefficients for pfos in antarctic waters log bcf 3 0 6 is not significantly different than that for pfoa log bcf 3 8 0 3 casal et al 2017a the bacteria water partition coefficients for pfaas have never been reported before but are higher than those of phytoplankton due to a larger surface to volume ratio of the cells text s1 therefore a significant fraction of pfaas can be sorbed into onto cells during the time course of the experiments and this fraction may vary over time due to changes in cell abundance and community composition therefore the mesured concentrations in the dissolved phase will not only reflect a potential degradation but also the partitioning of a variable fraction to cells and doc this variability of concentrations was similar for pfos and pfoa and could be explained by the abundance of hna bacteria and other variables related to doc text s1 in order to block the variability of concentrations due to sorption to the organic matter pools during the time course of the experiment and thus being able to determine the degradation rate of pfos we used chemical benchmarking this approach allows to improve the quantification of degradation in field and laboratory experiments mclachlan et al 2017 with this approach the degradation of a chemical is measured relative to another chemical of known persistence and the degradation is then assessed using not the absolute concentrations but the relative concentrations ratio of the target analyte over the benchmark chemical therefore the benchmark chemical is used as internal standard of the experimental set up in this work we used pfoa as a benchmark chemical and pfos as the target chemical for which biodegradation was assessed this is consistent with pfos showing a notable decrease of concentrations during the long term assay while pfoa lacking such a decrease fig 2 shows the ratio of concentrations of pfos over pfoa during the time course of the experiment thus pfos concentrations in relative abundances and shows a clear exponential decay as the ratio of pfos and pfoa is evaluated instead of absolute concentrations of pfos alone this approach blocks the variability in dissolved concentrations due to sorption to bottle walls cells and doc as both chemicals have similar hydrophobicity similar bcf fitting ln pfos versus time resulted in a regression r2 0 42 p 0 05 with a degradation constant of 0 016 h 1 corresponding to a half life of pfos in the long term experiment of 43 h that is a disappearance of more than 50 after 48 h fig 2 similar fast pfos degradation rates have been observed in cultures of specific consumers e g pseudomonas aeruginosa strain hj4 kwon et al 2014 and pseudomonas plecoglossicida strain 2 4 d chetverikov et al 2017 in terms of environmental relevance of these degradation rates for the occurrence of pfos in oceanic waters it would be surprising that such fast degradation occurs in the global oceans as pfos is ubiquitously found in seawater benskin et al 2012 gonzález gaya et al 2014 first it is possible that antarctic or polar microbial communities are especially suited for such degradation secondly it could happen that the biogeochemical conditions in antarctic coastal waters favor this process see discussion below for potential use of sulfur from pfos enzyme mediated degradation rates are dependent on the chemical substrate concentration a consequence of michaelis menten kinetics in laboratory experiments it has been shown that pollutant biodegradation is activated by the addition of high concentrations of substrate li and mclachlan 2019 as it could have happened in our spiked treatments in controls containing field in situ concentrations of pfaas concentrations of pfos also decreased by 31 during the long term experiment not significant while this decrease was of 85 in the treatments with pfaas significant p 0 05 thus with pfos concentrations 100 fold those found in situ the ubiquity of pfos in oceans provides evidence that it is slowly degraded and remains in the surface ocean for long periods as estimated previously for tropical and subtropical oceans gonzález gaya et al 2014 casal et al 2017b in most oceanic regions pfos concentrations are higher than those of pfoa wei et al 2007 ahrens et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 gonzález gaya et al 2014 casal et al 2017a the median in the ratio pfos pfoa is 4 0 in temperate oceanic waters with values of 4 2 in the atlantic 4 0 in the indian and 3 8 in the pacific oceans gonzález gaya et al 2014 lower ratios have been observed in antarctic waters ranging from 0 3 to 2 2 in several sites including offshore and coastal areas wei et al 2007 zhao et al 2012 casal et al 2017a the ratio measured in our samples 1 3 falls in the range of antarctic samples these results suggest a potential of pfos degradation by polar microorganisms higher than in temperate seawater gonzález gaya et al 2014 in order to identify potential pfos degraders and degradation pathways we turned to molecular analyses 3 3 community composition profiles in short and long term experiment in general bacterial abundances in the treatments were higher than in the controls over the time course of the experiments without distinction between hna and lna cells however after 6 days bacterial abundances significantly dropped in the pfaa exposed communities fig 3 and table s4 community composition varied over the time course of the experiments based on 16s rdna sequencing analyses although no significant changes were recorded at higher taxonomic levels between treatments and controls bacterial communities after 6 days of pfaas exposure fig s1 fig s2 some specific taxa got significantly enriched after 24 h and after 6 days table s5 the larger number of taxa increasing in the pfaas mix enrichments belonged to gammaproteobacteria especially alteromonadales and flavobacteriia mainly flavobacteriales these results were in agreement with card fish counts in which gammaproteobacteria and flavobacteriia increased in relative abundance in the treatments after 24 h and after 6 days respectively fig 3 in concordance with our results the few pfos and pfoa biodegraders isolated so far belong to the proteobacteria phylum especially to the gammaproteobacteria class and the genus pseudomonas table s6 both pseudomonas and alteromonas are closely related genera common in the marine environment baumann et al 1983 in the environment few communities have been analyzed in relation to pfaa concentrations in freshwater sediments betaproteobacteria and epsilonproteobacteria are recognized tolerant classes to high pfaa concentrations table s6 sun et al 2016 li et al 2017 but these studies did not report degradation of any pfaa interestingly in surface seawaters bacteroidetes have been reported to have positive correlations to in situ concentrations of pfaas chen et al 2019 3 4 functional profiles in short and long term experiment generally specific eea decreased in the pfaa exposed treatments after 24 h with significant decreases in leu amp and apa fig 3 this decrease after a short exposure contrast with the eea increases observed after 6 days being significant for β glc this is consistent with the observed changes in communities but also suggests that potential toxic effects were overcome by gammaproteobacteria after 6 days of exposure which may have contributed to this response in terms of eea the lower abundance of cells but higher specific eea activities after 6 days suggests the development of a tolerant community including gammaproteobacteria these results are in agreement with boncat percentages and that absolute number of transcripts were generally lower in the pfaas treatments than in the controls after 24 h but higher after 6 days figs 3 and s3 taxonomy of the metatranscriptomic reads indicated a higher relative abundance of transcripts harbored by gammaproteobacteria and rhodobacterales after 24 h and bacteroidetes including flavobacteriia after 6 days fig 4 in agreement with boncat trends in dose response bioassays differences in sar11 activities low in metatranscriptomes high in boncat figs 3 and 4 can be due to the already described divergences between card fish probes and 16s primers especially in the sar11 group from antarctic waters cerro gálvez et al 2019a individual significantly deferentially expressed genes in the treatments than in the controls edger test fdr 0 05 showed a higher transcriptional activity of flavobacteriia after 6 days accounting for most of the up regulated genes along with sar11 table s7 interestingly as many as 19 individual transcripts in the respiration seed category increased indicating a rising of heterotrophic activity by the pfoa tolerant community fig 5 bacteroidetes and proteobacteria have been reported to be the selected resistant bacteria in lab scale sequencing batch reactor continuously exposed to high pfoa concentrations in the order of mg l yu et al 2018 seed functional categories dna metabolism and sulfur metabolism got significantly enriched after 24 h t test p 0 05 but not after 6 days fig 5 consistent with the sharp decrease of pfos concentrations in the short term incubation and suggesting a linkage of pfos consumption to the sulfur cycle in taxonomic groups able to actively grow on pfos desulfurization figs 2 and s4 several significant more than 2 fold increases of genes in different sulfur related categories in pfaa treatments were observed after 24 h including genes related to dimethylsulfoniopropionate dmsp metabolism and sulfur oxidation fig 6 the higher the concentrations of pfaas the higher number of up regulated sulfur related genes individual significant differentially expressed sulfur related genes in the pfaa treatments were also more abundant after 24 h than after 6 days table s7 the enriched genes were classified into three main categories firstly release of sulfite group encoding lyases of the carbon so3 bond three different gene families were identified potentially encoding this process sulfonate and alkanesulfonate monooxygenases potentially forming perfluorooctanol as transformation product dmsp related genes encoding the first step of dmsp degradation both dmsp lyases dddp dddd etc and dmsp demethylase dmda and sulfatase genes which are sulfohydrolases secondly oxidation of sulfite to sulfate mostly encoded by sox family genes showing the use of pfos as source of reducing power and a third category including reduction of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide encoded by the bidirectional enzyme sulfite reductase and incorporation of sulfur pfos in bacterial biomass through homocysteine and cysteine metabolism figs 7 and s5 and table s7 consistent with metatranscriptomes and boncat results most of these genes were encoded by gammaproteobacteria flavobacteriia sar11 and rhodobacterales figs 1 4 s5 and table s7 these groups are known degraders of reduced sulfur in the oceans so far described mainly for dmsp and main players in the inorganic sulfur metabolism gonzález et al 1999 yoch 2002 vila costa et al 2006 2010 unfortunately the absence of identified genes specifically encoding pfos degradation pathways hampers a direct comparison of our results with previously reported metatranscriptomic data for pfos degradation in addition the fact that differentially expressed genes belonged to the sulfur metabolism seed category further confirms that degradation was related to desulfurization but not to defluorination in fact no evidence of formation of perfluoroheptanoic acid fig 7 as suggested elsewhere chetverikov et al 2017 was found in this work while formation of perfluoroctanol was feasible perfluorooctanol must have a very high henry s law constant as polyfluorinated telomers have and thus if perfluorooctanol was formed it was either lost by volatilization or sorbed to cells during the incubations and could not be detected in the dissolved phase conversely perfluoroheptanoic acid was analyzed in controls and treatments results not shown but it did not show a significant increase of comparable magnitude with the decrease of pfos the potential linkage between pfos desulfurization and the sulfur biogeochemical cycle suggested by our data should be further explored for instance the few groups identified at sites with high concentrations of pfaas correspond to species directly related to sulfur metabolism such as thiobacillus and sulfurimonas in freshwater sediments table s6 sun et al 2016 li et al 2017 3 5 potential impact of pfos desulfurization to the sulfur biogeochemical cycle sulfate is at mm concentrations in seawater and bacteria have the capability to reduce it so that they never get limited by this element muyzer and stams 2008 however the use of sulfur available in a reduced form is energetically advantageous molecules containing reduced sulfur are hence actively and preferentially consumed in the marine environment due to the energetic advantage they confer to build cell proteins the main reduced sulfur containing molecule in the oceans is dmsp a ubiquitous compound in the upper layers of the water column it is produced by many species of phytoplankton in the euphotic ocean keller et al 1989 where it represents a major pool of reduced sulfur bates et al 1994 at the global scale dmsp and its breakdown product dimethylsufide dms can supply most of the sulfur and part of the carbon requirements of marine microbial communities kiene and linn 2000 simó et al 2009 dmsp degradation genes have been identified mostly in alphaproteobacteria mainly sar11 and roseobacter which can explain the absence of these genes in our treatments where flavobacteriia and gammaproteobacteria harbored most of the transcripts related to sulfur metabolism until now nobody has put into the equation the presence of synthetic compounds containing reduced sulfur in the oceans however our results point to a very efficient use of the reduced sulfur from pfos molecules the fast desulfurization of pfos more than 50 after 48 h can be a feature of polar environments specially stressed in port foster bay deception island thanks to the hydrothermal venting activity and underwater volcanism possibly selecting for microorganisms suited to live in the presence of several forms of sulfur containing molecules somoza et al 2004 pfos desulfurization promoted the expression of genes related to sulfur oxidation sulfur incorporation and dmsp degradation pointing to the use of pfos as a reducing power source sulfur source for bacterial biomass a direct interference to dmsp cycling in the oceans concentrations of pfos are low in oceanic waters compared with those of dmsp however there are other poly and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates in antarctic waters casal et al 2017a and other anthropogenic organic chemicals containing sulfur such as dibenzothiophenes among others casal et al 2018 that substantially increase the concentration of anthropogenic organic sulfur compounds how widespread this interaction between the unquantified pool of anthropogenic organosulfur compounds and sulfur cycle is in polar environments a matter of future research 4 conclusions dose response assays and short versus long term exposure experiments with a mix of pfos and pfoa performed under in situ conditions with coastal antarctic microbial communities deception island showed fast biodegradation rates of pfos with a half life of 43 h while pfoa remained undegraded gene expression profiles of the pfos degrading bacterial communities showed a significant increase of transcripts encoding for sulfur metabolisms after pfos pfoa addition suggesting desulfurization of pfos molecules the sulfite functional moiety of the pfos molecule was used as a source of reducing power and sulfur for building cell biomass by specific bacterial groups namely gammaproteobacteria agreeing with the few bacteria that are known so far as pfaas degraders and flavobacteriia which has been previously reported to have positive correlation to pfaas tolerant this study suggests the potential of antarctic microbial communities to consume pfos in seawater under aerobic conditions and opens the door to include anthropogenic organic sulfur compounds in the biogeochemical cycling of reduced sulfur in the oceans author contributions ecg jd and mvc designed the study ecg and mvc wrote the
