19590,while slow sand filters ssfs have produced drinking water for more than a hundred years understanding of their associated microbial communities is limited in this study bacteria in influent and effluent water from full scale ssfs were explored using flow cytometry fcm with cytometric histogram image comparison chic analysis and routine microbial counts for heterotrophs total coliforms and escherichia coli to assess if fcm can monitor biofilm function ssfs differing in age and sand composition were compared fcm profiles from two established filters were indistinguishable to examine biofilm in the deep sand bed ssfs were monitored during a scraping event when the top layer of sand and the schmutzdecke are removed to restore flow through the filter the performance of an established ssf was stable total organic carbon toc ph numbers of heterotrophs coliforms e coli and fcm bacterial profile were unaffected by scraping however the performance of two newly built ssfs containing new and mixed sand was compromised breakthrough of both microbial indicators and toc occurred following scraping the compromised performance of the new ssfs was reflected in distinct effluent bacterial communities and the presence of microbial indicators correlated to influent bacterial communities this demonstrated that fcm can monitor ssf performance removal of the top layer of sand did not alter the effluent water from the established ssf but did affect that of the ssfs containing new sand this suggests that the impact of the surface biofilm on effluent water is greater when the deep sand bed biofilm is not established graphical abstract image keywords slow sand filters drinking water flow cytometry schmutzdecke cytometric histogram image comparison chic biofilm 1 introduction one of the oldest technologies for the treatment of drinking water is the use of slow sand filters ssfs huisman and wood 1974 these filters combine multiple cleaning mechanisms including mechanical filtration and sedimentation but are primarily considered as biological filters where a microbial ecosystem develops as biofilm on the sand particles and contributes to the cleaning process haig et al 2015b as ssfs remove a broad range of microbial contaminants including escherichia coli clostridium spp cryptosporidium spp viral pathogens and toxins bourne et al 2006 elliott et al 2008 hijnen et al 2007 as well as total organic carbon toc wotton 2002 monitoring the performance of these filters is crucial for the drinking water producer this type of monitoring however is complicated by limitations in both knowledge regarding the microbial diversity in these filters and the analytical methods that are able to follow this diversity in real time or near real time resolution understanding these human built aquatic ecosystems would facilitate both routine monitoring for quality control as well as optimised design for ssfs these are both required to produce safe drinking water in a future with climate related changes such as altered natural organic matter water temperatures and pathogen contamination in source water at a time when urbanization will increase demand for treated water ritson et al 2014 sterk et al 2013 van leeuwen 2013 knowledge about the dynamics of bacterial communities in ssfs is limited by the ability of the current routine analyses to describe the microbial processes occurring in the biofilm and water phases with respect to both diversity and time heterotrophic plate counts hpc and counts of coliforms and e coli can analyse microbes passing through the ssfs and satisfy traditions of common usage and regulations however these methods only capture a small fraction of the total microbial population allen et al 2004 and at least 24 h incubation time is required studies using molecular techniques have described laboratory and pilot plant scale ssf systems bourne et al 2006 calvo bado et al 2003 wakelin et al 2011 or focused on elements of the filter such as the uppermost biofilm or schmutzdecke unger and collins 2008 wakelin et al 2011 other studies have focused on microbial contaminant removal by ssfs bauer et al 2011 elliott et al 2008 hijnen et al 2004 several metagenomic dna sequencing studies of the microbial community in full scale ssfs in operating drinking water treatment plants have shown that a highly diverse community dominated by bacteria is living in these biological filters bai et al 2013 haig et al 2014 2015b oh et al 2018 the presence of bacteriophage protozoa and fungi and their role in ssf ecology has also been examined haig et al 2015a prenafeta boldú et al 2017 these studies are invaluable for providing a deep understanding of the microbial ecosystems in ssfs however the methods used are expensive with time consuming laboratory work and demanding data analysis this currently prevents their use for online routine monitoring flow cytometry fcm with dna staining is used to study the microbial communities of numerous aquatic systems berney et al 2008 boi et al 2016 de corte et al 2016 including microbial dynamics in both treatment and distribution of drinking water besmer et al 2014 el chakhtoura et al 2015 lautenschlager et al 2014 total cell count tcc has been proposed for monitoring drinking water treatment processes van nevel et al 2017b and online measurement has been demonstrated besmer and hammes 2016 additional quantitative fcm parameters describe the bacteria in a water sample including the number of intact cells and a fluorescent fingerprint describing the distribution of dna content in the bacterial community prest et al 2013 during ssf operation the bacteria in the sand consume organic matter and multiply and over a period of months or years depending on season and source water the filter becomes clogged with biomass to restore the water flow the top layer of the ssf is removed by mechanical scraping huisman and wood 1974 this procedure may disturb the filter function and effluent water from the disturbed ssfs is not used until water quality parameters comply with regulations the ability to follow ssf function in real or near real time would minimise the time filters are offline to both ensure maximum supply of treated water and reduce costs this is particularly relevant in sweden where ssfs require scraping 2 3 times per year in this study three ssfs differing in microbial community maturation and sand composition were followed over a period of several weeks during summer before and after a scraping procedure water quality of influent and effluent were assessed using fcm and conventional microbial and chemical parameters fcm parameters together with cytometric histogram image comparison chic analysis were analysed to assess if this method could resolve dynamic changes in the bacterial communities of the effluent water in order to examine if this method could be used to monitor the function of the biofilm in ssfs these profiles were correlated to different traditional microbial water quality indicators in addition by observing the different ssfs before and after the removal of the top layer of sand including schmutzdecke the specific contribution of the deep sand bed biofilms to ssf function could be observed 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of ssfs and sampling the full scale ssfs in this study are located in sweden at ringsjö waterworks stehag sweden and operated by sydvatten ab hyllie stationstorg 21 malmö sweden during the study the treatment plant produced 1300 l sec of drinking water from surface water lake bolmen småland sweden supplemented with a small fraction of groundwater the plant receives the source water through an 82 km tunnel and treated using flocculation with ferric chloride lamellar sedimentation rapid sand filtration slow sand filtration and disinfection with hypochlorite before distribution sydvatten ab 2016 each ssf at the treatment plant is scraped 2 3 times per year usually in the summer when the resistance of flow through the filter is unacceptable the ssfs are scraped to remove the top layer of sand including the schmutzdecke and then refilled with water from below the sand bed in winter 2015 two new ssfs were built at ringsjö waterworks one was constructed using only purchased virgin sand sibelco nordic ab baskarp sweden new while the second ssf mix was constructed with first a layer of virgin sand topped with a layer of washed sand collected during previous scraping of established ssfs a third ssf a well established working ssf est in the same production line as the newly constructed filters and used for drinking water production over 20 years built 1995 was included in sampling as a control persson 2013 water samples were collected during july and august 2015 from above the sand beds using a telescopic sampler and after filtration from continuously running taps samples were collected using sterilized borosilicate bottles one day before and for up to three weeks after the scraping of each ssf as scraping for each filter was not carried out on the same calendar day data and comparisons are presented relative to the day of scraping with day 1 being the day before scraping day 2 being the day of the scraping activity and so forth all three ssfs were scraped within the same three week period of stable ambient temperatures data not shown in summer 2016 april august est and a second mature ssf from the same treatment line est2 were sampled in the same way as describe above except that water samples were collected directly into 50 ml falcon tubes and not transferred from the borosilicate bottles 2 2 water quality measurements water samples for conventional microbial parameters were processed by the treatment plant staff according to a routine schedule and coincided in time with the flow cytometry analysis heterotrophic plate counts hpc were determined by mixing 1 ml of water with r2a agar with incubation at 22 c for 72 h bartram et al 2003 concentration of coliforms and e coli were determined with the colilert method from idexx laboratories using the quanti tray 2000 and sealed with quanti tray sealer according to the manufacturer s instructions idexx laboratories westbrook usa chemical water quality parameters were determined by va syd malmö sweden using standard methods table s1 the temperature of the water over the studied period was measured online in the bulk water at the outlet of the treatment plant 2 3 flow cytometry samples of 50 ml water for flow cytometry were transferred and stored in sterile 50 ml falcon tubes on ice and analyzed within 7 h of sampling water samples were stained in triplicate for measurement of total cell count and fingerprints according to prest et al 2013 briefly 5 μl ml 1 of sybr green i at 100 x diluted with dmso stock concentration 10 000 x invitrogen ag switzerland was added to samples at room temperature to a final concentration of 1 x sybr green i before incubation in the dark at 37 c for 15 min for intact cell measurements a working solution of sybr green i 100 x and propidium iodide pi 1 mg ml sigma aldrich germany was prepared with final concentrations of 1 x sybr green i and 3 μm pi in the sample and incubated as above gillespie et al 2014 live and ethanol killed e coli were used as controls for examination of cells with intact membranes referred to hereafter as intact cells as well as milliq water as a control for background fluorescence were used in every run all measurements were performed using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer becton dickinson belgium with a 50 mw laser with an emission wavelength at 488 nm a quality control of the flow cytometer using spherotech 8 peak and 6 peak validation beads bd biosciences was conducted each day measurements were taken in order to allow samples from different days to be compared 50 μl of 500 μl samples were measured in triplicate for each sample at a flow rate of 35 μl min 1 and a threshold of 500 arbitrary units on the green fluorescence channel 2 4 data analysis data processing and gating were performed with flowjo software tree star inc usa signals were collected and analyzed by gating on the dot plot with green fluorescence fl1 533 30 nm and red fluorescence fl3 670 nm gating was done following the gating strategy described in prest et al 2013 and identical gating was applied on all samples the gated data visualized by the green fluorescence histogram plot is referred to as the fluorescent fingerprint percentage of bacteria with low nucleic acid content lna and bacteria with high nucleic acid content hna were determined as described in prest et al 2013 statistical analysis was performed on all data tcc icc and hna concentration using one way anova followed by tukey test in r r development core team 2017 cytometric histogram image comparison chic analysis on dot plots was performed using r packages flowchic and flowcore ellis et al 2016 and visualized by ggplot2 wickham 2009 according to schumann et al 2015 and koch et al 2013 gated populations of the flow cytometric dot plots green fluorescence at x axis and red fluorescence at y axis were converted into 300 300 pixel images with 64 channel gray scale resolution for image comparison and to generate values describing the differences between water samples a nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plot based on bray curtis dissimilarity was created from the results and analysis of similarities anosim was performed with the formed clusters all statistical calculations were performed in r r development core team 2017 the correlation between the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of the fcm data and the conventional microbial parameters hpc coliforms and e coli was determined using the r function envfit vegan package oksanen et al 2017 only parameters from plate counts with a significant effect p value 0 05 are presented after the sampling and fcm analysis were completed plate count data collected as part of the routine monitoring schedule were obtained from the laboratory at ringsjö waterworks only fcm profiles and plate counts obtained on the same sampling day were used for the correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 conventional water quality assessments water quality parameters including specific microbial indicators were measured during a routine scraping event and subsequent operation period for three ssfs fig 1 influent water showed variations in the concentration of microbial indicators i e hpc coliforms and e coli between filters and over time despite the fact that all ssfs received water from the same process line at the treatment plant effluent water samples from the three ssfs contained heterotrophs during the entire sampling period the established ssf hereafter referred to as est had the lowest mean value of heterotrophs calculated over time of the three filters at 1 8 1 6 cfu ml counts for coliforms and e coli above zero were detected in effluent water from the established filter only once during the 35 days of sampling at 1 cfu per 100 ml of breakthrough coliforms the ssf with mixed sand mix both coliforms and e coli were detected in the effluent water following the scraping event with a steady decrease of indicators detected over operation time and no detection of e coli after day 8 the ssf containing all new sand new showed frequent breakthroughs of coliforms and e coli in effluent water during the entire sampling period chemical parameters for water quality were measured in the influent and effluent water for each filter table s1 the three ssfs showed similar values for parameters such as nitrite total phosphorus and conductivity but differed with respect to toc and ph toc and ph of the effluent water of est were lower and more stable than effluent from mix and new toc across est was reduced 0 6 mg l 0 2 mg l from a mean value of 2 9 mg l 0 09 mg l in the influent water to 2 2 mg l 0 09 mg l in effluent this was in contrast to that observed for the new ssfs where there was less reduction of toc mix gave a reduction in toc of 0 2 mg l 0 0 mg l mean value of toc in influent 2 9 mg l 0 1 mg l to effluent 2 7 0 1 mg l mg l and toc was reduced 0 1 mg l 0 0 mg l for new mean value of toc in influent 2 8 mg l 0 05 mg l to effluent 2 7 mg l 0 05 mg l in est ph was lowered from a mean value of 7 8 to 7 4 while the ph of the influent and effluent water of both mix and new were unaffected by filtration and remained with a mean value of 7 7 3 2 flow cytometric bacterial counts total cell counts tcc were determined by fcm to assess changes in the number of bacterial cells in the influent and effluent water of the three ssfs during the routine scraping event fig 2 tccs of the influent and effluent water of est peaked one day after scraping sampling day 3 with 6 105 1 5 104 cells ml 1 in the influent and 3 9 105 1 9 103 cells ml 1 in the effluent water this was the highest tcc observed in this study tcc values in effluent from the newly built filters were in the same order of magnitude with an average of 2 7 105 5 3 104 cells ml 1 in effluent water across the three filters after scraping sampling days 7 10 for est and mix sampling days 6 11 for new the average reduction in tcc performed by est was 16 1 compared to mix at 25 3 and new at 30 1 tcc in the effluent water from est reached a steady state level at 5 days after the scraping event sampling day 7 with almost no change in bacterial numbers over the following sampling days this was not observed for the two newly constructed filters calculating the slope values from linear regression of tcc time showed the stability of the effluent tcc from est giving a rate of change for est tcc over 10 times lower than that observed for either of the newly built ssfs est 1090 mix 13100 new 17800 intact cell counts showed similar trends as tcc data not shown effluent water from est had on average 80 intact cells with a statistically significantly higher p value 0 05 than both mix and new averages of 73 and 76 intact cells respectively the percentage of intact cells in effluent waters from mix and new were not statistically different from each other fig 3 effluent water from all filters contained on average more intact cells than influent with one exception from mix before the scraping event sampling day 1 where the influent had a higher icc 3 3 profiling bacterial communities by flow cytometric measurements fluorescence distribution histograms from fcm were used to compare dna stained bacterial cells in the ssf influent and effluent waters each histogram image represents a cumulative fluorescent profile of the individual cells in the bacterial community of a water samples prest et al 2013 histograms were visualised by fcm as fluorescence fingerprints fingerprints obtained from 64 influent water samples from three ssfs showed similar patterns indicating comparable bacterial communities with no significant differences in concentration of high nucleic acid bacteria hna fig s1 one exception was influent water for est sampled one day after scraping sample day 3 with an altered fingerprint and hna concentration of 48 8 0 95 this anomaly was likely due to cells entering the influent due to disturbance of the ssf biofilm when the ssf was refilled from below after scraping fluorescence fingerprints of effluent from est and mix showed a lower concentration of hna with a dramatic shift in community composition towards bacteria with low nucleic acid content lna fig 4 the effluent from est had on average 29 6 2 78 hna bacteria and mix effluent had 39 5 3 09 hna although only est maintained a steady state level of lna bacteria after the scraping event in contrast effluent water from new increased in the concentration of hna bacteria over time and always contained a higher hna concentration than the other effluent waters with an average of 46 6 4 43 hna all gated cell dot plots were analyzed using chic and presented in an nmds plot to quantitatively compare the changes and dynamics in the bacterial communities fig 5 chic analysis identified four distinct clusters associated with effluent water and depending on the origin of the ssfs and one cluster which encompassed all influent water samples correlation analysis between traditional plate counts and fcm profiles showed higher levels of indicator bacteria associated with the influent water cluster in analysis of similarities anosim confirmed significant separation between all groups r value 0 933 p value 0 001 data from effluent water samples of est e and mix m were distinct from those of the influent cluster in and each other new effluent waters split into two clusters in the nmds plot n1 was associated with samples taken before and shortly after the scraping procedure in time n2 contained samples taken several days after the scraping and showed water profiles that were most similar to those of the influent in water this division in profile character for new effluent water was also observed in the fingerprints over time fig 4 the effluent water from est had visually identical fingerprints regardless of whether the samples were taken before or after scraping this uniformity was also reflected in the compact cluster of group e in the chic analysis and the steady state behavior of this ssf observed by other parameters i e coliform count the cluster representing the effluent water of mix grouped between those of est and new with day before scraping sample day 1 and the last sampling points day 10 and 14 being closer to the est cluster to determine if fcm shows the same bacterial profile for established ssfs at this treatment plant effluent water was analyzed from est and a second well established ssf est2 over a five month period chic analysis with all previous ssf effluent water data fig s2 again separated effluent waters from new and established filters and all histograms describing effluent from established filters clustered together regardless of sampling date chic analysis of data from only the established filters est 2015 2016 and est2 2016 separated into two clusters representing the communities of the influent and effluent water from both filters and confirmed by anosim r value 0 957 p value 0 001 data not shown 4 discussion next generation sequencing ngs studies of drinking water biofilters have previously shown that the effluent water community reflects the content of the biofilm haig et al 2015b li et al 2017 oh et al 2018 pinto et al 2012 some studies have examined the use of fcm to characterize the influent and effluent communities from biofilters lautenschlager et al 2014 park et al 2016 the goal of the current study was to examine if fcm can monitor biofilm status and function in ssfs with sand beds of differing maturity and sand composition including their response to a scraping event using fcm the bacterial communities in the influent and effluent water from four ssfs were followed through time chic analysis was used for statistical comparison to compare total number of cells and distribution of nucleic acid in these cells this grouped the influent water separately from the effluent water and each ssf produced effluent water with a unique bacterial profile the influent water to each ssf was the same and differences in the effluents between filters indicated that a distinct microbial biofilm inhabited each of the examined ssfs the bacterial profiles in the effluent water of the two established ssfs were similar to each other regardless of sampling year closer examination of one of these filters showed consistent chemical and biological transformation of the water quality across the sand bed including removal of microbial indicators a lowering of ph an increase in percentage of intact cells and decreased hna content regardless of fluctuations in the influent water importantly the transformation of the water quality was not dependent on the upper layer of sand scraping did not result in changes to the fcm bacterial profiles of effluent water or breakthrough of microbial indicators this was in contrast to observations in the newly built ssfs particularly the ssf containing all new sand in this ssf removal of the top layer of sand including the schmutzdecke preceded breakthrough of microbial indicators and fcm profiles showed that the community in the effluent water became more similar to that of the influent this suggests that the sand bed biofilm in these newly built filters was not able to transform the influent water to the extent observed for the established filter the role of the schmutzdecke in water purification has long been attributed to the activity of microbes living as biofilm in this region of the ssf barrett et al 1991 bauer et al 2011 huisman and wood 1974 oh et al 2018 as the function of the mature ssf was not disrupted by scraping the functional microbial community of this filter resided in the sand bed and not only in the schmutzdecke an ngs study of two full scale ssfs showed that the bacterial communities between sand samples are highly similar even when sampled from different depths haig et al 2015b and together with the results in the current study it seems these core communities contain the essential functionality of ssfs however as studies characterizing the ecology of the ssf sand bed have used extracted dna without the ability to distinguish between living and dead cells or free dna it is difficult to say which mechanisms within the sand bed ecosystem are responsible for effluent water quality stable isotope probing showed that removal of e coli from laboratory ssfs was mediated via multiple direct and indirect mechanisms including protozoal grazing viral killing reactive oxygen species produced by algae and mutualistic fungi algal interactions haig et al 2015a this study also suggested that ecosystem wide associations on multiple trophic levels are required for pathogen removal and that the absence of this complexity could explain compromised function in less diverse filter ecosystems it is also known that ssf function improves with time virus removal improved over time in constructed model systems as the schmutzdecke and deeper sand biofilm developed bauer et al 2011 and seven week old freshwater biofilms showed greater enzyme activity for removal of doc than four week old biofilms peter et al 2011 these observations are supported by the current study as the ssf which had a top layer of washed sand from other ssfs mix was more effective at removing indicator organisms at the end of the study period chic analysis showed the bacterial profile in the effluent from this ssf migrated towards that of the established filters in the days following the scraping event this suggests that the biofilm community in the mixed ssf may have been approaching that of the established filter biofilm including acquisition of ecosystem wide associations required for pathogen removal further investigation is required however to determine if the microbial ecology and or specific pathogen removal mechanisms differ between the ssfs in this study the washed sand used in construction of one ssf mix appears to have inoculated the biofilm with a community preconditioned for ssf function promoting a more rapid development of a biofilm core community similar to that in the established sand filters interestingly pagaling et al 2014 showed that the colonization of a microbial community was predictable and similar to the original community when it was introduced to an environment to which it had previously been exposed the idea that inoculation with preconditioned microbial biomass can lead to rapid establishment of ssf function is supported by laboratory studies by haig et al 2014 lab scale ssf columns constructed using sand from a full scale ssf differed non sterile columns removed indicators after a period of 4 6 weeks whereas sterile columns required 7 10 weeks to reach the same level of performance while the biofilm in the deep sand is essential for shaping the effluent water from well functioning ssfs the removal of the top layer of sand and schmutzdecke did impact the function of the new ssfs in the ssf containing all new sand new chic analysis showed that after the scraping event the effluent profiles began approaching that of the influent water this suggests that without the schmutzdecke the deep sand bed in this ssf had minimal impact on the bacterial community in the water in an ngs study examining response of established full scale ssfs to scraping overlap between communities in the influent and effluent water was concomitant with coliform breakthrough haig et al 2015b thus in filters without a well functioning microbial community in the deep sand bed the biofilm may not be able to sufficiently impact the effluent water and changes in the effluent water could be more coupled to the status of the schmutzdecke this could explain the emphasis placed on the role of the schmutzdecke in water filtration studies examining its function have largely been conducted on filters that are not performing optimally or at lab or pilot scale where a sand bed community has not had years to establish haig et al 2015b pfannes et al 2015 unger and collins 2006 the study showing effective removal of faecal indicators from wastewater identified the schmutzdecke as the essential feature of 14 week old model slow sand filters but again the communities in the influent and effluent water were indistinguishable by t rflp analysis of bacterial 16s rrna pfannes et al 2015 the study by unger and collins 2006 also showed that the removal of schmutzdecke changed filter function although again these experiments were conducted at lab scale and over a period of weeks it is not surprising that the schmutzdecke plays an important role in filtration by new ssfs as substrate concentrations and the biomass acting on the substrates are highest at the surface of the sand bed bai et al 2013 lautenschlager et al 2014 in filters where for any number of reasons time inoculation the deep sand bed biofilm cannot significantly transform the influent water the influence of schmutzdecke on filter function may thus be more obvious as biofilms in both the schmutzdecke and sand bed can entrap particles and cells and support antagonistic microbial interactions pfannes et al 2015 prenafeta boldú et al 2017 the overall function of the filter is likely a balance between the functions of the biofilm ecosystems in these different regions a recent metagenomics study predicted that the minimum generation time for a mature ssf sand bed community was shorter than that predicted for the associated schmutzdecke metagenome oh et al 2018 suggesting that the degradation of organic material which fuels microbial growth in a mature filter is higher in the sand bed then on the surface although the bacterial content in schmutzdecke is denser than in the sand bed 1011 copies ml and 108 109 copies g respectively pfannes et al 2015 the total volume of the deep sand is many times greater than that occupied by the schmutzdecke instead of being dominated by the function in the schmutzdecke the activity of the ssf community in the deeper sand is likely more significant for overall ssf performance than previously thought conclusions from lab based experiments may thus overestimate the impact of the schmutzdecke emphasizing the need for studies conducted at full scale for complete assessment of drinking water treatment by ssfs the question still remains to what extent does the biofilm transform the influent water community to obtain desirable effluent water quality in this and other studies haig et al 2015b an overlap between the bacterial communities of the influent and effluent water were concomitant with indicator breakthrough it may be a specific and significant transformation of the bacterial community between influent and effluent water that is the signature of a well functioning ssf the established filter showed the least reduction of total cells with an increase in the amount of intact cells and a decrease in hna content suggesting an exchange of communities in the water as it passed this biofilm an increase in intact cells following ssf has also been reported lautenschlager et al 2014 chic analysis showed that the bacterial communities from each ssf differed in hna suggesting that the distinct biofilms in each individual sand bed altered this aspect of the effluent hna and lna bacteria are thought to be both phylogenetically and physiologically different schattenhofer et al 2011 wang et al 2009 vila costa et al 2012 changes in the ratio of hna to lna bacteria with lna bacteria dominating in effluent water have been observed following biofiltration lautenschlager et al 2014 vital et al 2012 the seeding of the treated drinking water with bacteria during biofiltration is thought to be important for the quality of the distributed water el chakhtoura et al 2015 lautenschlager et al 2014 pinto et al 2012 the ability of a biofilter to shift the community to include increased numbers of lna bacteria could be essential to achieve a desirable microbial water quality the effluent water from the established filter in this study showed this typical change to higher lna content in contrast both new filters had more hna bacteria in their effluent water compared to influent the hna content from the new filter containing mixed sand decreased over the study period to more closely resemble that of the established filter the new filter containing new sand however had continually increasing hna content in effluent water these changes in hna content appeared to coincide with the ability of the new ssfs to remove indicators observing a shift in the distribution of nucleic acid content could provide an alternative way to monitor ssfs although the relationship between dna content and ssf function requires more investigation the ability of different disinfectants to inflict membrane damage on hna and lna cells was examined ramseier et al 2011 this study postulated that hna bacteria contain higher proportions of or more accessible thiol or other non amine groups in their membrane proteins and that this difference could increase the sensitivity of hna cells to chlorine dioxide and permanganate disinfection when ozonation was examined in more detail lna cells were more sensitive to low doses of ozone than hna cells lee et al 2016 understanding the origin of the distribution of hna and lna bacteria in the ssf effluent may thus impact downstream disinfection as ssfs are often the last biological treatment step with the potential to shape the bacterial community entering the distribution system the rapid fcm method used here captured dynamic microbial changes in the ssf biofilm and effluent water these changes reflected ssf function and could potentially impact downstream disinfection fcm would thus be useful for process control of ssf in drinking water treatment plants providing advantages over current methods utilizing routine plating including cost speed and the potential for online monitoring besmer et al 2014 van nevel et al 2017b fcm has been specifically proposed for monitoring of maintenance in distribution networks van nevel et al 2017a time and water volume lost during maintenance and reconnection of the ssf into the production line could be minimized reducing the overall cost for water treatment this would be a particular advantage in countries such as sweden where scraping of ssfs is required 2 3 times per year zonal distributions created by chic analysis can establish a baseline profile with deviations from this profile indicating possible changes in microbial water quality understanding how much variation can be expected in the bacterial profile including the influence of seasonal or operational changes is required given that many factors including local weather patterns or source water could impact the bacterial community the use of fcm with chic for process control may require each drinking water producer to establish unique baselines customized for individual treatment plants 5 conclusions established ssfs showed consistent performance by fcm bacterial profiling that was not altered by removal of the schmutzdecke suggesting that a mature biofilm in the deep sand bed is required for consistent microbial water quality from ssfs inoculation with sand previously used in ssf at the same treatment plant could explain the more rapidly improved functioning of one new ssf improvement in function was not observed for a new ssf constructed only with new sand alteration of fcm bacterial profiles in effluents from ssfs could indicate compromised function of the filter using routine chic analysis would simplify and reduce bias in assessing microbial water quality facilitating use of fcm for process control acknowledgements this study was

19590,while slow sand filters ssfs have produced drinking water for more than a hundred years understanding of their associated microbial communities is limited in this study bacteria in influent and effluent water from full scale ssfs were explored using flow cytometry fcm with cytometric histogram image comparison chic analysis and routine microbial counts for heterotrophs total coliforms and escherichia coli to assess if fcm can monitor biofilm function ssfs differing in age and sand composition were compared fcm profiles from two established filters were indistinguishable to examine biofilm in the deep sand bed ssfs were monitored during a scraping event when the top layer of sand and the schmutzdecke are removed to restore flow through the filter the performance of an established ssf was stable total organic carbon toc ph numbers of heterotrophs coliforms e coli and fcm bacterial profile were unaffected by scraping however the performance of two newly built ssfs containing new and mixed sand was compromised breakthrough of both microbial indicators and toc occurred following scraping the compromised performance of the new ssfs was reflected in distinct effluent bacterial communities and the presence of microbial indicators correlated to influent bacterial communities this demonstrated that fcm can monitor ssf performance removal of the top layer of sand did not alter the effluent water from the established ssf but did affect that of the ssfs containing new sand this suggests that the impact of the surface biofilm on effluent water is greater when the deep sand bed biofilm is not established graphical abstract image keywords slow sand filters drinking water flow cytometry schmutzdecke cytometric histogram image comparison chic biofilm 1 introduction one of the oldest technologies for the treatment of drinking water is the use of slow sand filters ssfs huisman and wood 1974 these filters combine multiple cleaning mechanisms including mechanical filtration and sedimentation but are primarily considered as biological filters where a microbial ecosystem develops as biofilm on the sand particles and contributes to the cleaning process haig et al 2015b as ssfs remove a broad range of microbial contaminants including escherichia coli clostridium spp cryptosporidium spp viral pathogens and toxins bourne et al 2006 elliott et al 2008 hijnen et al 2007 as well as total organic carbon toc wotton 2002 monitoring the performance of these filters is crucial for the drinking water producer this type of monitoring however is complicated by limitations in both knowledge regarding the microbial diversity in these filters and the analytical methods that are able to follow this diversity in real time or near real time resolution understanding these human built aquatic ecosystems would facilitate both routine monitoring for quality control as well as optimised design for ssfs these are both required to produce safe drinking water in a future with climate related changes such as altered natural organic matter water temperatures and pathogen contamination in source water at a time when urbanization will increase demand for treated water ritson et al 2014 sterk et al 2013 van leeuwen 2013 knowledge about the dynamics of bacterial communities in ssfs is limited by the ability of the current routine analyses to describe the microbial processes occurring in the biofilm and water phases with respect to both diversity and time heterotrophic plate counts hpc and counts of coliforms and e coli can analyse microbes passing through the ssfs and satisfy traditions of common usage and regulations however these methods only capture a small fraction of the total microbial population allen et al 2004 and at least 24 h incubation time is required studies using molecular techniques have described laboratory and pilot plant scale ssf systems bourne et al 2006 calvo bado et al 2003 wakelin et al 2011 or focused on elements of the filter such as the uppermost biofilm or schmutzdecke unger and collins 2008 wakelin et al 2011 other studies have focused on microbial contaminant removal by ssfs bauer et al 2011 elliott et al 2008 hijnen et al 2004 several metagenomic dna sequencing studies of the microbial community in full scale ssfs in operating drinking water treatment plants have shown that a highly diverse community dominated by bacteria is living in these biological filters bai et al 2013 haig et al 2014 2015b oh et al 2018 the presence of bacteriophage protozoa and fungi and their role in ssf ecology has also been examined haig et al 2015a prenafeta boldú et al 2017 these studies are invaluable for providing a deep understanding of the microbial ecosystems in ssfs however the methods used are expensive with time consuming laboratory work and demanding data analysis this currently prevents their use for online routine monitoring flow cytometry fcm with dna staining is used to study the microbial communities of numerous aquatic systems berney et al 2008 boi et al 2016 de corte et al 2016 including microbial dynamics in both treatment and distribution of drinking water besmer et al 2014 el chakhtoura et al 2015 lautenschlager et al 2014 total cell count tcc has been proposed for monitoring drinking water treatment processes van nevel et al 2017b and online measurement has been demonstrated besmer and hammes 2016 additional quantitative fcm parameters describe the bacteria in a water sample including the number of intact cells and a fluorescent fingerprint describing the distribution of dna content in the bacterial community prest et al 2013 during ssf operation the bacteria in the sand consume organic matter and multiply and over a period of months or years depending on season and source water the filter becomes clogged with biomass to restore the water flow the top layer of the ssf is removed by mechanical scraping huisman and wood 1974 this procedure may disturb the filter function and effluent water from the disturbed ssfs is not used until water quality parameters comply with regulations the ability to follow ssf function in real or near real time would minimise the time filters are offline to both ensure maximum supply of treated water and reduce costs this is particularly relevant in sweden where ssfs require scraping 2 3 times per year in this study three ssfs differing in microbial community maturation and sand composition were followed over a period of several weeks during summer before and after a scraping procedure water quality of influent and effluent were assessed using fcm and conventional microbial and chemical parameters fcm parameters together with cytometric histogram image comparison chic analysis were analysed to assess if this method could resolve dynamic changes in the bacterial communities of the effluent water in order to examine if this method could be used to monitor the function of the biofilm in ssfs these profiles were correlated to different traditional microbial water quality indicators in addition by observing the different ssfs before and after the removal of the top layer of sand including schmutzdecke the specific contribution of the deep sand bed biofilms to ssf function could be observed 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of ssfs and sampling the full scale ssfs in this study are located in sweden at ringsjö waterworks stehag sweden and operated by sydvatten ab hyllie stationstorg 21 malmö sweden during the study the treatment plant produced 1300 l sec of drinking water from surface water lake bolmen småland sweden supplemented with a small fraction of groundwater the plant receives the source water through an 82 km tunnel and treated using flocculation with ferric chloride lamellar sedimentation rapid sand filtration slow sand filtration and disinfection with hypochlorite before distribution sydvatten ab 2016 each ssf at the treatment plant is scraped 2 3 times per year usually in the summer when the resistance of flow through the filter is unacceptable the ssfs are scraped to remove the top layer of sand including the schmutzdecke and then refilled with water from below the sand bed in winter 2015 two new ssfs were built at ringsjö waterworks one was constructed using only purchased virgin sand sibelco nordic ab baskarp sweden new while the second ssf mix was constructed with first a layer of virgin sand topped with a layer of washed sand collected during previous scraping of established ssfs a third ssf a well established working ssf est in the same production line as the newly constructed filters and used for drinking water production over 20 years built 1995 was included in sampling as a control persson 2013 water samples were collected during july and august 2015 from above the sand beds using a telescopic sampler and after filtration from continuously running taps samples were collected using sterilized borosilicate bottles one day before and for up to three weeks after the scraping of each ssf as scraping for each filter was not carried out on the same calendar day data and comparisons are presented relative to the day of scraping with day 1 being the day before scraping day 2 being the day of the scraping activity and so forth all three ssfs were scraped within the same three week period of stable ambient temperatures data not shown in summer 2016 april august est and a second mature ssf from the same treatment line est2 were sampled in the same way as describe above except that water samples were collected directly into 50 ml falcon tubes and not transferred from the borosilicate bottles 2 2 water quality measurements water samples for conventional microbial parameters were processed by the treatment plant staff according to a routine schedule and coincided in time with the flow cytometry analysis heterotrophic plate counts hpc were determined by mixing 1 ml of water with r2a agar with incubation at 22 c for 72 h bartram et al 2003 concentration of coliforms and e coli were determined with the colilert method from idexx laboratories using the quanti tray 2000 and sealed with quanti tray sealer according to the manufacturer s instructions idexx laboratories westbrook usa chemical water quality parameters were determined by va syd malmö sweden using standard methods table s1 the temperature of the water over the studied period was measured online in the bulk water at the outlet of the treatment plant 2 3 flow cytometry samples of 50 ml water for flow cytometry were transferred and stored in sterile 50 ml falcon tubes on ice and analyzed within 7 h of sampling water samples were stained in triplicate for measurement of total cell count and fingerprints according to prest et al 2013 briefly 5 μl ml 1 of sybr green i at 100 x diluted with dmso stock concentration 10 000 x invitrogen ag switzerland was added to samples at room temperature to a final concentration of 1 x sybr green i before incubation in the dark at 37 c for 15 min for intact cell measurements a working solution of sybr green i 100 x and propidium iodide pi 1 mg ml sigma aldrich germany was prepared with final concentrations of 1 x sybr green i and 3 μm pi in the sample and incubated as above gillespie et al 2014 live and ethanol killed e coli were used as controls for examination of cells with intact membranes referred to hereafter as intact cells as well as milliq water as a control for background fluorescence were used in every run all measurements were performed using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer becton dickinson belgium with a 50 mw laser with an emission wavelength at 488 nm a quality control of the flow cytometer using spherotech 8 peak and 6 peak validation beads bd biosciences was conducted each day measurements were taken in order to allow samples from different days to be compared 50 μl of 500 μl samples were measured in triplicate for each sample at a flow rate of 35 μl min 1 and a threshold of 500 arbitrary units on the green fluorescence channel 2 4 data analysis data processing and gating were performed with flowjo software tree star inc usa signals were collected and analyzed by gating on the dot plot with green fluorescence fl1 533 30 nm and red fluorescence fl3 670 nm gating was done following the gating strategy described in prest et al 2013 and identical gating was applied on all samples the gated data visualized by the green fluorescence histogram plot is referred to as the fluorescent fingerprint percentage of bacteria with low nucleic acid content lna and bacteria with high nucleic acid content hna were determined as described in prest et al 2013 statistical analysis was performed on all data tcc icc and hna concentration using one way anova followed by tukey test in r r development core team 2017 cytometric histogram image comparison chic analysis on dot plots was performed using r packages flowchic and flowcore ellis et al 2016 and visualized by ggplot2 wickham 2009 according to schumann et al 2015 and koch et al 2013 gated populations of the flow cytometric dot plots green fluorescence at x axis and red fluorescence at y axis were converted into 300 300 pixel images with 64 channel gray scale resolution for image comparison and to generate values describing the differences between water samples a nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plot based on bray curtis dissimilarity was created from the results and analysis of similarities anosim was performed with the formed clusters all statistical calculations were performed in r r development core team 2017 the correlation between the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of the fcm data and the conventional microbial parameters hpc coliforms and e coli was determined using the r function envfit vegan package oksanen et al 2017 only parameters from plate counts with a significant effect p value 0 05 are presented after the sampling and fcm analysis were completed plate count data collected as part of the routine monitoring schedule were obtained from the laboratory at ringsjö waterworks only fcm profiles and plate counts obtained on the same sampling day were used for the correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 conventional water quality assessments water quality parameters including specific microbial indicators were measured during a routine scraping event and subsequent operation period for three ssfs fig 1 influent water showed variations in the concentration of microbial indicators i e hpc coliforms and e coli between filters and over time despite the fact that all ssfs received water from the same process line at the treatment plant effluent water samples from the three ssfs contained heterotrophs during the entire sampling period the established ssf hereafter referred to as est had the lowest mean value of heterotrophs calculated over time of the three filters at 1 8 1 6 cfu ml counts for coliforms and e coli above zero were detected in effluent water from the established filter only once during the 35 days of sampling at 1 cfu per 100 ml of breakthrough coliforms the ssf with mixed sand mix both coliforms and e coli were detected in the effluent water following the scraping event with a steady decrease of indicators detected over operation time and no detection of e coli after day 8 the ssf containing all new sand new showed frequent breakthroughs of coliforms and e coli in effluent water during the entire sampling period chemical parameters for water quality were measured in the influent and effluent water for each filter table s1 the three ssfs showed similar values for parameters such as nitrite total phosphorus and conductivity but differed with respect to toc and ph toc and ph of the effluent water of est were lower and more stable than effluent from mix and new toc across est was reduced 0 6 mg l 0 2 mg l from a mean value of 2 9 mg l 0 09 mg l in the influent water to 2 2 mg l 0 09 mg l in effluent this was in contrast to that observed for the new ssfs where there was less reduction of toc mix gave a reduction in toc of 0 2 mg l 0 0 mg l mean value of toc in influent 2 9 mg l 0 1 mg l to effluent 2 7 0 1 mg l mg l and toc was reduced 0 1 mg l 0 0 mg l for new mean value of toc in influent 2 8 mg l 0 05 mg l to effluent 2 7 mg l 0 05 mg l in est ph was lowered from a mean value of 7 8 to 7 4 while the ph of the influent and effluent water of both mix and new were unaffected by filtration and remained with a mean value of 7 7 3 2 flow cytometric bacterial counts total cell counts tcc were determined by fcm to assess changes in the number of bacterial cells in the influent and effluent water of the three ssfs during the routine scraping event fig 2 tccs of the influent and effluent water of est peaked one day after scraping sampling day 3 with 6 105 1 5 104 cells ml 1 in the influent and 3 9 105 1 9 103 cells ml 1 in the effluent water this was the highest tcc observed in this study tcc values in effluent from the newly built filters were in the same order of magnitude with an average of 2 7 105 5 3 104 cells ml 1 in effluent water across the three filters after scraping sampling days 7 10 for est and mix sampling days 6 11 for new the average reduction in tcc performed by est was 16 1 compared to mix at 25 3 and new at 30 1 tcc in the effluent water from est reached a steady state level at 5 days after the scraping event sampling day 7 with almost no change in bacterial numbers over the following sampling days this was not observed for the two newly constructed filters calculating the slope values from linear regression of tcc time showed the stability of the effluent tcc from est giving a rate of change for est tcc over 10 times lower than that observed for either of the newly built ssfs est 1090 mix 13100 new 17800 intact cell counts showed similar trends as tcc data not shown effluent water from est had on average 80 intact cells with a statistically significantly higher p value 0 05 than both mix and new averages of 73 and 76 intact cells respectively the percentage of intact cells in effluent waters from mix and new were not statistically different from each other fig 3 effluent water from all filters contained on average more intact cells than influent with one exception from mix before the scraping event sampling day 1 where the influent had a higher icc 3 3 profiling bacterial communities by flow cytometric measurements fluorescence distribution histograms from fcm were used to compare dna stained bacterial cells in the ssf influent and effluent waters each histogram image represents a cumulative fluorescent profile of the individual cells in the bacterial community of a water samples prest et al 2013 histograms were visualised by fcm as fluorescence fingerprints fingerprints obtained from 64 influent water samples from three ssfs showed similar patterns indicating comparable bacterial communities with no significant differences in concentration of high nucleic acid bacteria hna fig s1 one exception was influent water for est sampled one day after scraping sample day 3 with an altered fingerprint and hna concentration of 48 8 0 95 this anomaly was likely due to cells entering the influent due to disturbance of the ssf biofilm when the ssf was refilled from below after scraping fluorescence fingerprints of effluent from est and mix showed a lower concentration of hna with a dramatic shift in community composition towards bacteria with low nucleic acid content lna fig 4 the effluent from est had on average 29 6 2 78 hna bacteria and mix effluent had 39 5 3 09 hna although only est maintained a steady state level of lna bacteria after the scraping event in contrast effluent water from new increased in the concentration of hna bacteria over time and always contained a higher hna concentration than the other effluent waters with an average of 46 6 4 43 hna all gated cell dot plots were analyzed using chic and presented in an nmds plot to quantitatively compare the changes and dynamics in the bacterial communities fig 5 chic analysis identified four distinct clusters associated with effluent water and depending on the origin of the ssfs and one cluster which encompassed all influent water samples correlation analysis between traditional plate counts and fcm profiles showed higher levels of indicator bacteria associated with the influent water cluster in analysis of similarities anosim confirmed significant separation between all groups r value 0 933 p value 0 001 data from effluent water samples of est e and mix m were distinct from those of the influent cluster in and each other new effluent waters split into two clusters in the nmds plot n1 was associated with samples taken before and shortly after the scraping procedure in time n2 contained samples taken several days after the scraping and showed water profiles that were most similar to those of the influent in water this division in profile character for new effluent water was also observed in the fingerprints over time fig 4 the effluent water from est had visually identical fingerprints regardless of whether the samples were taken before or after scraping this uniformity was also reflected in the compact cluster of group e in the chic analysis and the steady state behavior of this ssf observed by other parameters i e coliform count the cluster representing the effluent water of mix grouped between those of est and new with day before scraping sample day 1 and the last sampling points day 10 and 14 being closer to the est cluster to determine if fcm shows the same bacterial profile for established ssfs at this treatment plant effluent water was analyzed from est and a second well established ssf est2 over a five month period chic analysis with all previous ssf effluent water data fig s2 again separated effluent waters from new and established filters and all histograms describing effluent from established filters clustered together regardless of sampling date chic analysis of data from only the established filters est 2015 2016 and est2 2016 separated into two clusters representing the communities of the influent and effluent water from both filters and confirmed by anosim r value 0 957 p value 0 001 data not shown 4 discussion next generation sequencing ngs studies of drinking water biofilters have previously shown that the effluent water community reflects the content of the biofilm haig et al 2015b li et al 2017 oh et al 2018 pinto et al 2012 some studies have examined the use of fcm to characterize the influent and effluent communities from biofilters lautenschlager et al 2014 park et al 2016 the goal of the current study was to examine if fcm can monitor biofilm status and function in ssfs with sand beds of differing maturity and sand composition including their response to a scraping event using fcm the bacterial communities in the influent and effluent water from four ssfs were followed through time chic analysis was used for statistical comparison to compare total number of cells and distribution of nucleic acid in these cells this grouped the influent water separately from the effluent water and each ssf produced effluent water with a unique bacterial profile the influent water to each ssf was the same and differences in the effluents between filters indicated that a distinct microbial biofilm inhabited each of the examined ssfs the bacterial profiles in the effluent water of the two established ssfs were similar to each other regardless of sampling year closer examination of one of these filters showed consistent chemical and biological transformation of the water quality across the sand bed including removal of microbial indicators a lowering of ph an increase in percentage of intact cells and decreased hna content regardless of fluctuations in the influent water importantly the transformation of the water quality was not dependent on the upper layer of sand scraping did not result in changes to the fcm bacterial profiles of effluent water or breakthrough of microbial indicators this was in contrast to observations in the newly built ssfs particularly the ssf containing all new sand in this ssf removal of the top layer of sand including the schmutzdecke preceded breakthrough of microbial indicators and fcm profiles showed that the community in the effluent water became more similar to that of the influent this suggests that the sand bed biofilm in these newly built filters was not able to transform the influent water to the extent observed for the established filter the role of the schmutzdecke in water purification has long been attributed to the activity of microbes living as biofilm in this region of the ssf barrett et al 1991 bauer et al 2011 huisman and wood 1974 oh et al 2018 as the function of the mature ssf was not disrupted by scraping the functional microbial community of this filter resided in the sand bed and not only in the schmutzdecke an ngs study of two full scale ssfs showed that the bacterial communities between sand samples are highly similar even when sampled from different depths haig et al 2015b and together with the results in the current study it seems these core communities contain the essential functionality of ssfs however as studies characterizing the ecology of the ssf sand bed have used extracted dna without the ability to distinguish between living and dead cells or free dna it is difficult to say which mechanisms within the sand bed ecosystem are responsible for effluent water quality stable isotope probing showed that removal of e coli from laboratory ssfs was mediated via multiple direct and indirect mechanisms including protozoal grazing viral killing reactive oxygen species produced by algae and mutualistic fungi algal interactions haig et al 2015a this study also suggested that ecosystem wide associations on multiple trophic levels are required for pathogen removal and that the absence of this complexity could explain compromised function in less diverse filter ecosystems it is also known that ssf function improves with time virus removal improved over time in constructed model systems as the schmutzdecke and deeper sand biofilm developed bauer et al 2011 and seven week old freshwater biofilms showed greater enzyme activity for removal of doc than four week old biofilms peter et al 2011 these observations are supported by the current study as the ssf which had a top layer of washed sand from other ssfs mix was more effective at removing indicator organisms at the end of the study period chic analysis showed the bacterial profile in the effluent from this ssf migrated towards that of the established filters in the days following the scraping event this suggests that the biofilm community in the mixed ssf may have been approaching that of the established filter biofilm including acquisition of ecosystem wide associations required for pathogen removal further investigation is required however to determine if the microbial ecology and or specific pathogen removal mechanisms differ between the ssfs in this study the washed sand used in construction of one ssf mix appears to have inoculated the biofilm with a community preconditioned for ssf function promoting a more rapid development of a biofilm core community similar to that in the established sand filters interestingly pagaling et al 2014 showed that the colonization of a microbial community was predictable and similar to the original community when it was introduced to an environment to which it had previously been exposed the idea that inoculation with preconditioned microbial biomass can lead to rapid establishment of ssf function is supported by laboratory studies by haig et al 2014 lab scale ssf columns constructed using sand from a full scale ssf differed non sterile columns removed indicators after a period of 4 6 weeks whereas sterile columns required 7 10 weeks to reach the same level of performance while the biofilm in the deep sand is essential for shaping the effluent water from well functioning ssfs the removal of the top layer of sand and schmutzdecke did impact the function of the new ssfs in the ssf containing all new sand new chic analysis showed that after the scraping event the effluent profiles began approaching that of the influent water this suggests that without the schmutzdecke the deep sand bed in this ssf had minimal impact on the bacterial community in the water in an ngs study examining response of established full scale ssfs to scraping overlap between communities in the influent and effluent water was concomitant with coliform breakthrough haig et al 2015b thus in filters without a well functioning microbial community in the deep sand bed the biofilm may not be able to sufficiently impact the effluent water and changes in the effluent water could be more coupled to the status of the schmutzdecke this could explain the emphasis placed on the role of the schmutzdecke in water filtration studies examining its function have largely been conducted on filters that are not performing optimally or at lab or pilot scale where a sand bed community has not had years to establish haig et al 2015b pfannes et al 2015 unger and collins 2006 the study showing effective removal of faecal indicators from wastewater identified the schmutzdecke as the essential feature of 14 week old model slow sand filters but again the communities in the influent and effluent water were indistinguishable by t rflp analysis of bacterial 16s rrna pfannes et al 2015 the study by unger and collins 2006 also showed that the removal of schmutzdecke changed filter function although again these experiments were conducted at lab scale and over a period of weeks it is not surprising that the schmutzdecke plays an important role in filtration by new ssfs as substrate concentrations and the biomass acting on the substrates are highest at the surface of the sand bed bai et al 2013 lautenschlager et al 2014 in filters where for any number of reasons time inoculation the deep sand bed biofilm cannot significantly transform the influent water the influence of schmutzdecke on filter function may thus be more obvious as biofilms in both the schmutzdecke and sand bed can entrap particles and cells and support antagonistic microbial interactions pfannes et al 2015 prenafeta boldú et al 2017 the overall function of the filter is likely a balance between the functions of the biofilm ecosystems in these different regions a recent metagenomics study predicted that the minimum generation time for a mature ssf sand bed community was shorter than that predicted for the associated schmutzdecke metagenome oh et al 2018 suggesting that the degradation of organic material which fuels microbial growth in a mature filter is higher in the sand bed then on the surface although the bacterial content in schmutzdecke is denser than in the sand bed 1011 copies ml and 108 109 copies g respectively pfannes et al 2015 the total volume of the deep sand is many times greater than that occupied by the schmutzdecke instead of being dominated by the function in the schmutzdecke the activity of the ssf community in the deeper sand is likely more significant for overall ssf performance than previously thought conclusions from lab based experiments may thus overestimate the impact of the schmutzdecke emphasizing the need for studies conducted at full scale for complete assessment of drinking water treatment by ssfs the question still remains to what extent does the biofilm transform the influent water community to obtain desirable effluent water quality in this and other studies haig et al 2015b an overlap between the bacterial communities of the influent and effluent water were concomitant with indicator breakthrough it may be a specific and significant transformation of the bacterial community between influent and effluent water that is the signature of a well functioning ssf the established filter showed the least reduction of total cells with an increase in the amount of intact cells and a decrease in hna content suggesting an exchange of communities in the water as it passed this biofilm an increase in intact cells following ssf has also been reported lautenschlager et al 2014 chic analysis showed that the bacterial communities from each ssf differed in hna suggesting that the distinct biofilms in each individual sand bed altered this aspect of the effluent hna and lna bacteria are thought to be both phylogenetically and physiologically different schattenhofer et al 2011 wang et al 2009 vila costa et al 2012 changes in the ratio of hna to lna bacteria with lna bacteria dominating in effluent water have been observed following biofiltration lautenschlager et al 2014 vital et al 2012 the seeding of the treated drinking water with bacteria during biofiltration is thought to be important for the quality of the distributed water el chakhtoura et al 2015 lautenschlager et al 2014 pinto et al 2012 the ability of a biofilter to shift the community to include increased numbers of lna bacteria could be essential to achieve a desirable microbial water quality the effluent water from the established filter in this study showed this typical change to higher lna content in contrast both new filters had more hna bacteria in their effluent water compared to influent the hna content from the new filter containing mixed sand decreased over the study period to more closely resemble that of the established filter the new filter containing new sand however had continually increasing hna content in effluent water these changes in hna content appeared to coincide with the ability of the new ssfs to remove indicators observing a shift in the distribution of nucleic acid content could provide an alternative way to monitor ssfs although the relationship between dna content and ssf function requires more investigation the ability of different disinfectants to inflict membrane damage on hna and lna cells was examined ramseier et al 2011 this study postulated that hna bacteria contain higher proportions of or more accessible thiol or other non amine groups in their membrane proteins and that this difference could increase the sensitivity of hna cells to chlorine dioxide and permanganate disinfection when ozonation was examined in more detail lna cells were more sensitive to low doses of ozone than hna cells lee et al 2016 understanding the origin of the distribution of hna and lna bacteria in the ssf effluent may thus impact downstream disinfection as ssfs are often the last biological treatment step with the potential to shape the bacterial community entering the distribution system the rapid fcm method used here captured dynamic microbial changes in the ssf biofilm and effluent water these changes reflected ssf function and could potentially impact downstream disinfection fcm would thus be useful for process control of ssf in drinking water treatment plants providing advantages over current methods utilizing routine plating including cost speed and the potential for online monitoring besmer et al 2014 van nevel et al 2017b fcm has been specifically proposed for monitoring of maintenance in distribution networks van nevel et al 2017a time and water volume lost during maintenance and reconnection of the ssf into the production line could be minimized reducing the overall cost for water treatment this would be a particular advantage in countries such as sweden where scraping of ssfs is required 2 3 times per year zonal distributions created by chic analysis can establish a baseline profile with deviations from this profile indicating possible changes in microbial water quality understanding how much variation can be expected in the bacterial profile including the influence of seasonal or operational changes is required given that many factors including local weather patterns or source water could impact the bacterial community the use of fcm with chic for process control may require each drinking water producer to establish unique baselines customized for individual treatment plants 5 conclusions established ssfs showed consistent performance by fcm bacterial profiling that was not altered by removal of the schmutzdecke suggesting that a mature biofilm in the deep sand bed is required for consistent microbial water quality from ssfs inoculation with sand previously used in ssf at the same treatment plant could explain the more rapidly improved functioning of one new ssf improvement in function was not observed for a new ssf constructed only with new sand alteration of fcm bacterial profiles in effluents from ssfs could indicate compromised function of the filter using routine chic analysis would simplify and reduce bias in assessing microbial water quality facilitating use of fcm for process control acknowledgements this study was

encouraged in a second stage in this way discharge limits are reached while the need for external carbon dosing is avoided verstraete and vlaeminck 2011 one of the key challenges to achieve a robust process operation is the suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob while maximizing the activity of aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob different strategies focused on one or a combination of on off control e g by kinetic suppression by dissolved oxygen do control or by in out control where selective wash out of nob is strived for cao et al 2017 these combined strategies on real wastewater showed promising results yet no full eradication of nob so more insights are necessary as most studies focused on controllable process parameters like do setpoints loading rates residual ammonium levels or sludge retention times srt to achieve nob suppression they tend to overlook the additional effect of mostly location specific wastewater characteristics like inorganic carbon phosphorus or temperature on the activity on off control of aob and nob two strategies are commonly applied to link the activity or abundance of biomass with process parameters and wastewater characteristics in stp the first strategy is to link these parameters with the abundance of different genera by means of easy applicable statistical exploratory data analysis tools e g correlations and principle component analysis huang et al 2010 meerburg et al 2016 these studies mostly focused on unraveling niche differentiation and did not include the link with actual microbial activities moreover the uncoupling of different wastewater parameters may be challenging due to multiple correlations among wastewater parameters it is important to define which aob and nob are commonly selected by the long term environmental pressures and thus which kinetic parameters should be used in mathematical models the studies showed that nitrosomonas aob and nitrospira nob were the most common nitrifying genera in stp see table 1 daims et al 2001 rowan et al 2003 whereas nitrosospira aob nitrobacter nob and nitrotoga nob were less frequently encountered lücker et al 2015 rowan et al 2003 a second strategy used process models to describe the performance in stp these models combined transport chemical and physical processes with earlier empirical models of bacteria s activity and growth into one complex model some of these software tools both available in commercial i e biowin sumo etc and non commercial variants include more advanced 2 step nitrification models in a review on efforts on these models most advanced models included although not always combined differentiation on kinetic parameters for decay ph growth rate yield anabolism inorganic c p and catabolism n o2 between aob and nob sin et al 2008 although these easy accessible models have been successfully applied to model shortcut nitrogen removal processes al omari et al 2015 they still required substantial amount of time and complete sets of process data for case specific calibration and simulation hauduc et al 2009 furthermore as they are mostly calibrated towards effluent concentrations calibration for aob and nob potential activities is mostly not necessary and overlooked yet crucial to run accurate shortcut nitrogen process models since the previous statistical methods and modelling approaches not always accurately predicted aob and nob activity ratios there is a need for easy adaptable methodologies that can assess limitations for the complex environment that constitutes a stp in this study abundances and activities were linked with commonly monitored process and wastewater parameters we compared two stp blue plains washington dc and nieuwveer nl which had a certain degree of similarity in wastewater and process parameters yet had a different aob over nob potential activity ratio raob rnob to acquire insight on the most important parameters that control their activity a novel and easily implementable add on mechanistic model was set up the aim was to disentangle the effects of abundances and different process and wastewater parameters on raob rnob 2 material and methods 2 1 description and sampling of the plants blue plains was an advanced three stage stp washington dc usa receiving municipal wastewater from the surrounding regions with an average flow rate of 1 140 000 m3 d 1 about 4 million population equivalents figure b 1 for a schematic overview the first treatment stage is chemically enhanced primary treatment which mainly removes particulate cod and phosphorus the second stage is high rate activate sludge system srt 2d which removes biodegradable cod the last stage is a plug flow conventional nitrification denitrification process here the wastewater moves first through five aerobic 1 5 mg o2 l 1 sections of 247 000 m3 total 12 parallel reactors with the last stage being a swing zone 41 000 m3 0 0 5 mg o2 l 1 finally all the mixed liquor is combined and transferred to a denitrification reactor 177 000 m3 where nitrogen is removed with the aid of methanol addition altogether 13 grab samples of about 3 l of mixed liquor were collected over the course of a year to capture the whole temperature range they were taken from the second aerobic stage of the nitrification denitrification process and sent to the lab within 10 min for molecular analysis mixed liquor samples were first centrifuged 10 min 4000 g at 4 c after which the sludge pellet was stored at 80 c for later transportation and analysis the nieuwveer stp in breda nl functions as a two stage stp treating industrial and municipal wastewater from breda and its surroundings with over the studied period on average 72 000 m3 340 000 population equivalents of wastewater per day figure b 1 for a schematic overview the first stage is a high rate activated sludge treatment srt 0 5 d redirecting a substantial fraction of the incoming carbon stream to the anaerobic digester feso4 is added at the end of the a stage to remove phosphorus the second stage treats the effluent of the first stage removing nitrogen by means of nitrification denitrification the a stage effluent is split over four parallel reactors three of the four reactors are equal in configuration and built earlier having a volume of 5400 m3 with sequentially an anoxic two facultative oxic two oxic and again one facultative oxic section the fourth reactor has a volume of 12 000 m3 and sequentially two anoxic four swing zones and four oxic 2 8 mg o2 l 1 sections both stages have the same sludge recycle ratio of 0 5 in the second stage an internal recycle ratio of 0 04 0 1 is applied the final effluent is recirculated over the whole wastewater treatment plant with a recirculation ratio that varied between 0 3 and 1 5 over the course of the study since a sidestream pn a was installed at that moment from the first section of the second stage 4th reactor over a period of 5 months 9 samples of about 5 l of activated sludge were taken the fresh activated sludge was transported to ghent be and stored overnight at room temperature to later determine the activity of aob and nob it was assumed that transport and short term storage did not affect activity of the nitrifiers for molecular analyses samples of 60 ml were taken at the plant and immediately centrifuged 10 min at 4 000 g the obtained pellet was manually homogenized and subsamples of 0 5 ml were taken and flash frozen in a cooling block of at least 20 c for transport to be finally stored at 80 c 2 2 process and wastewater data for blue plains plant data table c 1 was obtained from the plant s main lab and flow measurements from the plant operation department physicochemical analyses nh4 no2 total soluble phosphorus alkalinity mlss were

reactor section 9 by an amtax sc from hach lange some parameters were measured intermittently no2 tp tss svi in these cases we always chose the data from samples collected closest in time to the batch activity tests ranging from 2 days before to one day after 2 3 aob and nob potential rate determination see appendix d 1 2 4 arrhenius model fitting the non linear arrhenius temperature model fit was based on 2 r t r m a x 20 c θ t t 20 rmax20 c and θt were fitted to temperature and measured rates in the batch tests optimization of fit was performed by minimizing the sum of squared error sse of prediction and actual measurements 2 5 statistical data analysis a generalized linear model glm was fitted using the r language for statistical computing rstudio 0 99 903 r development core team 2015 the description and mathematical details can be found in results 3 5 1 and supplemental information e 1 respectively different limitations were added stepwise to the model and the order was decided on 1 discovered correlations between wastewater and process parameters and 2 the potential limitation occurring deducted from literature saturation values more information can be found in appendix d 1 2 6 molecular analyses dna extraction was performed by means of a dneasy powersoil kit mo bio qpcr was performed to determine 16s rdna abundances nitrospira nitrobacter analogue to courtens et al 2016 in addition 16s rdna from aob and all bacteria were also quantified and specific procedure information is found in table f 1 for identification the 16s rrna gene v3 v4 hypervariable regions were amplified de vrieze et al 2016 subsequently absolute singleton operational taxonomic units otus i e otus with only a single read in the whole dataset were removed and prevalence filtering was executed mcmurdie and holmes 2014 subsequently differential abundance testing was performed based upon guidelines from the same publication by means of the deseq pipeline as implemented in deseq2 v 1 16 0 love et al 2014 in brief size factors were estimated as well as the overdispersion parameter based upon the negative binomial distribution next a negative binomial glm was fitted with wald statistics multiple comparison p values were false discovery rate fdr controlled with the significance level set to 5 α 0 05 benjamini and yekutieli 2001 3 results 3 1 arrhenius model fit to compare the temperature kinetics of both stp an arrhenius model was fitted in a non linear manner to the measured potential activity data fig 1 and table 2 both stp had similar temperature theta coefficients for aob 1 1 and nob 1 06 1 07 aside from this temperature effect the fits interestingly showed the key observation that both stp had an inverse raob rnob rmax20 c ratio i e the ratio is 0 61 for blue plains and 1 68 for nieuwveer this indicated that some process and wastewater parameters might diversely influenced the activity or community of aob and nob 3 2 diversity in nitrifier communities qpcr based abundances revealed continuous presence of aob nitrospira and nitrobacter with a slightly fluctuating aob nob abundance ratio between 0 10 and 0 15 for both stp see fig 1 nitrospira were always present in higher abundance than nitrobacter on average 20 times higher for nieuwveer and 10 times for blue plains amplicon sequencing analysis was performed to further identify potential differences between the communities comparing both communities more than half or 1000 of 1765 otu differed significantly between the two stp different otus were identified as aob and nob on the genus level for aob nitrosomonas was identified as the sole genus out of the eight detected otus see fig 2 five had a significantly different abundance in both plants four otus including the most abundant were only present in either one of the stp for nob see figure g 1 only representative otus for nitrospira were classified down to the genus level while in contrast to the qpcr nitrobacter was not three of the six detected otus were significantly different between the two stp of which the most abundant nitrospira otu coincided in both stp this difference in nitrosomonas community may lead to different kinetics i e different rmax20 c while this is most likely not the case for the more similar nitrospira community 3 3 dissimilar relationships between nitrifier abundance and activity to assess the link between microbial abundance and activity both stp were compared in figure h 1 in this case the difference in rmax20 c was not reflected in the change in average relative abundance by qpcr whereas the relative nob abundance in blue plains was almost twice as in nieuwveer the rmax20 c was 0 7 times lower in contrast aob relative abundances were a factor 1 4 higher in nieuwveer but the rmax20 c was 3 7 times higher the difference in measured rmax20 c could thus not be explained by a difference in relative abundance yet some process or wastewater parameters or the above mentioned community might explain the observed discrepancy 3 4 dis similarities in stp process and wastewater parameters the blue plains stp us and nieuwveer stp nl showed similarities and differences in their process and wastewater parameters for nieuwveer no monitoring of ph and alkalinity was performed during the executed study and values depicted in table 3 are from earlier or later measurement campaigns to acquire insight in possible limitations over the measurement campaign both plants had similar nitrogen loading rates 100 g n m 3 d 1 and anoxic sludge retention times 12d although the aerobic sludge retention time is shorter in blue plains 16 vs 22 d yearly temperatures were higher in blue plains 14 3 25 7 c than in nieuwveer 9 5 22 6 c with a similar seasonal temperature dt of 11 13 c the influent raw sewage and different pretreatment steps prior to n dn resulted in different wastewater parameters in the reactor these differed significantly p 0 05 between the two stp effluent inorganic carbon as alkalinity ammonium nh4 c n nitrite no2 n and phosphorus p were much more limited in blue plains than nieuwveer creating potential activity and growth limitations see table 1 for nieuwveer only nitrogen levels nh4 c n no2 n could limit their potential activity 3 5 specific process and wastewater limitations control activities to further investigate what process and wastewater parameters affected aob and nob activities in the two stp a spearman non linear correlation analysis table i 1 and j 1 was executed in table 4 all significant correlations p 0 05 for a selection of wastewater parameters are depicted for blue plains positive correlations were found between the measured potential activities and their ratios with temperature phosphorus p inorganic carbon ic and ph for the latter three temperature can act as a possible confounder since it also had positive correlations with these variables for nieuwveer aside from temperature these wastewater characteristics didn t show positive correlations in contrast the sludge specific n loading rate and sludge retention time srt showed positive correlations with the measured rates and their ratios temperature could also act as a confounder here so elucidation required further assessment 3 5 1 uncoupling temperature from other limitations to separately evaluate the effects of temperature t and other wastewater parameters the arrhenius model was sequentially complemented with specific terms for p nh4 n no2 n inorganic carbon and ph called add on mechanistic model supplemental information e 1 for the impact of the n loading rate a different approach was applied section 3 5 4 the modeled approach see supplemental information e 1 for a detailed mathematical description was based on the linearization of a combined arrhenius temperature model and separate addition of different substrate activity models i e a monod saturation model for nh4 n p inorganic carbon or a sigmoidal inorganic carbon activity model an example equation of this linearized model including monod saturation is as follows 3 ln r t tln θ t a ln s 1 s 1 k 1 b ln s 2 s 2 k 2 n ln s n s n k n c with c 20 l n θ t ln r m a x 20 c s wastewater parameter k saturation constants and a b n fitted coefficients the model was fitted to the measured potential rates in the external batch tests with literature values of the model constants i e saturation constants see table 1 this means that the model is not fitted on the actual limited aob nob activities in the stp since they cannot be measured unless the system is overloaded but on the measured potential activities given possible limitations that were present in the batch test e g p inorganic carbon this potential activity differs from the model estimated maximum achievable activity rmax20 c which will be apparent under unlimited growth conditions over a longer period for the same community the model estimated θ coefficients for temperature and ph maximum achievable activities at 20 c rmax20 c and the presence or absence of a certain substrate limitation by estimation of the limitation coefficients a b n the affinity constants were fixed and the weight of each substrate limitation e g monod term on each model fit was evaluated by the fitting of the limitation coefficients a b n the coefficient for each limitation was interpreted as follows a close to 1 substrate limitation is occurring b close to 0 no substrate limitation is occurring possibly because the real affinity constant was smaller than the used literature value c all other values or 0 1 unrealistic fit of the model to evaluate the goodness of the model fit the following four things in order of importance were analyzed 1 the estimated parameters were realistic limitation coefficients either 0 or close to 1 rmax20 c and θt in line with expected literature values 2 the increase in model complexity i e extra limitation added led to a minimum of residuals 3 the estimated parameters were contributing significantly p 0 1 to the model fit and 4 the model fit was statistically different p 0 05 by means of an f test from a baseline arrhenius temperature model finally to assess the impact of the abundance of aob and nob the model fits of bulk activity in mg n g vss 1 d 1 were compared to model fits of genera specific activities in mg n g vssaob 1 d 1 or mg n g vssnob 1 d 1 by correcting the vss mass for the relative aob or nob abundance obtained from qpcr data 16s rrna gene count of aob or nob on total eubacterial 16s rrna gene count when both model types had the same realistic model fit the bulk sludge activity reflected the abundance of aob and nob in the sludge meaning that the sludge was limited by lacking substrate if only the bulk activity was showing a realistic model fit the sludge was substrate limited and abundance does not reflect immediate activity 3 5 2 overall model fit in fig 3 for both stp the best model fits for raob and raob rnob chosen from table k 1 and l 1 according to the goodness of fit criteria listed above are depicted together with their estimated model parameters these model fits blue line were compared to a simple arrhenius temperature model green line and the actual data red squares for blue plains the best model fit included all limitations t p nh4 n inorganic c whereas for nieuwveer the model that included phosphate did not yield realistic fits unrealistic p coefficient table k 1 and thus only temperature and nitrogen levels nh4 n no2 n were considered for blue plains the variation in the data could be better described by this more complex model compared to a simple arrhenius temperature model inorganic carbon limitations were playing a major role in the measured activities of aob and thus raob rnob ratio while nitrogen levels and phosphorus were not in the case of nieuwveer the variation in the data could not be explained by the limitation in ammonium or nitrite alone adverting to other unknown factors e g during transport or storage or limitations that played an important role in the measured activities and model fits comparing the modeled limitations of genera specific activity rates with those of the bulk specific activity table k 1 and l 1 the model types were not in line with each other for blue plains indicating that there were activity limitations that are independent from the abundance of aob and nob for nieuwveer the fits are in line with each other and it is thus suggested that the observed activities were at least partially attributable to differences in abundance rather than sole activity limitations 3 5 3 inorganic carbon inorganic carbon ic calculated from total alkalinity measurements was only monitored in blue plains during the experiments whereas in nieuwveer a later measurement campaign raised insight in possible limitations for blue plains to investigate the effect of ic different ic models were added to a t psat nh4sat model 1 two monod saturation models one with total inorganic carbon icsat tic and one with bicarbonate as source of inorganic carbon icsat hco3 2 three sigmoidal activity models with two sets of widely varying literature kinetic constants for aob or nitrification icsigm1 tic or icsigm1 hco3 kicaob 1 11 mm c kicnob 0 1 mm c a 0 57 mm c guisasola et al 2007 and icsigm2 tic kicaob 4 17 mm c a 0 83 mm c wett and rauch 2003 and 3 an exponential ph model for nitrification icph that describes both carbon limitation and loss of activity due to changes in ph henze 2008 only for the monod saturation models differentiating kinetic constants for aob and nob were found in literature table 1 for the sigmoidal model a kicnob was assumed based on the parameters of guisasola et al 2007 blue plains raob showed to be sensitive to inorganic carbon limitation with a significant parameter contribution of rmax20 c and θt to all inorganic carbon models except for the ph model the best raob model fits table k 1 were achieved by using the icsigm1 tic or icsat tic model with an ic coefficient close to 1 0 75 1 18 for rnob results showed that the activity was less sensitive to changes in inorganic carbon with only a minor increase in the estimation of rmax20 c for raob rnob the best fit ic coefficient of 1 08 was achieved with a monod saturation model based on tic the θt and rmax20 c changed from 1 03 0 6 to 1 02 1 8 compared to a simple t model although only for the latter a significant estimation of both parameters was achieved the sigmoidal model did not yield better results 3 5 4 sludge specific nitrogen loading rate for nieuwveer correlation analysis table 4 indicated a significant positive correlation of the loading rate with temperature raob and rnob for blue plains no significant correlations were found to better understand the nieuwveer case one would expect a higher correlation coefficient with raob and rnob when the loading rate is within the timeframe of 1 srt 30d this is because historical loading rates past operation values in the negative side of the x axis influence the abundance of aob and nob and thus increase or decrease their observed activities the calculated correlation coefficient depicted in fig 4 showed a peak for raob and rnob at week 1 indicating that for both bacterial genera the activity was largely affected by loading rate that occurred in the plant one week earlier more so than by the instantaneous loading rate this was not reflected in the raob rnob ratio suggesting that the activity ratio was not dependent on the historical loading rate 4 discussion a more detailed discussion on some parts including goodness of fit can be found in supplemental information m 1 4 1 limitations in nitrifiers growth and activity 4 1 1 temperature the results confirmed that aob were more temperature sensitive than nob with indifferent temperature kinetics for the two stp although aob communities were different wiesmann 1994 furthermore nitrospira which was the most abundant nob in both stp showed temperature kinetics similar to the reported literature values for nitrobacter confirming previous research blackburne et al 2007 for modelling purposes these were important results because no differentiation must be made between different aob or nob communities interestingly at temperatures lower than 13 c the raob rnob ratio increased for nieuwveer which could not be explained by other limitations fig 1 data points at lower temperatures for blue plains no data at these temperatures was acquired these results are in line with previous research of gilbert et al 2015 who recorded similar raob rnob temperature behaviors in 3 different pn a sludges and reported nitrite accumulation in stp at lower temperatures this would implicate that arrhenius modelling would only work in a range from 13 to 35 c and that below 13 c either more specialist aob might take over or that aob were more resistant to colder temperatures since no shifts in aob or nob community were revealed at low temperatures by 16s amplicon sequencing the data supports the latter possibility 4 1 2 phosphate results from both treatment facilities suggested that phosphate limitation was no important parameter the scarce amount of literature reported kpaob in the range of 0 003 0 05 mg p l 1 in groundwater filters van der aa et al 2002 de vet et al 2012 and a kpnob 0 02 mg p l 1 in highly n loaded waters nowak et al 1996 with a p range of 0 01 0 08 mg p l 1 limitations could have occurred in blue plains yet sensitivity analysis figure n 1 and o 1 indicated no impact when increasing kpaob or kpnob thus although both stp differed in pretreatment prior to n dn and resulting p concentrations this impacted most likely not the activity of aob and nob 4 1 3 inorganic carbon model fits of blue plains showed that inorganic carbon potentially limited aob activity suggesting that θt rmax20 c of raob rnob would increase to 1 021 1 027 1 2 1 8 when no ic limitations were present this kinetics would coincide with the ones of nieuwveer where inorganic carbon and other limitations were almost not present with an estimated θt and rmax20 c of 1 03 1 54 this showed that inorganic carbon was most likely the only limiting factor for aob in blue plains further discussion see supplemental information m 1 suggested that modelling with bicarbonate and a sigmoidal model most likely resulted in a better description of bicarbonate limitation which is in line with literature guisasola et al 2007 jiang et al 2015 mellbye et al 2016 previous studies suggested that ic limitation for nitrification mainly prevailed in highly loaded n removal systems such as side stream pn a with a low influent bicarbonate over ammonium ratio stp in regions with low influent alkalinity and bod or with deep aeration tanks with a high oxygen uptake rate also risked limitations sin et al 2008 wett and rauch 2003 this was also reflected in modelling efforts where usually aob and nob kinetics were not differentiated by using very low saturation constants 0 008 0 1 mm c this study suggests that inorganic carbon is an important parameter to consider under the conditions of a conventional stp literature supported that ic limitation affects the rate of aob in a range of 0 3 5 mm tic which lie well within the range of process parameters of most stp as well as for nieuwveer stp 3 3 5 mm tic ph 7 1 7 6 guisasola et al 2007 mellbye et al 2016 furthermore reduced inorganic carbon levels to 40 of the required growth demand resulted in overgrowth of nob in pn a mainly due to lower aob and anaob activity ma et al 2015 to further optimize the raob rnob ratio for purpose of shortcut nitrogen removal it can be helpful to increase inorganic carbon effluent levels to 3 3 5 mm c 4 1 4 nitrogen levels nh4 no2 nitrogen levels played an important role in nieuwveer and not in blue plains although more limiting for nieuwveer the indication of nitrogen limitation by the model fits were in line with the dependency of the activities on the sludge specific loading rate and with the similar response of the abundance corrected model compared to the bulk activity model this showed that both aob and nob were capable to process a higher nitrogen load and no obvious activity growth limitations by other parameters were experienced for further applications aob rates can thus be boosted by increasing levels of residual ammonium as was already previously done poot et al 2016 4 2 add on mechanistic modelling methodology overall the add on mechanistic modelling enabled to disentangle and pinpoint effects of different wastewater parameters on the activities of aob and nob since not always sufficient data was measured in stp to run short cut nitrogen removal process models this approach can act as a quick and easy methodology to identify limitations this can be done by using commonly measured data in stp combined with non calibrated kinetic literature data furthermore by highlighting potential limitations it can assist to prioritize calibration of parameters for process models where multiple parameters need to be calibrated simultaneously in this way time can be saved for calibration and detailed measured campaigns which now consume significant amount of time i e several weeks hauduc et al 2009 in general the fitted rmax20 c and θt showed although not always significantly contributions to the fits the fitted limitation coefficients for p n ic were most of the time realistic close to 0 1 however not significantly contributing also compared to the baseline t model the different limitation model fits were never statistically different p 0 05 anova f test one reason for this lack of significance or realistic fitting could be due to the limited amount of data 13 sample points for blue plains and 8 sample points for nieuwveer larger data sets will be able to achieve better fits and estimate coefficients more reliably another reason was that other unrecorded parameters could have influenced the activity of the nitrifiers results from the current datasets thus should be interpreted with sufficient care regarding the possible limitations in both stp and always be accompanied with a sensitivity analysis see figure n 1 r 1 for the applied kinetic constant to understand the model fit in the case of nieuwveer model fits pointed out that nitrogen levels could have influenced raob and rnob furthermore ic limitations appeared to be limiting for raob in blue plains in both cases the concentrations of both substrates were present in higher concentrations in the batch test as they were in the stp indicating that the impact of historical growth conditions on raob and rnob could be resolved with this add on mechanistic model for inorganic carbon limitation guisasola et al 2007 showed that when inorganic carbon was spiked at high concentrations to an enriched aob community after a 2 3 day ic limitation high activity was regained within minutes yet 20 lower than initial maximum rate due to the short timeframe of the test 2 h ic limitations thus could have impacted the measured rates for n levels previous studies on ammonium limitation showed that aob have a base level of ammonium oxygenase amo transcription to rapidly respond to sudden availability of ammonium while having a higher expression of amo after longer exposure to increased substrate concentrations geets et al 2006 stein and arp 1998 in contrast nob suffer much more from anoxic disturbances and their activity is likely more susceptible to variations in nitrogen levels kornaros et al 2010 since low substrate concentrations 2 mg n l 1 were present in stp and a short exposure 2 6 h to higher concentrations 4 10 mg n l 1 prevailed in the batch test nitrogen levels might have slightly influenced the measured potential activities in conclusion to study whether certain limitations are influencing activity batch tests should be set up with stp identical limitations on the anabolic side e g t ph p ic and sufficient data points should be used to fit the model in contrast to study whether historical limitations influenced the potential activity no limitations should be present in the batch test 5 conclusions blue plains and nieuwveer are two similarly operated nitrifying stp in terms of nitrogen loading rate total srt and temperature profile nonetheless nieuwveer displayed a much higher raob rnob ratio 1 6 at 20 c versus 0 6 in blue plains likely facilitating the transition to a shortcut nitrogen removal process a bottom up step by step approach enabled to unveil determining factors for this 1 disproportional and dissimilar relationships between aob or nob relative abundances and respective activities pointed towards differences in community and growth activity limiting parameters 2 nitrifying communities differed mainly in aob the five most abundant aob nitrosomonas otu were present in either one of the stp whereas both stp shared the most abundant nob nitrospira otu 3 arrhenius temperature model fits showed different rmax20 c yet similar θt θaob 1 1 θaob 1 06 1 07 not discriminating the raob rnob

activities 5 nieuwveer aob and nob activities were limited by lack of nitrogen substrate due to the loading rate of the stp 6 blue plains aob activity was limited by inorganic carbon not for n and p while no limitations for nob were found it is hypothesized that addition of inorganic carbon e g as caco3 to the process would increase the raob rnob ratio from 0 6 to 1 facilitating the transition to

19591,even though nitrification denitrification is a robust technology to remove nitrogen from sewage economic incentives drive its future replacement by shortcut nitrogen removal processes the latter necessitates high potential activity ratios of ammonia oxidizing to nitrite oxidizing bacteria raob rnob the goal of this study was to identify which wastewater and process parameters can govern this

limited by the concentration of inorganic carbon not by residual n and p while nob experienced less limitation from this for nv the sludge specific nitrogen loading rate seemed to be the most prevalent factor limiting aob and nob activities altogether this study shows that bottom up mechanistic modelling can identify parameters that influence the nitrification performance increasing

encouraged in a second stage in this way discharge limits are reached while the need for external carbon dosing is avoided verstraete and vlaeminck 2011 one of the key challenges to achieve a robust process operation is the suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob while maximizing the activity of aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob different strategies focused on one or a combination of on off control e g by kinetic suppression by dissolved oxygen do control or by in out control where selective wash out of nob is strived for cao et al 2017 these combined strategies on real wastewater showed promising results yet no full eradication of nob so more insights are necessary as most studies focused on controllable process parameters like do setpoints loading rates residual ammonium levels or sludge retention times srt to achieve nob suppression they tend to overlook the additional effect of mostly location specific wastewater characteristics like inorganic carbon phosphorus or temperature on the activity on off control of aob and nob two strategies are commonly applied to link the activity or abundance of biomass with process parameters and wastewater characteristics in stp the first strategy is to link these parameters with the abundance of different genera by means of easy applicable statistical exploratory data analysis tools e g correlations and principle component analysis huang et al 2010 meerburg et al 2016 these studies mostly focused on unraveling niche differentiation and did not include the link with actual microbial activities moreover the uncoupling of different wastewater parameters may be challenging due to multiple correlations among wastewater parameters it is important to define which aob and nob are commonly selected by the long term environmental pressures and thus which kinetic parameters should be used in mathematical models the studies showed that nitrosomonas aob and nitrospira nob were the most common nitrifying genera in stp see table 1 daims et al 2001 rowan et al 2003 whereas nitrosospira aob nitrobacter nob and nitrotoga nob were less frequently encountered lücker et al 2015 rowan et al 2003 a second strategy used process models to describe the performance in stp these models combined transport chemical and physical processes with earlier empirical models of bacteria s activity and growth into one complex model some of these software tools both available in commercial i e biowin sumo etc and non commercial variants include more advanced 2 step nitrification models in a review on efforts on these models most advanced models included although not always combined differentiation on kinetic parameters for decay ph growth rate yield anabolism inorganic c p and catabolism n o2 between aob and nob sin et al 2008 although these easy accessible models have been successfully applied to model shortcut nitrogen removal processes al omari et al 2015 they still required substantial amount of time and complete sets of process data for case specific calibration and simulation hauduc et al 2009 furthermore as they are mostly calibrated towards effluent concentrations calibration for aob and nob potential activities is mostly not necessary and overlooked yet crucial to run accurate shortcut nitrogen process models since the previous statistical methods and modelling approaches not always accurately predicted aob and nob activity ratios there is a need for easy adaptable methodologies that can assess limitations for the complex environment that constitutes a stp in this study abundances and activities were linked with commonly monitored process and wastewater parameters we compared two stp blue plains washington dc and nieuwveer nl which had a certain degree of similarity in wastewater and process parameters yet had a different aob over nob potential activity ratio raob rnob to acquire insight on the most important parameters that control their activity a novel and easily implementable add on mechanistic model was set up the aim was to disentangle the effects of abundances and different process and wastewater parameters on raob rnob 2 material and methods 2 1 description and sampling of the plants blue plains was an advanced three stage stp washington dc usa receiving municipal wastewater from the surrounding regions with an average flow rate of 1 140 000 m3 d 1 about 4 million population equivalents figure b 1 for a schematic overview the first treatment stage is chemically enhanced primary treatment which mainly removes particulate cod and phosphorus the second stage is high rate activate sludge system srt 2d which removes biodegradable cod the last stage is a plug flow conventional nitrification denitrification process here the wastewater moves first through five aerobic 1 5 mg o2 l 1 sections of 247 000 m3 total 12 parallel reactors with the last stage being a swing zone 41 000 m3 0 0 5 mg o2 l 1 finally all the mixed liquor is combined and transferred to a denitrification reactor 177 000 m3 where nitrogen is removed with the aid of methanol addition altogether 13 grab samples of about 3 l of mixed liquor were collected over the course of a year to capture the whole temperature range they were taken from the second aerobic stage of the nitrification denitrification process and sent to the lab within 10 min for molecular analysis mixed liquor samples were first centrifuged 10 min 4000 g at 4 c after which the sludge pellet was stored at 80 c for later transportation and analysis the nieuwveer stp in breda nl functions as a two stage stp treating industrial and municipal wastewater from breda and its surroundings with over the studied period on average 72 000 m3 340 000 population equivalents of wastewater per day figure b 1 for a schematic overview the first stage is a high rate activated sludge treatment srt 0 5 d redirecting a substantial fraction of the incoming carbon stream to the anaerobic digester feso4 is added at the end of the a stage to remove phosphorus the second stage treats the effluent of the first stage removing nitrogen by means of nitrification denitrification the a stage effluent is split over four parallel reactors three of the four reactors are equal in configuration and built earlier having a volume of 5400 m3 with sequentially an anoxic two facultative oxic two oxic and again one facultative oxic section the fourth reactor has a volume of 12 000 m3 and sequentially two anoxic four swing zones and four oxic 2 8 mg o2 l 1 sections both stages have the same sludge recycle ratio of 0 5 in the second stage an internal recycle ratio of 0 04 0 1 is applied the final effluent is recirculated over the whole wastewater treatment plant with a recirculation ratio that varied between 0 3 and 1 5 over the course of the study since a sidestream pn a was installed at that moment from the first section of the second stage 4th reactor over a period of 5 months 9 samples of about 5 l of activated sludge were taken the fresh activated sludge was transported to ghent be and stored overnight at room temperature to later determine the activity of aob and nob it was assumed that transport and short term storage did not affect activity of the nitrifiers for molecular analyses samples of 60 ml were taken at the plant and immediately centrifuged 10 min at 4 000 g the obtained pellet was manually homogenized and subsamples of 0 5 ml were taken and flash frozen in a cooling block of at least 20 c for transport to be finally stored at 80 c 2 2 process and wastewater data for blue plains

reactor section 9 by an amtax sc from hach lange some parameters were measured intermittently no2 tp tss svi in these cases we always chose the data from samples collected closest in time to the batch activity tests ranging from 2 days before to one day after 2 3 aob and nob potential rate determination see appendix d 1 2 4 arrhenius model fitting the non linear arrhenius temperature model fit was based on 2 r t r m a x 20 c θ t t 20 rmax20 c and θt were fitted to temperature and measured rates in the batch tests optimization of fit was performed by minimizing the sum of squared error sse of prediction and actual measurements 2 5 statistical data analysis a generalized linear model glm was fitted using the r language for statistical computing rstudio 0 99 903 r development core team 2015 the description and mathematical details can be found in results 3 5 1 and supplemental information e 1 respectively different limitations were added stepwise to the model and the order was decided on 1 discovered correlations between wastewater and process parameters and 2 the potential limitation occurring deducted from literature saturation values more information can be found in appendix d 1 2 6 molecular analyses dna extraction was performed by means of a dneasy powersoil kit mo bio qpcr was performed to determine 16s rdna abundances nitrospira nitrobacter analogue to courtens et al 2016 in addition 16s rdna from aob and all bacteria were also quantified and specific procedure information is found in table f 1 for identification the 16s rrna gene v3 v4 hypervariable regions were amplified de vrieze et al 2016 subsequently absolute singleton operational taxonomic units otus i e otus with only a single read in the whole dataset were removed and prevalence filtering was executed mcmurdie and holmes 2014 subsequently differential abundance testing was performed based upon guidelines from the same publication by means of the deseq pipeline as implemented in deseq2 v 1 16 0 love et al 2014 in brief size factors were estimated as well as the overdispersion parameter based upon the negative binomial distribution next a negative binomial glm was fitted with wald statistics multiple comparison p values were false discovery rate fdr controlled with the significance level set to 5 α 0 05 benjamini and yekutieli 2001 3 results 3 1 arrhenius model fit to compare the temperature kinetics of both stp an arrhenius model was fitted in a non linear manner to the measured potential activity data fig 1 and table 2 both stp had similar temperature theta coefficients for aob 1 1 and nob 1 06 1 07 aside from this temperature effect the fits interestingly showed the key observation that both stp had an inverse raob rnob rmax20 c ratio i e the ratio is 0 61 for blue plains and 1 68 for nieuwveer this indicated that some process and wastewater parameters might diversely influenced the activity or community of aob and nob 3 2 diversity in nitrifier communities qpcr based abundances revealed continuous presence of aob nitrospira and nitrobacter with a slightly fluctuating aob nob abundance ratio between 0 10 and 0 15 for both stp see fig 1 nitrospira were always present in higher abundance than nitrobacter on average 20 times higher for nieuwveer and 10 times for blue plains amplicon sequencing analysis was performed to further identify potential differences between the communities comparing both communities more than half or 1000 of 1765 otu differed significantly between the two stp different otus were identified as aob and nob on the genus level for aob nitrosomonas was identified as the sole genus out of the eight detected otus see fig 2 five had a significantly different abundance in both plants four otus including the most abundant were only present in either one of the stp for nob see figure g 1 only representative otus for nitrospira were classified down to the genus level while in contrast to the qpcr nitrobacter was not three of the six detected otus were significantly different between the two stp of which the most abundant nitrospira otu coincided in both stp this difference in nitrosomonas community may lead to different kinetics i e different rmax20 c while this is most likely not the case for the more similar nitrospira community 3 3 dissimilar relationships between nitrifier abundance and activity to assess the link between microbial abundance and activity both stp were compared in figure h 1 in this case the difference in rmax20 c was not reflected in the change in average relative abundance by qpcr whereas the relative nob abundance in blue plains was almost twice as in nieuwveer the rmax20 c was 0 7 times lower in contrast aob relative abundances were a factor 1 4 higher in nieuwveer but the rmax20 c was 3 7 times higher the difference in measured rmax20 c could thus not be explained by a difference in relative abundance yet some process or wastewater parameters or the above mentioned community might explain the observed discrepancy 3 4 dis similarities in stp process and wastewater parameters the blue plains stp us and nieuwveer stp nl showed similarities and differences in their process and wastewater parameters for nieuwveer no monitoring of ph and alkalinity was performed during the executed study and values depicted in table 3 are from earlier or later measurement campaigns to acquire insight in possible limitations over the measurement campaign both plants had similar nitrogen loading rates 100 g n m 3 d 1 and anoxic sludge retention times 12d although the aerobic sludge retention time is shorter in blue plains 16 vs 22 d yearly temperatures were higher in blue plains 14 3 25 7 c than in nieuwveer 9 5 22 6 c with a similar seasonal temperature dt of 11 13 c the influent raw sewage and different pretreatment steps prior to n dn resulted in different wastewater parameters in the reactor these differed significantly p 0 05 between the two stp effluent inorganic carbon as alkalinity ammonium nh4 c n nitrite no2 n and phosphorus p were much more limited in blue plains than nieuwveer creating potential activity and growth limitations see table 1 for nieuwveer only nitrogen levels nh4 c n no2 n could limit their potential activity 3 5 specific process and wastewater limitations control activities to further investigate what process and wastewater parameters affected aob and nob activities in the two stp a spearman non linear correlation analysis table i 1 and j 1 was executed in table 4 all significant correlations p 0 05 for a selection of wastewater parameters are depicted for blue plains positive correlations were found between the measured potential activities and their ratios with temperature phosphorus p inorganic carbon ic and ph for the latter three temperature can act as a possible confounder since it also had positive correlations with these variables for nieuwveer aside from temperature these wastewater characteristics didn t show positive correlations in contrast the sludge specific n loading rate and sludge retention time srt showed positive correlations with the measured rates and their ratios temperature could also act as a confounder here so elucidation required further assessment 3 5 1 uncoupling temperature from other limitations to separately evaluate the effects of temperature t and other wastewater parameters the arrhenius model was sequentially complemented with specific terms for p nh4 n no2 n inorganic carbon and ph called add on mechanistic model supplemental information e 1 for the impact of the n loading rate a different approach was applied section 3 5 4 the modeled approach see supplemental information e 1 for a detailed mathematical description was based on the linearization of a combined arrhenius temperature model and separate addition of different substrate activity models i e a monod saturation model for nh4 n p inorganic carbon or a sigmoidal inorganic carbon activity model an example equation of this linearized model including monod saturation is as follows 3 ln r t tln θ t a ln s 1 s 1 k 1 b ln s 2 s 2 k 2 n ln s n s n k n c with c 20 l n θ t ln r m a x 20 c s wastewater parameter k saturation constants and a b n fitted coefficients the model was fitted to the measured potential rates in the external batch tests with literature values of the model constants i e saturation constants see table 1 this means that the model is not fitted on the actual limited aob nob activities in the stp since they cannot be measured unless the system is overloaded but on the measured potential activities given possible limitations that were present in the batch test e g p inorganic carbon this potential activity differs from the model estimated maximum achievable activity rmax20 c which will be apparent under unlimited growth conditions over a longer period for the same community the model estimated θ coefficients for temperature and ph maximum achievable activities at 20 c rmax20 c and the presence or absence of a certain substrate limitation by estimation of the limitation coefficients a b n the affinity constants were fixed and the weight of each substrate limitation e g monod term on each model fit was evaluated by the fitting of the limitation coefficients a b n the coefficient for each limitation was interpreted as follows a close to 1 substrate limitation is occurring b close to 0 no substrate limitation is occurring possibly because the real affinity constant was smaller than the used literature value c all other values or 0 1 unrealistic fit of the model to evaluate the goodness of the model fit the following four things in order of importance were analyzed 1 the estimated parameters were realistic limitation coefficients either 0 or close to 1 rmax20 c and θt in line with expected literature values 2 the increase in model complexity i e extra limitation added led to a minimum of residuals 3 the estimated parameters were contributing significantly p 0 1 to the model fit and 4 the model fit was statistically different p 0 05 by means of an f test from a baseline arrhenius temperature model finally to assess the impact of the abundance of aob and nob the model fits of bulk activity in mg n g vss 1 d 1 were compared to model fits of genera specific activities in mg n g vssaob 1 d 1 or mg n g vssnob 1 d 1 by correcting the vss mass for the relative aob or nob abundance obtained from qpcr data 16s rrna gene count of aob or nob on total eubacterial 16s rrna gene count when both model types had the same realistic model fit the bulk sludge activity reflected the abundance of aob and nob in the sludge meaning that the sludge was limited by lacking substrate if only the bulk activity was showing a realistic model fit the sludge was substrate limited and abundance does not reflect immediate activity 3 5 2 overall model fit in fig 3 for both stp the best model fits for raob and raob rnob chosen from table k 1 and l 1 according to the goodness of fit criteria listed above are depicted together with their estimated model parameters these model fits blue line were compared to a simple arrhenius temperature model green line and the actual data red squares for blue plains the best model fit included all limitations t p nh4 n inorganic c whereas for nieuwveer the model that included phosphate did not yield realistic fits unrealistic p coefficient table k 1 and thus only temperature and nitrogen levels nh4 n no2 n were considered for blue plains the variation in the data could be better described by this more complex model compared to a simple arrhenius temperature model inorganic carbon limitations were playing a major role in the measured activities of aob and thus raob rnob ratio while nitrogen levels and phosphorus were not in the case of nieuwveer the variation in the data could not be explained by the limitation in ammonium or nitrite alone adverting to other unknown factors e g during transport or storage or limitations that played an important role in the measured activities and model fits comparing the modeled limitations of genera specific activity rates with those of the bulk specific activity table k 1 and l 1 the model types were not in line with each other for blue plains indicating that there were activity limitations that are independent from the abundance of aob and nob for nieuwveer the fits are in line with each other and it is thus suggested that the observed activities were at least partially attributable to differences in abundance rather than sole activity limitations 3 5 3 inorganic carbon inorganic carbon ic calculated from total alkalinity measurements was only monitored in blue plains during the experiments whereas in nieuwveer a later measurement campaign raised insight in possible limitations for blue plains to investigate the effect of ic different ic models were added to a t psat nh4sat model 1 two monod saturation models one with total inorganic carbon icsat tic and one with bicarbonate as source of inorganic carbon icsat hco3 2 three sigmoidal activity models with two sets of widely varying literature kinetic constants for aob or nitrification icsigm1 tic or icsigm1 hco3 kicaob 1 11 mm c kicnob 0 1 mm c a 0 57 mm c guisasola et al 2007 and icsigm2 tic kicaob 4 17 mm c a 0 83 mm c wett and rauch 2003 and 3 an exponential ph model for nitrification icph that describes both carbon limitation and loss of activity due to changes in ph henze 2008 only for the monod saturation models differentiating kinetic constants for aob and nob were found in literature table 1 for the sigmoidal model a kicnob was assumed based on the parameters of guisasola et al 2007 blue plains raob showed to be sensitive to inorganic carbon limitation with a significant parameter contribution of rmax20 c and θt to all inorganic carbon models except for the ph model the best raob model fits table k 1 were achieved by using the icsigm1 tic or icsat tic model with an ic coefficient close to 1 0 75 1 18 for rnob results showed that the activity was less sensitive to changes in inorganic carbon with only a minor increase in the estimation of rmax20 c for raob rnob the best fit ic coefficient of 1 08 was achieved with a monod saturation model based on tic the θt and rmax20 c changed from 1 03 0 6 to 1 02 1 8 compared to a simple t model although only for the latter a significant estimation of both parameters was achieved the sigmoidal model did not yield better results 3 5 4 sludge specific nitrogen loading rate for nieuwveer correlation analysis table 4 indicated a significant positive correlation of the loading rate with temperature raob and rnob for blue plains no significant correlations were found to better understand the nieuwveer case one would expect a higher correlation coefficient with raob and rnob when the loading rate is within the timeframe of 1 srt 30d this is because historical loading rates past operation values in the negative side of the x axis influence the abundance of aob and nob and thus increase or decrease their observed activities the calculated correlation coefficient depicted in fig 4 showed a peak for raob and rnob at week 1 indicating that for both bacterial genera the activity was largely affected by loading rate that occurred in the plant one week earlier more so than by the instantaneous loading rate this was not reflected in the raob rnob ratio suggesting that the activity ratio was not dependent on the historical loading rate 4 discussion a more detailed discussion on some parts including goodness of fit can be found in supplemental information m 1 4 1 limitations in nitrifiers growth and activity 4 1 1 temperature the results confirmed that aob were more temperature sensitive than nob with indifferent temperature kinetics for the two stp although aob communities were different wiesmann 1994 furthermore nitrospira which was the most abundant nob in both stp showed temperature kinetics similar to the reported literature values for nitrobacter confirming previous research blackburne et al 2007 for modelling purposes these were important results because no differentiation must be made between different aob or nob communities interestingly at temperatures lower than 13 c the raob rnob ratio increased for nieuwveer which could not be explained by other limitations fig 1 data points at lower temperatures for blue plains no data at these temperatures was acquired these results are in line with previous research of gilbert et al 2015 who recorded similar raob rnob temperature behaviors in 3 different pn a sludges and reported nitrite accumulation in stp at lower temperatures this would implicate that arrhenius modelling would only work in a range from 13 to 35 c and that below 13 c either more specialist aob might take over or that aob were more resistant to colder temperatures since no shifts in aob or nob community were revealed at low temperatures by 16s amplicon sequencing the data supports the latter possibility 4 1 2 phosphate results from both treatment facilities suggested that phosphate limitation was no important parameter the scarce amount of literature reported kpaob in the range of 0 003 0 05 mg p l 1 in groundwater filters van der aa et al 2002 de vet et al 2012 and a kpnob 0 02 mg p l 1 in highly n loaded waters nowak et al 1996 with a p range of 0 01 0 08 mg p l 1 limitations could have occurred in blue plains yet sensitivity analysis figure n 1 and o 1 indicated no impact when increasing kpaob or kpnob thus although both stp differed in pretreatment prior to n dn and resulting p concentrations this impacted most likely not the activity of aob and nob 4 1 3 inorganic carbon model fits of blue plains showed that inorganic carbon potentially limited aob activity suggesting that θt rmax20 c of raob rnob would increase to 1 021 1 027 1 2 1 8 when no ic limitations were present this kinetics would coincide with the ones of nieuwveer where inorganic carbon and other limitations were almost not present with an estimated θt and rmax20 c of 1 03 1 54 this showed that inorganic carbon was most likely the only limiting factor for aob in blue plains further discussion see supplemental information m 1 suggested that modelling with bicarbonate and a sigmoidal model most likely resulted in a better description of bicarbonate limitation which is in line with literature guisasola et al 2007 jiang et al 2015 mellbye et al 2016 previous studies suggested that ic limitation for nitrification mainly prevailed in highly loaded n removal systems such as side stream pn a with a low influent bicarbonate over ammonium ratio stp in regions with low influent alkalinity and bod or with deep aeration tanks with a high oxygen uptake rate also risked limitations sin et al 2008 wett and rauch 2003 this was also reflected in modelling efforts where usually aob and nob kinetics were not differentiated by using very low saturation constants 0 008 0 1 mm c this study suggests that inorganic carbon is an important parameter to consider under the conditions of a conventional stp literature supported that ic limitation affects the rate of aob in a range of 0 3 5 mm tic which lie well within the range of process parameters of most stp as well as for nieuwveer stp 3 3 5 mm tic ph 7 1 7 6 guisasola et al 2007 mellbye et al 2016 furthermore reduced inorganic carbon levels to 40 of the required growth demand resulted in overgrowth of nob in pn a mainly due to lower aob and anaob activity ma et al 2015 to further optimize the raob rnob ratio for purpose of shortcut nitrogen removal it can be helpful to increase inorganic carbon effluent levels to 3 3 5 mm c 4 1 4 nitrogen levels nh4 no2 nitrogen levels played an important role in nieuwveer and not in blue plains although more limiting for nieuwveer the indication of nitrogen limitation by the model fits were in line with the dependency of the activities on the sludge specific loading rate and with the similar response of the abundance corrected model compared to the bulk activity model this showed that both aob and nob were capable to process a higher nitrogen load and no obvious activity growth limitations by other parameters were experienced for further applications aob rates can thus be boosted by increasing levels of residual ammonium as was already previously done poot et al 2016 4 2 add on mechanistic modelling methodology overall the add on mechanistic modelling enabled to disentangle and pinpoint effects of different wastewater parameters on the activities of aob and nob since not always sufficient data was measured in stp to run short cut nitrogen removal process models this approach can act as a quick and easy methodology to identify limitations this can be done by using commonly measured data in stp combined with non calibrated kinetic literature data furthermore by highlighting potential limitations it can assist to prioritize calibration of parameters for process models where multiple parameters need to be calibrated simultaneously in this way time can be saved for calibration and detailed measured campaigns which now consume significant amount of time i e several weeks hauduc et al 2009 in general the fitted rmax20 c and θt showed although not always significantly contributions to the fits the fitted limitation coefficients for p n ic were most of the time realistic close to 0 1 however not significantly contributing also compared to the baseline t model the different limitation model fits were never statistically different p 0 05 anova f test one reason for this lack of significance or realistic fitting could be due to the limited amount of data 13 sample points for blue plains and 8 sample points for nieuwveer larger data sets will be able to achieve better fits and estimate coefficients more reliably another reason was that other unrecorded parameters could have influenced the activity of the nitrifiers results from the current datasets thus should be interpreted with sufficient care regarding the possible limitations in both stp and always be accompanied with a sensitivity analysis see figure n 1 r 1 for the applied kinetic constant to understand the model fit in the case of nieuwveer model fits pointed out that nitrogen levels could have influenced raob and rnob furthermore ic limitations appeared to be limiting for raob in blue plains in both cases the concentrations of both substrates were present in higher concentrations in the batch test as they were in the stp indicating that the impact of historical growth conditions on raob and rnob could be resolved with this add on mechanistic model for inorganic carbon limitation guisasola et al 2007 showed that when inorganic carbon was spiked at high concentrations to an enriched aob community after a 2 3 day ic limitation high activity was regained within minutes yet 20 lower than initial maximum rate due to the short timeframe of the test 2 h ic limitations thus could have impacted the measured rates for n levels previous studies on ammonium limitation showed that aob have a base level of ammonium oxygenase amo transcription to rapidly respond to sudden availability of ammonium while having a higher expression of amo after longer exposure to increased substrate concentrations geets et al 2006 stein and arp 1998 in contrast nob suffer much more from anoxic disturbances and their activity is likely more susceptible to variations in nitrogen levels kornaros et al 2010 since low substrate concentrations 2 mg n l 1 were present in stp and a short exposure 2 6 h to higher concentrations 4 10 mg n l 1 prevailed in the batch test nitrogen levels might have slightly influenced the measured potential activities in conclusion to study whether certain limitations are influencing activity batch tests should be set up with stp identical limitations on the anabolic side e g t ph p ic and sufficient data points should be used to fit the model in contrast to study whether historical limitations influenced the potential activity no limitations should be present in the batch test 5 conclusions blue plains and nieuwveer are two similarly operated nitrifying stp in terms of nitrogen loading rate total srt and temperature profile nonetheless nieuwveer displayed a much higher raob rnob ratio 1 6 at 20 c versus 0 6 in blue plains likely facilitating the transition to a shortcut nitrogen removal process a bottom up step by step approach enabled to unveil determining factors for this 1 disproportional and dissimilar relationships between aob or nob relative abundances and respective activities pointed towards differences in community and growth activity limiting parameters 2 nitrifying communities differed mainly in aob the five most abundant aob nitrosomonas otu were present in either one of the stp whereas both stp shared the most abundant nob nitrospira otu 3 arrhenius temperature model fits showed different rmax20 c yet similar θt θaob 1 1 θaob 1 06 1 07 not discriminating the raob rnob activity ratio in the two stp 4 the developed add on mechanistic model could disentangle the effect of temperature from different wastewater parameters nh4 no2 p inorganic carbon on aob and nob activities 5 nieuwveer aob and nob activities were limited by lack of nitrogen substrate due to the loading rate of the stp 6 blue plains aob activity was limited by inorganic carbon not for n and p while no limitations for nob were found it is hypothesized that addition of inorganic carbon e g as caco3 to the process would increase the raob rnob ratio from 0 6 to 1 facilitating the transition to

neutral compounds were the most abundant organic fractions corresponding to 47 and 35 of doc respectively ozonation did not change distribution of organic carbon fractions and concentrations of detected individual organic compounds significantly sorption to activated carbon targeted removal of individual organic compounds with molecular weight 115 da whereas lmw compounds remained largely unaffected aerobic degradation was responsible for removal of lmw compounds and partial ammonium removal whereas formation of intermediates with molecular weight of 200 350 da was observed combination of aerobic degradation for lmw organics removal with adsorption to activated carbon for removal of non biodegradable organics is proposed to be implemented between pre treatment dissolved air floatation and desalination thermal or membrane desalination steps graphical abstract image 1 keywords shale gas hydraulic fracturing flowback water dissolved organic carbon aerobic degradation 1 introduction the negative impact on the quality of surface and ground water is one of the major environmental consequences of shale gas production brantley et al 2014 ferrar et al 2013 jackson et al 2013 osborn et al 2011 vidic et al 2013 shale gas producers use a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to recover gas from formations hydraulic fracturing implies high pressure well injection of large volumes of water mixed with inert solid material proppant and chemical additives this mixture called fracturing fluid creates fissures in the shale increasing its permeability and gas recovery the mixture of the injected fracturing fluid together with the connate water of the formation which returns to the surface within few weeks after pressure being released is called flowback water olmstead et al 2013 the connate water of the formation which continues flowing upwards for years after fracturing has been completed is called produced water vidic et al 2013 both flowback and produced waters fpw are contaminated with high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds oil and grease natural radioactive materials norm and dissolved organic matter dom gregory et al 2011 injection into disposal wells was the most widely used shale gas wastewater management strategy until 2010 epa 2016 rahm et al 2013 however the limited availability of disposal wells increased uncertainties about risks related to deep well injection and legislative constrains make the industry turn towards reuse and discharge of fpw gregory et al 2011 mauter et al 2014 rahm et al 2013 silva et al 2017 removal of contaminants is required before fpw can be discharged fpw reuse also requires removal of certain compounds e g potential scalants and foulants treatment technologies typically include separation for removal of total suspended solids tss oil and grease adsorption for removal of organics norm and heavy metals membrane or thermal desalination for tds removal drioli et al 2015 igunnu and chen 2014 jiménez et al 2018 saba 2014 desalination is a crucial step in the fpw treatment because of the high tds concentrations that often equal or exceed sea water salinity shaffer et al 2013 membrane and thermal desalination technologies for oil and gas produced water are well established and can remove tds and majority of contaminants mentioned above abousnina et al 2015 fakhru l razi et al 2009 however concentrations of organic carbon in shale gas fpw often exceed 1000 mg l causing fouling on the membranes and distillation equipment alzahrani and mohammad 2014 chen et al 2015 thiel and lienhard 2014 in addition desalination technologies are effective towards high molecular weight polar compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs but poorly remove low molecular weight non polar organics that may also pose threats to the environment and human health annevelink et al 2016 butkovskyi et al 2017 ferrar et al 2013 shaffer et al 2013 despite that only few studies attempt to characterize the nature of organic compounds in fpw and evaluate potential treatment strategies for their removal butkovskyi et al 2017 camarillo et al 2016 components of the fracturing fluid including heterocyclic biocides cocamidopropyl surfactants ethylene glycol and derivatives as well as natural constituents of shale including aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons alkanes resins asphaltenes heterocyclic and halogenated organics were detected in fpw from u s shale basins using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry gc ms and lc ms annevelink et al 2016 butkovskyi et al 2017 ferrar et al 2013 hayes 2009 lester et al 2015 maguire boyle and barron 2014 orem et al 2014 lester et al 2015 reported low removal of dom from shale gas flowback water by advanced oxidation whereas aerobic treatment removed 50 of dom at flowback water tds of 22 5 g l other authors demonstrated that microbial mats are capable to decrease cod at tds as high as 100 g l akyon et al 2015 neither the fate of different dom fractions nor the removal of individual organic compounds were studied in these works moreover akyon et al 2015 did their experiments with synthetic flowback water several authors reported high biodegradability of fracturing fluid components including poly ethylene glycol surfactants and biocide glutaraldehyde kekacs et al 2015 mclaughlin et al 2016 mouser et al 2016 however the degradation of compounds was studied in fracturing fluids which composition is very different from fpw high potential of granular activated carbon gac for adsorption of fracturing fluid chemicals furfural and 2 butoxyethanol and powdered activated carbon pac for adsorption of polyethylene glycols was also shown manz et al 2016 rosenblum et al 2016 so far these are the only two studies focused on application of activated carbon for removal of organic chemicals from flowback water this paper aims to assess the removal of different fractions of dissolved organic carbon and individual organic compounds present in flowback water using typical primary treatment process dissolved air flotation followed by one of the common processes for organics removal ozonation adsorption to activated carbon or aerobic degradation flowback water is studied because in comparison to produced water this stream has typically high concentrations of organic carbon and contains potentially harmful components of fracturing fluids the most promising treatment strategy for organic compounds removal is proposed and its integration with existing treatment processes is discussed 2 materials and methods the shale gas flowback water was obtained from a baltic shale gas basin poland under non disclosure agreement regarding location storage conditions and composition of the fracturing fluid used at the production site the water was sampled within two months after commencement of the first fracturing operation it was transported in 20 l plastic containers and stored at 4 c until the experiments the flowback water was pre treated in a dissolved air flotation daf unit assisted by coagulation in order to remove tss oil and grease daf treated flowback water was used for ozonation adsorption to gac and aerobic degradation experiments 2 1 experimental set up 2 1 1 dissolved air flotation coagulation flowback water v 80 l was treated by fecl3 assisted daf in a stainless steel tank v 200 l fecl3 100 mg fe l was added as a coagulant and ph was adjusted to 8 0 by addition of naoh 0 5 g l megid et al 2014 flocculation was observed within 40 min and 3 l of water saturated with air was released to the stainless steel vessel from the adjacent pressurized tank p 5 bar flotation contact time was 10 min daf treated flowback water v 63 l was collected excluding precipitate and scum v 20 l and stored at 4 c until ozonation gac sorption and aerobic degradation tests were performed 2 1 2 ozonation ozonation was performed in batch mode in a glass vessel vliquid 2 l with ozone supplied through a bubble diffuser during 60 min ozone was produced from pure oxygen using a fischer 503 ozone generator the gas flow was maintained at 0 1 m3 h and the ozone concentration in the reactor inlet at 6 3 g m3 ozone concentrations in the gas phase of the reactor inlet and outlet were measured by bmt ozone analyser 961tc and 961 respectively an ozone dosage of 0 3 g l was applied to daf treated flowback water additionally control tests with air supplied instead of ozone at the same flow rate were run to correct for volatilization to correct for ozone losses in the system a blank test with milliq was run until stabilization of ozone concentrations in the reactor inlet 6 0 g m3 and outlet 5 5 g m3 has been reached the ozone losses were taken into account when calculating ozone consumption of the flowback water liquid samples were filtrated through 0 45 μm pore size filters directly after the test and stored at 20 c until the analyses 2 1 3 sorption to gac sorption tests were performed with daf treated flowback water and three different types of gac granular types of activated carbon were chosen because they are preferred to powdered by oil and gas industry due to lower carbon usage rates and operational costs arthur et al 2005 hackney and wiesner 1996 the tests were performed in stirred glass vessels vliquid 1 l using three different fresh gac types typically used in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment chemviron f400 norit gac 830w and norit c gran table s1 and dosage of 2000 mg l the adsorption tests were run for 6 weeks at 20 c to reach the equilibrium state liquid samples were filtrated through 0 45 μm pore size filters directly after the test and stored at 20 c until the analyses 2 1 4 aerobic degradation batch aerobic degradation test was adapted from oecd method 301a oecd 1992 the test was performed in triplicate in 250 ml glass bottles holding a liquid volume of 120 ml and headspace volume of 130 ml activated sludge adapted to high salinities was obtained from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp at delfzijl the netherlands which treats industrial wastewater with high cl concentrations 2 20 g cl l van der marel and de boks 2014 the sludge volatile suspended solids vss 3 5 g l was collected from the aerobic nitrification basin and stored at 4 c until the experiment sludge liquor had low cod 170 mg l no ammonium nitrogen and comparatively high chloride concentrations cl 22 g l daf treated flowback water was mixed with sludge from delfzijl wwtp volumetric ratio of 0 29 0 71 to obtain the sludge loading of 0 1 g cod g vss d diluted batch samples prepared for aerobic degradation experiments contained significantly lower cod 610 mg l and doc 192 mg l when compared to the daf treated flowback water disodium phosphate was added as external phosphorous source to reach substrate n p ratio of 5 1 the rest of the nutrients required according to oecd method 301a were present in the tested flowback water in excess the glass bottles were closed with butyl rubber septa and incubated horizontally at constant temperature 20 c for 48 h on a linear shaker at 160 rpm for maximum oxygen up take the headspace composition was refreshed as soon as the oxygen volume fraction dropped to 10 to adapt the sludge to changes in salinity and substrate composition batch incubations were repeated six times with the substrate refreshment between incubations to refresh the substrate the batches were centrifuged at 1500 rpm and the sludge pellet was mixed with a new portion of daf treated flowback water and sludge liquor full sampling campaign and analytical measurements were performed during the last incubation the liquid samples and the headspace gas samples were taken at t 0 5 1 2 3 5 7 10 24 and 48 h headspace gas composition was analysed immediately after sampling all liquid samples v 1 5 ml were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm and the supernatant was stored at 20 c until the analyses an abiotic control experiment was performed using daf treated flowback water and sodium azide 6 4 mg l control batches were incubated and sampled similarly to the test batches 2 2 analytical measurements chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n were analysed with hach test kits lck 1414 and lck 304 respectively the ph was measured with hach hq 440d multimeter vss of sludge in aerobic

analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent vista mfx after acidification with 1 nitric acid volatile fatty acids vfa and alcohols were analysed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector gc fid agilent 7890b after sample acidification with formic acid all samples were diluted with milliq if the concentrations of analytes were above the calibration limits or salt concentration interfered with analytical procedures the quantification limits for ic cd icp oes and gc fid are presented in tables s2 and s3 headspace gas composition in batch tests was analysed by gas chromatography with micro thermal conductivity detector gc μtcd shimadzu gc 2010 the concentration of oxygen in the headspace during biological batch tests was quantified according to ideal gas law with pressure inside the bottle measured by pressure meter greisinger gmh 3151 specific oxygen uptake rate sour was calculated as a ratio of the measured oxygen consumption rate at the defined time period and sludge vss the fractions of organic carbon were separated using size exclusion chromatography sec followed by multidetection of organic carbon ocd uv absorbing aromatic and unsaturated structures at 254 nm uvd and organic bound nitrogen ond lc ocd analysis at the doc labor dr huber laboratory the detailed description of the analytical equipment and modified procedure for liquids with high tds are found in the literature huber et al 2011 salinas rodriguez 2011 calibration of molecular masses and detector sensitivities was performed with a nacl solutions of humic and fulvic acids and potassium hydrogen phthalate chromatograms were processed on the basis of area integration using the program chromcalc the assignation of the doc fractions detected in the flowback water is given in supplementary material organic compounds were analysed using liquid chromatography coupled to a linear ion trap orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer lc ltq hrms in positive and negative ionisation mode ses supplementary material for additional methodological details sjerps et al 2016 interpretation of detected peaks was performed using sieve 2 2 peak integration in combination with xcalibur software molecular formula identification the semi quantitative concentrations of the attributed compounds were expressed as atrazine d5 equivalents is eq in positive ionization mode and as bentazone d6 equivalents in negative ionization mode with a detection limit of 0 05 μg l is eq confidence levels regarding the identification of compounds were reported according to schymanski et al 2014 a level 5 confidence level suggests that an exact mass has been detected and an unequivocal molecular formula based on isotope and adduct information provides a level 4 identification level 3 suggests that a number of tentative structures are identified based on ms2 data levels 2 and 1 suggest that a probable structure or a confirmed structure has been assigned based on matches to library spectrums or reference standards total is eq concentrations of organic compounds were reported with a detection limit of 0 01 μg l carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus were allowed for molecular formula determination and if suggested by the spectrum chlorine and or sulphur were also considered the direction or of the internal standard mass error for a given spectrum in combination with isotope information i e presence of sulphur halogens the number of carbons based on c13 information etc was used to determine the most likely molecular formula in addition a suspect screening was also performed using the compound discoverer 2 0 software thermo scientific the used suspect list includes chemicals that could potentially be present in shale gas related waters and is described in detail in faber et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 flowback water composition the raw flowback water had a low ph 4 9 and high salinity tds 103 g l with chloride being the dominating anion and sodium calcium magnesium and strontium the dominating cations table s2 the relatively high concentrations of scale forming cations ca mg sr and ba should be of concern when targeting flowback water reuse in hydraulic fracturing because of the high scaling potential thiel and lienhard 2014 heavy metals were not detected in the flowback water except for manganese which concentrations were in the same order of magnitude as reported in the other studies hayes 2009 lester et al 2015 thacker et al 2015 ziemkiewicz and thomas he 2015 the flowback water was also characterised by high cod 1800 mg l doc 649 mg l and ammonium nitrogen 103 5 mg l concentrations fractionation of organic matter according to the size and hydrophobicity with subsequent detection of organic carbon uv absorbance at 254 nm and nitrogen showed that lmw acids and neutrals were two dominant organic fractions in the flowback water fig 1 table s4 since uvd and ond detectors showed no response for elution of lmw neutrals it was concluded that the fraction is represented by saturated hydrophilic compounds which do not contain nitrogen gc fid detection of vfa and alcohols has shown that lmw acid fraction was dominated by acetic acid 319 19 mg l or 43 and lmw neutral fraction by ethanol 215 17 mg l or 52 fig 1 table s3 other fatty acids propionic butyric and hexanoic acid and alcohols propanol and butanol were also detected though in much lower concentrations table s3 significant parts of lmw acids 48 6 and lmw neutrals 40 5 fractions were not classified further by gc fid suggesting the presence of a mixture of various lmw compounds apart from acetic acid and ethanol other doc fractions included hydrophobic organic compounds hoc high molecular weight biopolymers mw 10000 da and fraction of building blocks mw 300 500 da see supplementary material for detailed description these fractions presumably contain natural hydrocarbons of the formation and synthetic organic chemicals added to the fracturing fluid however the response of lc ocd system to synthetic organic chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing was not tested since the composition of fracturing fluid used at the flowback water sampling site was not disclosed the concentration of acetic acid in this study 319 19 mg l is in the range of the concentrations of acetate measured by olsson et al 2013 in flowback water from two hydraulically fractured wells in germany 417 and 197 mg l respectively the same authors did not find acetate in a well which was not fractured and concluded that acetate is a degradation product of polymers used in hydraulic fracturing fluids olsson et al 2013 these results are also confirmed by other authors who observed release of organic acids from shale being in contact with fracturing fluid under high temperature and pressure conditions vieth hillebrand et al 2017 contrary orem et al 2014 did not find significant concentrations of acetate in flowback water from hydraulically fractured wells in marcellus and new albany shales usa they suggest that acetate even if formed downhole will be immediately consumed by populations of methanogenic organisms in the well according to these authors high concentrations of acetate in flowback water found at some fields can be explained by cracking of kerogens at temperatures exceeding 80 c which also inhibits methanogens and thus the conversion of acetate to methane orem et al 2014 presence of ethanol in shale gas flowback water was previously reported only in one study where it was detected in one well out of nineteen and originated from fracturing fluid used at that location hayes 2009 ethanol may also be a degradation product of long chain ethoxylated alcohols which are frequently used in hydraulic fracturing operations twenty seven compounds with unique m z ratios were detected in flowback water with lc ltq hrms at is equivalent concentrations 0 05 μg l using sieve 2 2 and xcalibur software confidence levels 2 to 5 according to schymanski et al 2014 table s5 molecular formulas were assigned to ten of these compounds allowing for a 5 ppm mass error several polyethylene glycol peg oligomers octaethylene glycol decaethylene glycol dodecaethylene glycol and 1 6 dioxacyclododecane 7 12 dione cycloalkanedione were semi quantitatively detected in flowback water with confidence levels 2 to 4 table 1 peg oligomers which are common components of fracturing fluids were previously detected in flowback and produced water from denver julesburg basin usa thurman et al 2017 1 6 dioxacyclododecane 7 12 dione is detected in the fracturing fluid for the first time and most probably originates from alkanes naturally present in formation 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol possible transformation product of fracturing fluid additive 2 butoxyethanol was the only compound identified by suspect screening at the concentration of 29 4 μg l is eq being an evidence of downhole transformation of this frequently used and persistent fracturing chemical table 1 high concentrations of easily degradable organic compounds such as acetic acid and ethanol indicate a potential for biological treatment moreover combination of acetic acid as an energy limited and ethanol as an energy excess substrate should lead to higher bacterial growth rates and lower residual concentrations of organic matter babel 2009 3 2 daf pre treatment of flowback water pre treatment of flowback water with daf assisted by coagulation did not change cod and doc significantly 4 2 and 0 4 removal respectively however removal of biopolymer fraction of doc 74 1 was observed probably due to coagulation fig 2 at the same time increase of the hoc fraction was observed probably because of the formation of metal organic complexes which increase hydrophobicity of some organic compounds in flowback water the ph increase from 4 9 to 8 0 caused by ph adjustment with naoh required for coagulation has important implications for the following treatment steps neutral ph promotes biodegradation of organic matter compared to acidic ph of untreated flowback the ph of the solution also governs the choice of activated carbon surface chemistry since it may improve or impair removal of charged organic molecules al degs et al 2008 3 3 application of ozone for flowback water treatment the studied flowback water had low ozone demand with 44 mg o3 l consumed during 60 min whereas 300 mg o3 l was applied foaming was observed at the beginning of the experiment possibly caused by the presence of surfactants originated from fracturing fluid cod and doc removal was below 10 as well as removal of different doc fractions fig 2 table s4 similar results were achieved by lester et al 2015 in the experiments with different advanced oxidation processes uv h2o2 o2 h2o2 solar light chlorine photo fenton treating shale gas flowback water the authors have shown that oh radicals generated during ozonation were scavenged by bromide present in the flowback water at high concentration however despite high bromide concentrations 570 mg l and ph neutralization during daf pre treatment no changes in bromide concentrations were observed even at the highest ozone dosage applied in this study low efficiency of ozonation can be thus explained by saturated nature of organic compounds von gunten 2003 indirect ammonium oxidation by the product of bromide ozonation hypobromous acid hobr is expected at br n ratios above 0 4 eusebi and battistoni 2016 tanaka and matsumura 2003 thus eusebi battistoni 2016 removed 40 mg ammonium nitrogen applying ozone dosage similar to that applied in the present study 7 3 mg o3 mg n at high cl 14 g l concentration and high cod 11 g l despite the br nh4 n ratio was equal to 4 4 in this study no removal of nh4 n was observed 3 4 application of gac for flowback water treatment cod and doc removal with three studied gac types did not exceed 25 fig 2 table s4 biopolymers and building blocks were removed to the highest extent 67 and 58 respectively whereas removal of lmw acids did not exceed 30 and removal of lmw neutrals was negative a possible explanation is that most of the lmw organic compounds are weak adsorbates at near neutral ph of daf treated flowback water e g adsorption of acetate rapidly decreases at ph 6 0 kipling 1948 moreover displacement of lmw organic compounds with larger molecules might occur velten et al 2011 chemviron f400 showed the best performance 23 cod removal and 20 doc removal followed by norit c gran and norit 830w meanwhile hoc removal was higher with norit 830w 45 removal than with two other carbon types 27 removal this can be attributed to the differences in the carbon surface chemistry hence chemviron f400 and norit c gran have acidic surface whereas norit 830w has alkaline surface table s1 hydrophobic compounds with a negative charge would not be removed by gac with acidic surface due to the repulsion forces observed at near neutral ph of daf treated flowback water 3 5 application of aerobic degradation for flowback water treatment the efficacies of the cod and doc removal reached 73 and 83 respectively after 48 h of incubation fig 2 table s4 the cod was also measured in the liquid samples that were taken during incubation at 2 5 10 and 24 h showing that 71 removal was achieved already after 10 h of incubation further removal was not observed during next 38 h of incubation indicating that 30 of organic matter was non biodegradable similar cod removal efficacies were observed by other researchers who used activated sludge adapted to high chloride concentrations for flowback water treatment 50 cod removal after 6 h of batch incubation and conventional oil produced water treatment 81 cod removal after 21 h of aeration in sbr lester et al 2015 pendashteh et al 2010 sour during first hour of the incubation were between 25 and 40 mg g vss h fig 3 indicating high biological activity of sludge he et al 2017 further decrease of sour can be attributed rather to the substrate depletion in the batch experiment than to the inhibition of bioactivity neither oxygen consumption nor cod removal were registered in the abiotic control batches results not shown indicating that observed removal is attributed solely to biodegradation partial nh4 n removal 47 was observed during first 10 h of incubation fig 3 theoretical amount of nitrogen which could be assimilated in the batch experiment by biomass assuming 50 carbon assimilation and empirical bacterial composition ch1 666n0 20o0 27 is equal to 18 1 mg l this value is close to the observed nh4 n removal of 17 6 mg l after 10 h of incubation additionally formation of no2 which is the main product of ammonium oxidation at high salinities and no3 was not observed cui et al 2016 vendramel et al 2011 therefore nitrogen removal during aerobic treatment of flowback water occurs via assimilation by the biomass and not via the nitrification analysis of doc in the flowback water and sludge liquor used for biodegradation experiments have shown that flowback water was the main source of organic carbon minimal possible removal of flowback water doc fractions was calculated assuming that all doc of sludge liquor is removed in biological experiments the calculations showed high removal of doc 79 as well as its separate fractions hoc biopolymers lmw neutrals and lmw acids fig 2 table s4 gc fid analysis of vfa and alcohols in the liquid samples taken during aerobic incubation showed complete removal of acetic acid within 1 h whereas ethanol removal required 5 h of incubation catabolic free energy of ethanol oxidation δg0 1325 5 kj mol is higher than that of acetate oxidation δg0 893 7 kj mol which in turn leads to higher cell yields coupled to growth on ethanol and in theory preferable utilization of ethanol as a substrate roden and jin 2011 however first step of ethanol metabolism oxidation to acetaldehyde is endergonic which limits bacterial catabolism of this substrate faster metabolism of acetic acid can be also explained by competitive inhibition of the ethanol catabolism by acetate 3 6 removal of individual organic compounds total is eq concentrations of the individual organic compounds detected in flowback water by lc ltq hrms in positive and negative ionization modes was 5 2 mg l organic carbon makes up roughly 50 of the organic compounds therefore respective toc is 2 6 mg l mackinnon 1981 this value is considerably lower than the organic carbon content of the building blocks fraction 46 mg l determined by lc ocd analysis molecular weight of the compounds which make up fraction of building blocks is 300 500 da thus the fraction is completely covered by the lc ltq hrms molecular weight resolution of 115 1300 da therefore 10 of potentially present structures were identified by lc ltq hrms either because of the analytical limitations of the chromatographic separation or due to the high detection limits 0 05 μg l is eq daf and ozonation did not improve removal of detected individual organic compounds as shown by the is eq concentrations assigned to unique exact masses table s5 and total is eq concentrations fig 4 1 6 dioxacyclododecane 7 12 dione was the only compound removed by daf to 0 01 μg l is eq among 27 unique exact masses determined in flowback water table 1 removal of this volatile cyclic polyester dimer was most probably achieved by stripping after pressurized air release at the same time is eq concentrations of peg oligomers in flowback water increased possibly due to the breakdown of higher molecular weight peg polymers table 1 application of gac with acidic surface chemistry chemviron f400 and norit c gran led to 99 removal of organic compounds fig 4 activated carbon with alkaline surface chemistry norit 830w showed lower performance with 98 and 78 removal of organic compounds analysed in positive and negative mode respectively these results are complementary to the observed removal of cod and doc which is higher for gac with acidic surfaces fig 2 removal of individual organic compounds detected in positive ionization mode did not change significantly in biodegradation experiments whereas removal of the compounds measured in negative ionization mode decreased fig 4 organic compounds with higher molecular weight mw 350 da were removed whereas lower molecular weight compounds mw 200 350 da were formed after aerobic incubation table s5 these compounds can be identified as intermediates of aerobic degradation because their presence was proved neither in the flowback water nor in the sludge liquor one of these intermediates was identified as 1 3 dicyclohexylurea however it is unclear whether the intermediates are resulting from biodegradation of compounds present in flowback water or sludge liquor the only compound identified by the suspect screening namely 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol was not removed during daf the compound was removed by all subsequent treatments tested ozonation sorption to activated carbon and biodegradation 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol is a transformation product of 2 butoxyethanol which is frequently used in the fracturing fluids and is not rejected by membranes therefore removal of this compound and its transformation products prior to membrane filtration is highly desired 3 7 implications for flowback water management aerobic biological treatment is inexpensive relatively to physic chemical processes for organic contaminants removal however it is rarely used for oil and gas produced water due to potential problems related to high salinity and presence of inhibitory compounds lefebvre and moletta 2006 yet the present study together with the work of lester et al 2015 has shown that aerobic degradation targets easily degradable lmw organics that comprise the majority of organics in shale gas fpw yet aerobic degradation at higher chloride concentrations than applied in this study 32 g l will be a challenging task akyon et al 2015 jiménez et al 2018 combination with other industrial wastewaters with lower salinities or adaptation of sludge to higher concentrations of cl may be a solution for flowback waters with high salinities whereas lmw organic acids and alcohols are removed by aerobic degradation fractions with higher molecular weight are only partially removed as shown by doc fractionation and analysis of individual organic compounds in contrast activated carbon can effectively remove compounds with mw 115 1300 da not affecting lmw organic acids and alcohols sorption to activated carbon is also efficient towards removal of other classes of organic pollutants which commonly occur in shale gas fpw but were not detected in this study namely pahs chlorinated organics and total petroleum hydrocarbons alzahrani and mohammad 2014 pavoni et al 2006 rosenblum et al 2016 hence combination of aerobic degradation with gac filtration can target different fractions and classes of organic compounds the processes can be applied as an intermediate treatment step between primary treatment and tds removal in order to decrease membrane fouling or prior to the direct flowback water reuse if equipment fouling due to elevated concentrations of organic compounds is observed at the production sites alzahrani and mohammad 2014 additional studies on the changes of flowback water toxicity during aerobic degradation and gac filtration is needed since only a small number of organic compounds can be identified using existing non target screening methods composition of shale gas flowback water differs significantly between production sites and even between wells within a single play shih et al 2015 hence each full scale application will require an individual approach including characterization of flowback water and evaluation of its biological treatability flowback water may be combined with other types of industrial wastewater with lower salinity to offer optimal solutions for equalization of peaks in flow and composition including salinity thus environmentally safe discharge or re use of such water streams may be facilitated which is especially relevant for agricultural industrial regions where water scarcity is paralleled by shale gas production 4 conclusions the studied flowback water was characterised by the high concentrations of organic compounds as indicated by cod 1800 mg l and doc 649 mg l concentrations organic compounds in the studied flowback water were dominated by lmw acids and neutrals with acetic acid and ethanol being the most abundant lmw compounds only a small number of individual organic compounds including peg oligomers and presumable fracturing fluid additives 1 6 dioxacyclododecane 7 12 dione and 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol were identified using non target lc ltq hrms screening daf applied for flowback water pre treatment did not change cod and doc as well as concentrations of organic fractions and individual organic compounds significantly this indicates necessity for specific organic removal especially when the present organics cause fouling on the membranes frequently applied for tds removal or on the drilling and fracturing equipment when the water is going to be reused for the next fracturing operations without desalination step shaffer et al 2013 ozonation was shown to be inefficient towards removal of organic compounds aerobic degradation removed 70 of doc mainly targeting lmw organics in addition gac filtration removed fractions of doc with higher molecular weight including lc ltq hrms detected individual organic compounds with molecular weight between 115 and 1300 da combination of both technologies is proposed for efficient organic removal prior to desalination or flowback water reuse acknowledgement this work was funded by the netherlands organisation for scientific

19592,ozonation sorption to granular activated carbon and aerobic degradation were compared as potential treatment methods for removal of dissolved organic carbon doc fractions and selected organic compounds from shale gas flowback water after pre treatment in dissolved air flotation unit flowback water was characterised by high chemical oxygen demand and doc low molecular weight lmw acids and neutral compounds were the most abundant organic fractions corresponding to 47 and 35 of doc respectively ozonation did not change distribution of organic carbon fractions and concentrations of detected individual organic compounds significantly sorption to activated carbon targeted removal of individual organic compounds with molecular weight 115 da whereas lmw compounds remained largely unaffected aerobic degradation was responsible for removal of lmw compounds and partial ammonium removal whereas formation of intermediates with molecular weight of 200 350 da was observed combination of aerobic degradation for lmw organics removal with adsorption to activated carbon for removal of non biodegradable organics is proposed to be implemented between pre treatment dissolved air floatation and desalination thermal or membrane desalination steps graphical abstract image 1 keywords shale gas hydraulic fracturing flowback water dissolved organic carbon aerobic degradation 1 introduction the negative impact on the quality of surface and ground water is one of the major environmental consequences of shale gas production brantley et al 2014 ferrar et al 2013 jackson et al 2013 osborn et al 2011 vidic et al 2013 shale gas producers use a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to recover gas from formations hydraulic fracturing implies high pressure well injection of large volumes of water mixed with inert solid material proppant and chemical additives this mixture called fracturing fluid creates fissures in the shale increasing its permeability and gas recovery the mixture of the injected fracturing fluid together with the connate water of the formation which returns to the surface within few weeks after pressure being released is called flowback water olmstead et al 2013 the connate water of the formation which continues flowing upwards for years after fracturing has been completed is called produced water vidic et al 2013 both flowback and produced waters fpw are contaminated with high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds oil and grease natural radioactive materials norm and dissolved organic matter dom gregory et al 2011 injection into disposal wells was the most widely used shale gas wastewater management strategy until 2010 epa 2016 rahm et al 2013 however the limited availability of disposal wells increased uncertainties about risks related to deep well injection and legislative constrains make the industry turn towards reuse and discharge of fpw gregory et al 2011 mauter et al 2014 rahm et al 2013 silva et al 2017 removal of contaminants is required before fpw can be discharged fpw reuse also requires removal of certain compounds e g potential scalants and foulants treatment technologies typically include separation for removal of total suspended solids tss oil and grease adsorption for removal of organics norm and heavy metals membrane or thermal desalination for tds removal drioli et al 2015 igunnu and chen 2014 jiménez et al 2018 saba 2014 desalination is a crucial step in the fpw treatment because of the high tds concentrations that often equal or exceed sea water salinity shaffer et al 2013 membrane and thermal desalination technologies for oil and gas produced water are well established and can remove tds and majority of contaminants mentioned above abousnina et al 2015 fakhru l razi et al 2009 however concentrations of organic carbon in shale gas fpw often exceed 1000 mg l causing fouling on the membranes and distillation equipment alzahrani and mohammad 2014 chen et al 2015 thiel and lienhard 2014 in addition desalination technologies are effective towards high molecular weight polar compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs but poorly remove low molecular weight non polar organics that may also pose threats to the environment and human health annevelink et al 2016 butkovskyi et al 2017 ferrar et al 2013 shaffer et al 2013 despite that only few studies attempt to characterize the nature of organic compounds in fpw and evaluate potential treatment strategies for their removal butkovskyi et al 2017 camarillo et al 2016 components of the fracturing fluid including heterocyclic biocides cocamidopropyl surfactants ethylene glycol and derivatives as well as natural constituents of shale including aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons alkanes resins asphaltenes heterocyclic and halogenated organics were detected in fpw from u s shale basins using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry gc ms and lc ms annevelink et al 2016 butkovskyi et al 2017 ferrar et al 2013 hayes 2009 lester et al 2015 maguire boyle and barron 2014 orem et al 2014 lester et al 2015 reported low removal of dom from shale gas flowback water by advanced oxidation whereas aerobic treatment removed 50 of dom at flowback water tds of 22 5 g l other authors demonstrated that microbial mats are capable to decrease cod at tds as high as 100 g l akyon et al 2015 neither the fate of different dom fractions nor the removal of individual organic compounds were studied in these works moreover akyon et al 2015 did their experiments with synthetic flowback water several authors reported high biodegradability of fracturing fluid components including poly ethylene glycol surfactants and biocide glutaraldehyde kekacs et al 2015 mclaughlin et al 2016 mouser et al 2016 however the degradation of compounds was studied in fracturing fluids which composition is very different from fpw high potential of granular activated carbon gac for adsorption of fracturing fluid chemicals furfural and 2 butoxyethanol and powdered activated carbon pac for adsorption of polyethylene glycols was also shown manz et al 2016 rosenblum et al 2016 so far these are the only two studies focused on application of activated carbon for removal of organic chemicals from flowback water this paper aims to assess the removal of different fractions of dissolved organic carbon and individual organic compounds present in flowback water using typical primary treatment process dissolved air flotation followed by one of the common processes for organics removal ozonation adsorption to activated carbon or aerobic degradation flowback water is studied because in comparison to produced water this stream has typically high concentrations of organic carbon and contains potentially harmful components of fracturing fluids the most promising treatment strategy for organic compounds removal is proposed and its integration with existing treatment processes is discussed 2 materials and methods the shale gas flowback water was obtained from a baltic shale gas basin poland under non disclosure agreement regarding location storage conditions and composition of the fracturing fluid used at the production site the water was sampled within two months after commencement of the first fracturing operation it was transported in 20 l plastic containers and stored at 4 c until the experiments the flowback water was pre treated in a dissolved air flotation daf unit assisted by coagulation in order to remove tss oil and grease daf treated flowback water was used for ozonation adsorption to gac and aerobic degradation experiments 2 1 experimental set up 2 1 1 dissolved air flotation coagulation flowback water v 80 l was treated by fecl3 assisted daf in a stainless steel tank v 200 l fecl3 100 mg fe l was added as a coagulant and ph was adjusted to 8 0 by addition of naoh 0 5 g l megid et al 2014 flocculation was observed within 40 min and 3 l of water saturated with air was released to the stainless steel vessel from the adjacent pressurized tank p 5 bar flotation contact time was 10 min daf treated flowback water v 63 l was collected excluding precipitate and scum v 20 l and stored at 4 c until ozonation gac sorption and aerobic degradation tests were performed 2 1 2 ozonation ozonation was performed in batch mode in a glass vessel vliquid 2 l with ozone supplied through a bubble diffuser during 60 min ozone was produced from pure oxygen using a fischer 503 ozone generator the gas flow was maintained at 0 1 m3 h and the ozone concentration in the reactor inlet at 6 3 g m3 ozone concentrations in the gas phase of the reactor inlet and outlet were measured by bmt ozone analyser 961tc and 961 respectively an ozone dosage of 0 3 g l was applied to daf treated flowback water additionally control tests with air supplied instead of ozone at the same flow rate were run to correct for volatilization to correct for ozone losses in the system a blank test with milliq was run until stabilization of ozone concentrations in the reactor inlet 6 0 g m3 and outlet 5 5 g m3 has been reached the ozone losses were taken into account when calculating ozone consumption of the flowback water liquid samples were filtrated through 0 45 μm pore size filters directly after the test and stored at 20 c until the analyses 2 1 3 sorption to gac sorption tests were performed with daf treated flowback water and three different types of gac granular types of activated carbon were chosen because they are preferred to powdered by oil and gas industry due to lower carbon usage rates and operational costs arthur et al 2005 hackney and wiesner 1996 the tests were performed in stirred glass vessels vliquid 1 l using three different fresh gac types typically used in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment chemviron f400 norit gac 830w and norit c gran table s1 and dosage of 2000 mg l the adsorption tests were run for 6 weeks at 20 c to reach the equilibrium state liquid samples were filtrated through 0 45 μm pore size filters directly after the test and stored at 20 c until the analyses 2 1 4 aerobic degradation batch aerobic degradation test was adapted from oecd method 301a oecd 1992 the test was performed in triplicate in 250 ml glass bottles holding a liquid volume of 120 ml and headspace volume of 130 ml activated sludge adapted to high salinities was obtained from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp at delfzijl the netherlands which treats industrial wastewater with high cl concentrations 2 20 g cl l van der marel and de boks 2014 the sludge volatile suspended solids vss 3 5 g l was collected from the aerobic nitrification basin and stored at 4 c until the experiment sludge liquor had low cod 170 mg l no ammonium nitrogen and comparatively high chloride concentrations cl 22 g l daf treated flowback water was mixed with sludge from delfzijl wwtp volumetric ratio of 0 29 0 71 to obtain the sludge loading of 0 1 g cod g vss d diluted batch samples prepared for aerobic degradation experiments contained significantly lower cod 610 mg l and doc 192 mg l when compared to the daf treated flowback water disodium phosphate was added as external phosphorous source to reach substrate n p ratio of 5 1 the rest of the nutrients required according to oecd method 301a were present in the tested flowback water in excess the glass bottles were closed with butyl rubber septa and incubated horizontally at constant temperature 20 c for 48 h on a linear shaker at 160 rpm for maximum oxygen up take the headspace composition was refreshed as soon as the oxygen volume fraction dropped to 10 to adapt the sludge to changes in salinity and substrate composition batch incubations were repeated six times with the substrate refreshment between incubations to refresh the substrate the batches were centrifuged at 1500 rpm and the sludge pellet was mixed with a new portion of daf treated flowback water and sludge liquor full sampling campaign and analytical measurements were performed during the last incubation the liquid samples and the headspace gas samples were taken at t 0 5 1 2 3 5 7 10 24 and 48 h headspace gas composition was analysed immediately after sampling all liquid samples v 1 5 ml were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm and the supernatant was stored at 20 c until the analyses an abiotic control experiment was performed using daf treated flowback water and sodium azide 6 4 mg l control batches were incubated and sampled similarly to the test batches 2 2 analytical measurements chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n were analysed with hach test kits lck 1414 and lck 304 respectively the ph was measured with hach hq 440d multimeter vss of sludge in aerobic degradation experiments were measured according to the standard method 2540 d apha 1998 anions were analysed by ion chromatography with conductivity detector ic cd dionex ics 2100 cations were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent vista mfx after acidification with 1 nitric acid volatile fatty acids vfa and alcohols were analysed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector gc fid agilent 7890b after sample acidification with formic acid all samples were diluted with milliq if the concentrations of analytes were above the calibration limits or salt concentration interfered with analytical procedures the quantification limits for ic cd icp oes and gc fid are presented in tables s2 and s3 headspace gas composition in batch tests was analysed by gas chromatography with micro thermal conductivity detector gc μtcd shimadzu gc 2010 the concentration of oxygen in the headspace during biological batch tests was quantified according to ideal gas law with pressure inside the bottle measured by pressure meter greisinger gmh 3151 specific oxygen uptake rate sour was calculated as a ratio of the measured oxygen consumption rate at the defined time period and sludge vss the fractions of organic carbon were separated using size exclusion chromatography sec followed by multidetection of organic carbon ocd uv absorbing aromatic and unsaturated structures at 254 nm uvd and organic bound nitrogen ond lc ocd analysis at the doc labor dr huber laboratory the detailed description of the analytical equipment and modified procedure for liquids with high tds are found in the literature huber et al 2011 salinas rodriguez 2011 calibration of molecular masses and detector sensitivities was performed with a nacl solutions of humic and fulvic acids and potassium hydrogen phthalate chromatograms were processed on the basis of area integration using the program chromcalc the assignation of the doc fractions detected in the flowback water is given in supplementary material organic compounds were analysed using liquid chromatography coupled to a linear ion trap orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer lc ltq hrms in positive and negative ionisation mode ses supplementary material for additional methodological details sjerps et al 2016 interpretation of detected peaks was performed using sieve 2 2 peak integration in combination with xcalibur software molecular formula identification the semi quantitative concentrations of the attributed compounds were expressed as atrazine d5 equivalents is eq in positive ionization mode and as bentazone d6 equivalents in negative ionization mode with a detection limit of 0 05 μg l is eq confidence levels regarding the identification of compounds were reported according to schymanski et al 2014 a level 5 confidence level suggests that an exact mass has been detected and an unequivocal molecular formula based on isotope and adduct information provides a level 4 identification level 3 suggests that a number of tentative structures are identified based on ms2 data levels 2 and 1 suggest that a probable structure or a confirmed structure has been assigned based on matches to library spectrums or reference standards total is eq concentrations of organic compounds were reported with a detection limit of 0 01 μg l carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus were allowed for molecular formula determination and if suggested by the spectrum chlorine and or sulphur were also considered the direction or of the internal standard mass error for a given spectrum in combination with isotope information i e presence of sulphur halogens the number of carbons based on c13 information etc was used to determine the most likely molecular formula in addition a suspect screening was also performed using the compound discoverer 2 0 software thermo scientific the used suspect list includes chemicals that could potentially be present in shale gas related waters and is described in detail in faber et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 flowback water composition the raw flowback water had a low ph 4 9 and high salinity tds 103 g l with chloride being the dominating anion and sodium calcium magnesium and strontium the dominating cations table s2 the relatively high concentrations of scale forming cations ca mg sr and ba should be of concern when targeting flowback water reuse in hydraulic fracturing because of the high scaling potential thiel and lienhard 2014 heavy metals were not detected in the flowback water except for manganese which concentrations were in the same order of magnitude as reported in the other studies hayes 2009 lester et al 2015 thacker et al 2015 ziemkiewicz and thomas he 2015 the flowback water was also characterised by high cod 1800 mg l doc 649 mg l and ammonium nitrogen 103 5 mg l concentrations fractionation of organic matter according to the size and hydrophobicity with subsequent detection of organic carbon uv absorbance at 254 nm and nitrogen showed that lmw acids and neutrals were two dominant organic fractions in the flowback water fig 1 table s4 since uvd and ond detectors showed no response for elution of lmw neutrals it was concluded that the fraction is represented by saturated hydrophilic compounds which do not contain nitrogen gc fid detection of vfa and alcohols has shown that lmw acid fraction was dominated by acetic acid 319 19 mg l or 43 and lmw neutral fraction by ethanol 215 17 mg l or 52 fig 1 table s3 other fatty acids propionic butyric and hexanoic acid and alcohols propanol and butanol were also detected though in much lower concentrations table s3 significant parts of lmw acids 48 6 and lmw neutrals 40 5 fractions were not classified further by gc fid suggesting the presence of a mixture of various lmw compounds apart from acetic acid and ethanol other doc fractions included hydrophobic organic compounds hoc high molecular weight biopolymers mw 10000 da and fraction of building blocks mw 300 500 da see supplementary material for detailed description these fractions presumably contain natural hydrocarbons of the formation and synthetic organic chemicals added to the fracturing fluid however the response of lc ocd system to synthetic organic chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing was not tested since the composition of fracturing fluid used at the flowback water sampling site was not disclosed the concentration of acetic acid in this study 319 19 mg l is in the range of the concentrations of acetate measured by olsson et al 2013 in flowback water from two hydraulically fractured wells in germany 417 and 197 mg l respectively the same authors did not find acetate in a well which was not fractured and concluded that acetate is a degradation product of polymers used in hydraulic fracturing fluids olsson et al 2013 these results are also confirmed by other authors who observed release of organic acids from shale being in contact with fracturing fluid under high temperature and pressure conditions vieth hillebrand et al 2017 contrary orem et al 2014 did not find significant concentrations of acetate in flowback water from hydraulically fractured wells in marcellus and new albany shales usa they suggest that acetate even if formed downhole will be immediately consumed by populations of methanogenic organisms in the well according to these authors high concentrations of acetate in flowback water found at some fields can be explained by cracking of kerogens at temperatures exceeding 80 c which also inhibits methanogens and thus the conversion of acetate to methane orem et al 2014 presence of ethanol in shale gas flowback water was previously reported only in one study where it was detected in one well out of nineteen and originated from fracturing fluid used at that location hayes 2009 ethanol may also be a degradation product of long chain ethoxylated alcohols which are frequently used in hydraulic fracturing operations twenty seven compounds with unique m z ratios were detected in flowback water with lc ltq hrms at is equivalent concentrations 0 05 μg l using sieve 2 2 and xcalibur software confidence levels 2 to 5 according to schymanski et al 2014 table s5 molecular formulas were assigned to ten of these compounds allowing for a 5 ppm mass error several polyethylene glycol peg oligomers octaethylene glycol decaethylene glycol dodecaethylene glycol and 1 6 dioxacyclododecane 7 12 dione cycloalkanedione were semi quantitatively detected in flowback water with confidence levels 2 to 4 table 1 peg oligomers which are common components of fracturing fluids were previously detected in flowback and produced water from denver julesburg basin usa thurman et al 2017 1 6 dioxacyclododecane 7 12 dione is detected in the fracturing fluid for the first time and most probably originates from alkanes naturally present in formation 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol possible transformation product of fracturing fluid additive 2 butoxyethanol was the only compound identified by suspect screening at the concentration of 29 4 μg l is eq being an evidence of downhole transformation of this frequently used and persistent fracturing chemical table 1 high concentrations of easily degradable organic compounds such as acetic acid and ethanol indicate a potential for biological treatment moreover combination of acetic acid as an energy limited and ethanol as an energy excess substrate should lead to higher bacterial growth rates and lower residual concentrations of organic matter babel 2009 3 2 daf pre treatment of flowback water pre treatment of flowback water with daf assisted by coagulation did not change cod and doc significantly 4 2 and 0 4 removal respectively however removal of biopolymer fraction of doc 74 1 was observed probably due to coagulation fig 2 at the same time increase of the hoc fraction was observed probably because of the formation of metal organic complexes which increase hydrophobicity of some organic compounds in flowback water the ph increase from 4 9 to 8 0 caused by ph adjustment with naoh required for coagulation has important implications for the following treatment steps neutral ph promotes biodegradation of organic matter compared to acidic ph of untreated flowback the ph of the solution also governs the choice of activated carbon surface chemistry since it may improve or impair removal of charged organic molecules al degs et al 2008 3 3 application of ozone for flowback water treatment the studied flowback water had low ozone demand with 44 mg o3 l consumed during 60 min whereas 300 mg o3 l was applied foaming was observed at the beginning of the experiment possibly caused by the presence of surfactants originated from fracturing fluid cod and doc removal was below 10 as well as removal of different doc fractions fig 2 table s4 similar results were achieved by lester et al 2015 in the experiments with different advanced oxidation processes uv h2o2 o2 h2o2 solar light chlorine photo fenton treating shale gas flowback water the authors have shown that oh radicals generated during ozonation were scavenged by bromide present in the flowback water at high concentration however despite high bromide concentrations 570 mg l and ph neutralization during daf pre treatment no changes in bromide concentrations were observed even at the highest ozone dosage applied in this study low efficiency of ozonation can be thus explained by saturated nature of organic compounds von gunten 2003 indirect ammonium oxidation by the product of bromide ozonation hypobromous acid hobr is expected at br n ratios above 0 4 eusebi and battistoni 2016 tanaka and matsumura 2003 thus eusebi battistoni 2016 removed 40 mg ammonium nitrogen applying ozone dosage similar to that applied in the present study 7 3 mg o3 mg n at high cl 14 g l concentration and high cod 11 g l despite the br nh4 n ratio was equal to 4 4 in this study no removal of nh4 n was observed 3 4 application of gac for flowback water treatment cod and doc removal with three studied gac types did not exceed 25 fig 2 table s4 biopolymers and building blocks were removed to the highest extent 67 and 58 respectively whereas removal of lmw acids did not exceed 30 and removal of lmw neutrals was negative a possible explanation is that most of the lmw organic compounds are weak adsorbates at near neutral ph of daf treated flowback water e g adsorption of acetate rapidly decreases at ph 6 0 kipling 1948 moreover displacement of lmw organic compounds with larger molecules might occur velten et al 2011 chemviron f400 showed the best performance 23 cod removal and 20 doc removal followed by norit c gran and norit 830w meanwhile hoc removal was higher with norit 830w 45 removal than with two other carbon types 27 removal this can be attributed to the differences in the carbon surface chemistry hence chemviron f400 and norit c gran have acidic surface whereas norit 830w has alkaline surface table s1 hydrophobic compounds with a negative charge would not be removed by gac with acidic surface due to the repulsion forces observed at near neutral ph of daf treated flowback water 3 5 application of aerobic degradation for flowback water treatment the efficacies of the cod and doc removal reached 73 and 83 respectively after 48 h of incubation fig 2 table s4 the cod was also measured in the liquid samples that were taken during incubation at 2 5 10 and 24 h showing that 71 removal was achieved already after 10 h of incubation further removal was not observed during next 38 h of incubation indicating that 30 of organic matter was non biodegradable similar cod removal efficacies were observed by other researchers who used activated sludge adapted to high chloride concentrations for flowback water treatment 50 cod removal after 6 h of batch incubation and conventional oil produced water treatment 81 cod removal after 21 h of aeration in sbr lester et al 2015 pendashteh et al 2010 sour during first hour of the incubation were between 25 and 40 mg g vss h fig 3 indicating high biological activity of sludge he et al 2017 further decrease of sour can be attributed rather to the substrate depletion in the batch experiment than to the inhibition of bioactivity neither oxygen consumption nor cod removal were registered in the abiotic control batches results not shown indicating that observed removal is attributed solely to biodegradation partial nh4 n removal 47 was observed during first 10 h of incubation fig 3 theoretical amount of nitrogen which could be assimilated in the batch experiment by biomass assuming 50 carbon assimilation and empirical bacterial composition ch1 666n0 20o0 27 is equal to 18 1 mg l this value is close to the observed nh4 n removal of 17 6 mg l after 10 h of incubation additionally formation of no2 which is the main product of ammonium oxidation at high salinities and no3 was not observed cui et al 2016 vendramel et al 2011 therefore nitrogen removal during aerobic treatment of flowback water occurs via assimilation by the biomass and not via the nitrification analysis of doc in the flowback water and sludge liquor used for biodegradation experiments have shown that flowback water was the main source of organic carbon minimal possible removal of flowback water doc fractions was calculated assuming that all doc of sludge liquor is removed in biological experiments the calculations showed high removal of doc 79 as well as its separate fractions hoc biopolymers lmw neutrals and lmw acids fig 2 table s4 gc fid analysis of vfa and alcohols in the liquid samples taken during aerobic incubation showed complete removal of acetic acid within 1 h whereas ethanol removal required 5 h of incubation catabolic free energy of ethanol oxidation δg0 1325 5 kj mol is higher than that of acetate oxidation δg0 893 7 kj mol which in turn leads to higher cell yields coupled to growth on ethanol and in theory preferable utilization of ethanol as a substrate roden and jin 2011 however first step of ethanol metabolism oxidation to acetaldehyde is endergonic which limits bacterial catabolism of this substrate faster metabolism of acetic acid can be also explained by competitive inhibition of the ethanol catabolism by acetate 3 6 removal of individual organic compounds total is eq concentrations of the individual organic compounds detected in flowback water by lc ltq hrms in positive and negative ionization modes was 5 2 mg l organic carbon makes up roughly 50 of the organic compounds therefore respective toc is 2 6 mg l mackinnon 1981 this value is considerably lower than the organic carbon content of the building blocks fraction 46 mg l determined by lc ocd analysis molecular weight of the compounds which make up fraction of building blocks is 300 500 da thus the fraction is completely covered by the lc ltq hrms molecular weight resolution of 115 1300 da therefore 10 of potentially present structures were identified by lc ltq hrms either because of the analytical limitations of the chromatographic separation or due to the high detection limits 0 05 μg l is eq daf and ozonation did not improve removal of detected individual organic compounds as shown by the is eq concentrations assigned to unique exact masses table s5 and total is eq concentrations fig 4 1 6 dioxacyclododecane 7 12 dione was the only compound removed by daf to 0 01 μg l is eq among 27 unique exact masses determined in flowback water table 1 removal of this volatile cyclic polyester dimer was most probably achieved by stripping after pressurized air release at the same time is eq concentrations of peg oligomers in flowback water increased possibly due to the breakdown of higher molecular weight peg polymers table 1 application of gac with acidic surface chemistry chemviron f400 and norit c gran led to 99 removal of organic compounds fig 4 activated carbon with alkaline surface chemistry norit 830w showed lower performance with 98 and 78 removal of organic compounds analysed in positive and negative mode respectively these results are complementary to the observed removal of cod and doc which is higher for gac with acidic surfaces fig 2 removal of individual organic compounds detected in positive ionization mode did not change significantly in biodegradation experiments whereas removal of the compounds measured in negative ionization mode decreased fig 4 organic compounds with higher molecular weight mw 350 da were removed whereas lower molecular weight compounds mw 200 350 da were formed after aerobic incubation table s5 these compounds can be identified as intermediates of aerobic degradation because their presence was proved neither in the flowback water nor in the sludge liquor one of these intermediates was identified as 1 3 dicyclohexylurea however it is unclear whether the intermediates are resulting from biodegradation of compounds present in flowback water or sludge liquor the only compound identified by the suspect screening namely 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol was not removed during daf the compound was removed by all subsequent treatments tested ozonation sorption to activated carbon and biodegradation 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol is a transformation product of 2 butoxyethanol which is frequently used in the fracturing fluids and is not rejected by membranes therefore removal of this compound and its transformation products prior to membrane filtration is highly desired 3 7 implications for flowback water management aerobic biological treatment is inexpensive relatively to physic chemical processes for organic contaminants removal however it is rarely used for oil and gas produced water due to potential problems related to high salinity and presence of inhibitory compounds lefebvre and moletta 2006 yet the present study together with the work of lester et al 2015 has shown that aerobic degradation targets easily degradable lmw organics that comprise the majority of organics in shale gas fpw yet aerobic degradation at higher chloride concentrations than applied in this study 32 g l will be a challenging task akyon et al 2015 jiménez et al 2018 combination with other industrial wastewaters with lower salinities or adaptation of sludge to higher concentrations of cl may be a solution for flowback waters with high salinities whereas lmw organic acids and alcohols are removed by aerobic degradation fractions with higher molecular weight are only partially removed as shown by doc fractionation and analysis of individual organic compounds in contrast activated carbon can effectively remove compounds with mw 115 1300 da not affecting lmw organic acids and alcohols sorption to activated carbon is also efficient towards removal of other classes of organic pollutants which commonly occur in shale gas fpw but were not detected in this study namely pahs chlorinated organics and total petroleum hydrocarbons alzahrani and mohammad 2014 pavoni et al 2006 rosenblum et al 2016 hence combination of aerobic degradation with gac filtration can target different fractions and classes of organic compounds the processes can be applied as an intermediate treatment step between primary treatment and tds removal in order to decrease membrane fouling or prior to the direct flowback water reuse if equipment fouling due to elevated concentrations of organic compounds is observed at the production sites alzahrani and mohammad 2014 additional studies on the changes of flowback water toxicity during aerobic degradation and gac filtration is needed since only a small number of organic compounds can be identified using existing non target screening methods composition of shale gas flowback water differs significantly between production sites and even between wells within a single play shih et al 2015 hence each full scale application will require an individual approach including characterization of flowback water and evaluation of its biological treatability flowback water may be combined with other types of industrial wastewater with lower salinity to offer optimal solutions for equalization of peaks in flow and composition including salinity thus environmentally safe discharge or re use of such water streams may be facilitated which is especially relevant for agricultural industrial regions where water scarcity is paralleled by shale gas production 4 conclusions the studied flowback water was characterised by the high concentrations of organic compounds as indicated by cod 1800 mg l and doc 649 mg l concentrations organic compounds in the studied flowback water were dominated by lmw acids and neutrals with acetic acid and ethanol being the most abundant lmw compounds only a small number of individual organic compounds including peg oligomers and presumable fracturing fluid additives 1 6 dioxacyclododecane 7 12 dione and 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol were identified using non target lc ltq hrms screening daf applied for flowback water pre treatment did not change cod and doc as well as concentrations of organic fractions and individual organic compounds significantly this indicates necessity for specific organic removal especially when the present organics cause fouling on the membranes frequently applied for tds removal or on the drilling and fracturing equipment when the water is going to be reused for the next fracturing operations without desalination step shaffer et al 2013 ozonation was shown to be inefficient towards removal of organic compounds aerobic degradation removed 70 of doc mainly targeting lmw organics in addition gac filtration removed fractions of doc with higher molecular weight including lc ltq hrms detected individual organic compounds with molecular weight between 115 and 1300 da combination of both technologies is proposed for efficient organic removal prior to desalination or flowback water reuse acknowledgement this work was funded by the netherlands organisation for scientific

19593,recently in situ chemical oxidation isco using peroxymonosulfate pms for environmental decontamination has received increasing interest in this study oxidation kinetics and products of four steroid estrogens i e estrone 17β estradiol estriol and 17α ethinylestradiol by pms under various conditions were investigated pms could fairly degrade steroid estrogens over the ph range of 7 10 and the degradation rate increased with the increase of solution ph this ph dependence was well described by parallel reactions between individual acid base species of steroid estrogens e and e and pms hso5 and so5 2 where specific second order rate constants for e with hso5 and so5 2 were in the range of 2 11 5 58 m 1s 1 and 0 77 1 25 m 1s 1 respectively identification of oxidation products by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer showed that pms readily oxidized the phenolic group of steroid estrogens leading to the generation of hydroxylated and ring opening products the presence of bromide and chloride ions br and cl at environmentally relevant levels could greatly accelerate the degradation of steroid estrogens by pms with the formation of halogenated aromatic products this effect was quantitatively estimated by a kinetic model where the formation of free bromine and chorine and their rapid electrophilic substitution with steroid estrogens were taken into consideration eco toxicity of transformation products of 17α ethinylestradiol by pms treatment in the absence and presence of bromide and chloride was estimated by quantitative structure activity relationship analysis using ecosar these findings advance the understanding of isco using pms graphical abstract image 1 keywords peroxymonosulfate steroid estrogens

on wildlife and human these compounds are capable of disrupting endocrine systems even at very low concentrations ng l 1 to μg l 1 leading to abnormal development reproductive disorders and cancers khetan and collins 2007 nash et al 2004 peterson et al 2000 animal feeding operations biosolids augmented agricultural land and municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps effluents are regarded as major sources of steroid estrogens to the environments lee et al 2015 steroid estrogens have been detected in surface and ground waters in the vicinity of manure applied fields in concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 lee et al 2007 shore and shemesh 2003 chemical oxidation technology is a promising option for elimination of steroid estrogens many studies have been conducted to examine the treatment of steroid estrogens by various chemical oxidants it has been demonstrated that permanganate mn vii ferrate fe vi chlorine dioxide ozone and hydroxyl radical oh are effective in destructing steroid estrogens with moderate to very rapid rates huber et al 2004 jiang et al 2012 lee et al 2005 2008 the reactive phenolic moiety i e the most important functional group in steroid estrogens can be destroyed in these oxidation processes thus resulting in a decrease of the estrogenic activity in recent years in situ chemical oxidation isco using peroxymonosulfate pms for subsurface remediation e g soil sediment and groundwater has received increasing interest zhou et al 2015 anipsitakis et al 2008 chesney et al 2016 cui et al 2017 do et al 2009 rastogi et al 2009 rodríguez chueca et al 2017 watts et al 2017 the published studies mostly focus on the activation of pms for the generation of sulfate radical so4 e h 0 2 5 3 1v and or oh e h 0 1 9 2 7v during isco anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 2003 ghanbari and moradi 2017 do et al 2009 however the reactivity of pms as a moderate oxidant with a relatively high reduction potential of e h 0 hso5 hso4 1 82 v betterton and hoffmann 1990 to destroy various environmental contaminants received little attention wacławek et al 2017 duan et al 2018 very recently we interestingly found that pms could fairly degrade substituted phenols e g phenol methylphenols methoxyphenols and dihydroxybenzenes especially in alkaline solution zhou et al 2017a yang et al 2016 found that methyl mercaptan a sulfur containing odor compound could be successfully removed by pms direct oxidation nevertheless limited information is available on the reaction kinetics and products of pms with emerging environmental contaminants especially for those containing electron rich moieties e g steroid estrogens halide ions i e bromide br chloride cl widely exist in natural environments and they are demonstrated to play an important role in pms based advanced oxidation processes in many studies anipsitakis et al 2006 liu et al 2015 2018 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2016 br levels in source waters and wastewaters are similar in the range of 10 to several hundred μg l lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2009 the cl concentration displays a large range from 0 24 to several hundred mg l in surface water and groundwater and even to g l level in wastewaters vredenbregt et al 1997 kelting et al 2012 mullaney et al 2009 however a few studies have examined the effect of br and cl on pms direct oxidation li et al 2017 2018 zhou et al 2017b for instance delcomyn et al 2006 reported that inactivation of bacteria by pms was greatly enhanced in the presence of cl due to the contribution of free chlorine hocl generated by pms oxidation fang et al 2017 found that br could accelerate the degradation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol by pms where hobr formed in situ played an important role the present study was conducted to assess the potential of pms for the oxidative removal of steroid estrogens during isco as part of work investigating a wide range of emerging endocrine disruptors pharmaceutical and personal care products with electron rich moieties for this purpose estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 and a model compound 5 6 7 8 tetrahydro 2 naphthol thn represented the reactive phenolic moiety were selected and their chemical structures were shown in table s1 first the reaction kinetics of pms with these steroid estrogens were determined in synthetic solutions over the ph range from 7 to 10 then the effect of halide ions i e br and cl at environmentally relevant levels on the oxidation kinetics of ee2 as a model steroid estrogen by pms was investigated and a kinetic model was established to quantitatively describe this effect finally transformation products of ee2 by pms in the absence and presence of halide ions were identified by using high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry hplc esi ms ms and their evolution was monitored and compared with model predictions 2 material and methods 2 1

text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics for the reactions of pms with e1 e2 e3 and ee2 3 1 1 reaction rate order determination fig 1 exhibited the time course profiles of the degradation of estrogens 1 μm in the presence of pms 0 96 mm at ph 8 5 as can be seen appreciable degradation of estrogens was achieved in the presence of pms while they were stable in absence of pms data not shown the involvement of so4 and oh therein was explicitly excluded by radical quenching studies where methanol and tert butanol in excess had negligible influence on the degradation of estrogens see fig s1 for example the plots of lnc c0 vs time insert in fig 1a showed straight lines suggesting that the reactions were first order with respect to estrogens therefore the pseudo first order rate constant k obs could be determined by eq 1 1 d e tot d t k obs e tot where e tot represents the total concentration of estrogens reaction kinetics were then examined for each estrogen by varying pms concentration the linear relationship between measured pseudo first order rates and pms concentrations fig 1b demonstrated that the reactions were also first order to pms the apparent second order rate constant k app could be determined by eq 2 2 d e tot d t k app pms tot e tot where pms tot represents the total concentration of pms 3 1 2 ph dependence of rate constants the oxidation kinetics of estrogens 1 μm by pms 0 96 mm were conducted over a wide ph range of 7 10 interestingly the degradation of estrogens at ph 10 slightly deviated from pseudo first order decay fig s2 and methanol and tert butanol in excess had negligible influence on the degradation kinetics see fig s3 for example our recent study has shown that the oxidation of substituted phenols by pms also exhibits autocatalysis at ph 10 due to the contribution of singlet oxygen 1o2 produced from pms activation by quinone intermediates formed from their phenolic parents zhou et al 2017a so it seems likely that the formation of quinonoid products from the reactions of pms with estrogens see the following section is responsible for the slight autocatalysis observed therein for the sake of comparison the initial rate was used to determine the rate constant k obs at ph 10 these ph dependent apparent second order rate constants for e1 e2 e3 ee2 and thn were exhibited in fig 2 as shown the k app values of e2 e3 ee2 and thn were very comparable at each ph suggesting that the phenolic moiety of steroid estrogens was the dominating reactive group jiang et al 2012 lee et al 2005 interestingly the k app values of e1 were approximately 2 4 times higher than those of e2 e3 and ee2 indicating that the cyclopentanone moiety in e1 may also exhibit appreciable reactivity to pms in order to confirm this control experiments examining the reactions between pms and cyclopentanone were conducted at ph 10 as shown in fig s4 pms was decomposed at a relatively high rate in the presence of excess cyclopentanone while the decomposition of pms was negligible in the presence of cyclopentanol 1 2 cyclopentanediol or 1 ethinyl 1 cyclohexanol ech representing the possible secondary reactive moieties of e2 e3 and ee2 respectively 3 1 3 species specific second order rate constants the k app values of e1 e2 e3 ee2 and thn increased nearly 40 times when ph increased from 7 to 10 the increase of ph would induce the dissociation of both estrogens and pms goodman and robson 1963 and thus the ph dependence of k app in fig 2 was attributed to a combined effect of pms speciation hso5 and so5 2 and steroid estrogens speciation e and e accordingly reactions 3 5 were initially proposed as main reactions between pms and steroid estrogens to describe the ph dependency of k app 3 hso 5 e k 1 products 4 hso 5 e k 2 products 5 so 5 2 e k 3 products since dissociated pms ion so5 2 has a lower oxidizing reactivity than hso5 the reaction of so5 2 with undissociated steroid estrogens e was not considered to simplify the kinetic model a similar simplification was also used in kinetic modeling ferrate fe vi oxidation and chlorination of estrogens deborde et al 2004 lee et al 2005 the apparent second order rate constant could be expressed as follows 6 k app k 1 α 1 β 1 k 2 α 1 β 2 k 3 α 2 β 2 where α 1 and α 2 represent the species distribution coefficients for hso5 and so5 2 respectively β 1 and β 2 represent the species distribution coefficients for e and e respectively the species specific second order rate constants i e k 1 k 2 and k 3 were obtained by using nonlinear least squares regression of experimental data table s2 showed the determined species specific rate constants for e1 e2 e3 ee2 and thn as can be seen the rate constants for the reactions between hso5 and e were in the range of 0 00143 0 0330 m 1s 1 while the rate constants for the reaction between hso5 and e were about 2 3 orders of magnitude higher 2 11 5 58 m 1s 1 comparatively the rate constants for so5 2 with e in the range of 0 77 1 25 m 1s 1 were lower than those for hso5 with e the more susceptible of dissociated estrogens to oxidation was reasonably explained by the stronger electron donating strength of aromatic hydroxyl groups after their dissociation huber et al 2003 jiang et al 2012 lee et al 2005 3 1 4 oxidation products totally fourteen oxidation products of ee2 by pms were detected by hplc esi qtofms chemical structures for these products including hydroxylated and aromatic ring opening products were proposed upon the basis of their molecular ion accurate mass relative chromatographic retention times rt and product ion spectra table 1 and fig s5 most of these products had greater molecular weights and earlier retention times than their parent molecule in agreement with the formation of hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups on parent ee2 the ethinyl group of ee2 remained intact consistent with the conclusion drawn from kinetic experiments that pms was readily to attack the aromatic ring while the ethinyl group was inert similar oxidation products were also observed in the case of e2 as shown in table s3 many studies have demonstrated that the phenolic moiety of steroid estrogens is an essential functional group responsible for their strong estrogenicity anstead et al 1997 a small modification of the phenolic ring e g hydroxylation or partial cleavage of steroid estrogens can substantially reduce their estrogenicity by a factor of 200 500 huber et al 2004 so it seems likely that isco using pms may not only degrade estrogens but also efficiently eliminate their estrogenic activity the acute and chronic toxicities of ee2 as an example and transformation products were also estimated using ecosar computer program sanchirico et al 2012 gao et al 2014 khalit and tay 2017 yang et al 2017 the predicted ecosar class specific values of acute toxicity lc50 and ec50 and chronic toxicity chv were presented in table s4 as can be seen the hydroxylated and aromatic ring opening products exhibited lower eco toxicity than parent ee2 lienert et al 2007 suggested that the toxicity of parent compound and its metabolite was positively related to their octanol water partition coefficients kow compared to parent ee2 the hydrophilicity of hydroxylated and aromatic ring opening products increased leading to their decreasing toxicity these results suggested that pms direct oxidation may also efficiently eliminate the eco toxicity of estrogens 3 2 effect of br and cl on the transformation kinetics of ee2 by pms 3 2 1 effect of br the effect of br on the oxidation kinetics of ee2 by pms at ph 8 5 was examined as shown in fig 3 a the presence of br strongly enhanced the transformation rates of ee2 as compared to control without br and the accelerating effect increased with the increase of br concentration for instance with the increase of br from 3 to 10 μm the loss extent of ee2 greatly increased from 25 to 75 at 5 min lente et al 2009 have thermodynamically demonstrated that br can be oxidized by pms in a formally two electron process to generate hobr reactions 7 8 7 hso 5 br 0 7 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 hobr 8 so 5 2 br 0 17 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 hobr hobr is a potent oxidant for phenolic compounds such as phenol chlorophenols and steroid estrogens leading to the formation of brominated products the reactions of hobr with ee2 and bromo ee2s were shown as eqs 9 13 lee and von gunten 2009 9 hobr h obr p k a 8 9 10 hobr ee 2 5 25 108 m 1 s 1 2 br ee 2 4 br ee 2 1 4 p k a 10 4 11 hobr 2 br ee 2 1 34 108 m 1 s 1 2 4 dibree 2 p k a 8 9 12 hobr 4 br ee 2 7 38 107 m 1 s 1 2 4 dibree 2 p k a 9 0 13 hobr 2 4 dibree 2 9 74 105 m 1 s 1 ring opening products p k a 7 1 in order to better understand the effect of br a kinetic model was established where reactions 3 5 and 7 13 were used to simulate the degradation kinetics of ee2 by the computer program kintecus 5 75 ianni 2017 it was found that the experimental data were well simulated by the kinetic model dash lines in fig 3a the dynamic levels of hobr in pms br ee2 system were also simulated modeling results showed that the concentrations of hobr increased as the reactions progressed and the formation rate of hobr increased with the increase of br concentration fig s6 for example at time when 90 ee2 was degraded the concentration of hobr was about 4 7 10 4 and 3 5 10 3 μm respectively in the presence of 3 and 10 μm br fig s6 3 2 2 effect of cl as shown in fig 3b the presence of cl 2 10 mm efficiently accelerated the degradation of ee2 1 μm by pms 0 96 mm similar to the case of br with the increase of cl concentration from 2 to 10 mm the half time of ee2 decreased gradually from about 55 min to 15 min the accelerating effect of cl was also ascribed to the contribution of hocl produced from the oxidation of cl by pms reactions 14 15 lente et al 2009 hocl exhibited relatively high reactivity toward ee2 as well as chloro ee2s reactions 16 20 deborde et al 2004 lee and von gunten 2009 14 hso 5 cl 2 06 10 3 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 hocl 15 so 5 2 cl 3 8 10 4 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 hocl 16 hocl h ocl p k a 7 5 17 hocl ee 2 4 49 105 m 1 s 1 2 cl ee 2 4 cl ee 2 1 4 p k a 10 4 18 hocl 2 cl ee 2 4 84 104 m 1 s 1 2 4 diclee 2 p k a 8 7 19 hocl 4 cl ee 2 1 61 104 m 1 s 1 2 4 diclee 2 p k a 8 6 20 hocl 2 4 diclee 2 1 04 103 m 1 s 1 ring opening products p k a 7 1 reactions 3 5 and 14 20 were used to establish a kinetic model to simulate the degradation of ee2 in the presence with cl however it was found that the predictions considerably overestimated the degradation of ee2 in the presence of cl fig s7 the discrepancy in the case of br vs cl might be resulted from the different ionic strength used in the study of lente et al 2009 to obtain the rate constants for br 0 1 m naclo4 and cl 1 m naclo4 on the other hand by fitting the kinetic model to the experimental data the rate constants for reactions 14 15 i e the rate limiting steps in overall reactions were calculated to be 3 37 10 4 and 4 02 10 6 m 1s 1 respectively about dozens times smaller than those 2 06 10 3 and 3 8 10 4 m 1s 1 reported by lente et al as shown in fig 3b the simulations dash lines could well predict the degradation kinetics of ee2 when the rate constants of reactions 9 and 10 were adjusted to 3 37 10 4 and 4 02 10 6 m 1s 1 respectively the hocl concentrations in pms cl ee2 system predicted by the model increased as the reactions progressed and the formation rate of hocl increased with the increase of cl concentration fig s8 for example at time when 90 ee2 was degraded the concentration of hocl was about 1 4 and 4 1 μm respectively in the presence of 2 and 10 mm cl fig s8 3 2 3 effect of combined br and cl since br and cl always coexist in natural environments the effect of combined br 3 μm and cl 4 mm on the degradation of ee2 1 μm by pms 0 96 mm at ph 8 5 was examined as shown in fig 3c in the presence of br and cl together the degradation of ee2 was considerably accelerated as compared to the presence of cl or br individually for instance in the presence of individual br 3 μm or cl 4 mm the loss extent of ee2 at 20 min was about 70 and 20 respectively while almost 90 ee2 was eliminated in the presence of br and cl together this result suggested that both hobr and hocl formed in situ contributed to the degradation of ee2 where hobr played a dominant role a kinetic model was proposed by considering reactions 3 5 and 7 20 as well as the reaction between hocl and br reaction 21 and the reactions of hobr and hocl with bromo ee2s and chloro ee2s table s5 21 hocl br 1550 m 1 s 1 hobr cl it was found that the experimental data were well predicted by the modeling results 3 3 oxidation products of ee2 by pms in the presence of br or cl 3 3 1 products identification in the presence of br a total of ten products were detected by the pis at m z 79 as compared bromide free control each peak in the chromatogram detected by the pis at m z 79 could find its counterpart at m z 81 data not shown suggesting that these peaks in pair should correspond to bromine containing products chemical structures for these products were proposed upon the basis of their molecular ion mass relative chromatographic retention times rt and product ion spectra fig s9 table 2 summarized the brominated products including their molecular ions in the pis at m z 79 chromatographic retention times and their possible structures op 373 i and op 373 ii at 31 15 min and 32 26 min were isomers which should contain one bromine atom due to the faster elution of 2 br ee2 than 4 br ee2 lee and von gunten 2009 op 373 i and op 373 ii were assigned to 2 br ee2 and 4 br ee2 respectively op 451 had the molecular ions of m z 451 453 in the pis at m z 79 suggesting that it should contain two bromine ions also the isotope abundance ratio of 1 1 in the peak clusters was accordant with the theoretical prediction it was assigned to 2 4 dibr ee2 op 389 i and op 389 ii with an additional o atom 16 da and earlier retention times comparing with 2 br ee2 and 4 br ee2 were proposed to be hydroxylated 2 br ee2 and 4 br ee2 respectively similarly op 467 was assigned to a hydroxylated product of op 451 there were three isomers for op 421 op 421 isomers had more o atoms and earlier retention time than op 389 and thus they were assigned to ring opening products op 437 with an additional o atom than op 421 was also a ring opening product similar chlorinated products were also detected in the case of cl table 3 and fig s10 3 3 2 products evolution and model predictions the time course profiles of primary and secondary brominated products i e 2 br ee2 4 br ee2 and 2 4 dibr ee2 during oxidation of ee2 1 μm by pms 0 96 mm in the presence of br 5 μm were monitored by hplc esi qqqms at mrm mode since the lack of commercial standards the normalized peak areas by dividing their maxima of these products along the reaction time were shown as can be seen from fig 4 a along with the loss of ee2 2 br ee2 and 4 br ee2 reached to their maxima at about 3 and 5 min respectively and then declined gradually 2 4 dibr ee2 was gradually formed during first 20 min and then was slowly degraded the evolution of 2 br ee2 4 br ee2 and 2 4 dibr ee2 was further simulated by using the kinetic model established in section 3 2 1 in order to facilitate the comparison of simulated and experimental results the model predicted concentrations of these products were also normalized by dividing their maxima as shown in fig 4a the evolution of brominated products was well predicted by the kinetic model in the case of cl the evolution trends of primary and secondary products 2 cl ee2 4 cl ee2 and 2 4 dicl ee2 were similar to their brominated analogies fig 4b and they were also well predicted by the kinetic model fig 4c showed the evolution of primary and secondary halogenated products during the degradation of ee2 1 μm by pms 0 96 mm in the presence of both br 3 μm and cl 4 mm 2 br ee2 4 br ee2 2 4 dibr ee2 and two cl br ee2 products i e 2cl4br ee2 and 2br4cl ee2 were detected while chlorinated products i e 2 cl ee 2 4 cl ee2 and 2 4 dicl ee2 were not detected the model predictions confirmed that these chlorinated products were at extremely low concentrations less than 0 03 μm evolution of brominated products in the co presence of br and cl was also well predicted by the kinetic model some studies demonstrated that the estrogenic activity of ee2 was significantly reduced as a result of bromination and chlorination hu et al 2003 lee et al 2004 2008 the primary halogenated aromatic products of ee2 i e monobromo ee2 and monochloro ee2 exhibit a substantially low estrogenic activity 10 of the parent ee2 further substitution of chlorine or bromine will result in a reduction of estrogenic activity by a factor of 100 1000 compared to initial transformation products brominated products of ee2 always show lower estrogenic activities than the chlorinated analogies lee et al 2008 the eco toxicity of these halogenated products was also estimated by using the computer program ecosar and the results were presented in table s6 s7 it was found that the initial substitution products 2 br ee2 4 br ee2 op 373 and 2 cl ee2 4 cl ee2 op 329 showed higher acute and chronic toxicity than parent ee2 further halogenation of these compounds to 2 4 dibr ee2 2 4 dicl ee2 resulted in an increase of acute and chronic toxicity interestingly the transformation of halogenated ee2 to ring opening products containing hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups could reduce the toxicity and even to a level lower than parent ee2 this might be attributed to an increase of hydrophilicity of these ring opening products veith et al 1983 könemann 1981 4 conclusion the treatment of four steroid estrogens e1 e2 e3 and ee2 by pms was evaluated by examining the oxidation kinetics oxidation products and the effect of halide ions i e br and cl the major findings of this study are summarized as follows i reaction kinetics between pms with steroid estrogens were described by a second order rate law the apparent second order rate constants increased with the increase of solution ph the rate constants for hso5 with deprotonated estrogens were in the range of 2 11 5 58 m 1s 1 while the rate constants of hso5 with neutral estrogens were much lower i e 0 14 10 2 3 3 10 2 m 1s 1 ii oxidation products of ee2 including hydroxylated and aromatic ring opening compounds i e formation of hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups were identified by hplc esi qtofms they were formed from the initial attack of aromatic hydroxyl group in steroid estrogens by pms iii the presence of halide ions i e br and cl at environmentally relevant levels greatly accelerated the degradation of steroid estrogens by pms where hox i e hobr and hocl formed in situ played important roles kinetic model including the reactions of pms with halide ions hox with ee2 and hox with halogenated products could well predict the degradation of ee2 as well as the evolution of halogenated products iv the treatment of ee2 by pms direct oxidation could substantially reduce its estrogenicity as well as eco toxicity the initial halogenated aromatic products formed in the presence of br and cl showed higher eco toxicity than parent ee2 and their further transformation to ring opening products could reduce the toxicity and even to a level lower than parent ee2 the formation of halogenated products could reduce the estrogenic activities of ee2

19593,recently in situ chemical oxidation isco using peroxymonosulfate pms for environmental decontamination has received increasing interest in this study oxidation kinetics and products of four steroid estrogens i e estrone 17β estradiol estriol and 17α ethinylestradiol by pms under various conditions were investigated pms could fairly degrade steroid estrogens over the ph range of 7 10 and the degradation rate increased with the increase of solution ph this ph dependence was well described by parallel reactions between individual acid base species of steroid estrogens e and e and pms hso5 and so5 2 where specific second order rate constants for e with hso5 and so5 2 were in the range of 2 11 5 58 m 1s 1 and 0 77 1 25 m 1s 1 respectively identification of oxidation products by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer showed that pms readily oxidized the phenolic group of steroid estrogens leading to the generation of hydroxylated and ring opening products the presence of bromide and chloride ions br and cl at environmentally relevant levels could greatly accelerate the degradation of steroid estrogens by pms with the formation of halogenated aromatic products this effect was quantitatively estimated by a kinetic model where the formation of free bromine and chorine and their rapid electrophilic substitution with steroid estrogens were taken into consideration eco toxicity of transformation products of 17α ethinylestradiol by pms treatment in the absence and presence of bromide and chloride was estimated

al 2017 2018 zhou et al 2017b for instance delcomyn et al 2006 reported that inactivation of bacteria by pms was greatly enhanced in the presence of cl due to the contribution of free chlorine hocl generated by pms oxidation fang et al 2017 found that br could accelerate the degradation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol by pms where hobr formed in situ played an important role the present study was conducted to assess the potential of pms for the oxidative removal of steroid estrogens during isco as part of work investigating a wide range of emerging endocrine disruptors pharmaceutical and

over the ph range from 7 to 10 then the effect of halide ions i e br and cl at environmentally relevant levels on the oxidation kinetics of ee2 as a model steroid estrogen by pms was investigated and a kinetic model was established to quantitatively describe this effect finally transformation products of ee2 by pms in the absence and presence of halide ions were identified by using high

text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics for the reactions of pms with e1 e2 e3 and ee2 3 1 1 reaction rate order determination fig 1 exhibited the time course profiles of the degradation of estrogens 1 μm in the presence of pms 0 96 mm at ph 8 5 as can be seen appreciable degradation of estrogens was achieved in the presence of pms while they were stable in absence of pms data not shown the involvement of so4 and oh therein was explicitly excluded by radical quenching studies where methanol and tert butanol in excess had negligible influence on the degradation of estrogens see fig s1 for example the plots of lnc c0 vs time insert in fig 1a showed straight lines suggesting that the reactions were first order with respect to estrogens therefore the pseudo first order rate constant k obs could be determined by eq 1 1 d e tot d t k obs e tot where e tot represents the total concentration of estrogens reaction kinetics were then examined for each estrogen by varying pms concentration the linear relationship between measured pseudo first order rates and pms concentrations fig 1b demonstrated that the reactions were also first order to pms the apparent second order rate constant k app could be determined by eq 2 2 d e tot d t k app pms tot e tot where pms tot represents the total concentration of pms 3 1 2 ph dependence of rate constants the oxidation kinetics of estrogens 1 μm by pms 0 96 mm were conducted over a wide ph range of 7 10 interestingly the degradation of estrogens at ph 10 slightly deviated from pseudo first order decay fig s2 and methanol and tert butanol in excess had negligible influence on the degradation kinetics see fig s3 for example our recent study has shown that the oxidation of substituted phenols by pms also exhibits autocatalysis at ph 10 due to the contribution of singlet oxygen 1o2 produced from pms activation by quinone intermediates formed from their phenolic parents zhou et al 2017a so it seems likely that the formation of quinonoid products from the reactions of pms with estrogens see the following section is responsible for the slight autocatalysis observed therein for the sake of comparison the initial rate was used to determine the rate constant k obs at ph 10 these ph dependent apparent second order rate constants for e1 e2 e3 ee2 and thn were exhibited in fig 2 as shown the k app values of e2 e3 ee2 and thn were very comparable at each ph suggesting that the phenolic moiety of steroid estrogens was the dominating reactive group jiang et al 2012 lee et al 2005 interestingly the k app values of e1 were approximately 2 4 times higher than those of e2 e3 and ee2 indicating that the cyclopentanone moiety in e1 may also exhibit appreciable reactivity to pms in order to confirm this control experiments examining the reactions between pms and cyclopentanone were conducted at ph 10 as shown in fig s4 pms was decomposed at a relatively high rate in the presence of excess cyclopentanone while the decomposition of pms was negligible in the presence of cyclopentanol 1 2 cyclopentanediol or 1 ethinyl 1 cyclohexanol ech representing the possible secondary reactive moieties of e2 e3 and ee2 respectively 3 1 3 species specific second order rate constants the k app values of e1 e2 e3 ee2 and thn increased nearly 40 times when ph increased from 7 to 10 the increase of ph would induce the dissociation of both estrogens and pms goodman and robson 1963 and thus the ph dependence of k app in fig 2 was attributed to a combined effect of pms speciation hso5 and so5 2 and steroid estrogens speciation e and e accordingly reactions 3 5 were initially proposed as main reactions between pms and steroid estrogens to describe the ph dependency of k app 3 hso 5 e k 1 products 4 hso 5 e k 2 products 5 so 5 2 e k 3 products since dissociated pms ion so5 2 has a lower oxidizing reactivity than hso5 the reaction of so5 2 with undissociated steroid estrogens e was not considered to simplify the kinetic model a similar simplification was also used in kinetic modeling ferrate fe vi oxidation and chlorination of estrogens deborde et al 2004 lee et al 2005 the apparent second order rate constant could be expressed as follows 6 k app k 1 α 1 β 1 k 2 α 1 β 2 k 3 α 2 β 2 where α 1 and α 2 represent the species distribution coefficients for hso5 and so5 2 respectively β 1 and β 2 represent the species distribution coefficients for e and e respectively the species specific second order rate constants i e k 1 k 2 and k 3 were obtained by using nonlinear least squares regression of experimental data table s2 showed the determined species specific rate constants for e1 e2 e3 ee2 and thn as can be seen the rate constants for the reactions between hso5 and e were in the range of 0 00143 0 0330 m 1s 1 while the rate constants for the reaction between hso5 and e were about 2 3 orders of magnitude higher 2 11 5 58 m 1s 1 comparatively the rate constants for so5 2 with e in the range of 0 77 1 25 m 1s 1 were lower than those for hso5 with e the more susceptible of dissociated estrogens to oxidation was reasonably explained by the stronger electron donating strength of aromatic hydroxyl groups after their dissociation huber et al 2003 jiang et al 2012 lee et al 2005 3 1 4 oxidation products totally fourteen oxidation products of ee2 by pms were detected by hplc esi qtofms chemical structures for these products including hydroxylated and aromatic ring opening products were proposed upon the basis of their molecular ion accurate mass relative chromatographic retention times rt and product ion spectra table 1 and fig s5 most of these products had greater molecular weights and earlier retention times than their parent molecule in agreement with the formation of hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups on parent ee2 the ethinyl group of ee2 remained intact consistent with the conclusion drawn from kinetic experiments that pms was readily to attack the aromatic ring while the ethinyl group was inert similar oxidation products were also observed in the case of e2 as shown in table s3 many studies have demonstrated that the phenolic moiety of steroid estrogens is an essential functional group responsible for their strong estrogenicity anstead et al 1997 a small modification of the phenolic ring e g hydroxylation or partial cleavage of steroid estrogens can substantially reduce their estrogenicity by a factor of 200 500 huber et al 2004 so it seems likely that isco using pms may not only degrade estrogens but also efficiently eliminate their estrogenic activity the acute and chronic toxicities of ee2 as an example and transformation products were also estimated using ecosar computer program sanchirico et al 2012 gao et al 2014 khalit and tay 2017 yang et al 2017 the predicted ecosar class specific values of acute toxicity lc50 and ec50 and chronic toxicity chv were presented in table s4 as can be seen the hydroxylated and aromatic ring opening products exhibited lower eco toxicity than parent ee2 lienert et al 2007 suggested that the toxicity of parent compound and its metabolite was positively related to their octanol water partition coefficients kow compared to parent ee2 the hydrophilicity of hydroxylated and aromatic ring opening products increased leading to their decreasing toxicity these results suggested that pms direct oxidation may also efficiently eliminate the eco toxicity of estrogens 3 2 effect of br and cl on the transformation kinetics of ee2 by pms 3 2 1 effect of br the effect of br on the oxidation kinetics of ee2 by pms at ph 8 5 was examined as shown in fig 3 a the presence of br strongly enhanced the transformation rates of ee2 as compared to control without br and the accelerating effect increased with the increase of br concentration for instance with the increase of br from 3 to 10 μm the loss extent of ee2 greatly increased from 25 to 75 at 5 min lente et al 2009 have thermodynamically demonstrated that br can be oxidized by pms in a formally two electron process to generate hobr reactions 7 8 7 hso 5 br 0 7 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 hobr 8 so 5 2 br 0 17 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 hobr hobr is a potent oxidant for phenolic compounds such as phenol chlorophenols and steroid estrogens leading to the formation of brominated products the reactions of hobr with ee2 and bromo ee2s were shown as eqs 9 13 lee and von gunten 2009 9 hobr h obr p k a 8 9 10 hobr ee 2 5 25 108 m 1 s 1 2 br ee 2 4 br ee 2 1 4 p k a 10 4 11 hobr 2 br ee 2 1 34 108 m 1 s 1 2 4 dibree 2 p k a 8 9 12 hobr 4 br ee 2 7 38 107 m 1 s 1 2 4 dibree 2 p k a 9 0 13 hobr 2 4 dibree 2 9 74 105 m 1 s 1 ring opening products p k a 7 1 in order to better understand the effect of br a kinetic model was established where reactions 3 5 and 7 13 were used to simulate the degradation kinetics of ee2 by the computer program kintecus 5 75 ianni 2017 it was found that the experimental data were well simulated by the kinetic model dash lines in fig 3a the dynamic levels of hobr in pms br ee2 system were also simulated modeling results showed that the concentrations of hobr increased as the reactions progressed and the formation rate of hobr increased with the increase of br concentration fig s6 for example at time when 90 ee2 was degraded the concentration of hobr was about 4 7 10 4 and 3 5 10 3 μm respectively in the presence of 3 and 10 μm br fig s6 3 2 2 effect of cl as shown in fig 3b the presence of cl 2 10 mm efficiently accelerated the degradation of ee2 1 μm by pms 0 96 mm similar to the case of br with the increase of cl concentration from 2 to 10 mm the half time of ee2 decreased gradually from about 55 min to 15 min the accelerating effect of cl was also ascribed to the contribution of hocl produced from the oxidation of cl by pms reactions 14 15 lente et al 2009 hocl exhibited relatively high reactivity toward ee2 as well as chloro ee2s reactions 16 20 deborde et al 2004 lee and von gunten 2009 14 hso 5 cl 2 06 10 3 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 hocl 15 so 5 2 cl 3 8 10 4 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 hocl 16 hocl h ocl p k a 7 5 17 hocl ee 2 4 49 105 m 1 s 1 2 cl ee 2 4 cl ee 2 1 4 p k

reactions 3 5 and 14 20 were used to establish a kinetic model to simulate the degradation of ee2 in the presence with cl however it was found that the predictions considerably overestimated the degradation of ee2 in the presence of cl fig s7 the discrepancy in the case of br vs cl might be resulted from the different ionic strength used in the study of lente et al 2009 to obtain the rate constants for br 0 1 m naclo4 and cl 1 m naclo4 on the other hand by fitting the kinetic model to the experimental data the rate constants for reactions 14 15 i e the rate limiting steps in overall reactions were calculated to be 3 37 10 4 and 4 02 10 6 m 1s 1 respectively about dozens times smaller than those 2 06 10 3 and 3 8 10 4 m 1s 1 reported by lente et al as shown in fig 3b the simulations dash lines could well predict the degradation kinetics of ee2 when the rate constants of reactions 9 and 10 were adjusted to 3 37 10 4 and 4 02 10 6 m 1s 1 respectively the hocl concentrations in pms cl ee2 system predicted by the model increased as the reactions progressed and the formation rate of hocl increased with the increase of cl concentration fig s8 for example at time when 90 ee2 was degraded the concentration of hocl was about 1 4 and 4 1 μm respectively in the presence of 2 and 10 mm cl fig s8 3 2 3 effect of combined br and cl since br and cl always coexist in natural environments the effect of combined br 3 μm and cl 4 mm on the degradation of ee2 1 μm by pms 0 96 mm at ph 8 5 was examined as shown in fig 3c in the presence of br and cl together the degradation of ee2 was considerably accelerated as compared to the presence of cl or br individually for instance in the presence of individual br 3 μm or cl 4 mm the loss extent of ee2 at 20 min was about 70 and 20 respectively while almost 90 ee2 was eliminated in the presence of br and cl together this result suggested that both hobr and hocl formed in situ contributed to the degradation of ee2 where hobr played a dominant role a kinetic model was proposed by considering reactions 3 5 and 7 20 as well as the reaction between hocl and br reaction 21 and the reactions of hobr and hocl with bromo ee2s and chloro ee2s table s5 21 hocl br 1550 m 1 s 1 hobr cl it was found that the experimental data were well predicted by the modeling results 3 3 oxidation products of ee2 by pms in the presence of br or cl 3 3 1 products identification in the presence of br a total of ten products were detected by the pis at m z 79 as compared bromide free control each peak in the chromatogram detected by the pis at m z 79 could find its counterpart at m z 81 data not shown suggesting that these peaks in pair should correspond to bromine containing products chemical structures for these products were proposed upon the basis of their molecular ion mass relative chromatographic retention times rt and product ion spectra fig s9 table 2 summarized the brominated products including their molecular ions in the pis at m z 79 chromatographic retention times and their possible structures op 373 i and op 373 ii at 31 15 min and 32 26 min were isomers which should contain one bromine atom due to the faster elution of 2 br ee2 than 4 br ee2 lee and von gunten 2009 op 373 i and op 373 ii were assigned to 2 br ee2 and 4 br ee2 respectively op 451 had the molecular ions of m z 451 453 in the pis at m z 79 suggesting that it should contain two bromine ions also the isotope abundance ratio of 1 1 in the peak clusters was accordant with the theoretical prediction it was assigned to 2 4 dibr ee2 op 389 i and op 389 ii with an additional o atom 16 da and earlier retention times comparing with 2 br ee2 and 4 br ee2 were proposed to be hydroxylated 2 br ee2 and 4 br ee2 respectively similarly op 467 was assigned to a hydroxylated product of op 451 there were three isomers for op 421 op 421 isomers had more o atoms and earlier retention time than op 389 and thus they were assigned to ring opening products op 437 with an additional o atom than op 421 was also a ring opening product similar chlorinated products were also detected in the case of cl table 3 and fig s10 3 3 2 products evolution and model predictions the time course profiles of primary and secondary brominated products i e 2 br ee2 4 br ee2 and 2 4 dibr ee2 during oxidation of ee2 1 μm by pms 0 96 mm in the presence of br 5 μm were monitored by hplc esi qqqms at mrm mode since the lack of commercial standards the normalized peak areas by dividing their maxima of these products along the reaction time were shown as can be seen from fig 4 a along with the loss of ee2 2 br ee2 and 4 br ee2 reached to their maxima at about 3 and 5 min respectively and then declined gradually 2 4 dibr ee2 was gradually formed during first 20 min and then was slowly degraded the evolution of 2 br ee2 4 br ee2 and 2 4 dibr ee2 was further simulated by using the kinetic model established in section 3 2 1 in order to facilitate the comparison of simulated and experimental results the model predicted concentrations of these products were also normalized by dividing their maxima as shown in fig 4a the evolution of brominated products was well predicted by the kinetic model in the case of cl the evolution trends of primary and secondary products 2 cl ee2 4 cl ee2 and 2 4 dicl ee2 were similar to their brominated analogies fig 4b and they were also well predicted by the kinetic model fig 4c showed the evolution of primary and secondary halogenated products during the degradation of ee2 1 μm by pms 0 96 mm in the presence of both br 3 μm and cl 4 mm 2 br ee2 4 br ee2 2 4 dibr ee2 and two cl br ee2 products i e 2cl4br ee2 and 2br4cl ee2 were detected while chlorinated products i e 2 cl ee 2 4 cl ee2 and 2 4 dicl ee2 were not detected the model predictions confirmed that these chlorinated products were at extremely low concentrations less than 0 03 μm evolution of brominated products in the co presence of br and cl was also well predicted by the kinetic model some studies demonstrated that the estrogenic activity of ee2 was significantly reduced as a result of bromination and chlorination hu et al 2003 lee et al 2004 2008 the primary halogenated aromatic products of ee2 i e monobromo ee2 and monochloro ee2 exhibit a substantially low estrogenic activity 10 of the parent ee2 further substitution of chlorine or bromine will result in a reduction of estrogenic activity by a factor of 100 1000 compared to initial transformation products brominated products of ee2 always show lower estrogenic activities than the chlorinated analogies lee et al 2008 the eco toxicity of these halogenated products was also estimated by using the computer program ecosar and the results were presented in table s6 s7 it was found that the initial substitution products 2 br ee2 4 br ee2 op 373 and 2 cl ee2 4 cl ee2 op 329 showed higher acute and chronic toxicity than parent ee2 further halogenation of these compounds to 2 4 dibr ee2 2 4 dicl ee2 resulted in an increase of acute and chronic toxicity interestingly the transformation of halogenated ee2 to ring opening products containing hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups could reduce the toxicity and even to a level lower than parent ee2 this might be attributed to an increase of hydrophilicity of these ring opening products veith et al 1983 könemann 1981 4 conclusion the treatment of four steroid estrogens e1 e2 e3 and ee2 by pms was evaluated by examining the oxidation kinetics oxidation products and the effect of halide ions i e br and cl the major findings of this study are summarized as follows i reaction kinetics between pms with steroid estrogens were described by a second order rate law the apparent second order rate constants increased with the increase of solution ph the rate constants for hso5 with deprotonated estrogens were in the range of 2 11 5 58 m 1s 1 while the rate constants of hso5 with neutral estrogens were much lower i e 0 14 10 2 3 3 10 2 m 1s 1 ii oxidation products of ee2 including hydroxylated and aromatic ring opening compounds i e formation of hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups were identified by hplc esi qtofms they were formed from the initial attack of aromatic hydroxyl group in steroid estrogens by pms iii the presence of halide ions i e br and cl at environmentally relevant levels greatly accelerated the degradation of steroid estrogens by pms where hox i e hobr and hocl formed in situ played important roles kinetic model including the reactions of pms with halide ions hox with ee2 and hox with halogenated products could well predict the degradation of ee2 as well as the evolution of halogenated products iv the treatment of ee2 by pms direct oxidation could substantially reduce its estrogenicity as well as eco toxicity the initial halogenated aromatic products formed in the presence of br and cl showed higher eco toxicity than parent ee2 and their further transformation to ring opening products could reduce the toxicity and even to a level lower than parent ee2 the formation of halogenated products could reduce the estrogenic activities of ee2

the effects of both kind of stressors and their potential interaction on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial communities requires highly controlled manipulative experiments

diclofenac and methylparaben on the bacterial composition abundance and antibiotic resistance profile of biofilms grown in artificial streams in particular we investigated the effect of this combined stress on genes encoding resistance to ciprofloxacin qnrs erythromycin ermb sulfamethoxazole sul1 and sul2 as well as the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 only genes conferring resistance to sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 and inti1 gene were detected in all treatments during the study period besides bacterial communities exposed to emerging contaminants showed higher copy numbers of sul1 and inti1 genes than those not exposed whereas nutrient amendments did not affect their abundance however bacterial communities exposed to both emerging contaminants and a high nutrient concentration 1 25 and 1 mg l 1 of phosphate nitrate and ammonium respectively showed the highest increase on the abundance of sul1 and inti1 genes thus suggesting a factors synergistic effect of both stressors since none of the treatments caused a significant change on the composition of bacterial communities the enrichment of sul1 and inti1 genes within the community was caused by their dissemination under the combined pressure exerted by nutrients and emerging contaminants to the best of our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the contribution of nutrients on the maintenance and spread of antibiotic resistance genes in streambed biofilms under controlled conditions our results also highlight that nutrients could enhance the effect of emerging contaminants on the dissemination of

mirsonbol et al 2014 susceptible bacteria can acquire resistance to antibiotics under the appropriate selective pressure either by genomic mutations or by horizontal gene transfer the latter being the

of bacterial communities rosi marshall et al 2013 shaw et al 2015 subirats et al 2017 nutrients in wastewater usually exhibit a subsidy effect wagenhoff et al 2011 dunck et al 2015 on microbial populations characterized by a hump shape response of their biomass and activity paerl et al 2003 rubin and leff 2007 yergeau et al 2012 liu et al 2015 previous studies have also shown that nutrient load may favor horizontal gene transfer among microorganisms elsas et al 2003 amos et al 2015 this observation suggests that nutrients may thus promote the spread of args however information on the combined effect of nutrients and emergent contaminants on the composition of resident bacterial communities and their antibiotic resistance profile is limited zheng et al 2017 we therefore conducted an experiment using artificial streams under controlled conditions to assess the role of nutrients and their combined effect with emerging contaminants on the composition of biofilm bacterial communities and their associated resistome the experiment followed a factorial design with 2 levels of a mixture of emerging contaminants absence presence and three levels of nutrient concentrations low medium and high aristi et al 2016 for the compounds in the mixture we selected three antibiotics ciprofloxacin erythromycin sulfamethoxazole and two pharmaceuticals with antimicrobial activity the anti inflammatory drug diclofenac dastidar et al 2000 salem milani et al 2013 and the preservative methylparaben both largely used in food industry and cosmetics moir and eyles 1992 mirsonbol et al 2014 the selection of the five compounds was based on their high ecotoxicological relevance and their widespread occurrence in anthropogenic polluted rivers in the mediterranean region kuzmanovi et al 2014 the working concentrations of these five compounds were selected to mimic the worst scenario reported in the lower llobregat river gonzález et al 2012 gorga et al 2015 our goal was to evaluate the combined effect of nutrients and the selected pharmaceuticals on the prevalence of six genes enconding resistance to sulfamethoxazole sul1 sul2 ciprofloxacin qnra qnrb and qnrs and erythromycin ermb the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 was also analyzed to assess if treatment exposure favors the potential dissemination of args located in mges since inti1 is usually linked to mges and has been considered to play an important role in the acquisition and dissemination of args among bacteria ma et al 2017 stalder et al 2014 our hypotheses were that i the abundance of the target args and inti1 gene would increase with emerging contaminants reaching the maximum increase at the highest nutrient concentrations i e producing a synergistic interaction between nutrients and emerging contaminants ii the bacterial abundance would increase at medium nutrient concentration subsidy effect but decrease in the presence of emerging contaminants regardless of the nutrient concentration and iii the mixture of emerging contaminants and nutrients would alter the composition of streambed biofilm bacterial communities 2 methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was performed in the indoor experimental streams facility of the catalan institute for water research girona spain the treatments followed a factorial design based on three nutrient concentrations low l medium m or high h and two levels for the mixture of emerging contaminants no emerging ne or emerging e thus the experimental design was based on the following six treatments treatments with no emerging contaminants at low ne l medium ne m or high ne h nutrient concentrations and treatments with emerging contaminants at low e l medium e m or high e l nutrient concentrations the experimental streams facility consisted in eighteen artificial streams each artificial stream was assigned to one of six treatments following a randomized complete block design with three replicates per treatment and one replicate per block of six artificial streams nutrient treatment was based on a mixture of phosphate p po4 3 nitrate nno3 and ammonium nnh4 at different concentrations whereas the treatment with emerging contaminants consisted in a mixture of the 5 previously described contaminants ciprofloxacin erythromycin sulfamethoxazole diclofenac and methylparaben treatment exposure lasted for 28 days thus allowing the assessment of short 14 days to long term effects 28 days of both the separate effects of nutrients and emerging contaminants and their interaction 2 2 experimental settings each stream

growing on surface of rocks and epipsammic growing on the surface of sand biofilms from an unpolluted segment of the llémena river briefly biofilm inoculum was obtained after scrapping epilithic biofilms from 10 to 12 cobbles and washing approximately 10 l of fine sediments the colonization period in the artificial streams lasted for 20 days before the exposure to treatments nutrients during the colonization period were held constant at 0 040 1 7 and 0 040 mg l 1 of phosphate nitrate and ammonium by means of injection of concentrated solutions kh2po4 nano3 and nh4cl respectively and using

treatment and to 1 25 and 1 mg l 1 of phosphate nitrate and ammonium respectively in the h treatment aristi et al 2016 the highest concentrations mimicked those observed during low flow conditions in the llobregat river aguilera et al 2012 we used a mixture of 5 emerging contaminants at constant concentrations of 0 1 μg l 1 of methylparaben and 1 μg l 1 of ciprofloxacin diclofenac erythromycin and

that provides a signal to noise ratio of 3 and 10 respectively 2 4 sampling and sample processing biofilm samples from each artificial stream were collected before treatment started at day 1 as well as after 14 and 28 days the top sand layer 1 cm was collected with a core sampler diameter 1 2 cm placed in sterile 15 ml polypropylene tubes fisher scientific wilmington de usa and stored at 80 c until dna extraction biofilms were detached from sand particles by vortexing for 5 min 3 times after adding 5 ml of 10 mm tris hcl buffer at ph 7 5 to each sterile 15 ml polypropylene tubes biofilm biomass was then pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min and genomic dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories usa according to manufacturer s instructions

spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington de usa 2 5 quantification of antibiotic resistance genes copy numbers of six genes encoding resistance to the antibiotics added in the mixture of emerging contaminants namely sul1 and sul2 genes conferring resistance to sulfamethoxazole qnra qnrb and qnrs genes conferring resistance to ciprofloxacin and the ermb gene conferring resistance to erythromycin were determined in triplicate using real time pcr qpcr assays moreover copy numbers of the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 and the bacterial 16s rrna gene were also determined the abundance of the latter was used as a proxy for bacterial abundance and to normalize the concentration of target args to minimize variations due to different dna extraction efficiency across samples and to provide an indication of the proportion of total bacterial carrying args heuer et al 2011 pruden et al 2006 all genes were quantified using primers and conditions compiled in supporting information table s1 the standard curves were carried out as previously described subirats et al 2017 all reactions were performed using sybr green detection chemistry on a mx3005 system agilent technologies santa clara ca usa as previously described marti et al 2013 samples were analyzed in duplicate with a standard curve and a negative control included in each run the specificity of the reaction was verified by melting curve analysis and by electrophoresis run all qpcr assays were performed with high r 2 values 0 998 in average high efficiencies 91 86 3 18 and a dynamic range of at least 5 orders of magnitude thus validating the gene quantification the limit of quantification of each gene was 18 100 80 56 250 copies μl 1 for qnrs sul1 sul2 ermb and inti1 genes respectively 2 6 high throughput sequencing and sequence processing for community analysis equimolar amounts of dna extracted from each artificial stream under same treatment conditions were combined to obtain a composite sample for that treatment these composite samples were then subjected to high throughput multiplexed 16s rrna gene sequencing with the illumina miseq system 2 250 pe using primer pair 515f 806r caporaso et al 2011 complemented with illumina adapters and sample specific barcodes at the research technology support facility michigan state university usa kozich et al 2013 pair merging quality filtering chimera checking clustering into operational taxonomic units otu 97 cutoff and construction of otu table were carried out using default parameters in uparse edgar 2013 the resulting otu table was converted to biological observation matrix biom format mcdonald et al 2012 and then imported and analyzed in qiime caporaso et al 2010 sequencing depth ranged between 167 and 97 540 sequences per sample the sample with the lowest sequence number 14ne h 167 sequences was removed from downstream analysis otus affiliated to eukaryotes 6 0 2 algal chloroplasts 83 3 3 archaea 8 0 3 and unclassifieds 175 6 5 were filtered from the original otu table using appropriate scripts in qiime after filtering we obtained a total number of 2435 bacterial otus for community analysis alpha and beta diversity the number of sequences in each sample was normalized by randomly selecting a subset of 27 700 sequences per sample to minimize bias due to different sequencing depth across samples the sequence data set was deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under accession number srp128512 2 7 data analysis we used one way analysis of variance anova with blocks as fixed factor to test for differences among experimental arrays for all variables before treatment onset after that differences in the abundance of target args inti1 and 16s rrna genes were analyzed using a mixed effects model with time nutrients and emerging pollutant treatments as fixed factors and arrays as random factor n 36 interactions between the considered fixed factors were also tested and post hoc tukey tests were done for each sampling day normality of all variables was checked with the shapiro wilk test and statistical significance was determined at α 0 05 all analyses were performed with r software version 3 1 1 r development core team vienna austria for community composition analyses we constructed a similarity matrix using the bray curtis distance legendre and gallagher 2001 based on the relative abundance square root transformed of each bacterial otu ordination of samples according to bray curtis distance matrices was done using principal coordinates analysis pcoa analysis of similarity between communities based on their taxonomic composition was done after grouping samples by sampling day either 1 14 and 28 days or 14 and 28 days by nutrient low medium and high concentration and by emerging contaminants presence vs absence which were used as factors in permanova also the contribution of each otu to the bray curtis distance between samples grouped by time was calculated using the analysis of similarity percentages simper all these analyses were run in the primer 6 statistical package with the permanova add on primer e plymouth marine laboratory uk 3 results 3 1 water chemistry environmental conditions dissolved oxygen ph and specific conductivity showed no statistically significant differences between arrays before the onset of the treatments data not shown dissolved oxygen was steady throughout the whole experiment and among treatments with values ranged between 9 99 and 10 41 mg l 1 conductivity increased with nutrient concentration from 206 19 ms cm 1 at low 233 29 ms cm 1 at medium and 350 64 ms cm 1 at high nutrient concentration aristi et al 2016 the concentration of the five selected chemicals was similar throughout the entire experiment among those channels exposed to the emerging contaminants treatment table 1 however measured concentrations were between 15 and 40 lower than the nominal ones except for ciprofloxacin which was approximately 24 higher table 1 these differences may be caused by natural attenuation within the artificial streams due to photo transformation and biotransformation the higher concentration of ciprofloxacin measured however might be due to its high sorption capacity to sediments marques et al 2013 regarding nutrients phosphate and ammonium concentrations were lower 25 80 and 80 90 less respectively than the nominal concentrations in all studied levels l m and h the concentration of nitrate in l and m was similar to the nominal one but not in h which was 10 lower table 1 aristi et al 2016 3 2 bacterial abundance copy numbers of bacterial 16s rrna gene was used as a proxy for bacterial abundance it should be noted however that 16s rrna copy numbers cannot be directly converted to cell numbers due to the large variation in the number of rrna operons among bacterial species farrelly et al 1995 stoddard et al 2015 before treatment started concentration of bacterial 16s rrna genes ranged from 9 75 107 to 5 92 108 copies cm 2 with no significant differences among replicates data not shown we then assessed the separated effect of nutrients and emerging contaminants on the 16s rrna abundance over time the copy numbers of bacterial 16s rrna gene increased along time as a result of bacterial growth p 0 001 table 2 fig 1 whereas the presence of emerging contaminants did not affect the 16s rrna gene abundance p 0 425 table 2 nutrients had a clear effect on its concentration p 0 001 table 2 fig 1 particularly copy numbers of the 16s rrna gene were significantly higher in biofilms exposed to medium nutrient concentrations in comparison to those grown at low and high nutrient concentrations this short term 14 days effect occurred regardless of the presence of emerging contaminants fig 1 after 28 days of exposure the abundance of the 16s rrna genes was similar between medium and high nutrient concentrations but significantly higher when compared to low nutrient conditions fig 1 the differential effect of nutrient on the 16s rrna abundance over time was corroborated with the significant interaction between the factors nutrient and time p 0 001 table 2 3 3 composition of biofilm bacterial communities after colonization of artificial channels and one day before treatment started day 1 biofilm bacterial communities were dominated by firmicutes 48 63 1 13 of total reads alphaproteobacteria 20 26 1 49 and betaproteobacteria 9 07 3 01 fig 2 the ordination of samples according to their similarity in community composition showed that time was the main factor causing the observed differences in bacterial community composition throughout the experiment regardless of the treatment nutrients or emerging contaminants fig 3 a at day 1 bacterial communities clustered together and significantly segregated from those at days 14 and 28 permanova test p 0 001 fig 3a a simper analysis was then carried out to identify which taxa were responsible of the observed differences between biofilm communities at days 1 and 28 simper revealed that families contributing the most to these differences were mainly affiliated to phyla firmicutes cyanobacteria and proteobacteria particularly classes alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria table s2a firmicutes were largely represented by sequences affiliated to order bacillales 98 04 of reads at day 1 but they decreased to 38 47 after 28 days data not shown in turn sequences affiliated to alpha and betaproteobacteria grouped into several orders that exhibited slight shifts in their relative abundance during the experiment particularly bradyrhizobiaceae and acetobacteraceae alphaproteobacteria and oxalobacteraceae betaproteobacteria table s2a sequences affiliated to phylum cyanobacteria and class gammaproteobacteria accounted to 0 76 0 17 and 4 73 0 25 respectively before treatment implementation day 1 but their relative abundances increased and decreased to 21 11 and 2 67 respectively after 28 days data not shown instead the treatments nutrients and emerging contaminants did not have a clear effect on the composition of biofilm bacterial communities fig 3b a principal coordinate analysis pcoa indicated that nutrients did not change bacterial communities while only 14 1 of the variability was accounted for the presence of emerging contaminants fig 3b this minor effect of the emerging contaminants on community composition was further confirmed by simper analysis suppl table s2b which showed that the differential abundance of otus contributing the most to the observed differences between biofilms exposed or not to emerging contaminants did not exceed 1 6 except for cyanobacteria this distribution was also corroborated with a permanova test which yielded significant differences in community composition by time p 0 005 but neither by nutrient concentration p 0 613 nor emerging contaminants p 0 171 3 4 abundance of args and the inti1 gene the genes conferring resistance to sulfamethoxazole sul1 and sul2 as well as the inti1 gene were detected in biofilm samples at day 1 and during treatment day 14 and 28 overall the relative abundance of the sul2 gene was lower than sul1 and inti1 genes fig 4 the concentration of genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones qnra qnrb and qnrs and macrolides ermb were always below the detection limit of the essay data not shown although antibiotics belonging to these families were present in the treatment mixture ciprofloxacin and erythromycin respectively nutrients did not have any effect on the relative concentration of inti1 sul1 and sul2 genes p 0 066 p 0 097 p 0 858 respectively while the presence of emerging contaminants significantly increased the relative abundance of both inti1 and sul1 p 0 001 fig 4 table 2 these genes increased further when nutrient concentration co occurred with the emerging contaminants fig 4 the combined stress caused by emerging contaminants and high nutrient concentrations resulted in higher concentrations of genes sul1 and inti1 when compared to biofilms incubated without the presence of contaminants at the same nutrient concentration fig 4 this differential effect was corroborated further by the significant interaction measured between the corresponding factors emerging contaminants and nutrients table 2 4 discussion microbial communities thriving in aquatic environments receiving wastewater effluents are challenged by a large variety of anthropogenic derived compounds but at the same time their growth and activity are fueled by nutrients also released by these discharges few studies have been designed however to elucidate the effects of both stressors aristi et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 and none have addressed the effects of both type of pollutants on the composition and antibiotic resistance profile of resident bacterial communities under controlled conditions the nutrient concentrations measured during the experiment were in most cases lower than the nominal ones notwithstanding this discrepancy previous studies have shown that concentrations of ammonium and nitrate similar to those measured in the high nutrient treatment caused toxic effects in aquatic ecosystems camargo and alonso 2006 in the present study the observed increase in 16s rrna gene copies here used as proxy for bacterial abundance in biofilms exposed to medium nutrient concentrations after 14 days of treatment agrees with the hump shaped response previously observed in aquatic biofilms subjected to increasing nutrient loads dunck et al 2015 niyogi et al 2007 the lack of this differential response at long term 28 days of treatment may respond to the adaptation of bacterial communities to the nutrient excess either by the overgrowth of copiotrophic species koch 2001 or the enrichment of bacterial taxa possessing a high copy number of rrna operons eichorst et al 2007 klappenbach et al 2000 remarkably emerging contaminants did not produce clear effects on bacterial abundance at any time suggesting that bacterial growth was not affected at the concentrations used although the five antimicrobials used in our study are known to inhibit bacterial growth at sub inhibitory concentrations mirsonbol et al 2014 pankey and sabath 2004 salem milani et al 2013 silva et al 2011 the polymeric biofilm matrix and its structural complexity probably lessened their inhibitory action steve et al 2013 also the higher resistance of bacterial cells within biofilms gilbert et al 2002 may account to the reduced susceptibility of the overall community to the emerging contaminants used likewise emerging contaminants did not significantly change bacterial community composition similar results were found when analyzing the effect of low level concentrations of sewage effluent on the bacterial community composition of river biofilms lehmann et al 2016 other studies also reported that low concentrations of emerging contaminants had low to no effect on the aquatic biota brausch and rand 2011 grung et al 2008 in contrast shifts in the bacterial community composition have been observed under environmental stress including selection for more resistant bacteria with an associate change in overall diversity ford 2000 this difference might be related to the existence of minimum inhibitory concentrations mics of antibiotics that can select for resistant bacteria gullberg et al 2011 2014 liu et al 2012 the predicted no effect concentrations that select for resistance pnec for erythromycin sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin have been estimated to be 1 16 and 0 064 μg l 1 respectively bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the concentrations used in our experiment were 1 6 and 20 times lower than the estimated pnec for erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole and only ciprofloxacin was present in a concentration higher than its pnec value 1 247 0 083 μg l 1 20 times higher table 1 assuming than only ciprofloxacin could select for resistance under our experimental conditions it is surprising that genes conferring resistance to this antibiotic qnrs qnra and qnrb were below the detection limit of the essay in all treatments and time points these results suggest that the combination of the selected pharmaceuticals at the concentrations used together with the incubation time 28 days was not sufficient to generate resistant genotypes to ciprofloxacin the increase of the relative abundance of sul1 and inti1 genes normalized to 16s rrna copies in biofilm communities exposed to emerging contaminants evidenced a clear impact on bacterial communities even in the absence of significant relevant shifts in their composition changes on the composition of bacterial communities have been invoked as crucial to explain changes in the resistome of sewage sludge jia et al 2015 and drinking water su et al 2014 in our study the variation in the abundance of inti1 and sul1 may be caused by others mechanisms rather than compositional changes the increase in the relative abundance of both inti1 and sul1 only when biofilms were exposed to emerging contaminants suggest that these genes were selectively enriched within the community actually concentration of antibiotics below the mic are known to stimulate horizontal gene transfer via mge and thus favor the development of resistance within a given community andersson and hughes 2014 in this regard the class i integron is a gene capture platform usually located in mges such as transposons and plasmids gillings et al 2015 the prevalence of inti1 in biofilm bacterial communities exposed to emerging contaminants may thus be the consequence of the potential mobilization of class i integrons within the biofilm community several studies have shown that the structured matrix of biofilms provides an optimal environment for gene transfer among bacteria gillings et al 2009 molin and tolker nielsen 2003 similarly the increase in the relative abundance of sul1 may be also related with integron mobilization since this gene is usually linked to class i integrons gillings et al 2015 after 14 days of experiment the relative abundance of the inti1 gene showed a significant correlation with the abundance of the sul1 gene spearman s rho 0 750 p 0 02 only in biofilms exposed to emerging contaminants fig s1 these results showed that the abundance of the inti1 gene which is usually linked to several resistance genes can rapidly change in response to environmental pressures supporting the idea of using the inti1 gene as a generic marker for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 previous studies have shown that nutrient concentration has a key role in stimulating horizontal gene transfer rates in biofilms as a result of enhanced metabolic rates and cell mobility elsas et al 2003 remarkably inti1 and sul1 genes reached their maximum abundance in those biofilms exposed to the combined effect of emerging contaminants and high nutrient concentration at both short and long term this suggests a synergistic effect of emerging contaminants and nutrients on the spread of inti1 and sul1genes moreover our results are consistent with those by zhao and co workers who found that nutrients might directly contribute to the dissemination of args in sediments collected at different sampling sites along a mariculture drainage ditch zhao et al 2016 likewise a study carried out in the dongjiang river basin found that antibiotics heavy metals and nutrients explained 21 of the cumulative percentage variance in arg data su et al 2014 overall these results confirm that nutrients lead to an increase in the prevalence of args and the inti1 gene under the combined effect of emerging contaminants lehmann et al 2016 5 conclusions the main conclusions of this work are summarized as follows environmental concentrations of emerging contaminants favor the spread of class i integrons and sul1 genes without significant shifts in the composition of streambed bacterial communities nutrients have a significant contribution to the spread of class i integrons and sul1 genes but only when combined with emerging contaminants showing a synergistic effect considering that wwtp effluents constantly release both nutrients and emerging contaminants into surface waters future efforts should be focused on i the combined effect of these stressors on the spread of antibiotic resistance and ii the implementation of new wastewater treatments to efficiently reduce the concentration of emerging contaminants and nutrients to minimum values conﬂict of

19594,wastewater effluents increase the nutrient load of receiving streams while introducing a myriad of anthropogenic chemical pollutants that challenge the resident aquatic micro biota disentangling the effects of both kind of stressors and their potential interaction on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial communities requires highly controlled manipulative experiments in this work we investigated the effects of a combined regime of nutrients at low medium and high concentrations and a mixture of emerging contaminants ciproﬂoxacin erythromycin sulfamethoxazole diclofenac and methylparaben on the bacterial composition abundance and antibiotic resistance profile of biofilms grown in artificial streams in particular we investigated the effect of this combined stress on genes encoding resistance to ciprofloxacin qnrs erythromycin ermb sulfamethoxazole sul1 and sul2 as well as the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 only genes conferring resistance to sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 and inti1 gene were detected in all treatments during the study period besides bacterial communities exposed to emerging contaminants showed higher copy numbers of sul1 and inti1 genes than those not exposed whereas nutrient amendments did not affect their abundance however bacterial communities exposed to both emerging contaminants and a high nutrient concentration 1 25 and 1 mg l 1 of phosphate nitrate and ammonium respectively showed the highest increase on the abundance of sul1 and inti1 genes thus suggesting a factors synergistic effect of both stressors since none of the treatments caused a significant change on the composition of bacterial communities the enrichment of sul1 and inti1 genes within the community was caused by their dissemination under the combined pressure exerted by nutrients and emerging contaminants to the best of our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the contribution of nutrients on the maintenance and spread of antibiotic resistance genes in streambed biofilms under controlled conditions our results also highlight that nutrients could enhance the effect of emerging contaminants on the dissemination of

populations characterized by a hump shape response of their biomass and activity paerl et al 2003 rubin and leff 2007 yergeau et al 2012 liu et al 2015 previous studies have also shown that nutrient load may favor horizontal gene transfer among microorganisms elsas et al 2003 amos et al 2015 this observation suggests that nutrients may thus promote the spread of args however information on the combined effect of nutrients and emergent contaminants on the composition of resident bacterial communities and their antibiotic resistance profile is limited zheng et al 2017 we therefore conducted an experiment using artificial streams under controlled conditions to assess the role of nutrients and their combined effect with emerging contaminants on the composition of biofilm bacterial communities and their associated resistome the experiment followed a factorial design with 2 levels of a mixture of emerging contaminants absence presence and three levels of nutrient concentrations low medium and high aristi et al 2016 for the compounds in the mixture we selected three antibiotics ciprofloxacin erythromycin sulfamethoxazole and two pharmaceuticals with antimicrobial activity the anti inflammatory drug diclofenac dastidar et al 2000 salem milani et al 2013 and the preservative methylparaben both largely used in food industry and cosmetics moir and eyles 1992 mirsonbol et al 2014 the selection of the five compounds was based on their high ecotoxicological relevance and their widespread occurrence in anthropogenic polluted rivers in the mediterranean region kuzmanovi et al 2014 the working concentrations of these five compounds were selected to mimic the worst scenario reported in the lower llobregat river gonzález et al 2012 gorga et al 2015 our goal was to evaluate the combined effect of nutrients and the selected pharmaceuticals on the prevalence of six genes enconding resistance to sulfamethoxazole sul1 sul2 ciprofloxacin qnra qnrb and qnrs and erythromycin ermb the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 was also analyzed to assess if treatment exposure favors the potential dissemination of args located in mges since inti1 is usually linked to mges and has been considered to play an important role in the acquisition and dissemination of args among bacteria ma et al 2017 stalder et al 2014 our hypotheses were that i the abundance of the target args and inti1 gene would increase with emerging contaminants reaching the maximum increase at the highest nutrient concentrations i e producing a synergistic interaction between nutrients and emerging contaminants ii the bacterial abundance would increase at medium nutrient concentration subsidy effect but decrease in the presence of emerging contaminants regardless of the nutrient concentration and iii the mixture of emerging contaminants and nutrients would alter the composition of streambed biofilm bacterial communities 2 methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was performed in the indoor experimental streams facility of the catalan institute for water research girona spain the treatments followed a factorial design based on three nutrient concentrations low l medium m or high h and two levels for the mixture of emerging contaminants no emerging ne or emerging e thus the experimental design was based on the following six treatments treatments with no emerging contaminants at low ne l medium ne m or high ne h nutrient concentrations and treatments with emerging contaminants at low e l medium e m or high e l nutrient concentrations the experimental streams facility consisted in eighteen artificial streams each artificial stream was assigned to one of six treatments following a randomized complete block design with three replicates per treatment and one replicate per block of six artificial streams nutrient treatment was based on a mixture of phosphate p po4 3 nitrate nno3 and ammonium nnh4 at different concentrations whereas the treatment with emerging contaminants consisted in a mixture of the 5 previously described contaminants ciprofloxacin erythromycin sulfamethoxazole diclofenac and methylparaben treatment exposure lasted for 28 days thus allowing the assessment of short 14 days to long term effects 28 days of both the separate effects of nutrients and emerging contaminants and their interaction 2 2 experimental settings each stream

cycles emulated those of the llémena river during late spring and under low flow conditions biofilm was inoculated twice per week during the colonization period using combined inoculum from epilithic growing on surface of rocks and epipsammic growing on the surface of sand biofilms from an unpolluted segment of the llémena river briefly biofilm inoculum was obtained after scrapping epilithic biofilms from 10 to 12 cobbles and washing approximately 10 l of fine sediments the colonization period in the artificial streams lasted for 20 days before the exposure to treatments nutrients during the colonization period were held constant at 0 040 1 7 and 0 040 mg l 1 of phosphate nitrate and ammonium by means of injection of concentrated solutions kh2po4 nano3 and nh4cl respectively and using a peristaltic pump ipc pump ismatec switzerland these concentrations were maintained in the l treatment and increased to 0 2 mg l 1 of phosphate 5 mg l 1 of nitrate and 0 2 mg l 1 of ammonium in the m treatment and to 1 25 and 1 mg l 1 of phosphate nitrate and ammonium respectively in the h treatment aristi et al 2016 the highest concentrations mimicked those observed during low flow conditions in the llobregat river aguilera et al 2012 we used a mixture of 5 emerging contaminants at constant concentrations of 0 1 μg l 1 of methylparaben and 1 μg l 1 of ciprofloxacin diclofenac erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole the working standard mixture of emerging contaminants was prepared every 2 days at a concentration of 100 mg l 1 in 10 methanol water v v and added to the artificial streams using a peristaltic pump ipc pump ismatec switzerland the total concentration of methanol reaching the artificial streams was 400 ng l 1 the same concentration of methanol was added to treatments without emerging contaminants high purity 97 standard solutions of the target compounds and their deuterated counterparts used as surrogate standards were obtained from sigma aldrich st louis u s a aldrich

weekly by noon in each artificial stream using wtw weilheim germany hand held probes background concentrations of nutrient and emerging contaminants were measured weekly from water collected from the channel outlet to assess the possible differences between nominal and observed concentrations see aristi et al 2016 for details emerging contaminants were analyzed using a method based on an online

ionization source esi see aristi et al 2016 for details note that the limits of detection lods and quantification loqs were estimated experimentally from real samples as the concentration of analyte that provides a signal to noise ratio of 3 and 10 respectively 2 4 sampling and sample processing biofilm samples from each artificial stream were collected before treatment started at day 1 as well as after 14 and 28 days the top sand layer 1 cm was collected with a core sampler diameter 1 2 cm placed in sterile 15 ml polypropylene tubes fisher scientific wilmington de usa and stored at 80 c until dna extraction biofilms were detached from sand particles by vortexing for 5 min 3 times after adding 5 ml of 10 mm tris hcl buffer at ph 7 5 to each sterile 15 ml polypropylene tubes biofilm biomass was then pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min and genomic dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories usa according to manufacturer s instructions the dna concentration was measured using qubit 2 0 fluorometer life technologies carlsbad ca usa and purity was determined by measuring a260 a230 and a260 a280 absorbance ratios using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington de usa 2 5 quantification of antibiotic resistance genes copy numbers of six genes encoding resistance to the antibiotics added in the mixture of emerging contaminants namely sul1 and sul2 genes conferring resistance to sulfamethoxazole qnra qnrb and qnrs genes conferring resistance to ciprofloxacin and the ermb gene conferring resistance to erythromycin were determined in triplicate using real time pcr qpcr assays moreover copy numbers of the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 and the bacterial 16s rrna gene were also determined the abundance of the latter was used as a proxy for bacterial abundance and to normalize the concentration of target args to minimize variations due to different dna extraction efficiency across samples and to provide an indication of the proportion of total bacterial carrying args heuer et al 2011 pruden et al 2006 all genes were quantified using primers and conditions compiled in supporting information table s1 the standard curves were carried out as previously described subirats et al 2017 all reactions were performed using sybr green detection chemistry on a mx3005 system agilent technologies santa clara ca usa as previously described marti et al 2013 samples were analyzed in duplicate with a standard curve and a negative control included in each run the specificity of the reaction was verified by melting curve analysis and by electrophoresis run all qpcr assays were performed with high r 2 values 0 998 in average high efficiencies 91 86 3 18 and a dynamic range of at least 5 orders of magnitude thus validating the gene quantification the limit of quantification of each gene was 18 100 80 56 250 copies μl 1 for qnrs sul1 sul2 ermb and inti1 genes respectively 2 6 high throughput sequencing and sequence processing for community analysis equimolar amounts of dna extracted from each artificial stream under same treatment conditions were combined to obtain a composite sample for that treatment these composite samples were then subjected to high throughput multiplexed 16s rrna gene sequencing with the illumina miseq system 2 250 pe using primer pair 515f 806r caporaso et al 2011 complemented with illumina adapters and sample specific barcodes at the research technology support facility michigan state university usa kozich et al 2013 pair merging quality filtering chimera checking clustering into operational taxonomic units otu 97 cutoff and construction of otu table were carried out using default parameters in uparse edgar 2013 the resulting otu table was converted to biological observation matrix biom format mcdonald et al 2012 and then imported and analyzed in qiime caporaso et al 2010 sequencing depth ranged between 167 and 97 540 sequences per sample the sample with the lowest sequence number 14ne h 167 sequences was removed from downstream analysis otus affiliated to eukaryotes 6 0 2 algal chloroplasts 83 3 3 archaea 8 0 3 and unclassifieds 175 6 5 were filtered from the original otu table using appropriate scripts in qiime after filtering we obtained a total number of 2435 bacterial otus for community analysis alpha and beta diversity the number of sequences in each sample was normalized by randomly selecting a subset of 27 700 sequences per sample to minimize bias due to different sequencing depth across samples the sequence data set was deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under accession number srp128512 2 7 data analysis we used one way analysis of variance anova with blocks as fixed factor to test for differences among experimental arrays for all variables before treatment onset after that differences in the abundance of target args inti1 and 16s rrna genes were analyzed using a mixed effects model with time nutrients and emerging pollutant treatments as fixed factors and arrays as random factor n 36 interactions between the considered fixed factors were also tested and post hoc tukey tests were done for each sampling day normality of all variables was checked with the shapiro wilk test and statistical significance was determined at α 0 05 all analyses were performed with r software version 3 1 1 r development core team vienna austria for community composition analyses we constructed a similarity matrix using the bray curtis distance legendre and gallagher 2001 based on the relative abundance square root transformed of each bacterial otu ordination of samples according to bray curtis distance matrices was done using principal coordinates analysis pcoa analysis of similarity between communities based on their taxonomic composition was done after grouping samples by sampling day either 1 14 and 28 days or 14 and 28 days by nutrient low medium and high concentration and by emerging contaminants presence vs absence which were used as factors in permanova also the contribution of each otu to the bray curtis distance between samples grouped by time was calculated using the analysis of similarity percentages simper all these analyses were run in the primer 6 statistical package with the permanova add on primer e plymouth marine laboratory uk 3 results 3 1 water chemistry environmental conditions dissolved oxygen ph and specific conductivity showed no statistically significant differences between arrays before the onset of the treatments data not shown dissolved oxygen was steady throughout the whole experiment and among treatments with values ranged between 9 99 and 10 41 mg l 1 conductivity increased with nutrient concentration from 206 19 ms cm 1 at low 233 29 ms cm 1 at medium and 350 64 ms cm 1 at high nutrient concentration aristi et al 2016 the concentration of the five selected chemicals was similar throughout the entire experiment among those channels exposed to the emerging contaminants treatment table 1 however measured concentrations were between 15 and 40 lower than the nominal ones except for ciprofloxacin which was approximately 24 higher table 1 these differences may be caused by natural attenuation within the artificial streams due to photo transformation and biotransformation the higher concentration of ciprofloxacin measured however might be due to its high sorption capacity to sediments marques et al 2013 regarding nutrients phosphate and ammonium concentrations were lower 25 80 and 80 90 less respectively than the nominal concentrations in all studied levels l m and h the concentration of nitrate in l and m was similar to the nominal one but not in h which was 10 lower table 1 aristi et al 2016 3 2 bacterial abundance copy numbers of bacterial 16s rrna gene was used as a proxy for bacterial abundance it should be noted however that 16s rrna copy numbers cannot be directly converted to cell numbers due to the large variation in the number of rrna operons among bacterial species farrelly et al 1995 stoddard et al 2015 before treatment started concentration of bacterial 16s rrna genes ranged from 9 75 107 to 5 92 108 copies cm 2 with no significant differences among replicates data not shown we then assessed the separated effect of nutrients and emerging contaminants on the 16s rrna abundance over time the copy numbers of bacterial 16s rrna gene increased along time as a result of bacterial growth p 0 001 table 2 fig 1 whereas the presence of emerging contaminants did not affect the 16s rrna gene abundance p 0 425 table 2 nutrients had a clear effect on its concentration p 0 001 table 2 fig 1 particularly copy numbers of the 16s rrna gene were significantly higher in biofilms exposed to medium nutrient concentrations in comparison to those grown at low and high nutrient concentrations this short term 14 days effect occurred regardless of the presence of emerging contaminants fig 1 after 28 days of exposure the abundance of the 16s rrna genes was similar between medium and high nutrient concentrations but significantly higher when compared to low nutrient conditions fig 1 the differential effect of nutrient on the 16s rrna abundance over time was corroborated with the significant interaction between the factors nutrient and time p 0 001 table 2 3 3 composition of biofilm bacterial communities after colonization of artificial channels and one day before treatment started day 1 biofilm bacterial communities were dominated by firmicutes 48 63 1 13 of total reads alphaproteobacteria 20 26 1 49 and betaproteobacteria 9 07 3 01 fig 2 the ordination of samples according to their similarity in community composition showed that time was the main factor causing the observed differences in bacterial community composition throughout the experiment regardless of the treatment nutrients or emerging contaminants fig 3 a at day 1 bacterial communities clustered together and significantly segregated from those at days 14 and 28 permanova test p 0 001 fig 3a a simper analysis was then carried out to identify which taxa were responsible of the observed differences between biofilm communities at days 1 and 28 simper revealed that families contributing the most to these differences were mainly affiliated to phyla firmicutes cyanobacteria and proteobacteria particularly classes alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria table s2a firmicutes were largely represented by sequences affiliated to order bacillales 98 04 of reads at day 1 but they decreased to 38 47 after 28 days data not shown in turn sequences affiliated to alpha and betaproteobacteria grouped into several orders that exhibited slight shifts in their relative abundance during the experiment particularly bradyrhizobiaceae and acetobacteraceae alphaproteobacteria and oxalobacteraceae betaproteobacteria table s2a sequences affiliated to phylum cyanobacteria and class gammaproteobacteria accounted to 0 76 0 17 and 4 73 0 25 respectively before treatment implementation day 1 but their relative abundances increased and decreased to 21 11 and 2 67 respectively after 28 days data not shown instead the treatments nutrients and emerging contaminants did not have a clear effect on the composition of biofilm bacterial communities fig 3b a principal coordinate analysis pcoa indicated that nutrients did not change bacterial communities while only 14 1 of the variability was accounted for the presence of emerging contaminants fig 3b this minor effect of the emerging contaminants on community composition was further confirmed by simper analysis suppl table s2b which showed that the differential abundance of otus contributing the most to the observed differences between biofilms exposed or not to emerging contaminants did not exceed 1 6 except for cyanobacteria this distribution was also corroborated with a permanova test which yielded significant differences in community composition by time p 0 005 but neither by nutrient concentration p 0 613 nor emerging contaminants p 0 171 3 4 abundance of args and the inti1 gene the genes conferring resistance to sulfamethoxazole sul1 and sul2 as well as the inti1 gene were detected in biofilm samples at day 1 and during treatment day 14 and 28 overall the relative abundance of the sul2 gene was lower than sul1 and inti1 genes fig 4 the concentration of genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones qnra qnrb and qnrs and macrolides ermb were always below the detection limit of the essay data not shown although antibiotics belonging to these families were present in the treatment mixture ciprofloxacin and erythromycin respectively nutrients did not have any effect on the relative concentration of inti1 sul1 and sul2 genes p 0 066 p 0 097 p 0 858 respectively while the presence of emerging contaminants significantly increased the relative abundance of both inti1 and sul1 p 0 001 fig 4 table 2 these genes increased further when nutrient concentration co occurred with the emerging contaminants fig 4 the combined stress caused by emerging contaminants and high nutrient concentrations resulted in higher concentrations of genes sul1 and inti1 when compared to biofilms incubated without the presence of contaminants at the same nutrient concentration fig 4 this differential effect was corroborated further by the significant interaction measured between the corresponding factors emerging contaminants and nutrients table 2 4 discussion microbial communities thriving in aquatic environments receiving wastewater effluents are challenged by a large variety of anthropogenic derived compounds but at the same time their growth and activity are fueled by nutrients also released by these discharges few studies have been designed however to elucidate the effects of both stressors aristi et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 and none have addressed the effects of both type of pollutants on the composition and antibiotic resistance profile of resident bacterial communities under controlled conditions the nutrient concentrations measured during the experiment were in most cases lower than the nominal ones notwithstanding this discrepancy previous studies have shown that concentrations of ammonium and nitrate similar to those measured in the high nutrient treatment caused toxic effects in aquatic ecosystems camargo and alonso 2006 in the present study the observed increase in 16s rrna gene copies here used as proxy for bacterial abundance in biofilms exposed to medium nutrient concentrations after 14 days of treatment agrees with the hump shaped response previously observed in aquatic biofilms subjected to increasing nutrient loads dunck et al 2015 niyogi et al 2007 the lack of this differential response at long term 28 days of treatment may respond to the adaptation of bacterial communities to the nutrient excess either by the overgrowth of copiotrophic species koch 2001 or the enrichment of bacterial taxa possessing a high copy number of rrna operons eichorst et al 2007 klappenbach et al 2000 remarkably emerging contaminants did not produce clear effects on bacterial abundance at any time suggesting that bacterial growth was not affected at the concentrations used although the five antimicrobials used in our study are known to inhibit bacterial growth at sub inhibitory concentrations mirsonbol et al 2014 pankey and sabath 2004 salem milani et al 2013 silva et al 2011 the polymeric biofilm matrix and its structural complexity probably lessened their inhibitory action steve et al 2013 also the higher resistance of bacterial cells within biofilms gilbert et al 2002 may account to the reduced susceptibility of the overall community to the emerging contaminants used likewise emerging contaminants did not significantly change bacterial community composition similar results were found when analyzing the effect of low level concentrations of sewage effluent on the bacterial community composition of river biofilms lehmann et al 2016 other studies also reported that low concentrations of emerging contaminants had low to no effect on the aquatic biota brausch and rand 2011 grung et al 2008 in contrast shifts in the bacterial community composition have been observed under environmental stress including selection for more resistant bacteria with an associate change in overall diversity ford 2000 this difference might be related to the existence of minimum inhibitory concentrations mics of antibiotics that can select for resistant bacteria gullberg et al 2011 2014 liu et al 2012 the predicted no effect concentrations that select for resistance pnec for erythromycin sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin have been estimated to be 1 16 and 0 064 μg l 1 respectively bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the concentrations used in our experiment were 1 6 and 20 times lower than the estimated pnec for erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole and only ciprofloxacin was present in a concentration higher than its pnec value 1 247 0 083 μg l 1 20 times higher table 1 assuming than only ciprofloxacin could select for resistance under our experimental conditions it is surprising that genes conferring resistance to this antibiotic qnrs qnra and qnrb were below the detection limit of the essay in all treatments and time points these results suggest that the combination of the selected pharmaceuticals at the concentrations used together with the incubation time 28 days was not sufficient to generate resistant genotypes to ciprofloxacin the increase of the relative abundance of sul1 and inti1 genes normalized to 16s rrna copies in biofilm communities exposed to emerging contaminants evidenced a clear impact on bacterial communities even in the absence of significant relevant shifts in their composition changes on the composition of bacterial communities have been invoked as crucial to explain changes in the resistome of sewage sludge jia et al 2015 and drinking water su et al 2014 in our study the variation in the abundance of inti1 and sul1 may be caused by others mechanisms rather than compositional changes the increase in the relative abundance of both inti1 and sul1 only when biofilms were exposed to emerging contaminants suggest that these genes were selectively enriched within the community actually concentration of antibiotics below the mic are known to stimulate horizontal gene transfer via mge and thus favor the development of resistance within a given community andersson and hughes 2014 in this regard the class i integron is a gene capture platform usually located in mges such as transposons and plasmids gillings et al 2015 the prevalence of inti1 in biofilm bacterial communities exposed to emerging contaminants may thus be the consequence of the potential mobilization of class i integrons within the biofilm community several studies have shown that the structured matrix of biofilms provides an optimal environment for gene transfer among bacteria gillings et al 2009 molin and tolker nielsen 2003 similarly the increase in the relative abundance of sul1 may be also related with integron mobilization since this gene is usually linked to class i integrons gillings et al 2015 after 14 days of experiment the relative abundance of the inti1 gene showed a significant correlation with the abundance of the sul1 gene spearman s rho 0 750 p 0 02 only in biofilms exposed to emerging contaminants fig s1 these results showed that the abundance of the inti1 gene which is usually linked to several resistance genes can rapidly change in response to environmental pressures supporting the idea of using the inti1 gene as a generic marker for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 previous studies have shown that nutrient concentration has a key role in stimulating horizontal gene transfer rates in biofilms as a result of enhanced metabolic rates and cell mobility elsas et al 2003 remarkably inti1 and sul1 genes reached their maximum abundance in those biofilms exposed to the combined effect of emerging contaminants and high nutrient concentration at both short and long term this suggests a synergistic effect of emerging contaminants and nutrients on the spread of inti1 and sul1genes moreover our results are consistent with those by zhao and co workers who found that nutrients might directly contribute to the dissemination of args in sediments collected at different sampling sites along a mariculture drainage ditch zhao et al 2016 likewise a study carried out in the dongjiang river basin found that antibiotics heavy metals and nutrients explained 21 of the cumulative percentage variance in arg data su et al 2014 overall these results confirm that nutrients lead to an increase in the prevalence of args and the inti1 gene under the combined effect of emerging contaminants lehmann et al 2016 5 conclusions the main conclusions of this work are summarized as follows environmental concentrations of emerging contaminants favor the spread of class i integrons and sul1 genes without significant shifts in the composition of streambed bacterial communities nutrients have a significant contribution to the spread of class i integrons and sul1 genes but only when combined with emerging contaminants showing a synergistic effect considering that wwtp effluents constantly release both nutrients and emerging contaminants into surface waters future efforts should be focused on i the combined effect of these stressors on the spread of antibiotic resistance and ii the implementation of new wastewater treatments to efficiently reduce the concentration of emerging contaminants and nutrients to minimum values conﬂict of
