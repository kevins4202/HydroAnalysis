17415,in the present work an active mno2 rice husk biochar bc composite mbc was prepared to enhance as iii removal for groundwater remediation the mbc material obtained an improved porous structure i e specific surface area pore volume and mesoporosity with mno2 providing abundant reaction or interaction sites for surface or interface related processes such as redox transformation and adsorption of arsenic as a result a significant enhancement in arsenic removal can be achieved by using mbc more specifically mbc showed a high removal capacity for as iii which was tenfold higher than that of bc this improvement can be ascribed to the redox transformation of as iii via mno2 resulting in the more effective removal of as v species in addition ph was an important factor that could influence the as iii removal capacity under alkaline conditions the as iii v removal capacity of mbc was clearly lower than those under acidic and neutral conditions due to the negative effects of electrostatic repulsion importantly a powerful transformation capability of as iii via mbc was presented namely only 5 9 as iii remained in solution under neutral conditions both mno2 and the bc substrate contributed to the removal of arsenic by mbc mno2 delivered mn oh functional groups to generate surface complexes with as v produced by as iii oxidation while the reduced mn ii and as v could precipitate on the mbc surface the bc substrate also provided cooh and oh functional groups for as iii v removal by a surface complexation mechanism note that the application of mbc in the treatment of simulated groundwater demonstrated an efficient arsenic removal of 94 6 and a concentration of arsenic as low as the 10 µg l 1 who guideline keywords engineered biochar redox transformation arsenite oxidation arsenic removal groundwater remediation 1 introduction arsenic is a ubiquitous contaminant with high toxicity and carcinogenicity that can be found in groundwater at high concentrations smedley and kinniburgh 2002 natural arsenic sources related to weathered volcanic rocks sedimentary rocks of marine origin mineral deposits fossil fuels and geothermal areas can contaminate water sources through geological or hydrological processes korte and fernando 1991 artificial arsenic sources may originate from the mining and processing of mineral waste animal feed additives pesticides and arsenic stores nordstrom 2002 arsenic may exist in aqueous solution in two oxidation states arsenate as v and arsenite as iii depending on the environmental conditions e g ph and redox potential eh in groundwater with a ph range of 6 8 5 as iii dominates as the h3aso3 species under reducing conditions low eh values while as v appears as a mixture of the h2aso4 and haso4 2 species under oxidizing conditions high eh values sharma and sohn 2009 note that the as iii species has higher mobility and solubility and much more toxicity than as v zhao et al 2010 arsenic has been observed in aquatic environments in many countries at concentrations ranging from 1 μg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 sarkar and paul 2016 according to guidelines for drinking water quality from the world health organization who the maximum allowable concentration of arsenic in drinking water is 10 ppb smith et al 2002 if the concentration of arsenic in drinking water is higher than 10 μg l 1 there will be many impacts in terms of both physical and psychological harm in particular arsenic entering the body can cause serious diseases including cancer e g skin bladder kidney and lung cancers and perhaps other internal tumors hypertension peripheral vascular disease and diabetes hopenhayn 2006 many methods have been applied to treat arsenic in natural water sources especially groundwater these methods include filtration leupin and hug 2005 ion exchange anirudhan and unnithan 2007 precipitation battaglia brunet et al 2012 adsorption pintor et al 2018 membrane separation zheng et al 2011 reverse osmosis abejón et al 2015 and capacitive deionization fan et al 2017 among these technologies adsorption is regarded as one of the simplest to operate and most cost effective techniques for arsenic removal ali and gupta 2006 unfortunately many previous studies of adsorption processes have indicated that the removal efficiency of as iii is significantly lower than that of as v aryal et al 2010 ge et al 2017 liu et al 2018b to improve the removal efficiency of as iii many studies have focused on the conversion of as iii to as v based on preoxidation processes involving oxidizing substances such as zero valent iron ramos et al 2009 fe iii oxides greenleaf et al 2003 titanium dioxide bissen et al 2001 hydrogen peroxide voegelin and hug 2003 and fe mn binary oxides lou et al 2017 the utilization of mno2 has also shown effectiveness in various environmental applications e g as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction xiao et al 2010 to improve methyl blue adsorption chen et al 2013 and to enhance desalination performance liu et al 2018a notably manganese dioxide mno2 is an environmentally friendly oxidizing agent with a high redox potential of e0 mno2 mn2 1 224 v and e0 mn3 mn2 1 542 v hou et al 2016 mno2 possesses the ability to efficiently and quickly oxidize as iii to as v which is considered an important step in reducing arsenic toxicity and facilitating arsenic fixation gude et al 2017 hou et al 2017a hou et al 2017b li et al 2010 oscarson et al 1981 the initial redox reaction between as iii and mno2 rapidly occurs via the following reactions tournassat et al 2002 1 2 m n iv o 2 h 3 as o 3 h 2 o 2 m n iii ooh h 2 aso 4 h 2 2 m n iii ooh h 3 as o 3 3 h 2 m n 2 h 2 aso 4 3 h 2 o subsequently mno2 can act as a potential adsorbent to remove as v by surface complexation of as v on mno2 surfaces manning et al 2002 electrostatic retention and ion exchange lenoble et al 2004 saleh et al 2011 additionally the removal of as v has been reported by tournassat et al in which manganese arsenate mnhaso4 h2o precipitated on the surface of mno2 tournassat et al 2002 unfortunately the formation of mnhaso4 h2o precipitation on pure mno2 may reduce the effective surface area as well as the active site of mno2 saleh et al 2011 in recent years waste biomass adsorbents have also attracted much attention in the adsorption of as iii v providing a cost effective and eco friendly solution asere et al 2019 vithanage et al 2017 several types of biochar derived from waste biomass have been used to adsorb as iii v such as oak wood niazi et al 2018b perennial grass saikia et al 2017 tectona and lagerstroemia speciose verma and singh 2019 perilla leaf niazi et al 2018a and rice husk agrafioti et al 2014 significantly rice husk is an agricultural waste biomass that is a byproduct of the milling industry and is currently becoming highly attractive owing to its broad usefulness and potential in water treatment rice husk is also the most appropriate representative of economical and widely available biomass waste cuong et al 2019 cuong et al 2020 moayedi et al 2019 in addition rice husk biochar contains abundant functional groups e g carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh which play important roles in the complexation mechanism for arsenic sorption li et al 2017 more specifically zhong et al mentioned that the redox active moieties i e phenolic oh quinoid co and semiquinone type persistent free radicals on rice husk biochar can contribute to the oxidation of as iii zhong et al 2019 however pristine biochar may have a limited adsorption capacity especially for the removal of highly mobile as iii due to its poor porous nature and low activity therefore biochar needs an amendment e g oxide hydroxide coating of fe cope et al 2014 al zhang and gao 2013 or fe mn lin et al 2017 to be an effective as adsorbent a promising solution is the synthesis of an engineered mno2 biochar composite material that can enhance the textural porosity surface chemistry and adsorptive properties of pristine biochar note that the biochar surface can provide more attachable sites for mnhaso4 h2o precipitation thereby avoiding the reduction of active sites on mno2 for as iii oxidation saleh et al 2011 liang s group indicated that swine manure derived biochar modified with mno2 significantly improved the adsorption performance of pb and cd liang et al 2017 grape stalk derived biochar supported mn oxide was prepared by trakal et al and exhibited excellent removal efficiencies of almost 99 91 and 51 for pb as and cd respectively trakal et al 2018 wu et al prepared mno2 rice husk biochar composites with enhanced adsorption capacities for cd ii and pb ii of 4 2 and 5 5 times compared to pristine biochar respectively wu et al 2020 however the mechanisms of as iii oxidation and as iii v removal by mno2 modified biochar remain poorly understood the purpose of this study was to decorate an engineered biochar substrate with mno2 to create a composite material for groundwater remediation specifically the mno2 biochar composite should have improved porosity and surface chemistry properties enhancing as iii oxidation and removal accordingly a mno2 biochar composite was synthesized by an in situ chemical precipitation method by controlling the mass ratio of mno2 batch adsorption experiments i e analysis of ph effects concentration effects and concentration time relationships were performed to obtain insight into the as iii oxidation and as iii v removal mechanisms by the mno2 biochar composite from aqueous solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of mno2 biochar composite rice husk biochar bc was purchased from mu en farm xinshi dist tainan city taiwan it was prepared by the pyrolysis method under a nitrogen atmosphere at 700 c for 8 h the fabrication of the mno2 biochar composite mbc was performed according to fig s1 mbc was synthesized by an in situ chemical precipitation method accordingly 2 g bc with sizes ranging from 60 to 120 mesh was submerged in 100 ml of 50 100 or 150 mm manganese ii acetate tetrahydrate 99 99 sigma aldrich solution and then ultrasonically vibrated for 30 min subsequently 100 ml of kmno4 99 jt baker solution with stoichiometry was gradually added under continuous stirring the brown suspension was stirred at 700 rpm and 80 c for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature after that the suspension was filtered washed with di water several times and dried at 80 c for 36 h the dried products were ground to pass through a 120 mesh and preserved in the desiccator before use the mbc samples were obtained and denoted as mbc x where x mm is the concentration of the mn ii acetate tetrahydrate solution 2 2 material characterizations the thermal stability of the samples was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis tga sta 6000 perkinelmer usa field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem s 4800 hitachi corp japan was used to examine the

spectroscopy analyzer thermo scientific escalab xi usa were used to analyze the surface composition x ray diffractometry xrd rigaku co usa was used to characterize the phase structures of the samples the manganese concentration was determined using an atomic absorption spectroscopy aas instrument aanalyst 800 perkinelmer germany the arsenic concentration was measured by a high pressure liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icpms lc 1200 and icp ms 7700x agilent technologies system the zeta potential of the samples was measured by a 90 plus particle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern panalytical ltd uk 2 3 batch experiment settings as iii oxidation and as iii v removal on the bc and mbc 100 samples were investigated by the batch equilibrium method concentration effect studies were performed with a 1 5 or 10 mg l 1 as iii or as v solution at ph 7 0 1 the effects of ph on oxidation and removal were investigated with a 10 mg l 1 arsenic solution at different ph values of 4 7 or 10 0 1 corresponding to acidic neutral or basic conditions respectively accordingly approximately 0 06 g of adsorbent was placed in a 30 ml solution of as iii naaso2 90 sigma aldrich or as v as2o5 97 sigma aldrich in a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube the ph of the solutions was adjusted with 0 01 m naoh 97 nacalai tesque and 0 01 m hcl 35 nacalai tesque the as iii and as v containing suspensions were shaken at 150 rpm at 25 c for 120 min the filtrate was collected using a 0 45 µm filter before measuring the concentrations the equilibrium removal capacities q e mg g 1 of arsenic adsorbed on the adsorbents were calculated according to eq 3 3 q e v c 0 c e w where v l is the volume of the solution c 0 and c e mg l 1 are the initial and equilibrium adsorbate concentrations in solution respectively and w g is the weight of the adsorbent moreover the arsenic removal performance of mbc 100 was investigated using simulated groundwater with low arsenic concentration typically 0 06 g mbc 100 was added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing a 30 ml solution of 100 µg l 1 as 90 as iii and 10 as v and 90 mg l 1 nacl 99 sigma aldrich the ph was not adjusted and the measured value was 5 68 the concentration time relationships of elements i e arsenic and manganese in the final solution were determined at time intervals from 1 to 120 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of bc and mbc n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the bc mbc and mno2 samples are shown in fig 1 a and s2 obvious hysteresis loops were observed between the adsorption and desorption curves at approximately p p 0 0 4 1 which indicated the presence of a mesoporous structure sing et al 1985 additionally fig 1b presents pore size distribution plots of bc and mbc 100 the broad distribution of mesopores in the range of 2 6 14 7 nm of the mbc 100 sample suggested that it is a mesoporous material li et al 2016 moreover the porosity properties of the bc and mbc samples are shown in table 1 it was seen that the porosity of bc after modification with mno2 improved with increases in the concentration of reactants for the mbc 50 mbc 100 and mbc 150 samples the specific surface areas were 51 5 71 0 and 122 3 m2 g 1 and the total pore volumes were 0 05 0 11 and 0 25 cm3 g 1 respectively additionally the mesoporosity of the mbc samples increased with increasing mn ii concentration mbc 50 mbc 100 and mbc 150 had mesoporosity ratios of 68 85 and 96 respectively the development of mesopores on the mbcs is attributed to the mno2 coating with an ultrahigh mesoporosity of 97 see table s1 these observations demonstrated the successful synthesis of mbc with an enhanced specific surface area pore volume and mesoporosity such enhancement can provide a large number of reaction or interaction sites for surface or interface related processes such as redox transformation and adsorption of arsenic fig 1c d and s3 show the tga differential thermogravimetry dtg spectra of the pristine bc and mbc samples as seen two stages of weight loss occurred in the pyrolysis process of pristine bc from 50 to 900 c in the first stage the weight of the pristine bc was reduced by 3 85 between 50 and 400 c which is related to the loss of water and volatile organic components inside its porous structure a higher weight loss of 68 95 was observed in the range of 400 700 c due to the gasification of the carbon matrix the residual mass of the bc approximately 27 20 indicates the presence of silica compounds inside the rice husk because the reaction between silica and oxygen can only occur at temperatures over 2000 c moreover the weight losses of mbc 50 mbc 100 and mbc 150 in the first stage were 5 75 6 00 and 7 75 respectively the increase in the weight loss of the mbc samples indicated the development of a porous structure in accordance with the results of n2 adsorption desorption analysis the residual masses of mbc 50 mbc 100 and mbc 150 were 36 37 41 38 and 51 69 respectively which are attributed to the total mass of silica and manganese these results confirm that the different mass ratios of mno2 are controlled on the mbc samples figs 2 and s4 present the morphological characteristics of the bc mbc 50 mbc 100 and mbc 150 samples the surface morphology of the bc sample was comparatively solid fig 2a while that of the mbc 100 sample was very rough with small particles fig 2b these results provided obvious evidence that mno2 formed on the mbc as illustrated the surface area covered by mno2 particles on the mbc samples became larger with an increased concentration of reactants i e mn ii and kmno4 note that the substrate surface of mbc 150 was mostly coated with mno2 therefore mbc 100 was selected to further investigate arsenic removal by mno2 and the bc substrate of mbc 100 the crystal structure of the bc and mbc 100 samples was determined by xrd as shown in fig 3 as observed the xrd pattern of bc had two typical diffraction peaks at 2θ 23 0 and 43 0 corresponding to the 002 and 110 crystal planes of graphite respectively which are consistent with most pyrolytic carbons stephan et al 2006 the intensity of the diffraction peaks for mbc 100 decreased compared to that for bc suggesting the uniform coverage of mno2 most notably in the xrd pattern of mbc 100 the peaks at 2θ 22 0 36 8 and 42 0 can be easily identified corresponding to the 101 210 and 211 planes respectively of the γ mno2 crystalline structure jcpds file no 44 0142 li et al 2018 3 2 effect of concentration on as iii v removal the effect of the initial concentration on the removal capacity of arsenic was investigated for pristine bc and mbc 100 at ph 7 as shown in fig 4 the removal capacity of as v increased with increasing initial arsenic concentration this observation may be due to the higher concentration gradient for ion transport resulting in more contact between arsenic ions and the material surface lutzenkirchen 2006 notably the removal capacity of as iii v on mbc 100 was clearly greater than that on bc for the 10 mg l 1 arsenic solution the as iii and as v removal capacities of mbc 100 were 1 88 and 2 16 mg g 1 which were much higher than those of bc with 0 14 and 0 42 mg g 1 respectively the improved arsenic removal by mbc 100 was attributed to the higher porosity i e specific surface area and mesoporosity and the existence of mno2 more specifically the removal capacity of as iii by mbc 100 was improved 13 4 times compared to that of bc the improvement of as v removal capacity after modification with mno2 was only 5 1 times the greater enhancement of as iii removal capacity by mbc 100 could be attributed to the redox transformation of as iii to as v by mno2 on mbc 100 3 3 effect of ph on the removal of as iii v fig 5 presents the removal capacity of as iii v by the pristine bc and mbc 100 samples at ph 4 7 and 10 the as iii v removal capacities of both samples were highest at ph 4 and lowest at ph 10 notably the as v removal capacities of the samples decreased at both ph 7 and ph 10 however an obvious decrease in the as iii removal capacities was only observed at ph 10 these observations may be related to electrostatic repulsion between arsenic ions and the charged material surfaces to elucidate this phenomenon in depth fig s5 shows the zeta potential ph curves for the samples and fig s6 presents the eh ph diagram of arsenic as illustrated the bc and mbc samples had negative zeta potentials in the ph range from 2 to 10 and the zeta potentials became more negative as the ph increased in this ph range fig s5 notably as v was always present in anionic forms h2aso4 ph 7 and haso4 2 ph 7 fig s6 this characteristic indicates that if the ph increased the electrostatic repulsion between as v ions and the negatively charged surface of the samples would increase resulting in reduced removal performance on the other hand the dominant forms of as iii are nonionic h3aso3 species ph 9 1 and anionic h2aso3 species ph 9 1 fig s6 the existence of nonionic h3aso3 species at both ph 4 and ph 7 results in no effects related to electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged surface of bc and mbc 100 this relationship explains why the as iii removal capacity remained relatively constant at ph 7 compared to that at ph 4 furthermore the anionic h2aso3 species that appeared at ph 10 formed electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged surface of the samples this interaction caused a decrease in the as iii removal capacity at ph 10 in addition the higher zeta potential value of mbc 100 compared to bc fig s5 reflects the lower electrostatic repulsion between charged arsenic species and material surfaces which contributes to the enhanced arsenic removal performance of mbc 100 3 4 ph dependence of as iii oxidation in this study the oxidation of as iii to as v by bc and mbc 100 was further investigated in detail these experiments were conducted with a 10 mg l 1 as iii solution under varying ph values of 4 7 and 10 fig 6 presents the concentrations of arsenic species i e mobile as iii and as v in solution and adsorbed as in these experiments after shaking within 120 min for as iii removal by bc mobile as iii predominated over mobile as v at all ph values for instance the bc system at ph 7 contained 79 3 mobile as iii 5 8 mobile as v and 14 9 adsorbed as in addition the highest as v generation was found at ph 10 our observations are in accordance with the previous result reported by zhong et al 2019 reflecting the ph dependence of as iii oxidation by biochar in contrast mbc 100 significantly contributed to the oxidation of as iii the percentages of mobile as iii in the mbc systems were only 5 8 5 9 and 6 5 at ph 4 7 and 10 respectively indicating powerful as iii oxidation by mbc 100 the improvement in as iii oxidation was mostly attributed to the redox transformation of as iii to as v via mno2 as shown in eqs 1 and 2 note that the higher concentration of mobile as v in the solution at ph 10 compared with that at ph 4 and 7 could be ascribed to the higher as v generation and limited removal capacity under alkaline conditions 3 5 proposed mechanism of oxidation and removal fig 7 a shows ftir spectra of pristine bc fresh mbc 100 and mbc 100 used for as iii v removal clearly pristine bc contains abundant functional groups which can provide reaction or interaction sites on the material surface for the transformation and sorption of arsenic niazi et al 2018b zhong et al 2019 for instance there was a high intensity peak at approximately 3460 cm 1 in the spectra caused by stretching vibrations of oh bonds in hydroxyl groups a spectral band was observed at approximately 1600 cm 1 which was assigned to co and cc bonds two peaks at approximately 1340 and 1150 cm 1 were caused by stretching vibrations of oh and co bonds respectively biswas et al 2017 more interestingly a peak at approximately 575 cm 1 appeared in the spectrum of the mbc 100 sample which validated the formation of mno bonds yuan et al 2016 in addition the peaks at approximately 880 cm 1 in the spectra of mbc 100 used for as iii and as v removal can be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of as o bonds ge et al 2017 fesem eds analysis was performed for mbc 100 used for as iii and as v removal to investigate the distribution and change in the composition of elements i e c o mn and as on the sample surface fig 7b and c as observed in the element mapping the presence of arsenic was relatively uniform on the mbc 100 surface the observation of arsenic on mbc 100 may be due to the formation of as o and as mn bonds manning et al 2002 another possibility is the formation of an as v and mn2 precipitate on the mbc 100 surface tournassat et al 2002 more significantly the eds results for mbc 100 used for as iii removal indicated 64 7 c 30 3 o 4 90 mn and 0 11 as while the results of mbc 100 used for as v removal indicated 50 94 c 37 93 o 10 78 mn and 0 35 as atom notably the mn stoichiometry of mbc 100 used for as iii removal was obviously decreased compared to that of fresh mbc 100 10 06 which is most likely due to the conversion of mno2 to mn ii ions via a redox reaction see eqs 1 and 2 however the mn stoichiometry of mbc 100 used for as v removal and fresh mbc 100 was almost the same suggesting that the occurrence of redox reaction on mbc 100 is insignificant in addition the arsenic stoichiometry of mbc 100 used for as v removal fig 7c was higher than that of mbc 100 used for as iii removal fig 7b this result demonstrated that the removal of as v is preferred over as iii species in accordance with the result in fig 5b to provide insights into the as iii oxidation and removal mechanisms an xps analysis was conducted with three samples of fresh mbc 100 and mbc 100 used for as iii v removal fig 8 shows the high resolution mn 2p3 2 as 3d o 1s and c 1s spectra of these samples the mn 2p3 2 spectra showed four peaks at binding energies of 638 5 639 7 640 8 and 643 5 ev which are assigned to mn ii mn iii mn iv and a satellite respectively si et al 2015 fig 8a notably the area ratio of mn iv and mn iii peaks i mn iv i mn iii of mbc 100 used for as v removal 1 72 see table s4 was almost equal to that of fresh mbc 100 1 73 suggesting that the redox reaction between as iii and mno2 may not have occurred luo et al 2018 moreover the i mn iv i mn iii of mbc 100 used for as iii removal 1 39 was evidently smaller than that of fresh mbc 100 indicating the utilization of mno2 this utilization of mno2 on mbc 100 used for as iii removal is in complete agreement with the eds results it could be suggested that the redox reaction between as iii and mno2 occurred on mbc 100 in addition the percentage of the mn ii peak of mbc 100 used for as iii removal was 9 6 which is higher than that of fresh mbc 100 6 4 and mbc 100 used for as v removal 6 9 this observation is probably due to the precipitation of mn2 and as v and readsorption of mn2 on mbc 100 in the case of as iii removal fig 8b shows the high resolution as 3d spectra and table s5 presents the percentages of components in the spectra of these three samples in the binding energy range from 42 to 47 ev no peaks were observed in fresh mbc 100 it is especially worth mentioning that the two peaks at 43 9 and 44 8 ev of mbc 100 used for as iii removal are assigned to as iii and as v respectively liu et al 2018b the fitted peaks showed that the area percentages of as iii and as v were approximately 18 4 and 81 6 respectively these results demonstrate that as iii was effectively oxidized to as v and that as v was adsorbed on the mbc 100 surface however only a peak at 44 8 ev corresponding to as v was observed for mbc 100 used for as v removal as expected our findings prove that the oxidation of as iii and reduction of mno2 simultaneously occurred for as iii removal by using mbc 100 as mentioned by manning et al the adsorption of as v can be followed by surface complexation mechanisms with a reactive hydroxyl group of mn oh on mno2 according to the following reactions manning et al 2002 4 2 mn o h s h 3 as o 4 aq mno 2 asoo h s 2 h 2 o the removal of as v may be related to the precipitation between as v and produced mn2 tournassat et al 2002 the precipitation reaction can be written as follows 5 m n 2 aq h 2 as o 4 aq h 2 o mnhas o 4 h 2 o s h additionally hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh functional groups on bc may undergo surface arsenic complexation reactions which are represented as follows vithanage et al 2017 6 c i o h s h 3 as o 3 aq c i haso 3 2 s h 2 o 7 c i o h s h 2 aso 4 aq c i haso 4 s 2 h 2 o 8 c i oo h s h 3 as o 3 aq c i haso 3 s 2 h 2 o 9 c i oo h s h 2 aso 4 aq c i haso 4 s 2 h 2 o to elucidate the as iii v removal mechanisms in depth fig 8c and table s5 show the distribution of oxygen functional groups on the three samples i e fresh mbc 100 and mbc 100 used for as iii and as v removal as illustrated the detailed o 1s spectra of the samples had two peaks at 527 7 and 530 2 ev corresponding to bonds between oxygen and manganese mno and between hydroxyl groups and manganese mnoh respectively additionally the area ratio of mn oh to mn o peaks i mn oh i mn o for fresh mbc 100 was 2 06 table s6 after the removal of as iii and as v the i mn oh i mn o values decreased to 1 88 and 1 62 respectively the decreases may be due to the replacement of hydroxyl groups by as iii and as v ions ge et al 2017 moreover the higher decrease in the i mn oh i mn o value after as v removal indicates that the surface interaction of mbc 100 with as v is preferred over that with as iii notably the binding energy of the mn oh peaks of the samples slightly shifted to a lower value after the removal of as iii v this finding was due to the formation of bonds between arsenic and oxygen as o on the mbc 100 surface as presented in eqs 4 and 5 as revealed in fig 8d the c 1s spectra of the three samples can be deconvoluted into three individual components of cc co and co bonds at 281 3 282 6 and 283 3 ev respectively the area percentages of these components are shown in table s7 as shown the area percentages of co and c o on the fresh mbc 100 sample were 55 3 and 27 1 respectively importantly these ratios decreased to 49 4 and 25 9 respectively after oxidation removal of as iii this decrease could possibly be due to surface complexation reactions between carboxyl groups cooh on mbc 100 and as iii v as shown in eqs 6 9 in addition the area percentages of co 48 1 and c o 23 0 in mbc 100 used for as v removal decreased more than those of mbc 100 used for as iii removal these results also provide strong evidence for the higher removal performance for as v than for as iii here it can be confirmed that mbc 100 is capable of as iii v removal by surface complexation with functional groups on the bc substrate i e cooh and oh more importantly as v that is generated through the redox transformation of as iii can be removed by surface complexation with mn oh groups on the mno2 surface and precipitation formation with reduced mn ii 3 6 application of mbc 100 in treating simulated groundwater the arsenic removal performance of mbc 100 was also investigated using simulated groundwater that contained a low arsenic concentration of 100 µg l 1 90 as iii and 10 as v and 90 mg l 1 nacl fig 9 a shows the concentration time relationship of total arsenic in solution the concentration of arsenic dramatically decreased in the first 5 min 77 5 removed and then gradually decreased until 120 min the reason for the fast removal may be attributed to the highly mesoporous structure 85 and large number of active sites of mbc 100 liu et al 2018b most importantly it was observed that an arsenic concentration of approximately 5 4 µg l 1 94 6 removal efficiency was achieved within 120 min satisfying the 10 µg l 1 who guideline for drinking water in addition the concentrations of as iii and as v species in the solution after shaking for 120 min were measured and are shown in fig s8 as v was dominant in the solution with a high rate of approximately 82 4 this result demonstrates that mbc 100 also had a good ability to transform as iii to as v in the case of simulated groundwater during the transformation of as iii mn ii is simultaneously released into solution as a secondary pollutant eq 5 and is not expected to be present at a higher concentration than the standard for drinking water the mn ii concentration was measured in the filtrate in conjunction with arsenic and its concentration time relationship is presented in fig 9b the mn ii concentration continuously increased to approximately 119 µg l 1 after the first 5 min however a decrease in mn ii concentration was observed after 30 min 89 µg l 1 interestingly the mn ii concentration was only 17 µg l 1 in the solution after 120 min satisfying the 50 µg l 1 who guideline for drinking water the decrease in mn ii concentration is ascribed to either the readsorption of mn ii ions on the negatively charged surface of mbc 100 or the formation of precipitation with as v gude et al 2017 table s2 exhibits a comparison of the arsenic removal capacity of mbc 100 with oxide hydroxide modified carbonaceous materials in the literature cope et al 2014 cruz et al 2020 imran et al 2021 lin et al 2017 vitela rodriguez and rangel mendez 2013 xu et al 2020 as shown the fe modified biochar exhibited removal capacities of 1 01 and 1 00 mg g 1 for the removal of as iii and as v respectively xu et al 2020 as demonstrated the arsenic removal capacities of mbc 100 were comparable to that of the other biochar composite materials it should be emphasized that mbc 100 not only achieved high oxidation performance for as iii but also presented efficient removal capacity for as iii v table s3 summaries the possible mechanisms of arsenic removal by mno2 or mno2 modified materials in the literature lenoble et al 2004 manning et al 2002 ouvrard et al 2002 saleh et al 2011 hou et al 2016 nesbitt et al 1998 tournassat et al 2002 zhang and sun 2013 based on the above analysis fig 10 presents the mechanisms involved in as iii oxidation and as iii v removal on mbc in pathway 1 as iii was partially adsorbed on the sample surface pathway 2 occurred by the oxidation of as iii to as v and then the precipitation and adsorption of as v the oxidation of as iii to as v simultaneously occurred with the reduction of mn iv to mn iii and mn ii eqs 1 and 2 as v and mn ii generated by as iii oxidation can form mnhaso4 h2o precipitation on the surface of mbc 100 in addition the generated as v can be removed by the formation of surface complexation with mn oh groups on mno2 functional groups on the bc substrate i e cooh oh can directly adsorb as iii and as v by a surface complexation mechanism 4 conclusions an active mno2 rice husk biochar composite known as mbc was successfully synthesized to enhance the removal of arsenic the improved arsenic removal performance of mbc compared to that of bc is attributed to a higher specific surface area high mesoporosity and existence of mno2 providing a larger number of redox active and sorption sites note that as iii is much more toxic and difficult to eliminate than as v species however the as iii removal capacity of mbc was increased tenfold compared to that of pristine bc this significant enhancement is due to the powerful oxidation of as iii to as v by mno2 coated on mbc and the subsequent adsorption and precipitation of as v onto mbc additionally ph was an important factor that could have influenced the arsenic removal capacity the as iii v removal capacity of mbc under alkaline conditions was clearly lower than those under acidic and neutral conditions due to the negative effects of electrostatic repulsion importantly mbc demonstrated a powerful transformation capability for as iii specifically only 5 9 as iii remained in solution under neutral conditions the as v generated after oxidation was predominantly governed by surface complexation with mn oh on mno2 and the formation of manganese arsenate precipitates with reduced mn ii in addition as iii v removal on mbc can be contributed by surface complexation with functional groups on the bc substrate i e cooh and oh in particular mbc demonstrated an efficient arsenic removal efficiency of 94 6 with simulated groundwater and a concentration of arsenic as low as the 10 µg l 1 who guideline declaration of competing

17415,in the present work an active mno2 rice husk biochar bc composite mbc was prepared to enhance as iii removal for groundwater remediation the mbc material obtained an improved porous structure i e specific surface area pore volume and mesoporosity with mno2 providing abundant reaction or interaction sites for surface or interface related processes such as redox transformation and adsorption of arsenic as a result a significant enhancement in arsenic removal can be achieved by using mbc more specifically mbc showed a high removal capacity for as iii which was tenfold higher than that of bc this improvement can be ascribed to the redox transformation of as iii via mno2 resulting in the more effective removal of as v species in addition ph was an important factor that could influence the as iii removal capacity under alkaline conditions the as iii v removal capacity of mbc was clearly lower than those under acidic and neutral conditions due to the negative effects of electrostatic repulsion importantly a powerful transformation capability of as iii via mbc was presented namely only 5 9 as iii remained in solution under neutral conditions both mno2 and the bc substrate contributed to the removal of arsenic by mbc mno2 delivered mn oh functional groups to generate surface complexes with as v produced by as iii oxidation while the reduced mn ii and as v could precipitate on the mbc surface the bc substrate also provided cooh and oh functional groups for as iii v removal by a surface complexation mechanism note that the application of mbc in the treatment of simulated groundwater demonstrated an efficient arsenic removal of 94 6 and a concentration of arsenic as low as the 10 µg l 1 who guideline keywords engineered biochar redox transformation arsenite oxidation arsenic removal groundwater remediation 1 introduction arsenic is a ubiquitous contaminant with high toxicity and carcinogenicity that can be found in groundwater at high concentrations smedley and kinniburgh 2002 natural arsenic sources related to weathered volcanic rocks sedimentary rocks of marine origin mineral deposits fossil fuels and geothermal areas can contaminate water sources through geological or hydrological processes korte and fernando 1991 artificial arsenic sources may originate from the mining and processing of mineral waste animal feed additives pesticides and arsenic stores nordstrom 2002 arsenic may exist in aqueous solution in two oxidation states arsenate as v and arsenite as iii depending on the environmental conditions e g ph and redox potential eh in groundwater with a ph range of 6 8 5 as iii dominates as the h3aso3 species under reducing conditions low eh values while as v appears as a mixture of the h2aso4 and haso4 2 species under oxidizing conditions high eh values sharma and sohn 2009 note that the as iii species has higher mobility and solubility and much more toxicity than as v zhao et al 2010 arsenic has been observed in aquatic environments in many countries at concentrations ranging from 1 μg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 sarkar and paul 2016 according to guidelines for drinking water quality from the world health organization who the maximum allowable concentration of arsenic in drinking water is 10 ppb smith et al 2002 if the concentration of arsenic in drinking water is higher than 10 μg l 1 there will be many impacts in terms of both physical and psychological harm in particular arsenic entering the body can cause serious diseases including cancer e g skin bladder kidney and lung cancers and perhaps other internal tumors hypertension peripheral vascular disease and diabetes hopenhayn 2006 many methods have been applied to treat arsenic in natural water sources especially groundwater these methods include filtration leupin and hug 2005 ion exchange anirudhan and unnithan 2007 precipitation battaglia brunet et al 2012 adsorption pintor et al 2018 membrane separation zheng et al 2011 reverse osmosis abejón et al 2015 and capacitive deionization fan et al 2017 among these technologies adsorption is regarded as one of the simplest to operate and most cost effective techniques for arsenic removal ali and gupta 2006 unfortunately many previous studies of adsorption processes have indicated that the removal efficiency of as iii is significantly lower than that of as v aryal et al 2010 ge et al 2017 liu et al 2018b to improve the removal efficiency of as iii many studies have focused on the conversion of as iii to as v based on preoxidation processes involving oxidizing substances such as zero valent iron ramos et al 2009 fe iii oxides greenleaf et al 2003 titanium dioxide bissen et al 2001 hydrogen peroxide voegelin and hug 2003 and fe mn binary oxides lou et al 2017 the utilization of mno2 has also shown effectiveness in various environmental applications e g as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction xiao et al 2010 to improve methyl blue adsorption chen et al 2013 and to enhance desalination performance liu et al 2018a notably manganese dioxide mno2 is an environmentally friendly oxidizing agent with a high redox potential of e0 mno2 mn2 1 224 v and e0 mn3 mn2 1 542 v hou et al 2016 mno2 possesses the ability to efficiently and quickly oxidize as iii to as v which is considered an important step in reducing arsenic toxicity and facilitating arsenic fixation gude et al 2017 hou et al 2017a hou et al 2017b li et al 2010 oscarson et al 1981 the initial redox reaction between as iii and mno2 rapidly occurs via the following reactions tournassat et al 2002 1 2 m n iv o 2 h 3 as o 3 h 2 o 2 m n iii ooh h 2 aso 4 h 2 2 m n iii ooh h 3 as o 3 3 h 2 m n 2 h 2 aso 4 3 h 2 o subsequently mno2 can act as a potential adsorbent to remove as v by surface complexation of as v on mno2 surfaces manning et al 2002 electrostatic retention and ion exchange lenoble et al 2004 saleh et al 2011 additionally the removal of as v has been reported by tournassat et al in which manganese arsenate mnhaso4 h2o precipitated on the surface of mno2 tournassat et al 2002 unfortunately the formation of mnhaso4 h2o precipitation on pure mno2 may reduce the effective surface area as well as the active site of mno2 saleh et al 2011 in recent years waste biomass adsorbents have also attracted much attention in the adsorption of as iii v providing a cost effective and eco friendly solution asere et al 2019 vithanage et al 2017 several types of biochar derived from waste biomass have been used to adsorb as iii v such as oak wood niazi et al 2018b perennial grass saikia et al 2017 tectona and lagerstroemia speciose verma and singh 2019 perilla leaf niazi et al 2018a and rice husk agrafioti et al 2014 significantly rice husk is an agricultural waste biomass that is a byproduct of the milling industry and is currently becoming highly attractive owing to its broad usefulness and potential in water treatment rice husk is also the most appropriate representative of economical and widely available biomass waste cuong et al 2019 cuong et al 2020 moayedi et al 2019 in addition rice husk biochar contains abundant functional groups e g carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh which play important roles in the complexation mechanism for arsenic sorption li et al 2017 more specifically zhong et al mentioned that the redox active moieties i e phenolic oh quinoid co and semiquinone type persistent free radicals on rice husk biochar can contribute to the oxidation of as iii zhong et al 2019 however pristine biochar may have a limited adsorption capacity especially for the removal of highly mobile as iii due to its poor porous nature and low activity therefore biochar needs an amendment e g oxide hydroxide coating of fe cope et al 2014 al zhang and gao 2013 or fe mn lin et al 2017 to be an effective as adsorbent a promising solution is the synthesis of an engineered mno2 biochar composite material that can enhance the textural porosity surface chemistry and adsorptive properties of pristine biochar note that the biochar surface can provide more attachable sites for mnhaso4 h2o precipitation thereby avoiding the reduction of active sites on mno2 for as iii oxidation saleh et al 2011 liang s group indicated that swine manure derived biochar modified with mno2 significantly improved the adsorption performance of pb and cd liang et al 2017 grape stalk derived biochar supported mn oxide was prepared by trakal et al and exhibited excellent removal efficiencies of almost 99 91 and 51 for pb as and cd respectively trakal et al 2018 wu et al prepared mno2 rice husk biochar composites with enhanced adsorption capacities for cd ii and pb ii of 4 2 and 5 5 times compared to pristine biochar respectively wu et al 2020 however the mechanisms of as iii oxidation and as iii v removal by mno2 modified biochar remain poorly understood the purpose of this study was to decorate an engineered biochar substrate with mno2 to create a composite material for groundwater remediation specifically the mno2 biochar composite should have improved porosity and surface chemistry properties enhancing as iii oxidation and removal accordingly a mno2 biochar composite was synthesized by an in situ chemical precipitation method by controlling the mass ratio of mno2 batch adsorption experiments i e analysis of ph effects concentration effects and concentration time relationships were performed to obtain insight into the as iii oxidation and as iii v removal mechanisms by the mno2 biochar composite from aqueous solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of mno2 biochar composite rice husk biochar bc was purchased from mu en farm xinshi dist tainan city taiwan it was prepared by the pyrolysis method under a nitrogen atmosphere at 700 c for 8 h the fabrication of the mno2 biochar composite mbc was performed according to fig s1 mbc was synthesized by an in situ chemical precipitation method accordingly 2 g bc with sizes ranging from 60 to 120 mesh was submerged in 100 ml of 50 100 or 150 mm manganese ii acetate tetrahydrate 99 99 sigma aldrich solution and then ultrasonically vibrated for 30 min subsequently 100 ml of kmno4 99 jt baker solution with stoichiometry was gradually added under continuous stirring the brown suspension was stirred at 700 rpm and 80 c for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature after that the suspension was filtered washed with di water several times and dried at 80 c for 36 h the dried products were ground to pass through a 120 mesh and preserved in the desiccator before use the mbc samples were obtained and denoted as mbc x where x mm is the concentration of the mn ii acetate tetrahydrate solution 2 2 material characterizations the thermal

the manganese concentration was determined using an atomic absorption spectroscopy aas instrument aanalyst 800 perkinelmer germany the arsenic concentration was measured by a high pressure liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icpms lc 1200 and icp ms 7700x agilent technologies system the zeta potential of the samples was measured by a 90 plus particle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern panalytical ltd uk 2 3 batch experiment settings as iii oxidation and as iii v removal on the bc and mbc 100 samples were investigated by the batch equilibrium method concentration effect studies were performed with a 1 5 or 10 mg l 1 as iii or as v solution at ph 7 0 1 the effects of ph on oxidation and removal were investigated with a 10 mg l 1 arsenic solution at different ph values of 4 7 or 10 0 1 corresponding to acidic neutral or basic conditions respectively accordingly approximately 0 06 g of adsorbent was placed in a 30 ml solution of as iii naaso2 90 sigma aldrich or as v as2o5 97 sigma aldrich in a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube the ph of the solutions was adjusted with 0 01 m naoh 97 nacalai tesque and 0 01 m hcl 35 nacalai tesque the as iii and as v containing suspensions were shaken at 150 rpm at 25 c for 120 min the filtrate was collected using a 0 45 µm filter before measuring the concentrations the equilibrium removal capacities q e mg g 1 of arsenic adsorbed on the adsorbents were calculated according to eq 3 3 q e v c 0 c e w where v l is the volume of the solution c 0 and c e mg l 1 are the initial and equilibrium adsorbate concentrations in solution respectively and w g is the weight of the adsorbent moreover the arsenic removal performance of mbc 100 was investigated using simulated groundwater with low arsenic concentration typically 0 06 g mbc 100 was added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing a 30 ml solution of 100 µg l 1 as 90 as iii and 10 as v and 90 mg l 1 nacl 99 sigma aldrich the ph was not adjusted and the measured value was 5 68 the concentration time relationships of elements i e arsenic and manganese in the final solution were determined at time intervals from 1 to 120 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of bc and mbc n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the bc mbc and mno2 samples are shown in fig 1 a and s2 obvious hysteresis loops were observed between the adsorption and desorption curves at approximately p p 0 0 4 1 which indicated the presence of a mesoporous structure sing et al 1985 additionally fig 1b presents pore size distribution plots of bc and mbc 100 the broad distribution of mesopores in the range of 2 6 14 7 nm of the mbc 100 sample suggested that it is a mesoporous material li et al 2016 moreover the porosity properties of the bc and mbc samples are shown in table 1 it was seen that the porosity of bc after modification with mno2 improved with increases in the concentration of reactants for the mbc 50 mbc 100 and mbc 150 samples the specific surface areas were 51 5 71 0 and 122 3 m2 g 1 and the total pore volumes were 0 05 0 11 and 0 25 cm3 g 1 respectively additionally the mesoporosity of the mbc samples increased with increasing mn ii concentration mbc 50 mbc 100 and mbc 150 had mesoporosity ratios of 68 85 and 96 respectively the development of mesopores on the mbcs is attributed to the mno2 coating with an ultrahigh mesoporosity of 97 see table s1 these observations demonstrated the successful synthesis of mbc with an enhanced specific surface area pore volume and mesoporosity such enhancement can provide a large number of reaction or interaction sites for surface or interface related processes such as redox transformation and adsorption of arsenic fig 1c d and s3 show the tga differential thermogravimetry dtg spectra of the pristine bc and mbc samples as seen two stages of weight loss occurred in the pyrolysis process of pristine bc from 50 to 900 c in the first stage the weight of the pristine bc was reduced by 3 85 between 50 and 400 c which is related to the loss of water and volatile organic components inside its porous structure a higher weight loss of 68 95 was observed in the range of 400 700 c due to the gasification of the carbon matrix the residual mass of the bc approximately 27 20 indicates the presence of silica compounds inside the rice husk because the reaction between silica and oxygen can only occur at temperatures over 2000 c moreover the weight losses of mbc 50 mbc 100 and mbc 150 in the first stage were 5 75 6 00 and 7 75 respectively the increase in the weight loss of the mbc samples indicated the development of a porous structure in accordance with the results of n2 adsorption desorption analysis the residual masses of mbc 50 mbc 100 and mbc 150 were 36 37 41 38 and 51 69 respectively which are attributed to the total mass of silica and manganese these results confirm that the different mass ratios of mno2 are controlled on the mbc samples figs 2 and s4 present the morphological characteristics of the bc mbc 50 mbc 100 and mbc 150 samples the surface morphology of the bc sample was comparatively solid fig 2a while that of the mbc 100 sample was very rough with small particles fig 2b these results provided obvious evidence that mno2 formed on the mbc as illustrated the surface area covered by mno2 particles on the mbc samples became larger with an increased concentration of reactants i e mn ii and kmno4 note that the substrate surface of mbc 150 was mostly coated with mno2 therefore mbc 100 was selected to further investigate arsenic removal by mno2 and the bc substrate of mbc 100 the crystal structure of the bc and mbc 100 samples was determined by xrd as shown in fig 3 as observed the xrd pattern of bc had two typical diffraction peaks at 2θ 23 0 and 43 0 corresponding to the 002 and 110 crystal planes of graphite respectively which are consistent with most pyrolytic carbons stephan et al 2006 the intensity of the diffraction peaks for mbc 100 decreased compared to that for bc suggesting the uniform coverage of mno2 most notably in the xrd pattern of mbc 100 the peaks at 2θ 22 0 36 8 and 42 0 can be easily identified corresponding to the 101 210 and 211 planes respectively of the γ mno2 crystalline structure jcpds file no 44 0142 li et al 2018 3 2 effect of concentration on as iii v removal the effect of the initial concentration on the removal capacity of arsenic was investigated for pristine bc and mbc 100 at ph 7 as shown in fig 4 the removal capacity of as v increased with increasing initial arsenic concentration this observation may be due to the higher concentration gradient for ion transport resulting in more contact between arsenic ions and the material surface lutzenkirchen 2006 notably the removal capacity of as iii v on mbc 100 was clearly greater than that on bc for the 10 mg l 1 arsenic solution the as iii and as v removal capacities of mbc 100 were 1 88 and 2 16 mg g 1 which were much higher than those of bc with 0 14 and 0 42 mg g 1 respectively the improved arsenic removal by mbc 100 was attributed to the higher porosity i e specific surface area and mesoporosity and the existence of mno2 more specifically the removal capacity of as iii by mbc 100 was improved 13 4 times compared to that of bc the improvement of as v removal capacity after modification with mno2 was only 5 1 times the greater enhancement of as iii removal capacity by mbc 100 could be attributed to the redox transformation of as iii to as v by mno2 on mbc 100 3 3 effect of ph on the removal of as iii v fig 5 presents the removal capacity of as iii v by the pristine bc and mbc 100 samples at ph 4 7 and 10 the as iii v removal capacities of both samples were highest at ph 4 and lowest at ph 10 notably the as v removal capacities of the samples decreased at both ph 7 and ph 10 however an obvious decrease in the as iii removal capacities was only observed at ph 10 these observations may be related to electrostatic repulsion between arsenic ions and the charged material surfaces to elucidate this phenomenon in depth fig s5 shows the zeta potential ph curves for the samples and fig s6 presents the eh ph diagram of arsenic as illustrated the bc and mbc samples had negative zeta potentials in the ph range from 2 to 10 and the zeta potentials became more negative as the ph increased in this ph range fig s5 notably as v was always present in anionic forms h2aso4 ph 7 and haso4 2 ph 7 fig s6 this characteristic indicates that if the ph increased the electrostatic repulsion between as v ions and the negatively charged surface of the samples would increase resulting in reduced removal performance on the other hand the dominant forms of as iii are nonionic h3aso3 species ph 9 1 and anionic h2aso3 species ph 9 1 fig s6 the existence of nonionic h3aso3 species at both ph 4 and ph 7 results in no effects related to electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged surface of bc and mbc 100 this relationship explains why the as iii removal capacity remained relatively constant at ph 7 compared to that at ph 4 furthermore the anionic h2aso3 species that appeared at ph 10 formed electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged surface of the samples this interaction caused a decrease in the as iii removal capacity at ph 10 in addition the higher zeta potential value of mbc 100 compared to bc fig s5 reflects the lower electrostatic repulsion between charged arsenic species and material surfaces which contributes to the enhanced arsenic removal performance of mbc 100 3 4 ph dependence of as iii oxidation in this study the oxidation of as iii to as v by bc and mbc 100 was further investigated in detail these experiments were conducted with a 10 mg l 1 as iii solution under varying ph values of 4 7 and 10 fig 6 presents the concentrations of arsenic species i e mobile as iii and as v in solution and adsorbed as in these experiments after shaking within 120 min for as iii removal by bc mobile as iii predominated over mobile as v at all ph values for instance the bc system at ph 7 contained 79 3 mobile as iii 5 8 mobile as v and 14 9 adsorbed as in addition the highest as v generation was found at ph 10 our observations are in accordance with the previous result reported by zhong et al 2019 reflecting the ph dependence of as iii oxidation by biochar in contrast mbc 100 significantly contributed to the oxidation of as iii the percentages of mobile as iii in the mbc systems were only 5 8 5 9 and 6 5 at ph 4 7 and 10 respectively indicating powerful as iii oxidation by mbc 100 the improvement in as iii oxidation was mostly attributed to the redox transformation of as iii to as v via mno2 as shown in eqs 1 and 2 note that the higher concentration of mobile as v in the solution at ph 10 compared with that at ph 4 and 7 could be ascribed to the higher as v generation and limited removal capacity under alkaline conditions 3 5 proposed mechanism of oxidation and removal fig 7 a shows ftir spectra of pristine bc fresh mbc 100 and mbc 100 used for as iii v removal clearly pristine bc contains abundant functional groups which can provide reaction or interaction sites on the material surface for the transformation and sorption of arsenic niazi et al 2018b zhong et al 2019 for instance there was a high intensity peak at approximately 3460 cm 1 in the spectra caused by stretching vibrations of oh bonds in hydroxyl groups a spectral band was observed at approximately 1600 cm 1 which was assigned to co and cc bonds two peaks at approximately 1340 and 1150 cm 1 were caused by stretching vibrations of oh and co bonds respectively biswas et al 2017 more interestingly a peak at approximately 575 cm 1 appeared in the spectrum of the mbc 100 sample which validated the formation of mno bonds yuan et al 2016 in addition the peaks at approximately 880 cm 1 in the spectra of mbc 100 used for as iii and as v removal can be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of as o bonds ge et al 2017 fesem eds analysis was performed for mbc 100 used for as iii and as v removal to investigate the distribution and change in the composition of elements i e c o mn and as on the sample surface fig 7b and c as observed in the element mapping the presence of arsenic was relatively uniform on the mbc 100 surface the observation of arsenic on mbc 100 may be due to the formation of as o and as mn bonds manning et al 2002 another possibility is the formation of an as v and mn2 precipitate on the mbc 100 surface tournassat et al 2002 more significantly the eds results for mbc 100 used for as iii removal indicated 64 7 c 30 3 o 4 90 mn and 0 11 as while the results of mbc 100 used for as v removal indicated 50 94 c 37 93 o 10 78 mn and 0 35 as atom notably the mn stoichiometry of mbc 100 used for as iii removal was obviously decreased compared to that of fresh mbc 100 10 06 which is most likely due to the conversion of mno2 to mn ii ions via a redox reaction see eqs 1 and 2 however the mn stoichiometry of mbc 100 used for as v removal and fresh mbc 100 was almost the same suggesting that the occurrence of redox reaction on mbc 100 is insignificant in addition the arsenic stoichiometry of mbc 100 used for as v removal fig 7c was higher than that of mbc 100 used for as iii removal fig 7b this result demonstrated that the removal of as v is preferred over as iii species in accordance with the result in fig 5b to provide insights into the as iii oxidation and removal mechanisms an xps analysis was conducted with three samples of fresh mbc 100 and mbc 100 used for as iii v removal fig 8 shows the high resolution mn 2p3 2 as 3d o 1s and c 1s spectra of these samples the mn 2p3 2 spectra showed four peaks at binding energies of 638 5 639 7 640 8 and 643 5 ev which are assigned to mn ii mn iii mn iv and a satellite respectively si et al 2015 fig 8a notably the area ratio of mn iv and mn iii peaks i mn iv i mn iii of mbc 100 used for as v removal 1 72 see table s4 was almost equal to that of fresh mbc 100 1 73 suggesting that the redox reaction between as iii and mno2 may not have occurred luo et al 2018 moreover the i mn iv i mn iii of mbc 100 used for as iii removal 1 39 was evidently smaller than that of fresh mbc 100 indicating the utilization of mno2 this utilization of mno2 on mbc 100 used for as iii removal is in complete agreement with the eds results it could be suggested that the redox reaction between as iii and mno2 occurred on mbc 100 in addition the percentage of the mn ii peak of mbc 100 used for as iii removal was 9 6 which is higher than that of fresh mbc 100 6 4 and mbc 100 used for as v removal 6 9 this observation is probably due to the precipitation of mn2 and as v and readsorption of mn2 on mbc 100 in the case of as iii removal fig 8b shows the high resolution as 3d spectra and table s5 presents the percentages of components in the spectra of these three samples in the binding energy range from 42 to 47 ev no peaks were observed in fresh mbc 100 it is especially worth mentioning that the two peaks at 43 9 and 44 8 ev of mbc 100 used for as iii removal are assigned to as iii and as v respectively liu et al 2018b the fitted peaks showed that the area percentages of as iii and as v were approximately 18 4 and 81 6 respectively these results demonstrate that as iii was effectively oxidized to as v and that as v was adsorbed on the mbc 100 surface however only a peak at 44 8 ev corresponding to as v was observed for mbc 100 used for as v removal as expected our findings prove that the oxidation of as iii and reduction of mno2 simultaneously occurred for as iii removal by using mbc 100 as mentioned by manning et al the adsorption of as v can be followed by surface complexation mechanisms with a reactive hydroxyl group of mn oh on mno2 according to the following reactions manning et al 2002 4 2 mn o h s h 3 as o 4 aq mno 2 asoo h s 2 h 2 o the removal of as v may be related to the precipitation between as v and produced mn2 tournassat et al 2002 the precipitation reaction can be written as follows 5 m n 2 aq h 2 as o 4 aq h 2 o mnhas o 4 h 2 o s h additionally hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh functional groups on bc may undergo surface arsenic complexation reactions which are represented as follows vithanage et al 2017 6 c i o h s h 3 as o 3 aq c i haso 3 2 s h 2 o 7 c i o h s h 2 aso 4 aq c i haso 4 s 2 h 2 o 8 c i oo h s h 3 as o 3 aq c i haso 3 s 2 h 2 o 9 c i oo h s h 2 aso 4 aq c i haso 4 s 2 h 2 o to elucidate the as iii v removal mechanisms in depth fig 8c and table s5 show the distribution of oxygen functional groups on the three samples i e fresh mbc 100 and mbc 100 used for as iii and as v removal as illustrated the detailed o 1s spectra of the samples had two peaks at 527 7 and 530 2 ev corresponding to bonds between oxygen and manganese mno and between hydroxyl groups and manganese mnoh respectively additionally the area ratio of mn oh to mn o peaks i mn oh i mn o for fresh mbc 100 was 2 06 table s6 after the removal of as iii and as v the i mn oh i mn o values decreased to 1 88 and 1 62 respectively the decreases may be due to the replacement of hydroxyl groups by as iii and as v ions ge et al 2017 moreover the higher decrease in the i mn oh i mn o value after as v removal indicates that the surface interaction of mbc 100 with as v is preferred over that with as iii notably the binding energy of the mn oh peaks of the samples slightly shifted to a lower value after the removal of as iii v this finding was due to the formation of bonds between arsenic and oxygen as o on the mbc 100 surface as presented in eqs 4 and 5 as revealed in fig 8d the c 1s spectra of the three samples can be deconvoluted into three individual components of cc co and co bonds at 281 3 282 6 and 283 3 ev respectively the area percentages of these components are shown in table s7 as shown the area percentages of co and c o on the fresh mbc 100 sample were 55 3 and 27 1 respectively importantly these ratios decreased to 49 4 and 25 9 respectively after oxidation removal of as iii this decrease could possibly be due to surface complexation reactions between carboxyl groups cooh on mbc 100 and as iii v as shown in eqs 6 9 in addition the area percentages of co 48 1 and c o 23 0 in mbc 100 used for as v removal decreased more than those of mbc 100 used for as iii removal these results also provide strong evidence for the higher removal performance for as v than for as iii here it can be confirmed that mbc 100 is capable of as iii v removal by surface complexation with functional groups on the bc substrate i e cooh and oh more importantly as v that is generated through the redox transformation of as iii can be removed by surface complexation with mn oh groups on the mno2 surface and precipitation formation with reduced mn ii 3 6 application of mbc 100 in treating simulated groundwater the arsenic removal performance of mbc 100 was also investigated using simulated groundwater that contained a low arsenic concentration of 100 µg l 1 90 as iii and 10 as v and 90 mg l 1 nacl fig 9 a shows the concentration time relationship of total arsenic in solution the concentration of arsenic dramatically decreased in the first 5 min 77 5 removed and then gradually decreased until 120 min the reason for the fast removal may be attributed to the highly mesoporous structure 85 and large number of active sites of mbc 100 liu et al 2018b most importantly it was observed that an arsenic concentration of approximately 5 4 µg l 1 94 6 removal efficiency was achieved within 120 min satisfying the 10 µg l 1 who guideline for drinking water in addition the concentrations of as iii and as v species in the solution after shaking for 120 min were measured and are shown in fig s8 as v was dominant in the solution with a high rate of approximately 82 4 this result demonstrates that mbc 100 also had a good ability to transform as iii to as v in the case of simulated groundwater during the transformation of as iii mn ii is simultaneously released into solution as a secondary pollutant eq 5 and is not expected to be present at a higher concentration than the standard for drinking water the mn ii concentration was measured in the filtrate in conjunction with arsenic and its concentration time relationship is presented in fig 9b the mn ii concentration continuously increased to approximately 119 µg l 1 after the first 5 min however a decrease in mn ii concentration was observed after 30 min 89 µg l 1 interestingly the mn ii concentration was only 17 µg l 1 in the solution after 120 min satisfying the 50 µg l 1 who guideline for drinking water the decrease in mn ii concentration is ascribed to either the readsorption of mn ii ions on the negatively charged surface of mbc 100 or the formation of precipitation with as v gude et al 2017 table s2 exhibits a comparison of the arsenic removal capacity of mbc 100 with oxide hydroxide modified carbonaceous materials in the literature cope et al 2014 cruz et al 2020 imran et al 2021 lin et al 2017 vitela rodriguez and rangel mendez 2013 xu et al 2020 as shown the fe modified biochar exhibited removal capacities of 1 01 and 1 00 mg g 1 for the removal of as iii and as v respectively xu et al 2020 as demonstrated the arsenic removal capacities of mbc 100 were comparable to that of the other biochar composite materials it should be emphasized that mbc 100 not only achieved high oxidation performance for as iii but also presented efficient removal capacity for as iii v table s3 summaries the possible mechanisms of arsenic removal by mno2 or mno2 modified materials in the literature lenoble et al 2004 manning et al 2002 ouvrard et al 2002 saleh et al 2011 hou et al 2016 nesbitt et al 1998 tournassat et al 2002 zhang and sun 2013 based on the above analysis fig 10 presents the mechanisms involved in as iii oxidation and as iii v removal on mbc in pathway 1 as iii was partially adsorbed on the sample surface pathway 2 occurred by the oxidation of as iii to as v and then the precipitation and adsorption of as v the oxidation of as iii to as v simultaneously occurred with the reduction of mn iv to mn iii and mn ii eqs 1 and 2 as v and mn ii generated by as iii oxidation can form mnhaso4 h2o precipitation on the surface of mbc 100 in addition the generated as v can be removed by the formation of surface complexation with mn oh groups on mno2 functional groups on the bc substrate i e cooh oh can directly adsorb as iii and as v by a surface complexation mechanism 4 conclusions an active mno2 rice husk biochar composite known as mbc was successfully synthesized to enhance the removal of arsenic the improved arsenic removal performance of mbc compared to that of bc is attributed to a higher specific surface area high mesoporosity and existence of mno2 providing a larger number of redox active and sorption sites note that as iii is much more toxic and difficult to eliminate than as v species however the as iii removal capacity of mbc was increased tenfold compared to that of pristine bc this significant enhancement is due to the powerful oxidation of as iii to as v by mno2 coated on mbc and the subsequent adsorption and precipitation of as v onto mbc additionally ph was an important factor that could have influenced the arsenic removal capacity the as iii v removal capacity of mbc under alkaline conditions was clearly lower than those under acidic and neutral conditions due to the negative effects of electrostatic repulsion importantly mbc demonstrated a powerful transformation capability for as iii specifically only 5 9 as iii remained in solution under neutral conditions the as v generated after oxidation was predominantly governed by surface complexation with mn oh on mno2 and the formation of manganese arsenate precipitates with reduced mn ii in addition as iii v removal on mbc can be contributed by surface complexation with functional groups on the bc substrate i e cooh and oh in particular mbc demonstrated an efficient arsenic removal efficiency of 94 6 with simulated groundwater and a concentration of arsenic as low as the 10 µg l 1 who guideline declaration of competing

17416,the biggest challenge to apply anammox to treat wastewater with elevated salt content is the inhibitory effect of salinity on freshwater anammox bacteria fab most of the research into salinity inhibition has focused on the osmotic pressure effect while the inhibitory effect and its mechanisms induced by ion composition are poorly understood in this study the individual and combined effect of nacl kcl and na2so4 on fab 99 belonging to ca brocadia genera were systematically investigated by batch tests the corresponding responses of mrna abundance of three functional genes including nitrite reductase gene nirs hydrazine synthase gene hzsb and hydrazine dehydrogenase gene hdh under different salt conditions were analyzed the results indicated that nacl kcl and na2so4 have different inhibition effects with the 50 inhibition at 0 106 0 096 and 0 063 m respectively the combined inhibition of nacl kcl and nacl na2so4 on fab were both synergistic while the combined inhibition of nacl kcl na2so4 was additive the responses of mrna of genes nirs hzsb and hdh suggested nacl inhibited the transport of ammonium na2so4 inhibited both nitrite and ammonium transport high salinity inhibited functional enzyme activity these results suggest both ionic stress and ion composition contributed to the observed inhibition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

wastewaters from regions using seawater toilet flushing and wastewaters from food processing industries meat canning plant pickle vegetables plant dairy products plants fish processing plants etc tanneries and the petroleum industry produced water and refining process wastewater summarized in table 1 it can be seen that the salt content and composition vary widely among different industries or different processes of the same industry anammox based process is a carbon and energy efficient wastewater treatment process for biological nitrogen removal due to the extremely low doubling time of marine anammox culture genus of ca scalindua awata et al 2015 directly acclimating freshwater anammox bacteria fab to treat saline wastewater is the most adopted method among the five fab genera namely ca anammoxoglobus ca anammoximicrobium ca brocadia ca jettenia and ca kuenenia ca brocadia is one of the most commonly reported dominant fab genera in full scale wastewater treatment plants suto et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the biggest challenge to achieve saline wastewater treatment by fab is the inhibitory effect of salinity giustinianovich et al 2018 liu et al 2009 salinity inhibition presents in two ways by osmosis as the cells lose free water wang et al 2016a and by ionic stress linked to the accumulation of ions which become toxic at high concentrations lefevre et al 2001 most of the research into salinity inhibition has focused on the former aspect the osmotic pressure effect mainly salt ions of na and cl however as noted above wastewater especially industrial wastewater is complex and contains a range of both cations e g na k ca2 mg2 and anions e g cl so4 2 po4 3 no3 table 1 among them na k ca2 mg2 are essential for the growth of microorganisms murray and zinder 1985 and ca2 is beneficial for the formation of microbial aggregates huang and pinder 1995 yu et al 2001 it has been reported that increasing k concentration in saline wastewater mainly nacl would improve the performance of a biological reactor jin et al 2007 li et al 2018 hence at low concentration 0 01 m these cations show positive effect on microorganism activity but elevated concentrations 0 1 m do cause inhibition the common cations affect biological activity differently with toxicity increases in the order na or k ca2 mg2 al3 deorsola et al 2013 kugelman and mccarty 1965 li et al 2017 romero guiza et al 2016 the understanding of inhibitory effect of the common anions is less clear but generally cl is the most benign anion campos et al 2002 wang et al 2016a yan et al 2010 elevated salt concentration results in inhibition however the inhibitory mechanisms induced by the various cations and anions are poorly understood regarding fab only a few researchers have considered the effect of different salt types and none has considered the combined effect of different salt types namely ion composition effect chen et al 2014 dapena mora et al 2007 to achieve application of anammox at wastewater treatment plants that receive some saline wastewaters it is essential to understand the fab performance and possible inhibition mechanisms under different salinity condition different salt ion type and ion composition to guide the engineering operation and shorten the start up period hence this study aims to investigate the inhibitory effect of ionic stress and ion composition focusing on the four most common types of ions na k cl and so4 2 on fab both the individual effect and the combined effect of nacl kcl and na2so4 were studied through systematically designed experiments the results are analyzed using typical inhibition models the responses of mrna of three functional genes nitrite reductase gene nirs hydrazine synthase gene hzsb and hydrazine dehydrogenase gene hdh were also analysed to elucidate the inhibition mechanisms under the various salinity conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and the parent reactor a 1 2 l semi continuous reactor was set up and operated in this study the fab 99 belonging to one unidentified species ca brocadia sp grew on k5 carriers from anoxkaldnes sweden shown at fig s1 in the semi continuous reactor which was seeded from a 1500 l pilot scale one stage pn anammox moving bed bioreactor in luggage point wwtp urban utilities brisbane queensland australia the semi continuous reactor was fed with the effluent of a pilot scale side stream pn reactor receiving real anaerobic digestion liquor in luggage point wwtp additional nano2 and nh4hco3 were occasionally added to maintain the nitrite and ammonium concentrations at about 520 mg n l and 400 mg n l respectively the 1 2 l parent reactor was fed with 100 ml influent every 2 hours resulting in 12 cycles of feeing per day 1 day hydraulic retention time the reactor was operated at steady state for more than 3 months with anammox activity aa of 1 5 2 0 g nh4 n l d the ratios of removed nitrite no2 n to removed ammonium nh4 n and produced nitrate no3 n to removed ammonium nh4 n were 1 35 0 06 and 0 32 0 1 respectively 2 2 batch experiment serum bottles with 60 ml of working volume were used to conduct the batch tests in all assays the effluent of the parent mbbr was collected as inoculum media with an initial electrical conductivity of 4 2 ms cm equivalent to about 2 5 g nacl l more details are shown in table s1 which had been pre filtered with 0 42µm filters and deoxygenated by sparging with pure nitrogen gas six sets of batch tests including 122 assays were conducted under six different salt conditions individual salt condition nacl kcl and na2so4 combined salt condition nacl kcl nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 according to the experimental design stock solutions including nacl kcl and na2so4 all 40 g l made from inoculum media were used individually or in combination to achieve 0 20 g l salt addition total salinity between 2 5 to 22 5 g l details were shown at table s2 at each set of experiment one reactor was always used as a blank control without salt addition and the rest were used as experimental reactors the anammox activities under different salt conditions were represented as percentages of the values measured in the control the ph in each reactor was adjusted and kept within the range of 7 2 7 4 by adding hepes 10 mm during the 24 h anaerobic tests the medium was deoxygenated again after which one biomass carrier was put into the batch reactor the reactor was then sealed with the rubber lid and alumina cap immediately then the nitrite nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and inorganic carbon were provided by adding nano2 solution 2 g n l and nh4hco3 2 g n l respectively to avoid substrate inhibition the initial concentrations of nitrite and ammonium were fixed at 110 130 mg n l and 100 120 mg n l respectively at the beginning of each test the liquid volume including all the medium mentioned above was 40 ml which resulted in a gas phase volume of 20 ml in each reactor the batch reactors were placed in a shaking incubator premiere thz 82 china at 35 1 c and 100 10 rpm for 24 h the gas pressure of each reactor was tested at time 0 2 4 6 9 12 24 h by using a gas pressure meter liquid samples were taken at time 0 and 6 h for the analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the volatile solids vs on each carrier in the reactors were measured at the end of batch test 2 3 methods for determination of anammox activity and chemical analysis 2 3 1 anammox activity in general anammox metabolism can be described by eq 1 strous et al 1998 anammox activity aa can be described according to i the n2 production ii ammonium consumption and iii nitrite consumption to simplify here the aa based on ammonium consumption of the first 6 h reaction g nh4 n g vs day was used to describe anammox activity and was calculated by eq 2 1 n h 4 1 32 n o 2 0 066 hc o 3 0 13 h 1 02 n 2 0 26 n o 3 0 066 c h 2 o 0 5 n 0 15 2 03 h 2 o 2 aa δ c n h 4 v l v s δ t where δc nh4 represents the consumption of ammonium g n l vl is the volume of the liquid phase in the batch reactor 0 04 l δt is the reaction time 6 h vs is the volatile solids content g relative anammox activity raa was introduced to eliminate the variability of biomass on different experimental days and was calculated by eq 3 3 r a a a a i a a 0 100 where aai g nh4 n g vs day is the aa of each experimental test and aa0 g nh4 n g vs day is the aa of the blank control 2 3 2 chemical analysis the ammonium nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n and orthophosphate po4 3 p concentrations were analyzed using a lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin after each batch test the biomass attached to each carrier was dried at 105 c for 24 h and peeled from the carrier then ts and vs were analyzed by the standard methods apha 1995 in addition the increasing osmotic pressure associated with the salinity addition of nacl kcl and na2so4 individually or in combination was evaluated by the lenntech osmotic pressure calculator 2 4 inhibition model 2 4 1 individual inhibition hill model most early studies suggested that salinity inhibition of biological activity including cod removal nitrification and denitrification processes could be well described by a non competitive inhibition model ghassemi et al 1995 lee and lin 2006 to describe the inhibitory effect of salinity more effectively claros et al 2010 a modified hill function non competitive inhibition model simply referred to as a hill model was adopted in this paper as there was no substrate shortage under all experimental conditions within first 6 h reaction time the hill model can be presented as eq 4 4 r a a r a a max k i n k i n i n where raamax is the maximum relative anammox activity equal to 100 which is the blank control test i represents the concentration of salts m ki is the inhibition constant m and is equal to the value of ic50 the salt concentration that caused 50 inhibition on aa 2 4 2 assessment of combined inhibition the combined inhibition toxicities include four main types 1 independent inhibition 2 additive inhibition 3 synergistic inhibition and 4 antagonistic inhibition ding et al 2015 independent inhibition is based on the assumption that the two or more inhibitors affect activity by different inhibitory mechanisms cedergreen 2014 additive inhibition is based on the assumption that two or more inhibitors affect activity by a similar inhibitory mechanism bliss 1939 and generally provides a higher predicted inhibition than the independent inhibition model belden et al 2007 synergistic inhibition also called potentiated inhibition or cocktail effects means the mix effect of two inhibitors or more is greater than the additive effect antagonistic inhibition refers to the mix effect of two inhibitors or more being less than the predicted value assuming additive inhibition or independent inhibition heys et al 2016 the main assessment method for combined toxicities include toxic unit tu marking and dawson 1975 and mixture toxic index mti könemann 1981 5 1 t u i c i i c 50 i 5 2 m i 1 n t u i c 1 i c 50 1 c 2 i c 50 2 c n i c 50 n 5 3 m 0 m t u i max 5 4 m t i 1 log m log m 0 tu is calculated by eq 5 1 where tui is the toxic unit of i nacl kcl and na2so4 respectively ci represents the concentration of compound i when the mixture is at its ic50 tui max is the maximum toxic unit of the mixture m is the sum of the toxic units calculated by eq 5 2 m0 is the ratio of m and tui max calculated by eq 5 3 the combined toxicity can be characterized by m and m0 the details of which can be seen as follows if m 1 the combined toxicity is synergistic if m 1 the combined toxicity is simply additive if m m0 the combined toxicity is believed as antagonistic if m m0 the combined toxicity is independent and if m0 m 1 the combined toxicity is partly additive besides if the 95 confidence interval of m includes 1 the combined toxicity is simply additive marking and dawson 1975 mti is an alternative approach for describing and predicting the combined toxicities of compounds in mixtures mti can be calculated by eq 5 4 the details of assessment of combined toxicity are as follows if mti 1 the combined toxicity is synergistic if mti 1 the combined toxicity is simply additive if mti 0 the combined toxicity is independent if mti 0 the combined toxicity is antagonistic and if 0 mti 1 the combined toxicity is partly additive in addition if the 95 confidence interval of mti includes 1 the combined toxicity is simply additive könemann 1981 2 5 dna rna selection and extraction and rt qpcr the catabolic process of anammox can be divided into three steps shown as eqs 6 1 6 3 there are three key enzymes namely nitrite reductase nir hydrazine synthase hzs and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh involved in each of the step correspondingly dalsgaard et al 2003 kartal et al 2011 6 1 step 1 n o 2 2 h e n o h 2 o e 0 0 38 v 6 2 step 2 n o n h 4 2 h 3 e n 2 h 4 h 2 o e 0 0 06 v 6 3 step 3 n 2 h 4 n 2 4 h 4 e e 0 0 75 v as a biomarker mrna gene transcription levels of the three specific functional genes nir hzs and hdh respectively can be used as a variable to study the metabolism of anammox bacteria under different inhibition conditions wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 based on 16s rrna gene sequencing results of studied biomass anammox bacteria aob nob and denitrification bacteria accounted for 11 60 1 06 0 58 0 11 of total microorganism the three genes nirs hzsb and hdh were selected as the specific functional genes of anammox bacteria in this mix culture system sludge samples 1 4 carrier from each batch bottle were taken after 6 hours shock in different salinity conditions immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until use dna and rna were extracted by using fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals and rneasy mini kit qiagen respectively the quality and quantity of dna and rna were detected by using nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa cdna was synthesized using quantitect rev transcription kit qiagen rt qpcr amplification was performed using an rt pcr abi viia7 system applied biosystems singapore with sybr green pcr master mix abi the standard curves for rt qpcr were generated through serial decimal dilutions of constructed plasmid carrying the specific target gene inserts all the primer pairs used in this study were summarized in table 2 for comparison of the mrna abundances among the different salt exposure mrna level in each batch tests was normalized with respect to that of the blank control test in the same set which was defined as the relative mrna abundance rm 3 results discussion 3 1 performance of fab individual effect of kcl nacl and na2so4 in this study under the anaerobic and autotrophic lack of biodegradeble organic carbon condition the variation of gas pressure and soluble inorganic nitrogen were attributed to the anammox activity in all assays the nitrogen mass balance transformation of inorganic nitrogen in both liquid and gas phase were closed for the blank control assays without any salt addition the stoichiometry ratio of nh4 n no2 n n2 n 1 1 36 0 06 1 97 0 21 was closed to the theoretical ratio of anammox activity 1 1 32 2 04 therefore raa based on ammonium consumption can well represent the aa change under different salinity condition the details of mass balance calculation and aa contribution in the system were verified in lin et al 2020 study in addition the variation of stoichiometry ratios nitrite consumption on ammonium consumption and nitrate generation on ammonium consumption under different salt conditions were shown in fig s3 as shown in fig 1 the trends of raa under individual shock of kcl nacl and na2so4 were similar the raa decreased with the increase of all three types of salt within the experimental salinity range however the inhibitory effect of these three salts were different based on the hill model the ic50 of nacl kcl and na2so4 were estimated to be 0 106 0 007 0 096 0 004 and 0 063 0 006 m respectively considering the osmotic stress at the ic50 salinity levels the calculated osmotic pressures of nacl kcl and na2so4 were 5 35 0 31 4 83 0 34 and 4 77 0 22 atm respectively the inhibitory effect for the studied fab increased in the order na2so4 kcl nacl the lower the ic50 value the more severe the inhibition similar results were obtained in dapena mora et al 2007 study which was carried out on a suspended fab culture belonging to a species of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis the ic50 of nacl kcl and na2so4 were determined to be 0 23 0 20 and 0 08 m respectively dapena mora et al 2007 chen et al 2014 also reported that 0 25 m of nacl kcl and na2so4 resulted in a decrease of raa to 57 6 55 1 and 19 0 respectively compared with above two fab cultures the studied fab culture ca brocadia sp has relatively low salinity tolerance however the toxicity order of these three salts was the same these results also suggested salinity inhibition was not only from osmotic pressure but also from ionic pressure the particular salt ion type 3 2 performance of fab combined effect of nacl kcl nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 similar to individual salt inhibition as shown at fig 2 under all three combinations of salt type with molar ratio of 1 raa decreased with the increase of salinity from salt addition of 0 to about 0 2 m the ic50s of combined inhibition of nacl kcl nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 were found to be 0 076 0 004 0 056 0 003 and 0 088 0 010 m respectively the combination of two salts either nacl kcl or nacl na2so4 resulted in significantly stronger inhibition than that by individual salt as indicated by lower ic50 values in contrast the ic50 for the combination of three salts nacl kcl na2so4 was comparable to the individual salt inhibition average ic50 of the three salts 0 088 m in addition the osmotic pressures under the ic50 levels of nacl kcl nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 were 3 82 0 37 3 54 0 30 and 5 19 0 52 atm respectively the studied fab had much lower osmotic pressure tolerance to the two combined salts than to each individual salt nacl kcl or na2so4 nevertheless its osmotic pressure tolerance to three combined salts nacl kcl na2so4 was similar to that to individual salts the type of combined inhibition of nacl kcl nacl na2so4 or nacl kcl na2so4 was further verified by the tu and mti assessments shown at table 3 under the mixture of two salts the m values were lower than 1 and values of mti were both higher than 1 these results indicated that the combined effects of nacl kcl and nacl na2so4 were synergistic under the combination of three salts both values of m and mti was very close to 1 implying additive inhibition 3 3 interpretation of functional gene expression to salinity inhibition 3 3 1 functional gene expression in parent reactor without salinity inhibition anammox activity aa relies on both intracellular substrate availability manifested as nitrite transport rate r t r a n s n o 2 and ammonium transport rate r t r a n s n h 4 and enzyme activity renzyme described as eq 7 it should be noted that substrates transport rate is subjected to the availability of transporters and energy that is mainly generated from catabolism process 7 a a f r t r a n s n h 4 r t r a n s n o 2 r e n z y m e fig 3 shows the dynamics of inorganic nitrogen in the liquid phase gas production and relative mrna levels of three functional genes nirs hzsb and hdh represented as rmnirs rmhzsb and rmhdh respectively in biomass in a typical cycle of the parent anammox reactor during this cycle study without salinity elevation no inhibition was posed on the enzyme activities hence aa was only limited by the substrate availability aa decreased with the decrease of nitrite and ammonium concentration of bulk liquid from 50 mg n l to 0 mg l 38 mg n l to 0 mg n l correspondingly after 2 h reaction time the rmnirs rmhzsb and rmhdh all significantly declined due to substrate shortage this was consistent with previous research that showed the abundance of mrna to be positively correlated to availability of substrate concentration level inside the cells park et al 2010 3 3 2 functional gene expression associated with different inhibition mechanisms in contrast for all the batch tests there was no substrate limitation in the bulk liquid during the 6 h reaction time both nitrite and ammonium concentrations were higher than 40 mg n l it is recognized that the no is also one of the substrates of hydrazine synthesis process however the catabolic process of anammox required electron balance from hydrazine dehydrogenation eq 6 3 to nitrite reduction eq 6 1 and hydrazine synthesis eq 6 2 which will result in a relatively low and stable no concentration in the cell on the other hand the transport of ammonium could be significantly affected by salinity due to the transporter competition it has been well reported that ammonium ion had very similar electrochemical properties to potassium and sodium ions and ammonium transport could rely on the na cl and na k 2cl co transporters kleiner 1985 sperelakis 2012 therefore ammonium is more likely to be the main factor affecting the regulation of rmhzsb therefore within the studied salinity range 0 25 m salt addition rmnirs rmhzsb and rmhdh were assumed sensitive enough to indicate the concentration levels of substrates nitrite ammonium and hydrazine respectively inside fab cells substrate concentrations inside of fab cells are determined by the rates of substrate active transport for nitrite and ammonium or substrate generation for hydrazine and substrate consumption which can be described as eq 8 1 8 3 8 1 r m n i r s k 1 c i n n o 2 t r t r a n s n o 2 a a 8 2 r m h z s b k 2 c i n n h 4 t r t r a n s n h 4 a a 8 3 r m h d h k 3 c i n n 2 h 4 t r p r o d n 2 h 4 a a where ki is the positive coefficient describing the correlation between relative mrna abundance and substrate or intermediate level inside the fab cells c i n n o 2 c i n n h 4 and c i n n 2 h 4 are no2 nh4 and n2h4 concentrations inside fab cells respectively t is the reaction time fixed at 6 h r t r a n s n o 2 r t r a n s n h 4 and r p r o d n 2 h 4 are no2 transport rate from bulk liquid to inside fab cells nh4 transport rate from bulk liquid to inside fab cells and n2h4 production rate inside fab cells respectively eq 8 describes gene expression under the presence of salinity for instance if the decrease of aa is mainly because of the decrease of substrate transportation rate rtrans i the rtrans i is more severely inhibited than that of the enzyme activity renzyme which will lead to the decrease of substrate concentration inside the cell cin i thus the functional gene expression will be down regulated resulting in the decrease of the relative mrna rm values vice versa strong inhibition on renzyme than rtrans i will lead to up regulation of functional gene expression rm values will increase the gene expression results under individual and combined effect of difference salts are presented and discussed in sections 3 4 and 3 5 respectively 3 4 proposed inhibition mechanisms under individual effect of nacl kcl and na2so4 based on functional gene expression the relative anammox activity and the relative expression of functional genes under individual salt inhibition were measured and presented in fig 4 a1 b1 c1 and the proposed inhibition mechanism was shown in the corresponding schematic drawing fig 4 a2 b2 c2 for nacl as shown in fig 4 a1 inhibition can be separated into two domains 1 associated with relatively low salinity level nacl addition 0 0 08 m and 2 associated with relatively high salinity level nacl addition 0 08 0 17 m in domain 1 rmnirs gradually increased to 170 while rmhzsb and rmhdh decreased to 25 and 80 respectively suggesting that increased nacl concentration likely affected the ammonia transportation rate r t r a n s n h 4 more severely than the functional enzyme activity renzyme the decreased of r t r a n s n h 4 may due to the co transporter competition with na and cl which further decreased n2h4 production rate r p r o d n 2 h 4 and resulted in lower expression levels of the corresponding mrna rmhzsb and rmhdh in the meantime less consumed nitrite less electrons supplied by the hydrazine dehydrogenation process led to nitrite accumulation which stimulated the expression of nirs rmnirs increased in domain 2 rmnirs was maintained at 170 while both rmhzsb and rmhdh increased this may be attributed to the accumulation of ammonia and hydrazine inside of the cell increased c i n n h 4 and c i n n 2 h 4 due to the dramatic decrease of renzyme which slowed the substrate consumption process furthermore the significantly diverged stoichiometry ratios from theoretical values in domain 2 shown in fig s3 indicated that more severe inhibition posed on functional enzymes and the metabolism pathway might change lin et al 2020 interestingly when kcl addition increased from 0 to 0 12 m rmnirs and rmhzsb kept increasing fig 4 b1 whereas a further increase of kcl to 0 135 m reduced both of these variables the rmhdh decreased and then was maintained at low level 15 along with the addition of kcl from 0 to 0 135 m as shown in fig 4 b2 the up regulation of rmnirs and rmhzsb and the down regulation of rmhdh suggested that kcl may have more sever inhibition on renzyme of nir and hzs which led to more accumulation of nitrite and ammonium and less production of hydrazine inside of the cells when kcl increased from 0 12 to 0 14 m both rmnirs and rmhzsb decreased though they remained higher than in the blank control the reduced rmnirs and rmhzsb may be due to lack of energy extremely low aa for gene expression and substrate active transport compared with kcl excess nacl negatively affected fab by both decreasing the r t r a n s n h 4 and renzyme however kcl inhibition only seemed to decrease renzyme considering years of studies on proteins and other biological molecules in other disciplines zhao 2005 the effect of ions on enzyme activity is mostly attributed to their impact on protein hydration for different enzymes the inhibition effect of the same ion will also vary due to different protein specificities in this study the functional enzymes of fab especially nir and hzs were more sensitive to k than to na which was likely the reason for lower tolerance lower values of ic50 to kcl rather than to nacl the above comparison between individual effect of nacl and kcl on fab focused on the cations k and na however for inorganic salts anion inhibition is more potent weingartner et al 2012 to compare the effect of different anions cl and so4 2 the individual inhibitory effect of na2so4 was also assessed and presented in fig 4 c1 similar to nacl inhibition of na2so4 on fab was divided into two domains 1 at relatively low salinity level na2so4 addition 0 0 04 m and 2 at relatively high salinity level na2so4 addition 0 06 0 12 m for domain 1 the relative gene expression of rmnirs rmhzsb and rmhdh all decreased which indicated that the anammox activity decreased mainly because na2so4 has negative effect on both r t r a n s n o 2 and r t r a n s n h 4 fig 4 c2 as a result all the intracellular substrate concentrations c i n n o 2 c i n n h 4 and c i n n 2 h 4 decreased as well for domain 2 the rmnirs rmhzsb and rmhdh all increased fig 4 c1 this was likely due to the more severe inhibition on renzyme by na2so4 rather than on r t r a n s n o 2 and r t r a n s n h 4 fig 4 c2 compared with nacl na2so4 likely hindered both the transport of ammonium and nitrite this suggested that the negative impact of na2so4 on nitrite transport of fab was highly likely due to excess so4 2 the inhibition was caused by the higher concentrations of na and stronger inhibition of so4 2 under the same molar concentration na concentration in na2so4 solution is twice what it is in nacl solution which could be partly the reason of stronger inhibition of na2so4 ic50 0 063 m than nacl ic50 0 106 m on the studied fab furthremore considering the osmotic stress at salt level of ic50 fab s tolerance to na2so4 4 37 atm was also lower than that of nacl 5 35 atm this indicated the higher toxicity of so4 2 on enzymes than cl in general under relatively low salinity expecially for salts of nacl and na2so4 the decrease of aa was mainly due to the decreased transport of substrates when salinity further increased the inhibition of functional enzyme activity was more severe than of substrate transport this is a further evidence that the inhibitory effect of salinity on fab varied not only due to the general osmotic pressure but also the salt ion type ionic stress 3 5 proposed inhibition mechanisms under combined effect of nacl kcl nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 based on functional gene expression as shown in fig 5 a the combined inhibition of nacl kcl from 0 0 19 m resulted in a larger increase of rmnirs to 180 400 compared to individual inhibition by kcl or nacl a stronger inhibition on r t r a n s n h 4 could explain the observed synergistic inhibition of nacl kcl as both na cl co transporter and na k 2cl co transporter were occupied under the presence of na k cl the ammonium transport rate was greatly affected this resulted in more nitrite accumulation inside of the cell and stimulated the rmnirs in comparison rmhzsb remained at a similar level to the control 90 110 when the addition of nacl kcl increased from 0 to 0 13 m it decreased to about 70 when the combined nacl kcl concentration reached to 0 18 m the rmhzsb in fig 5 a was higher than that in fig 4 a1 which indicated a higher level of ammonium inside of the cell this means even though r t r a n s n h 4 decreased higher inhibition of k on hzs enzyme resulted lower ammonia consumption as well which compensated ammonium shortage in the meantime the inhibited hzs enzyme led to lower r p r o d n 2 h 4 reflected by the decreased of rmhdh under the studied combined salt concentration when so4 2 was present in any of the combination scenarios fig 5 b and fig 5 c it became the dominant inhibitor this can be seen from both the ic50 values and the gene s expression under the ic50 of combined inhibition of nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 the so4 2 concentrations were very close 0 028 and 0 029 g l respectively shown in fig s2 compared with individual addition of na2so4 under combined inhibition of nacl na2so4 the ratio of na so4 2 changed from 2 to 3 it s been reported that so4 2 transport could be na dependent markovich 2012 when the ratio of na so4 2 increased to 3 it benefited the accumulation of so4 2 inside of cells kreke and cypionka 1994 turner 1984 therefore compared with fig 4 a1 and fig 4 c1 in fig 5 b the rmnirs was lower in the meantime the rmhzsb increased which suggested more ammonium accumulation these could be due to more severe inhibition on r t r a n s n o 2 thus less no can be used for ammonium oxidation this may also explain the synergistic inhibition of nacl na2so4 under the presence of all the combined salts nacl kcl na2so4 the molecular contribution of so4 2 was relatively low rmnirs in fig 5 c was higher than that in fig 5 b which decreased the total toxicity inhibition was shown as additive these results showed that the composition of different salt ions also play a role for salinity inhibition the interaction of different salt ions on microorganism is complicated therefore the pattern of combined inhibition cannot be defined simply in the future if the concentrations of substrates and intermediates nitrite ammonium hydrazine and nitric oxide inside the anammox cells can be measured directly the salinity inhibition mechanisms proposed by this study can be further verified 3 6 implication for wastewater treatment according to this study both ionic stress and ion composition contribute to salinity induced inhibition on fab hence it is important to access the salt ion type and composition of a wastewater before accepting it at a wastewater treatment plant since different combinations of salts will have varying inhibitory level and mechanism a wastewater stream with varying salt compositions may bring severe inhibition to the culture and result in unstable operation and that could not be predicted from simply considering the osmotic load it should be noted that the salinity of many real wastewater listed in table 1 e g pickling wastewater fishery related wastewater and tannery wastewater is higher than the ic50 concentration of the inoculated fab 8 5 g nacl l in this study and those wastewater have complex ion composition this means a direct dilution to reduce the salt concentration osmotic stress may not be sufficient due to the potential for synergistic inhibition caused by the interactions of different type of ions in this study the combined inhibition of nacl kcl and nacl na2so4 on fab were both synergistic under some situations additional pre treatment processes prior to anammox reactor could alleviate the ionic stress associated with the dominant inhibitor for example for scenarios of nacl na2so4 or kcl nacl na2so4 considered in this study the so4 2 ion was the dominant inhibitor in this case a pre treatment process to remove elevated sulphate should be considered before the particular wastewater is fed to an anammox process it has been reported that sulphate can be efficiently removed through different processes such as precipitation adsorption wetland and anaerobic sequencing batch reactor costa et al 2020 fernando et al 2018 this study focused on the short term salinity effect on fab which can be a guide for considering the immediate impact of accepting new industrial wastewaters at wastewater treatment plants however long term salt acclimation results in shifting the anammox species jeong et al 2020 different anammox species have their own osmotic and ionic tolerance range wu et al 2019 hence the proposed inhibition mechanisms may also be different which would require further investigations 4 conclusion our study indicated that besides total salinity level osmotic stress the type of salt ions ionic stress and their composition can cause different level of inhibition on fab under individual shock of nacl kcl and na2so4 the inhibition on studied fab increased in the order nacl ic50 0 106 m kcl ic50 0 096 m na2so4 ic50 0 063 m the combined inhibition effects of both nacl kcl and nacl na2so4 were synergistic while the combined inhibition of nacl kcl na2so4 was additive nacl and na2so4 inhibited both substrate transport and enzyme activity kcl mainly inhibited enzyme activity to use fab in saline wastewater treatment especially for wastewater contains multiple salt ions it is essential to identify and reduce the negative effects of the dominant salt ions future studies should focus on different fab cultures other types of common salt ions such as mg2 al3 no3 and po4 3 and long term exposure to salinity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17416,the biggest challenge to apply anammox to treat wastewater with elevated salt content is the inhibitory effect of salinity on freshwater anammox bacteria fab most of the research into salinity inhibition has focused on the osmotic pressure effect while the inhibitory effect and its mechanisms induced by ion composition are poorly understood in this study the individual and combined effect of nacl kcl and na2so4 on fab 99 belonging to ca brocadia genera were systematically investigated by batch tests the corresponding responses of mrna abundance of three functional genes including nitrite reductase gene nirs hydrazine synthase gene hzsb and hydrazine dehydrogenase gene hdh under different salt conditions were analyzed the results indicated that nacl kcl and na2so4 have different inhibition effects with the 50 inhibition at 0 106 0 096 and 0 063 m respectively the combined inhibition of nacl kcl and nacl na2so4 on fab were both synergistic while the combined inhibition of nacl kcl na2so4 was additive the responses of mrna of genes nirs hzsb and hdh suggested nacl inhibited the transport of ammonium na2so4 inhibited both nitrite and ammonium transport high salinity inhibited functional enzyme activity these results suggest both ionic stress and ion composition contributed to the observed inhibition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

wastewaters from regions using seawater toilet flushing and wastewaters from food processing industries meat canning plant pickle vegetables plant dairy products plants fish processing plants etc tanneries and the petroleum industry produced water and refining process wastewater summarized in table 1 it can be seen that the salt content and composition vary widely among different industries or different processes of the same industry anammox based process is a carbon and energy efficient wastewater treatment process for biological nitrogen removal due to the extremely low doubling time of marine anammox culture genus of ca scalindua awata et al 2015 directly acclimating freshwater anammox bacteria fab to treat saline wastewater is the most adopted method among the five fab genera namely ca anammoxoglobus ca anammoximicrobium ca brocadia ca jettenia and ca kuenenia ca brocadia is one of the most commonly reported dominant fab genera in full scale wastewater treatment plants suto et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the biggest challenge to achieve saline wastewater treatment by fab is the inhibitory effect of salinity giustinianovich et al 2018 liu et al 2009 salinity inhibition presents in two ways by osmosis as the cells lose free water wang et al 2016a and by ionic stress linked to the accumulation of ions which become toxic at high concentrations lefevre et al 2001 most of the research into salinity inhibition has focused on the former aspect the osmotic pressure effect mainly salt ions of na and cl however as noted above wastewater especially industrial wastewater is complex and contains a range of both cations e g na k ca2 mg2 and anions e g cl so4 2 po4 3 no3 table 1 among them na k ca2 mg2 are essential for the growth of microorganisms murray and zinder 1985 and ca2 is beneficial for the formation of microbial aggregates huang and pinder 1995 yu et al 2001 it has been reported that increasing k concentration in saline wastewater mainly nacl would improve the performance of a biological reactor jin et al 2007 li et al 2018 hence at low concentration 0 01 m these cations show positive effect on microorganism activity but elevated concentrations 0 1 m do cause inhibition the common cations affect biological activity differently with toxicity increases in the order na or k ca2 mg2 al3 deorsola et al 2013 kugelman and mccarty 1965 li et al 2017 romero guiza et al 2016 the understanding of inhibitory effect of the common anions is less clear but generally cl is the most benign anion campos et al 2002 wang et al 2016a yan et al 2010 elevated salt concentration results in inhibition however the inhibitory mechanisms induced by the various cations and anions are poorly understood regarding fab only a few researchers have considered the effect of different salt types and none has considered the combined effect of different salt types namely ion composition effect chen et al 2014 dapena mora et al 2007 to achieve application of anammox at wastewater treatment plants that receive some saline wastewaters it is essential to understand the fab performance and possible inhibition mechanisms under different salinity condition different salt ion type and ion composition to guide the engineering operation and shorten the start up period hence this study aims to investigate the inhibitory effect of ionic stress and ion composition focusing on the four most common types of ions na k cl and so4 2 on fab both the individual effect and the combined effect of nacl kcl and na2so4 were studied through systematically designed experiments the results are analyzed using typical inhibition models the responses of mrna of three functional genes nitrite reductase gene nirs hydrazine synthase gene hzsb and hydrazine dehydrogenase gene hdh were also analysed to elucidate the inhibition mechanisms under the various salinity conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and the parent reactor a 1 2 l semi continuous reactor was set up and operated in this study the fab 99 belonging to one unidentified species ca brocadia sp grew on k5 carriers from anoxkaldnes sweden shown at fig s1 in the semi continuous reactor which was seeded from a 1500 l pilot scale one stage pn anammox moving bed bioreactor in luggage point wwtp urban utilities brisbane queensland australia the semi continuous reactor was fed with the effluent of a pilot scale side stream pn reactor receiving real anaerobic digestion liquor in luggage point wwtp additional nano2 and nh4hco3 were occasionally added to maintain the nitrite and ammonium concentrations at about 520 mg n l and 400 mg n l respectively the 1 2 l parent reactor was fed with 100 ml influent every 2 hours resulting in 12 cycles of feeing per day 1 day hydraulic retention time the reactor was operated at steady state for more than 3 months with anammox activity aa of 1 5 2 0 g nh4 n l d the ratios of removed nitrite no2 n to removed ammonium nh4 n and produced nitrate no3 n to removed ammonium nh4 n were 1 35 0 06 and 0 32 0 1 respectively 2 2 batch experiment serum bottles with 60 ml of working volume were used to conduct the batch tests in all assays the effluent of the parent mbbr was collected as inoculum media with an initial electrical conductivity of 4 2 ms cm equivalent to about 2 5 g nacl l more details are shown in table s1 which had been pre filtered with 0 42µm filters and deoxygenated by sparging with pure nitrogen gas six sets of batch tests including 122 assays were conducted under six different salt conditions individual salt condition nacl kcl and na2so4 combined salt condition nacl kcl nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 according to the experimental design stock solutions including nacl kcl and na2so4 all 40 g l made from inoculum media were used individually or in combination to achieve 0 20 g l salt addition total salinity between 2 5 to 22 5 g l details were shown at table s2 at each set of experiment one reactor was always used as a blank control without salt addition and the rest were used as experimental reactors the anammox activities under different salt conditions were represented as percentages of the values measured in the control the ph in each reactor was adjusted and kept within the range of 7 2 7 4 by adding hepes 10 mm during the 24 h anaerobic tests the medium was deoxygenated again after which one biomass carrier was put into the batch reactor the reactor was then sealed with the rubber lid and alumina cap immediately then the nitrite nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and inorganic carbon were provided by adding nano2 solution 2 g n l and nh4hco3 2 g n l respectively to avoid substrate inhibition the initial concentrations of nitrite and ammonium were fixed at 110 130 mg n l and 100 120 mg n l respectively at the beginning of each test the liquid volume including all the medium mentioned above was 40 ml which resulted in a gas phase volume of 20 ml in each reactor the batch reactors were placed in a shaking incubator premiere thz 82 china at 35 1 c and 100 10 rpm for 24 h the gas pressure of each reactor was tested at time 0 2 4 6 9 12 24 h by using a gas pressure meter liquid samples were taken at time 0 and 6 h for the analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the volatile solids vs on each carrier in the reactors were measured at the end of batch test 2 3 methods for determination of anammox activity and chemical analysis 2 3 1 anammox activity in general anammox metabolism can be described by eq 1 strous et al 1998 anammox activity aa can be described according to i the n2 production ii ammonium consumption and iii nitrite consumption to simplify here the aa based on ammonium consumption of the first 6 h reaction g nh4 n g vs day was used to describe anammox activity and was calculated by eq 2 1 n h 4 1 32 n o 2 0 066 hc o 3 0 13 h 1 02 n 2 0 26 n o 3 0 066 c h 2 o 0 5 n 0 15 2 03 h 2 o 2 aa δ c n h 4 v l v s δ t where δc nh4 represents the consumption of ammonium g n l vl is the volume of the liquid phase in the batch reactor 0 04 l δt is the reaction time 6 h vs is the volatile solids content g relative anammox activity raa was introduced to eliminate the variability of biomass on different experimental days and was calculated by eq 3 3 r a a a a i a a 0 100 where aai g nh4 n g vs day is the aa of each experimental test and aa0 g nh4 n g vs day is the aa of the blank control 2 3 2 chemical analysis the ammonium nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n and orthophosphate po4 3 p concentrations were analyzed using a lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin after each batch test the biomass attached to each carrier was dried at 105 c for 24 h and peeled from the carrier then ts and vs were analyzed by the standard methods apha 1995 in addition the increasing osmotic pressure associated with the salinity addition of nacl kcl and na2so4 individually or in combination was evaluated by the lenntech osmotic pressure calculator 2 4 inhibition model 2 4 1 individual inhibition hill model most early studies suggested that salinity inhibition of biological activity including cod removal nitrification and denitrification processes could be well described by a non competitive inhibition model ghassemi et al 1995 lee and lin 2006 to describe the inhibitory effect of salinity more effectively claros et al 2010 a modified hill function non competitive inhibition model simply referred to as a hill model was adopted in this paper as there was no substrate shortage under all experimental conditions within first 6 h reaction time the hill model can be presented as eq 4 4 r a a r a a max k i n k i n i n where raamax is the maximum relative anammox activity equal to 100 which is the blank control test i represents the concentration of salts m ki is the inhibition constant m and is equal to the value of ic50 the salt concentration that caused 50 inhibition on aa 2 4 2 assessment of combined inhibition the combined inhibition toxicities include four main types 1 independent inhibition 2 additive inhibition 3 synergistic inhibition and 4 antagonistic inhibition ding et al 2015 independent inhibition is based on the assumption that the two or more inhibitors affect activity by different inhibitory mechanisms cedergreen 2014 additive inhibition is based on the assumption that two or more inhibitors affect activity by a similar inhibitory mechanism bliss 1939 and generally provides a higher predicted inhibition than the independent inhibition model belden et al 2007 synergistic inhibition also called potentiated inhibition or cocktail effects means the mix effect of two inhibitors or more is greater than the additive effect antagonistic inhibition refers to the mix effect of two inhibitors or more being less than the predicted value assuming additive inhibition or independent inhibition heys et al 2016 the main assessment method for combined toxicities include toxic unit tu marking and dawson 1975 and mixture toxic index mti könemann 1981 5 1 t u i c i i c 50 i 5 2 m i 1 n t u i c 1 i c 50 1 c 2 i c 50 2 c n i c 50 n 5 3 m 0 m t u i max 5 4 m t i 1 log m log m 0 tu is calculated by eq 5 1 where tui is the toxic unit of i nacl kcl and na2so4 respectively ci represents the concentration of compound i when the mixture is at its ic50 tui max is the maximum toxic unit of the mixture m is the sum of the toxic units calculated by eq 5 2 m0 is the ratio of m and tui max calculated by eq 5 3 the combined toxicity can be characterized by m and m0 the details of which can be seen as follows if m 1 the combined toxicity is synergistic if m 1 the combined toxicity is simply additive if m m0 the combined toxicity is believed as antagonistic if m m0 the combined toxicity is independent and if m0 m 1 the combined toxicity is partly additive besides if the 95 confidence interval of m includes 1 the combined toxicity is simply additive marking and dawson 1975 mti is an alternative approach for describing and predicting the combined toxicities of compounds in mixtures mti can be calculated by eq 5 4 the details of assessment of combined toxicity are as follows if mti 1 the combined toxicity is synergistic if mti 1 the combined toxicity is simply additive if mti 0 the combined toxicity is independent if mti 0 the combined toxicity is antagonistic and if 0 mti 1 the combined toxicity is partly additive in addition if the 95 confidence interval of mti includes 1 the combined toxicity is simply additive könemann 1981 2 5 dna rna selection and extraction and rt qpcr the catabolic process of anammox can be divided into three steps shown as eqs 6 1 6 3 there are three key enzymes namely nitrite reductase nir hydrazine synthase hzs and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh involved in each of the step correspondingly dalsgaard et al 2003 kartal et al 2011 6 1 step 1 n o 2 2 h e n o h 2 o e 0 0 38 v 6 2 step 2 n o n h 4 2 h 3 e n 2 h 4 h 2 o e 0 0 06 v 6 3 step 3 n 2 h 4 n 2 4 h 4 e e 0 0 75 v as a biomarker mrna gene transcription levels of the three specific functional genes nir hzs and hdh respectively can be used as a variable to study the metabolism of anammox bacteria under different inhibition conditions wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 based on 16s rrna gene sequencing results of studied biomass anammox bacteria aob nob and denitrification bacteria accounted for 11 60 1 06 0 58 0 11 of total microorganism the three genes nirs hzsb and hdh were selected as the specific functional genes of anammox bacteria in this mix culture system sludge samples 1 4 carrier from each batch bottle were taken after 6 hours shock in different salinity conditions immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until use dna and rna were extracted by using fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals and rneasy mini kit qiagen respectively the quality and quantity of dna and rna were detected by using nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa cdna was synthesized using quantitect rev transcription kit qiagen rt qpcr amplification was performed using an rt pcr abi viia7 system applied biosystems singapore with sybr green pcr master mix abi the standard curves for rt qpcr were generated through serial decimal dilutions of constructed plasmid carrying the specific target gene inserts all the primer pairs used in this study were summarized in table 2 for comparison of the mrna abundances among the different salt exposure mrna level in each batch tests was normalized with respect to that of the blank control test in the same set which was defined as the relative mrna abundance rm 3 results discussion 3 1 performance of fab individual effect of kcl nacl and na2so4 in this study under the anaerobic and autotrophic lack of biodegradeble organic carbon condition the variation of gas pressure and soluble inorganic nitrogen were attributed to the anammox activity in all assays the nitrogen mass balance transformation of inorganic nitrogen in both liquid and gas phase were closed for the blank control assays without any salt addition the stoichiometry ratio of nh4 n no2 n n2 n 1 1 36 0 06 1 97 0 21 was closed to the theoretical ratio of anammox activity 1 1 32 2 04 therefore raa based on ammonium consumption can well represent the aa change under different salinity condition the details of mass balance calculation and aa contribution in the system were verified in lin et al 2020 study in addition the variation of stoichiometry ratios nitrite consumption on ammonium consumption and nitrate generation on ammonium consumption under different salt conditions were shown in fig s3 as shown in fig 1 the trends of raa under individual shock of kcl nacl and na2so4 were similar the raa decreased with the increase of all three types of salt within the experimental salinity range however the inhibitory effect of these three salts were different based on the hill model the ic50 of nacl kcl and na2so4 were estimated to be 0 106 0 007 0 096 0 004 and 0 063 0 006 m respectively considering the osmotic stress at the ic50 salinity levels the calculated osmotic pressures of nacl kcl and na2so4 were 5 35 0 31 4 83 0 34 and 4 77 0 22 atm respectively the inhibitory effect for the studied fab increased in the order na2so4 kcl nacl the lower the ic50 value the more severe the inhibition similar results were obtained in dapena mora et al 2007 study which was carried out on a suspended fab culture belonging to a species of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis the ic50 of nacl kcl and na2so4 were determined to be 0 23 0 20 and 0 08 m respectively dapena mora et al 2007 chen et al 2014 also reported that 0 25 m of nacl kcl and na2so4 resulted in a decrease of raa to 57 6 55 1 and 19 0 respectively compared with above two fab cultures the studied fab culture ca brocadia sp has relatively low salinity tolerance however the toxicity order of these three salts was the same these results also suggested salinity inhibition was not only from osmotic pressure but also from ionic pressure the particular salt ion type 3 2 performance of fab combined effect of nacl kcl nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 similar to individual salt inhibition as shown at fig 2 under all three combinations of salt type with molar ratio of 1 raa decreased with the increase of salinity from salt addition of 0 to about 0 2 m the ic50s of combined inhibition of nacl kcl nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 were found to be 0 076 0 004 0 056 0 003 and 0 088 0 010 m respectively the combination of two salts either nacl kcl or nacl na2so4 resulted in significantly stronger inhibition than that by individual salt as indicated by lower ic50 values in contrast the ic50 for the combination of three salts nacl kcl na2so4 was comparable to the individual salt inhibition average ic50 of the three salts 0 088 m in addition the osmotic pressures under the ic50 levels of nacl kcl nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 were 3 82 0 37 3 54 0 30 and 5 19 0 52 atm respectively the studied fab had much lower osmotic pressure tolerance to the two combined salts than to each individual salt nacl kcl or na2so4 nevertheless its osmotic pressure tolerance to three combined salts nacl kcl na2so4 was similar to that to individual salts the type of combined inhibition of nacl kcl nacl na2so4 or nacl kcl na2so4 was further verified by the tu and mti assessments shown at table 3 under the mixture of two salts the m values were lower than 1 and values of mti were both higher than 1 these results indicated that the combined effects of nacl kcl and nacl na2so4 were synergistic under the combination of three salts both values of m and mti was very close to 1 implying additive inhibition 3 3 interpretation of functional gene expression to salinity inhibition 3 3 1 functional gene expression in parent reactor without salinity inhibition anammox activity aa relies on both intracellular substrate availability manifested as nitrite transport rate r t r a n s n o 2 and ammonium transport rate r t r a n s n h 4 and enzyme activity renzyme described as eq 7 it should be noted that substrates transport rate is subjected to the availability of transporters and energy that is mainly generated from catabolism process 7 a a f r t r a n s n h 4 r t r a n s n o 2 r e n z y m e fig 3 shows the dynamics of inorganic nitrogen in the liquid phase gas production and relative mrna levels of three functional genes nirs hzsb and hdh represented as rmnirs rmhzsb and rmhdh respectively in biomass in a typical cycle of the parent anammox reactor during this cycle study without salinity elevation no inhibition was posed on the enzyme activities hence aa was only limited by the substrate availability aa decreased with the decrease of nitrite and ammonium concentration of bulk liquid from 50 mg n l to 0 mg l 38 mg n l to 0 mg n l correspondingly after 2 h reaction time the rmnirs rmhzsb and rmhdh all significantly declined due to substrate shortage this was consistent with previous research that showed the abundance of mrna to be positively correlated to availability of substrate concentration level inside the cells park et al 2010 3 3 2 functional gene expression associated with different inhibition mechanisms in contrast for all the batch tests there was no substrate limitation in the bulk liquid during the 6 h reaction time both nitrite and ammonium concentrations were higher than 40 mg n l it is recognized that the no is also one of the substrates of hydrazine synthesis process however the catabolic process of anammox required electron balance from hydrazine dehydrogenation eq 6 3 to nitrite reduction eq 6 1 and hydrazine synthesis eq 6 2 which will result in a relatively low and stable no concentration in the cell on the other hand the transport of ammonium could be significantly affected by salinity due to the transporter competition it has been well reported that ammonium ion had very similar electrochemical properties to potassium and sodium ions and ammonium transport could rely on the na cl and na k 2cl co transporters kleiner 1985 sperelakis 2012 therefore ammonium is more likely to be the main factor affecting the regulation of rmhzsb therefore within the studied salinity range 0 25 m salt addition rmnirs rmhzsb and rmhdh were assumed sensitive enough to indicate the concentration levels of substrates nitrite ammonium and hydrazine respectively inside fab cells substrate concentrations inside of fab cells are determined by the rates of substrate active transport for nitrite and ammonium or substrate generation for hydrazine and substrate consumption which can be described as eq 8 1 8 3 8 1 r m n i r s k 1 c i n n o 2 t r t r a n s n o 2 a a 8 2 r m h z s b k 2 c i n n h 4 t r t r a n s n h 4 a a 8 3 r m h d h k 3 c i n n 2 h 4 t r p r o d n 2 h 4 a a where ki is the positive coefficient describing the correlation between relative mrna abundance and substrate or intermediate level inside the fab cells c i n n o 2 c i n n h 4 and c i n n 2 h 4 are no2 nh4 and n2h4 concentrations inside fab cells respectively t is the reaction time fixed at 6 h r t r a n s n o 2 r t r a n s n h 4 and r p r o d n 2 h 4 are no2 transport rate from bulk liquid to inside fab cells nh4 transport rate from bulk liquid to inside fab cells and n2h4 production rate inside fab cells respectively eq 8 describes gene expression under the presence of salinity for instance if the decrease of aa is mainly because of the decrease of substrate transportation rate rtrans i the rtrans i is more severely inhibited than that of the enzyme activity renzyme which will lead to the decrease of substrate concentration inside the cell cin i thus the functional gene expression will be down regulated resulting in the decrease of the relative mrna rm values vice versa strong inhibition on renzyme than rtrans i will lead to up regulation of functional gene expression rm values will increase the gene expression results under individual and combined effect of difference salts are presented and discussed in sections 3 4 and 3 5 respectively 3 4 proposed inhibition mechanisms under individual effect of nacl kcl and na2so4 based on functional gene expression the relative anammox activity and the relative expression of functional genes under individual salt inhibition were measured and presented in fig 4 a1 b1 c1 and the proposed inhibition mechanism was shown in the corresponding schematic drawing fig 4 a2 b2 c2 for nacl as shown in fig 4 a1 inhibition can be separated into two domains 1 associated with relatively low salinity level nacl addition 0 0 08 m and 2 associated with relatively high salinity level nacl addition 0 08 0 17 m in domain 1 rmnirs gradually increased to 170 while rmhzsb and rmhdh decreased to 25 and 80 respectively suggesting that increased nacl concentration likely affected the ammonia transportation rate r t r a n s n h 4 more severely than the functional enzyme activity renzyme the decreased of r t r a n s n h 4 may due to the co transporter competition with na and cl which further decreased n2h4 production rate r p r o d n 2 h 4 and resulted in lower expression levels of the corresponding mrna rmhzsb and rmhdh in the meantime less consumed nitrite less electrons supplied by the hydrazine dehydrogenation process led to nitrite accumulation which stimulated the expression of nirs rmnirs increased in domain 2 rmnirs was maintained at 170 while both rmhzsb and rmhdh increased this may be attributed to the accumulation of ammonia and hydrazine inside of the cell increased c i n n h 4 and c i n n 2 h 4 due to the dramatic decrease of renzyme which slowed the substrate consumption process furthermore the significantly diverged stoichiometry ratios from theoretical values in domain 2 shown in fig s3 indicated that more severe inhibition posed on functional enzymes and the metabolism pathway might change lin et al 2020 interestingly when kcl addition increased from 0 to 0 12 m rmnirs and rmhzsb kept increasing fig 4 b1 whereas a further increase of kcl to 0 135 m reduced both of these variables the rmhdh decreased and then was maintained at low level 15 along with the addition of kcl from 0 to 0 135 m as shown in fig 4 b2 the up regulation of rmnirs and rmhzsb and the down regulation of rmhdh suggested that kcl may have more sever inhibition on renzyme of nir and hzs which led to more accumulation of nitrite and ammonium and less production of hydrazine inside of the cells when kcl increased from 0 12 to 0 14 m both rmnirs and rmhzsb decreased though they remained higher than in the blank control the reduced rmnirs and rmhzsb may be due to lack of energy extremely low aa for gene expression and substrate active transport compared with kcl excess nacl negatively affected fab by both decreasing the r t r a n s n h 4 and renzyme however kcl inhibition only seemed to decrease renzyme considering years of studies on proteins and other biological molecules in other disciplines zhao 2005 the effect of ions on enzyme activity is mostly attributed to their impact on protein hydration for different enzymes the inhibition effect of the same ion will also vary due to different protein specificities in this study the functional enzymes of fab especially nir and hzs were more sensitive to k than to na which was likely the reason for lower tolerance lower values of ic50 to kcl rather than to nacl the above comparison between individual effect of nacl and kcl on fab focused on the cations k and na however for inorganic salts anion inhibition is more potent weingartner et al 2012 to compare the effect of different anions cl and so4 2 the individual inhibitory effect of na2so4 was also assessed and presented in fig 4 c1 similar to nacl inhibition of na2so4 on fab was divided into two domains 1 at relatively low salinity level na2so4 addition 0 0 04 m and 2 at relatively high salinity level na2so4 addition 0 06 0 12 m for domain 1 the relative gene expression of rmnirs rmhzsb and rmhdh all decreased which indicated that the anammox activity decreased mainly because na2so4 has negative effect on both r t r a n s n o 2 and r t r a n s n h 4 fig 4 c2 as a result all the intracellular substrate concentrations c i n n o 2 c i n n h 4 and c i n n 2 h 4 decreased as well for domain 2 the rmnirs rmhzsb and rmhdh all increased fig 4 c1 this was likely due to the more severe inhibition on renzyme by na2so4 rather than on r t r a n s n o 2 and r t r a n s n h 4 fig 4 c2 compared with nacl na2so4 likely hindered both the transport of ammonium and nitrite this suggested that the negative impact of na2so4 on nitrite transport of fab was highly likely due to excess so4 2 the inhibition was caused by the higher concentrations of na and stronger inhibition of so4 2 under the same molar concentration na concentration in na2so4 solution is twice what it is in nacl solution which could be partly the reason of stronger inhibition of na2so4 ic50 0 063 m than nacl ic50 0 106 m on the studied fab furthremore considering the osmotic stress at salt level of ic50 fab s tolerance to na2so4 4 37 atm was also lower than that of nacl 5 35 atm this indicated the higher toxicity of so4 2 on enzymes than cl in general under relatively low salinity expecially for salts of nacl and na2so4 the decrease of aa was mainly due to the decreased transport of substrates when salinity further increased the inhibition of functional enzyme activity was more severe than of substrate transport this is a further evidence that the inhibitory effect of salinity on fab varied not only due to the general osmotic pressure but also the salt ion type ionic stress 3 5 proposed inhibition mechanisms under combined effect of nacl kcl nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 based on functional gene expression as shown in fig 5 a the combined inhibition of nacl kcl from 0 0 19 m resulted in a larger increase of rmnirs to 180 400 compared to individual inhibition by kcl or nacl a stronger inhibition on r t r a n s n h 4 could explain the observed synergistic inhibition of nacl kcl as both na cl co transporter and na k 2cl co transporter were occupied under the presence of na k cl the ammonium transport rate was greatly affected this resulted in more nitrite accumulation inside of the cell and stimulated the rmnirs in comparison rmhzsb remained at a similar level to the control 90 110 when the addition of nacl kcl increased from 0 to 0 13 m it decreased to about 70 when the combined nacl kcl concentration reached to 0 18 m the rmhzsb in fig 5 a was higher than that in fig 4 a1 which indicated a higher level of ammonium inside of the cell this means even though r t r a n s n h 4 decreased higher inhibition of k on hzs enzyme resulted lower ammonia consumption as well which compensated ammonium shortage in the meantime the inhibited hzs enzyme led to lower r p r o d n 2 h 4 reflected by the decreased of rmhdh under the studied combined salt concentration when so4 2 was present in any of the combination scenarios fig 5 b and fig 5 c it became the dominant inhibitor this can be seen from both the ic50 values and the gene s expression under the ic50 of combined inhibition of nacl na2so4 and nacl kcl na2so4 the so4 2 concentrations were very close 0 028 and 0 029 g l respectively shown in fig s2 compared with individual addition of na2so4 under combined inhibition of nacl na2so4 the ratio of na so4 2 changed from 2 to 3 it s been reported that so4 2 transport could be na dependent markovich 2012 when the ratio of na so4 2 increased to 3 it benefited the accumulation of so4 2 inside of cells kreke and cypionka 1994 turner 1984 therefore compared with fig 4 a1 and fig 4 c1 in fig 5 b the rmnirs was lower in the meantime the rmhzsb increased which suggested more ammonium accumulation these could be due to more severe inhibition on r t r a n s n o 2 thus less no can be used for ammonium oxidation this may also explain the synergistic inhibition of nacl na2so4 under the presence of all the combined salts nacl kcl na2so4 the molecular contribution of so4 2 was relatively low rmnirs in fig 5 c was higher than that in fig 5 b which decreased the total toxicity inhibition was shown as additive these results showed that the composition of different salt ions also play a role for salinity inhibition the interaction of different salt ions on microorganism is complicated therefore the pattern of combined inhibition cannot be defined simply in the future if the concentrations of substrates and intermediates nitrite ammonium hydrazine and nitric oxide inside the anammox cells can be measured directly the salinity inhibition mechanisms proposed by this study can be further verified 3 6 implication for wastewater treatment according to this study both ionic stress and ion composition contribute to salinity induced inhibition on fab hence it is important to access the salt ion type and composition of a wastewater before accepting it at a wastewater treatment plant since different combinations of salts will have varying inhibitory level and mechanism a wastewater stream with varying salt compositions may bring severe inhibition to the culture and result in unstable operation and that could not be predicted from simply considering the osmotic load it should be noted that the salinity of many real wastewater listed in table 1 e g pickling wastewater fishery related wastewater and tannery wastewater is higher than the ic50 concentration of the inoculated fab 8 5 g nacl l in this study and those wastewater have complex ion composition this means a direct dilution to reduce the salt concentration osmotic stress may not be sufficient due to the potential for synergistic inhibition caused by the interactions of different type of ions in this study the combined inhibition of nacl kcl and nacl na2so4 on fab were both synergistic under some situations additional pre treatment processes prior to anammox reactor could alleviate the ionic stress associated with the dominant inhibitor for example for scenarios of nacl na2so4 or kcl nacl na2so4 considered in this study the so4 2 ion was the dominant inhibitor in this case a pre treatment process to remove elevated sulphate should be considered before the particular wastewater is fed to an anammox process it has been reported that sulphate can be efficiently removed through different processes such as precipitation adsorption wetland and anaerobic sequencing batch reactor costa et al 2020 fernando et al 2018 this study focused on the short term salinity effect on fab which can be a guide for considering the immediate impact of accepting new industrial wastewaters at wastewater treatment plants however long term salt acclimation results in shifting the anammox species jeong et al 2020 different anammox species have their own osmotic and ionic tolerance range wu et al 2019 hence the proposed inhibition mechanisms may also be different which would require further investigations 4 conclusion our study indicated that besides total salinity level osmotic stress the type of salt ions ionic stress and their composition can cause different level of inhibition on fab under individual shock of nacl kcl and na2so4 the inhibition on studied fab increased in the order nacl ic50 0 106 m kcl ic50 0 096 m na2so4 ic50 0 063 m the combined inhibition effects of both nacl kcl and nacl na2so4 were synergistic while the combined inhibition of nacl kcl na2so4 was additive nacl and na2so4 inhibited both substrate transport and enzyme activity kcl mainly inhibited enzyme activity to use fab in saline wastewater treatment especially for wastewater contains multiple salt ions it is essential to identify and reduce the negative effects of the dominant salt ions future studies should focus on different fab cultures other types of common salt ions such as mg2 al3 no3 and po4 3 and long term exposure to salinity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

microbial diversity 1 introduction in rural areas with large scale poultry breeding antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole smx are commonly used for illness prevention infection treatment and growth promotion moore 2019 sun et al 2020 however the majority of applied antibiotics can hardly be completely metabolized by the animals such that a mass of unused antibiotics and their metabolic products may be gradually excreted following livestock ingestion dalkmann et al 2014 the released antibiotics may pose serious risks to water security and human health christou et al 2017 liu et al 2014 furthermore long term exposure to such antibiotics may alter the microbial diversity of specific environments ziembinska buczynska and miksch 2016 in particular this issue is of great concern in decentralized rural communities and is garnering growing attention over the world rodriguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 thomas et al 2019 a number of studies were reported in employing emerging soil based technologies to mitigate ecological and human health risks of smx for example song et al 2018a demonstrated the high removal efficiency of smx in vertical up flow constructed wetland cw although it should be noted that this approach required continuous electrical energy consumption to overcome gravitational potential liang et al 2018 meanwhile documented 50 to 70 removal of smx using conventional cw however other studies have identified inadequacies of this approach such as the large land space requirement low loading rate and regional clogging in other studies smx exhibited moderate fluctuating in some cases even somewhat low removal performance when using cw as the treatment method hijosa valsero et al 2011 park et al 2009 the vertical flow multi soil layering msl

terms of construction structure water distribution medium conditions can facilitate the removal for a variety of contaminants in rural wastewater a number of prior studies have demonstrated significantly improved performance of msl system as compared with those of conventional land based wastewater treatment processes although the findings of previous studies are encouraging few studies have focused on the treatment of antibiotics in wastewater using msl system letting alone investigating the removal of smx in particular several studies have indicated that anaerobic conditions are favorable for smx removal park et al 2009 while others have asserted that smx could be more effectively degraded under aerobic conditions baumgarten et al 2011 the aerobic and anaerobic conditions are facilitated through the placement of permeable layers pls and soil mixture blocks smbs respectively within msl system hong et al 2019 song et al 2018b however the performance of msl system on smx removal and the effects of smx on the inherent microbial communities have not yet been studied and the underlying mechanisms has not been examined moreover many impact factors may interact with each other leading to composite effects on smx removal it is thus of interest to explore such effects and their physicochemical and biochemical implications this study constitutes the first attempt of factorial analysis for the effects of multiple state variables material of pl concentration of smx and ph of influent and their interactions on smx removal furthermore a novel stepwise cluster inference sci model is developed to tackle the discrete and nonlinear complexities in relationships among smx removal and related impact factors the impacts of smx on microbial communities have also been explored as well as the relationships between specific bacteria and smx removal overall as the first attempt this study is targeted on the investigation of smx removal in msl systems under multiple complexities in microbiological processes and relevant factorial relationships 2 materials and methods 2 1 factorial design of msl based experiment the experimental msl systems are shown in fig 1 a and the details with the constructions are available in the supplementary material in this study three state variables including a material of pl b concentration of smx and c ph of influent were considered given their significance in wastewater treatment processes concerning smx removal to explore the interactions among these three operating factors the experiments were carried out using a 23 factorial design method the different two types of factor a were denoted as a1 anthracite and a2 medical stone in the experiment elevated smx concentrations were used to reflect the characteristics of discharge in rural poultry wastewater from decentralized pollution sources with two possible extreme scenarios for peak smx concentrations in wastewater considered baumgarten et al 2011 liang et al 2018 xu et al 2011 thus the low and high levels of factor b were denoted by the actual concentration values b 1 00 and b 10 00 mg l respectively analytical grade smx cas no 723 46 6 with a purity of 98 was purchased from aladdine shanghai china the physiochemical properties of smx are shown in table s1 according to the pka of the given smx molecule then the low and high levels of factor c were named according to the actual ph values of 3 00 c and 9 00 c respectively to ensure sufficient dissolution of smx in acidic and alkaline conditions while maintaining the different molecular states of smx a detailed representation of the experimental design is shown in fig 1b 2 2 operation of msl systems there were ten msl systems which were identified as msl1 to msl10 in the laboratory twelve 130 l plastic barrels six plastic barrels of synthetic wastewater supply and other six plastic barrels of treated water collection were used in experiment fig 1b the experiment commenced with a 30 day preincubation period day 1 to day 30 during this period all the msl systems were fed with synthetic wastewater containing no smx and no adjustment of ph the purpose of this exercise was to ensure the stable performance and similar contaminant removal efficiency of the different msl systems at the outset of smx removal it was observed that the performance of the different msl systems was almost unaffected by materials of pl during the preincubation period for the smx removal experiments day 31 to day 90 msl3 msl4 msl7 and msl8 were used to treat wastewater with an smx concentration of 1 mg l msl1 msl2 msl5 and msl6 were used to treat wastewater with an smx concentration of 10 mg l and msl9 and msl10 were used as controls to treat wastewater containing no smx in addition the ph of influent in all msl systems was adjusted according to the factorial design beginning on day 31 the 60 day smx removal experiment was performed in the dark with the msl systems under observation msl1 to msl8 wrapped with aluminum foil to prevent photodegradation of the smx based on the universal characteristics of rural poultry wastewater quality an et al 2016 jia et al 2017 the quantity of required chemicals for preparing synthetic wastewater used throughout this experiment and the related influent water quality were determined as shown in table s2 the initial ph of the influent was adjusted using naoh and hcl solutions respectively synthetic wastewater was fed continuously into the msl systems through the upmost silicone tubing with 5 water droppers using peristaltic pumps kamoer fluid tech co ltd shanghai china during the experimental period the temperatures of all msl systems were kept at 22 1 c furthermore the hydraulic loading rate hlr was set at 320 l m2 d for all msl systems with a hydraulic residence time hrt of 37 3 h throughout the 90 day operational period the performance of the msl systems was evaluated by monitoring the physicochemical parameters of the water including the ph of effluent dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp as well as the water quality parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and total nitrogen tn raw effluent samples from the sampling outlet of each msl system were collected at 10 day intervals for the purpose of monitoring water parameters smx concentration in the effluent was also monitored at 10 day beginning at day 31 2 3 analytical methods all the water physicochemical parameters and water quality parameters were measured according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 with the methods available in the supplementary material smx in the effluent was analyzed using a shimadzu liquid chromatography lc spectrometry system lc 2030 prominence i japan the solid phase extraction spe for the smx enrichment and the details of smx measurement were presented in the supplementary material anthracite or medical stone samples of 1 g were taken at the third pl for all 10 msls where the microstructure of the materials was observed using a jsm 7001f scanning electron microscope jeol ltd japan with an accelerating voltage of 15 0 kv 2 4 microbial diversity analysis of soils in the investigation each smb of a given msl system was treated like a miniature soil ecosystem where the degree of biological activity could influence the overall smx removal performance and vice versa to gain insight of the inherent nature of microorganisms in msl system the bacterial diversity in smb derived soil samples was investigated through the high throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial rrna genes on the illumina hiseq 2500 sequencing platform the relationship between the microscopic mechanism and the microbiological characteristics in smbs as it relates to msl performance was characterized with particular attention given to the effect of smx removal and microbial feedbacks in order to compare the variations of bacterial diversity among the 10 msl systems both soil s0 and soil samples s1 to s10 from the smbs were analyzed a 100 g fresh soil sample of s1 s8 was collected from each of the ten smbs 10 10 g in each msl system at the end of the 60 day smx removal experiment as well a 100 g fresh soil sample was collected from control group s9 and s10 at the end of operation 90 days the detailed operational approaches concerning microbial sequencing are shown in the supplementary material 2 5 data analysis design expert 8 0 stat ease inc usa was applied for factorial analysis and statistical analysis through the results of one way analysis of variance anova the originpro software 2017 originlab corporation usa was used for drafting linear nonlinear fitting and for performing multiple linear regression mlr analysis of the experimental data sci model was performed using the stepwise cluster method package in r 3 4 3 software mathsoft inc usa for a stepwise cluster method flowchart with detailed descriptions the interested reader may refer to our previous work sun et al 2009 wang et al 2015 any correlation level with p 0 05 is considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic matter and nutrients removal in msl systems the variations of the physicochemical parameters including ph do and orp of effluent are shown in figs s1 s2a and s2b respectively long term operation using acidic and alkaline influent was the most important factor in the significant ph variation of effluent and environmental conditions in all the msl systems meanwhile the do concentrations of effluent remained at a high level throughout the stable experiment the relatively high orp 100 mv showed the oxidation environment is predominant in all msl systems at the final stage the detailed analyses are shown in supplementary material the removal of cod and tp in the different msl systems is shown in figs 2 a and 2b respecitvely during the preincubation period of operation newly constructed msl systems and especially the upper smbs and pls have abundant minute pore spaces and adsorption sites which were available for trapping phosphorous compounds various microorganisms and their needed organics the msl systems performed well at removing organic matter during days 0 to 30 however during days 40 to 90 there were significant decrease and slow recovery of biochemical degradation capacity and the less than ideal final performance in four of the msl systems for treating high concentration smx influent meanwhile other msl systems exhibited excellent performance on cod removal at rates ranging from 95 5 to 97 5 moreover there were inapparent effects of different factorial levels of influent ph and materials of pl on cod removal whether the wastewater contained smx or not the detailed data variations of cod removal are shown in supplementary material the chemical processes for tp removal are shown in fig 3 indeed ph was the key parameter influencing the process of chemical phosphorus removal and the forms of phosphorous chemical products present in msl systems a high ph of influent 9 could significantly promote tp removal while the highly acidic environment 3 in msl systems directly resulted in neutralization with final fe oh 3 adsorbents and secondary release of phosphate radicals in the well performing msl systems tp could be completely removed largely due to the chemical oxidation reaction adsorption between colloidal products and smbs and the chemical precipitation on the porous medium the detailed data variations of tp removal are shown in supplementary material the differences in microscale surface morphology between anthracite and medical stone after operation are summarized in fig 4 spongy porous structures emerged on the surface morphology of the medical stone after the 60 day period of acidic or alkaline attacks and the specific surface areas greatly increased msl2 and msl4 highly acidic influent had a greater pore density and spongier structure than msl1 and msl3 highly alkaline influent although there was almost no noticeable variation in surface morphology among the anthracite samples an observation of the performance of the msl systems in terms of tp removal revealed that msl6 and msl8 acidic environment showed a higher capacity for surface adsorption of particles than did msl5 and msl7 alkaline condition thus the microscopic pore structure optimization of medical stone was more favorable to the habitat of microorganisms and to nutrient removal the removal of nh3 n no3 n and tn among msl systems are shown in fig 2c fig 2d and fig 2e respectively at the initial period the physicochemical adsorption in pls and smbs played the dominant role in nh3 n and no3 n removal in comparison to the anthracite as filter packing only the most advantageous medical stone used in msl systems intensified the nh3 n removal from mechanism perspectives of system environment stability material microstructure optimization physical adsorption enhancement and microbial metabolic activity improvement moreover the nitrifying process in aerobic pls was the primary driver of nh3 n removal in pls in later stable operation the ph of the msl system is another important factor in the nitrification process that was explored in this study the performance of the msl systems also suggested that a neutral or alkalescent condition in the msl system is favorable for nh3 n transformation of nitrifying bacteria denitrification was mainly carried out in anaerobic smbs which were found to have a reasonable acid base buffering capacity the crushed sawdust used in the anaerobic smbs can accelerate the carbon supply for quick start denitrification however the microbial transformation of intensified denitrifying bacteria was hypersensitive to the different materials of pl denitrification under long term acidic and alkaline attacks may be inhibited in msl systems given medical stone s high bidirectional resistance to both acidic and alkaline erosion it has the characteristic which is highly conducive to protecting the activity of the functional enzyme protein in denitrifying bacteria the well activated denitrifying bacteria and equally dispersed slow release pbs as an optimal carbon source material further ensured relatively high no3 n removal rates in the msl systems for a long term denitrification played the primary role in ultimately removing nitrogen while the tn removal in turn was mainly influenced by the nh3 n removal in the nitrification process nitrogen removal was found to be almost impervious to the effects of different smx concentrations in the msl systems the details about nitrifying and denitrifying processes fig 3 with data variations related to nitrogen removal in msl systems are shown in supplementary material 3 2 smx removal in msl systems the performance and removal mechanism of smx removal in msl systems was given special attention based on the factorial design experiment from days 31 to 90 the smx concentrations in effluent and the smx removal rates in the msl systems are shown in fig 5 a and fig 5b respectively by virtue of the preincubation of the msl systems from day 0 to 30 the conditions for treating smx were more stable and mature although the smx removal capacity varied among the eight msl systems each of them showed relatively stable smx removal throughout the 60 day operational period the average effluent concentrations of smx corresponding average smx removal rates shown in parentheses of msl1 msl2 msl5 and msl6 were found to be 6 35 36 5 5 06 49 4 7 51 24 9 and 6 45 mg l 35 5 respectively based on an smx concentration of 10 mg l in the influent for msl3 msl4 msl7 and msl8 using influent with an smx concentration of 1 mg l smx the average concentrations of smx in the effluent corresponding average smx removal rates of the msl systems shown in parentheses were 0 30 70 1 0 11 89 5 0 69 31 1 and 0 42 mg l 57 8 respectively by comparing smx removal performance among the msl systems it was observed that the smx concentrations in effluent increased with increasing concentration level of smx in the influent although there were relatively low removal efficiencies of smx in the msl systems that had a high concentration of smx in the wastewater which still corresponding to a high net removal of smx the maximum removal rates of smx were obtained at ph 3 influent in the msl systems with both high and low concentrations of smx in the influent the results showed acidic influent to be more favorable for smx removal in the msl systems than alkaline influent in the acidic environment it was found that neutral smx molecules with strong hydrophobicity yang et al 2011 could be more easily adsorbed on microporous medical stone with larger specific surface area and more abundant adsorption sites as well soils however alkaline influent at ph 9 was found to have a negative effect on smx removal due to the proton dissociation in amidogen of smx when the ph increased to 9 all the smx molecules were found to be in the anionic speciation of smx which is the predominant chemical form when influent ph is higher than pka2 5 6 fig 5c kobayashi et al 2017 srinivasan and sarmah 2014 smx sorption affinity to soils was found to decrease with increasing ph of wastewater an observation which is attributable to the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic form smx and negatively charged soil particles shen et al 2018a srinivasan and sarmah 2014 zhao et al 2019b although the long term alkaline treatment in some msl systems spongy and porous medical stone is advantageous in terms of their still augmented adsorption capacity on hydrophilic smx compared to hard dense anthracite given the microporous structure and specific surface area as the most important basis in adsorption material characteristic of pl is the more important factor than ph level with respect to smx removal under complex conditions in addition the hydrogen bond interaction between smx and soil particles or clay minerals is important since it has a positive contribution in promoting sulfonamide sa sorption mohatt et al 2011 the surface complexation between smx and the metal fe hydroxides in smbs also contributes to enhance its adsorption in this context adsorption was considered the key mechanism for smx removal during contact between wastewater and smbs pls in our study as a result under the conditions of low ph low smx concentration in influent and the use of medical stone as material of pl i e msl4 the msl system exhibited the best smx removal performance 91 msl2 using medical stone also exhibited the high net removal of smx 52 3 in spite of the high concentrations of smx in the influent 10 mg l generally smx removal in soil based systems is primarily a function of the combined effect of abiotic and biotic factors srinivasan and sarmah 2014 however the dominant mechanism of smx removal in msl systems was more likely to be reflective of abiotic adsorption processes biotic effects could be the auxiliary mechanisms based on the conditional stimuli in smbs furthermore the upper layers of the msl systems played the main role in smx adsorption removal the significant concentrations of smx were also found in the upper layer of cw system button et al 2019 the upper layers could also provide a buffer effect to prevent microbes in the remaining layers from being destroyed or inhibited by smx the previous microcosm adsorption experiments using wetland soils showed that antibiotics in a biotic system were more effectively removed than antibiotics in an abiotic system indicating that soil mediated microbial degradation was a potential mechanism in msl systems associated with antibiotics removal in wastewater choi et al 2016 it was probable that a portion of smx could be gradually degradable in smbs through microbiological metabolism of soil microorganisms with the accumulation of most adsorbed smx in smbs the reasoning details about the possible biodegradation of smx in msl system are discussed in 3 5 section 3 3 significant factorial effects on smx removal the statistical significance of effects from individual factors and their interactions can be ascertained through factorial analysis li et al 2018 xin et al 2019 fig s3 shows the normal plots of residuals for factorial analysis on six responses for all the responses of concern in this case the points fell approximately along a straight line indicating normal distribution and thus a reliable set of experimental data for factorial analysis shen et al 2017 the anova results for the factorial analysis of cod removal r1 tp removal r2 nh3 n removal r3 no3 n removal r4 tn removal r5 and smx removal r6 are shown in table s3 as can be seen in the table the statistical p value of prob f which was much lower than 0 05 implying that the factorial model for the response is significant jing et al 2015 the symbols and preceding the values of standardized effects it should be noted are indicative of positive and negative effects respectively of the factor on the response while the absolute value of standardized effect represents the magnitude of the factorial effect on the response after standardization the pareto chart of effects on smx removal as shown in fig 6 a was also used to not only distinguish the main influences and interactions of all components but also visualize positive or negative effects of factors using different color the pareto charts of effects on the removal of organics and nutrients are summarized in fig s4 as can be seen in the figure in each pareto chart all the factorial effects were arranged in descending order with their significance levels indicated by the length of column song et al 2018b the detailed factorial analyses for r1 r5 are presented in the supplementary material the effects of all individual factors on smx removal r6 in msl systems were found to be significant with high absolute values of standardized effects as shown in table s3 and fig 6a the most significant negative and positive factors were b concentration of smx p 0 001 ser6 28 1 and a material of pl p 0 001 ser6 27 5 respectively this result indicates that a high concentration of smx in influent has a significant impact on smx removal however favorable medical stone could intensify the adsorption of smx under both acidic and alkaline conditions furthermore the larger surface area of medical stone in pls could promote the adsorption efficiency of smx regarding our findings the smx speciation in alkaline influent ph 9 was found to exhibit electrostatic repulsion to the negatively charged soils while acidic influent had contributed significantly to microstructure optimization of the medical stone thus factor c ph of influent also exhibited a negative effect p 0 001 ser6 21 8 on smx removal the effects of factorial interactions among factors on smx removal are shown in fig 6b d where the two approximately parallel lines in the interaction plot indicate that there is almost no interactive effect between two factors shen et al 2017 xin et al 2019 for instance for interaction a c p 0 1 and ser6 1 0 while for interaction b c p 0 1 and ser6 0 1 these findings confirm the details presented in table s3 and fig 6a however an intersection point on the left extension of the two lines indicates a potential interactive effect between a and b the different slopes of the two lines meanwhile show that a b has the most significant negative interactive effect on smx removal p 0 001 ser6 11 7 the findings indicate that smx removal could be improved by using medical stone in place of anthracite regardless of the smx concentration this was likely attributable to the fact that the adsorption process plays a more prominent role in smx removal the findings also show an obvious increase in smx removal performance as the smx concentration in the influent decreases for the purpose of our study the analysis of interactive effect encompassed possible synergy or antagonism rather than simple superposition of independent factors based on the results of factorial analysis on smx removal the optimal operating conditions with the most favorable factorial levels were determined as shown in fig 6e the cube plot indicates that the optimal msl performance is achieved when using medical stone a2 as material of pl to treat wastewater with low smx concentration b and an acidic environment c 3 4 stepwise cluster inference sci modeling of smx removal during msl system operation smx removal over time was accompanied by efficient removal of cod nitrogen and phosphorus multiple variations in do and orp and ph considering the role of internal interactions it was considered that the above responses are related to smx removal to better understand the relationship between smx removal and these responses sci model and multiple linear regression mlr were applied and the results compared sci model it should be noted can accommodate both continuous and discrete variables and can also accommodate both nonlinear relationships between multi variables and smx removal rate while mlr can only characterize linear relationships choi et al 2019 wang et al 2015 for both models the variables included time x1 cod removal x2 tp removal x3 nh3 n removal x4 no3 n removal x5 tn removal x6 do x7 orp x8 and ph x9 smx removal rate was the only output y among the 48 datasets 40 sets were used for model calibration while the remaining 8 sets were used for validation r square r2 and root mean squared error rmse analyses were applied in order to evaluate the model fig 7 a d shows that the sci had a higher r2 0 972 than the mlr 0 625 meaning a higher accuracy the lower rmse 3 163 of sci validation than that of mlr 14 175 similarly confirmed that sci model had higher precision in prediction sci model was better performed than mlr for both simulation and prediction of smx removal with respect to all the tested responses the stepwise cluster tree that was established in simulating smx removal efficiency is presented in fig 7e which clearly illustrates the role of independent variables in mapping their relationship with smx removal in the operation of stepwise cluster method one data cluster could be divided into two sub data clusters while in turn two could be merged into a new data cluster during the iterative calibration process sun et al 2009 step by step a classification tree in the probability sense could thus be established when no data clusters could be further divided or merged this based on a series of division merger processes satisfying the given statistical criteria hong et al 2019 the results demonstrate the feasibility and capability of sci model to process discrete datasets as well as to quantify fit and forecast nonlinear relationships between smx removal and water quality parameter variation during msl system operation 3 5 microbial community analyses related to smx removal in smbs because smx can inhibit soil microorganism activity and influence its distribution and diversity shen et al 2018a song et al 2018a microbial community structure in smbs after long term smx removal was analyzed here the operational taxonomic unit otu represents the total quantity of bacteria used to evaluate bacterial diversity liu et al 2012 shen et al 2018b wang et al 2019 as can be seen in fig 8 a the otu in each sample approached saturation when the sequencing quantity exceeds 40 000 meaning that this quantity is sufficient to characterize the maximum bacteria amount the percentage of otu coverage from s0 to s10 meanwhile was found to range from 99 60 to 99 89 suggesting a good sequencing quality based on the bacterial classification results table s4 a genus level was selected for further analyses such a level is associated with both high bacteria amount and large difference between s0 and s1 s10 as compared to the other levels fig s5 shows the evolutionary relationships among bacteria as characterized using the megan taxonomic evolutionary tree while fig 8b uses a cluster tree to represent correlations between samples with respect to microbial community s0 s8 here a connecting line with a shorter length indicates that the two samples connected by the line are of similar taxonomic composition song et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b s3 s4 s7 and s8 given their similarly low levels of smx were grouped together while s2 s5 and s6 with their high levels of smx were assigned to the other group the results indicate that smx concentration has an a significant influence on bacterial composition demoling et al 2009 fig 9 presents the relative abundance of the top 25 bacteria in all samples where a wider relation column indicates a higher relative abundance of the given bacterium in the sample dechloromonas has been identified as a predominant bacterium in smx degradation and removal in a prior study involving a cw system coupled with microbial fuel cells zhang et al 2018a in our study the relative abundance levels of dechloromonas in s2 s4 and s6 are 3 1 11 6 and 5 2 respectively indicating that dechloromonas is related to the acidic condition in msl systems compared to s2 and s6 dechloromonas was found to have higher relative abundance level in s4 with a lower smx concentration opitutus meanwhile has been described in the literature as a bacterium with a resistance gene in activated sludge for the treatment of wastewater with high concentrations of antibiotics zhao et al 2019a in our study the abundance levels of opitutus are found to be relatively high in s1 and s5 8 7 and 12 7 respectively and in s4 and s8 9 3 and 6 1 respectively this finding suggests that opitutus could become more resistant to an alkaline environment with high smx concentration and a weak acidic one with low smx another bacterium klebsiella has been significantly detected in sputum and feces of patients treated with amoxicillin cephalosporin and smx suggesting its resistance to these antibiotics kumar et al 2019 our study shows that klebsiella is the most dominant bacterium with the highest relative abundance levels of 29 3 and 25 9 in s2 and s6 respectively these findings signal high resistance to an acidic environment with high smx concentration therefore among the identified top bacteria dechloromonas opitutus and klebsiella could be considered the most dominant bacteria in terms of their resistance to smx with potential degrading capacity in msl systems in reference to the control s0 these three bacteria were only found to be present in the samples s1 to s8 containing smx fig 10 a shows the total relative abundance of these three bacteria to be 34 2 2 2 22 6 14 5 31 9 2 3 and 7 0 from s2 to s8 respectively fig 10b meanwhile shows a nonlinear regression between total abundance of the above three bacteria and the net smx removal at the end of experiment day 90 the r2 value of 0 77 demonstrates a relatively significant relationship between total abundance of resistant bacteria and smx concentration in wastewater the higher abundance of smx resistant bacteria the stronger capacity for smx removal it can also be inferred from this analysis that high abundance levels of dechloromonas opitutus and klebsiella could contribute significantly to smx removal the bacterial analyses for the removal of organics phosphorus and nitrogen are shown in the supplementary material smx concentration and ph were taken into consideration in redundancy analysis rda due to their more direct influence of than material of pl on smb the rda biplot fig 10c was conducted in order to better understand the relationship between environmental conditions smx concentration and ph and bacterial abundance it was found that rda1 explained 18 92 of the total variability while rda2 explained 10 76 the smx concerned relationship classified as rda2 was given special attention the length of the dotted arrow line and that of solid arrow line represent the bacterial abundance and the effect of the environmental conditions respectively in reference to the figure and as has been noted elsewhere in literature song et al 2020 the smaller angle between bacterial abundance and smx concentration indicates a closer relationship between specific bacterium percentage and smx amount an acute angle meanwhile points to a positive correlation between the two lines forming the angle only bacteria with the top 10 relative abundance percentages in all samples were incorporated into the rda results klebsiella and opitutus were the closest two bacteria to one another in terms of smx concentration indicating that in both cases the abundance of the bacterium is positively correlated with smx removal a finding which is consistent with previous analyses in addition as has been noted elsewhere in literature cang et al 2007 ph could also affect bacterial abundance in this regard in our study we found that the abundance of opitutus had a positive relationship with alkaline environment while the abundance of klebsiella had a negative relationship with acidic environment in smbs 4 conclusions as an energy saving and eco friendly technology vertical flow msl system is an attractive option for decentralized treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics in rural settings this study constitutes the first attempt in investigating the main and interactive effects of material of pl concentration of smx and ph of influent in the smx removal process it was found that smx concentration had significantly negative effect on smx removal in msl systems acidic influent is more favorable for smx removal in the msl systems than alkaline influent compared to anthracite the medical stone with larger surface area could intensify the smx removal the optimal msl performance on smx removal is achieved under the conditions of low ph low smx concentration in influent and the use of medical stone as material of pl in msl systems adsorption is considered the key mechanism for smx removal during contact between wastewater and smbs pls in our study the novel use in this study of the stepwise cluster method which was demonstrated has great feasibility and capability to process discrete datasets as well as to quantify fit and forecast nonlinear relationships between smx removal and water quality parameter variation the results of microbial diversity analysis indicated that higher abundance of dechloromonas opitutus and klebsiella among the identified top bacteria could be considered as the most dominant bacteria in terms of their resistance to smx with potential degradation capacity in msl systems to gain better understanding of the mechanisms underlying smx removal further research and follow up experiments can be conducted to investigate the adaptive variations of microbial communities at the genomic level in msl systems as well as how these adaptations are influenced by smx concentration high efficiency removal of other emerging micropollutants and other organic compounds in rural decentralized wastewater may be achievable through msl system in the near future

17417,sulfamethoxazole smx is the most widely distributed sulfonamide antibiotics detected in decentralized poultry wastewater in rural communities as an economically feasible and eco friendly technology for decentralized wastewater treatment in rural areas vertical flow multi soil layering msl system was promising to mitigate the ecological and human health risks from smx in such areas the treatment of smx contained poultry wastewater by using msl systems was investigated for the first time and the main and interactive effects of related multiple variables on system performance were explored through factorial analysis including material of permeable layer concentration of smx and ph of influent results indicated that smx concentration and ph of influent showed significantly negative effects on smx removal medical stone used in msl systems with larger surface area could intensify the smx removal compared to anthracite msl systems showed stable performances on smx removal with the best smx removal efficiency more than 91 a novel stepwise cluster inference sci model was developed for the first time to map the multivariate numeric relationships between state variables and smx removal under discrete and nonlinear complexities it was demonstrated that the effect of smx in wastewater with high concentration was significant on the differentiation of soil bacteria composition in msl systems based on microbial diversity analysis these results can help better understand the mechanism of smx removal in msl systems from perspectives of factorial analysis numeric modeling and microbiological change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords poultry wastewater multi soil layering system sulfamethoxazole interactive effect stepwise cluster inference microbial diversity 1 introduction in rural areas with large scale poultry breeding antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole smx are commonly used for illness prevention infection treatment and growth promotion moore 2019 sun et al 2020 however the majority of applied antibiotics can hardly be completely metabolized by the animals such that a mass of unused antibiotics and their metabolic products may be gradually excreted following livestock ingestion dalkmann et al 2014 the released antibiotics may pose serious risks to water security and human health christou et al 2017 liu et al 2014 furthermore long term exposure to such antibiotics may alter the microbial diversity of specific environments ziembinska buczynska and miksch 2016 in particular this issue is of great concern in decentralized rural communities and is garnering growing attention over the world rodriguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 thomas et al 2019 a number of studies were reported in employing emerging soil based technologies to mitigate ecological and human health risks of smx for example song et al 2018a demonstrated the high removal efficiency of smx in vertical up flow constructed wetland cw although it should be noted that this approach required continuous electrical energy consumption to overcome gravitational potential liang et al 2018 meanwhile documented 50 to 70 removal of smx using conventional cw however other studies have identified inadequacies of this approach such as the large land space requirement low loading rate and regional clogging in other studies smx exhibited moderate fluctuating in some cases even somewhat low removal performance when using cw as the treatment method hijosa valsero et al 2011 park et al 2009 the vertical flow multi soil layering msl system is an economically feasible and eco friendly wastewater treatment technology song et al 2018b msl system features ingenious structure small footprint zero energy consumption easy operation and maintenance long term operation lifespan and esthetic value in addition to being eco friendly and odorless an et al 2016 song et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the unique characteristics of msl system in terms of construction structure water distribution medium conditions can facilitate the removal for a variety of contaminants in rural wastewater a number of prior studies have demonstrated significantly improved performance of msl system as compared with those of conventional land based wastewater treatment processes although the findings of previous studies are encouraging few studies have focused on the treatment of antibiotics in wastewater using msl system letting alone investigating the removal of smx in particular several studies have indicated that anaerobic conditions are favorable for smx removal park et al 2009 while others have asserted that smx could be more effectively degraded under aerobic conditions baumgarten et al 2011 the aerobic and anaerobic conditions are facilitated through the placement of permeable layers pls and soil mixture blocks smbs respectively within msl system hong et al 2019 song et al 2018b however the performance of msl system on smx removal and the effects of smx on the inherent microbial communities have not yet been studied and the underlying mechanisms has not been examined moreover many impact factors may interact with each other leading to composite effects on smx removal it is thus of interest to explore such effects and their physicochemical and biochemical implications this study constitutes the first attempt of factorial analysis for the effects of multiple state variables material of pl concentration of smx and ph of influent and their interactions on smx removal furthermore a novel stepwise cluster inference sci model is developed to tackle the discrete and nonlinear complexities in relationships among smx removal and related impact factors the impacts of smx on microbial communities have also been explored as well as the relationships between specific bacteria and smx removal overall as the first attempt this study is targeted on the investigation of smx removal in msl systems under multiple complexities in microbiological processes and relevant factorial relationships 2 materials and methods 2 1 factorial design of msl based experiment the experimental msl systems are shown in fig 1 a and the details with the constructions are available in the supplementary material in this study three state variables including a material of pl b concentration of smx and c ph of influent were considered given their significance in wastewater treatment processes concerning smx removal to explore the interactions among these three operating factors the experiments were carried out using a 23 factorial design method the different two types of factor a were denoted as a1 anthracite and a2 medical stone in the experiment elevated smx concentrations were used to reflect the characteristics of discharge in rural poultry wastewater from decentralized pollution sources with two possible extreme scenarios for peak smx concentrations in wastewater considered baumgarten et al 2011 liang et al 2018 xu et al 2011 thus the low and high levels of factor b were denoted by the actual concentration values b 1 00 and b 10 00 mg l respectively analytical grade smx cas no 723 46 6 with a purity of 98 was purchased from aladdine shanghai china the physiochemical properties of smx are shown in table s1 according to the pka of the given smx molecule then the low and high levels of factor c were named according to the actual ph values of 3 00 c and 9 00 c respectively to ensure sufficient dissolution of smx in acidic and alkaline conditions while maintaining the different molecular states of smx a detailed representation of the experimental design is shown in fig 1b 2 2 operation of msl systems there were ten msl systems which were identified as msl1 to msl10 in the laboratory twelve 130 l plastic barrels six plastic barrels of synthetic wastewater supply and other six plastic barrels of treated water collection were used in experiment fig 1b the experiment commenced with a 30 day preincubation period day 1 to day 30 during this period all the msl systems were fed with synthetic wastewater containing no smx and no adjustment of ph the purpose of this exercise was to ensure the stable performance and similar contaminant removal efficiency of the different msl systems at the outset of smx removal it was observed that the performance of the different msl systems was almost unaffected by materials of pl during the preincubation period for the smx removal experiments day 31 to day 90 msl3 msl4 msl7 and msl8 were used to treat wastewater with an smx concentration of 1 mg l msl1 msl2 msl5 and msl6 were used to treat wastewater with an smx concentration of 10 mg l and msl9 and msl10 were used as controls to treat wastewater containing no smx in addition the ph of influent in all msl systems was adjusted according to the factorial design beginning on day 31 the 60 day smx removal experiment was performed in the dark with the msl systems under observation msl1 to msl8 wrapped with aluminum foil to prevent photodegradation of the smx based on the universal characteristics of rural poultry wastewater quality an et al 2016 jia et al 2017 the quantity of required chemicals for preparing synthetic wastewater used throughout this experiment and the related influent water quality were determined as shown in table s2 the initial ph of the influent was adjusted using naoh and hcl solutions respectively synthetic wastewater was fed continuously into the msl systems through the upmost silicone tubing with 5 water droppers using peristaltic pumps kamoer fluid tech co ltd shanghai china during the experimental period the temperatures of all msl systems were kept at 22 1 c furthermore the hydraulic loading rate hlr was set at 320 l m2 d for all msl systems with a hydraulic residence time hrt of 37 3 h throughout the 90 day operational period the performance of the msl systems was evaluated by monitoring the physicochemical parameters of the water including the ph of effluent dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp as well as the water quality parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and total nitrogen tn raw effluent samples from the sampling outlet of each msl system were collected at 10 day intervals for the purpose of monitoring water parameters smx concentration in the effluent was also monitored at 10 day beginning at day 31 2 3 analytical methods all the water physicochemical parameters and water quality parameters were measured according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 with the methods available in the supplementary material smx in the effluent was analyzed using a shimadzu liquid chromatography lc spectrometry system lc 2030 prominence i japan the solid phase extraction spe for the smx enrichment and the details of smx measurement were presented in the supplementary material anthracite or medical stone samples of 1 g were taken at the third pl for all 10 msls where the microstructure of the materials was observed using a jsm 7001f scanning electron microscope jeol ltd japan with an accelerating voltage of 15 0 kv 2 4 microbial diversity analysis of soils in the investigation each smb of a given msl system was treated like a miniature soil ecosystem where the degree of biological activity could influence the overall smx removal performance and vice versa to gain insight of the inherent nature of microorganisms in msl system the bacterial diversity in smb derived soil samples was investigated through the high throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial rrna genes on the illumina hiseq 2500 sequencing platform the relationship between the microscopic mechanism and the microbiological characteristics in smbs as it relates to msl performance was characterized with particular attention given to the effect of smx removal and microbial feedbacks in order to compare the variations of bacterial diversity among the 10 msl systems both soil s0 and soil samples s1 to s10 from the smbs were analyzed a 100 g fresh soil sample of s1 s8 was collected from each of the ten smbs 10 10 g in each msl system at the end of the 60 day smx removal experiment as well a 100 g fresh soil sample was collected from control group s9 and s10 at the end of operation 90 days the detailed operational approaches concerning microbial sequencing are shown in the supplementary material 2 5 data analysis design expert 8 0 stat ease inc usa was applied for factorial analysis and statistical analysis through the results of one way analysis of variance anova the originpro software 2017 originlab corporation usa was used for drafting linear nonlinear fitting and for performing multiple linear regression mlr analysis of the experimental data sci model was performed using the stepwise cluster method package in r 3 4 3 software mathsoft inc usa for a stepwise cluster method flowchart with detailed descriptions the interested reader may refer to our previous work sun et al 2009 wang et al 2015 any correlation level with p 0 05 is considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic matter and nutrients removal in msl systems the variations of the physicochemical parameters including ph do and orp of effluent are shown in figs s1 s2a and s2b respectively long term operation using acidic and alkaline influent was the most important factor in the significant ph variation of effluent and environmental conditions in all the msl systems meanwhile the do concentrations of effluent remained at a high level throughout the stable experiment the relatively high orp 100 mv showed the oxidation environment is predominant in all msl systems at the final stage the detailed analyses are shown in supplementary material the removal of cod and tp in the different msl systems is shown in figs 2 a and 2b respecitvely during the preincubation period of operation newly constructed msl systems and especially the upper smbs and pls have abundant minute pore spaces and adsorption sites which were available for trapping phosphorous compounds various microorganisms and their needed organics the msl systems performed well at removing organic matter during days 0 to 30 however during days 40 to 90 there were significant decrease and slow recovery of biochemical degradation capacity and the less than ideal final performance in four of the msl systems for treating high concentration smx influent meanwhile other msl systems exhibited excellent performance on cod removal at rates ranging from 95 5 to 97 5 moreover there were inapparent effects of different factorial levels of influent ph and materials of pl on cod removal whether the wastewater contained smx or not the detailed data variations of cod removal are shown in supplementary material the chemical processes for tp removal are shown in fig 3 indeed ph was the key parameter influencing the process of chemical phosphorus removal and the forms of phosphorous chemical products present in msl systems a high ph of influent 9 could significantly promote tp removal while the highly acidic environment 3 in msl systems directly resulted in neutralization with final fe oh 3 adsorbents and secondary release of phosphate radicals in the well performing msl systems tp could be completely removed largely due to the chemical oxidation reaction adsorption between colloidal products and smbs and the chemical precipitation on the porous medium the detailed data variations of tp removal are shown in supplementary material the differences in microscale surface morphology between anthracite and medical stone after operation are summarized in fig 4 spongy porous structures emerged on the surface morphology of the medical stone after the 60 day period of acidic or alkaline attacks and the specific surface areas greatly increased msl2 and msl4 highly acidic influent had a greater pore density and spongier structure than msl1 and msl3 highly alkaline influent although there was almost no noticeable variation in surface morphology among the anthracite samples an observation of the performance of the msl systems in terms of tp removal revealed that msl6 and msl8 acidic environment showed a higher capacity for surface adsorption of particles than did msl5 and msl7 alkaline condition thus the microscopic pore structure optimization of medical stone was more favorable to the habitat of microorganisms and to nutrient removal the removal of nh3 n no3 n and tn among msl systems are shown in fig 2c fig 2d and fig 2e respectively at the initial period the physicochemical adsorption in pls and smbs played the dominant role in nh3 n and no3 n removal in comparison to the anthracite as filter packing only the most advantageous medical stone used in msl systems intensified the nh3 n removal from mechanism perspectives of system environment stability material microstructure optimization physical adsorption enhancement and microbial metabolic activity improvement moreover the nitrifying process in aerobic pls was the primary driver of nh3 n removal in pls in later stable operation the ph of the msl system is another important factor in the nitrification process that was explored in this study the performance of the msl systems also suggested that a neutral or alkalescent condition in the msl system is favorable for nh3 n transformation of nitrifying bacteria denitrification was mainly carried out in anaerobic smbs which were found to have a reasonable acid base buffering capacity the crushed sawdust used in the anaerobic smbs can accelerate the carbon supply for quick start denitrification however the microbial transformation of intensified denitrifying bacteria was hypersensitive to the different materials of pl denitrification under long term acidic and alkaline attacks may be inhibited in msl systems given medical stone s high bidirectional resistance to both acidic and alkaline erosion it has the characteristic which is highly conducive to protecting the activity of the functional enzyme protein in denitrifying bacteria the well activated denitrifying bacteria and equally dispersed slow release pbs as an optimal carbon source material further ensured relatively high no3 n removal rates in the msl systems for a long term denitrification played the primary role in ultimately removing nitrogen while the tn removal in turn was mainly influenced by the nh3 n removal in the nitrification process nitrogen removal was found to be almost impervious to the effects of different smx concentrations in the msl systems the details about nitrifying and denitrifying processes fig 3 with data variations related to nitrogen removal in msl systems are shown in supplementary material 3 2 smx removal in msl systems the performance and removal mechanism of smx removal in msl systems was given special attention based on the factorial design experiment from days 31 to 90 the smx concentrations in effluent and the smx removal rates in the msl systems are shown in fig 5 a and fig 5b respectively by virtue of the preincubation of the msl systems from day 0 to 30 the conditions for treating smx were more stable and mature although the smx removal capacity varied among the eight msl systems each of them showed relatively stable smx removal throughout the 60 day operational period the average effluent concentrations of smx corresponding average smx removal rates shown in parentheses of msl1 msl2 msl5 and msl6 were found to be 6 35 36 5 5 06 49 4 7 51 24 9 and 6 45 mg l 35 5 respectively based on an smx concentration of 10 mg l in the influent for msl3 msl4 msl7 and msl8 using influent with an smx concentration of 1 mg l smx the average concentrations of smx in the effluent corresponding average smx removal rates of the msl systems shown in parentheses were 0 30 70 1 0 11 89 5 0 69 31 1 and 0 42 mg l 57 8 respectively by comparing smx removal performance among the msl systems it was observed that the smx concentrations in effluent increased with increasing concentration level of smx in the influent although there were relatively low removal efficiencies of smx in the msl systems that had a high concentration of smx in the wastewater which still corresponding to a high net removal of smx the maximum removal rates of smx were obtained at ph 3 influent in the msl systems with both high and low concentrations of smx in the influent the results showed acidic influent to be more favorable for smx removal in the msl systems than alkaline influent in the acidic environment it was found that neutral smx molecules with strong hydrophobicity yang et al 2011 could be more easily adsorbed on microporous medical stone with larger specific surface area and more abundant adsorption sites as well soils however alkaline influent at ph 9 was found to have a negative effect on smx removal due to the proton dissociation in amidogen of smx when the ph increased to 9 all the smx molecules were found to be in the anionic speciation of smx which is the predominant chemical form when influent ph is higher than pka2 5 6 fig 5c kobayashi et al 2017 srinivasan and sarmah 2014 smx sorption affinity to soils was found to decrease with increasing ph of wastewater an observation which is attributable to the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic form smx and negatively charged soil particles shen et al 2018a srinivasan and sarmah 2014 zhao et al 2019b although the long term alkaline treatment in some msl systems spongy and porous medical stone is advantageous in terms of their still augmented adsorption capacity on hydrophilic smx compared to hard dense anthracite given the microporous structure and specific surface area as the most important basis in adsorption material characteristic of pl is the more important factor than ph level with respect to smx removal under complex conditions in addition the hydrogen bond interaction between smx and soil particles or clay minerals is important since it has a positive contribution in promoting sulfonamide sa sorption mohatt et al 2011 the surface complexation between smx and the metal fe hydroxides in smbs also contributes to enhance its adsorption in this context adsorption was considered the key mechanism for smx removal during contact between wastewater and smbs pls in our study as a result under the conditions of low ph low smx concentration in influent and the use of medical stone as material of pl i e msl4 the msl system exhibited the best smx removal performance 91 msl2 using medical stone also exhibited the high net removal of smx 52 3 in spite of the high concentrations of smx in the influent 10 mg l generally smx removal in soil based systems is primarily a function of the combined effect of abiotic and biotic factors srinivasan and sarmah 2014 however the dominant mechanism of smx removal in msl systems was more likely to be reflective of abiotic adsorption processes biotic effects could be the auxiliary mechanisms based on the conditional stimuli in smbs furthermore the upper layers of the msl systems played the main role in smx adsorption removal the significant concentrations of smx were also found in the upper layer of cw system button et al 2019 the upper layers could also provide a buffer effect to prevent microbes in the remaining layers from being destroyed or inhibited by smx the previous microcosm adsorption experiments using wetland soils showed that antibiotics in a biotic system were more effectively removed than antibiotics in an abiotic system indicating that soil mediated microbial degradation was a potential mechanism in msl systems associated with antibiotics removal in wastewater choi et al 2016 it was probable that a portion of smx could be gradually degradable in smbs through microbiological metabolism of soil microorganisms with the accumulation of most adsorbed smx in smbs the reasoning details about the possible biodegradation of smx in msl system are discussed in 3 5 section 3 3 significant factorial effects on smx removal the statistical significance of effects from individual factors and their interactions can be ascertained through factorial analysis li et al 2018 xin et al 2019 fig s3 shows the normal plots of residuals for factorial analysis on six responses for all the responses of concern in this case the points fell approximately along a straight line indicating normal distribution and thus a reliable set of experimental data for factorial analysis shen et al 2017 the anova results for the factorial analysis of cod removal r1 tp removal r2 nh3 n removal r3 no3 n removal r4 tn removal r5 and smx removal r6 are shown in table s3 as can be seen in the table the statistical p value of prob f which was much lower than 0 05 implying that the factorial model for the response is significant jing et al 2015 the symbols and preceding the values of standardized effects it should be noted are indicative of positive and negative effects respectively of the factor on the response while the absolute value of standardized effect represents the magnitude of the factorial effect on the response after standardization the pareto chart of effects on smx removal as shown in fig 6 a was also used to not only distinguish the main influences and interactions of all components but also visualize positive or negative effects of factors using different color the pareto charts of effects on the removal of organics and nutrients are summarized in fig s4 as can be seen in the figure in each pareto chart all the factorial effects were arranged in descending order with their significance levels indicated by the length of column song et al 2018b the detailed factorial analyses for r1 r5 are presented in the supplementary material the effects of all individual factors on smx removal r6 in msl systems were found to be significant with high absolute values of standardized effects as shown in table s3 and fig 6a the most significant negative and positive factors were b concentration of smx p 0 001 ser6 28 1 and a material of pl p 0 001 ser6 27 5 respectively this result indicates that a high concentration of smx in influent has a significant impact on smx removal however favorable medical stone could intensify the adsorption of smx under both acidic and alkaline conditions furthermore the larger surface area of medical stone in pls could promote the adsorption efficiency of smx regarding our findings the smx speciation in alkaline influent ph 9 was found to exhibit electrostatic repulsion to the negatively charged soils while acidic influent had contributed significantly to microstructure optimization of the medical stone thus factor c ph of influent also exhibited a negative effect p 0 001 ser6 21 8 on smx removal the effects of factorial interactions among factors on smx removal are shown in fig 6b d where the two approximately parallel lines in the interaction plot indicate that there is almost no interactive effect between two factors shen et al 2017 xin et al 2019 for instance for interaction a c p 0 1 and ser6 1 0 while for interaction b c p 0 1 and ser6 0 1 these findings confirm the details presented in table s3 and fig 6a however an intersection point on the left extension of the two lines indicates a potential interactive effect between a and b the different slopes of the two lines meanwhile show that a b has the most significant negative interactive effect on smx removal p 0 001 ser6 11 7 the findings indicate that smx removal could be improved by using medical stone in place of anthracite regardless of the smx concentration this was likely attributable to the fact that the adsorption process plays a more prominent role in smx removal the findings also show an obvious increase in smx removal performance as the smx concentration in the influent decreases for the purpose of our study the analysis of interactive effect encompassed possible synergy or antagonism rather than simple superposition of independent factors based on the results of factorial analysis on smx removal the optimal operating conditions with the most favorable factorial levels were determined as shown in fig 6e the cube plot indicates that the optimal msl performance is achieved when using medical stone a2 as material of pl to treat wastewater with low smx concentration b and an acidic environment c 3 4 stepwise cluster inference sci modeling of smx removal during msl system operation smx removal over time was accompanied by efficient removal of cod nitrogen and phosphorus multiple variations in do and orp and ph considering the role of internal interactions it was considered that the above responses are related to smx removal to better understand the relationship between smx removal and these responses sci model and multiple linear regression mlr were applied and the results compared sci model it should be noted can accommodate both continuous and discrete variables and can also accommodate both nonlinear relationships between multi variables and smx removal rate while mlr can only characterize linear relationships choi et al 2019 wang et al 2015 for both models the variables included time x1 cod removal x2 tp removal x3 nh3 n removal x4 no3 n removal x5 tn removal x6 do x7 orp x8 and ph x9 smx removal rate was the only output y among the 48 datasets 40 sets were used for model calibration while the remaining 8 sets were used for validation r square r2 and root mean squared error rmse analyses were applied in order to evaluate the model fig 7 a d shows that the sci had a higher r2 0 972 than the mlr 0 625 meaning a higher accuracy the lower rmse 3 163 of sci validation than that of mlr 14 175 similarly confirmed that sci model had higher precision in prediction sci model was better performed than mlr for both simulation and prediction of smx removal with respect to all the tested responses the stepwise cluster tree that was established in simulating smx removal efficiency is presented in fig 7e which clearly illustrates the role of independent variables in mapping their relationship with smx removal in the operation of stepwise cluster method one data cluster could be divided into two sub data clusters while in turn two could be merged into a new data cluster during the iterative calibration process sun et al 2009 step by step a classification tree in the probability sense could thus be established when no data clusters could be further divided or merged this based on a series of division merger processes satisfying the given statistical criteria hong et al 2019 the results demonstrate the feasibility and capability of sci model to process discrete datasets as well as to quantify fit and forecast nonlinear relationships between smx removal and water quality parameter variation during msl system operation 3 5 microbial community analyses related to smx removal in smbs because smx can inhibit soil microorganism activity and influence its distribution and diversity shen et al 2018a song et al 2018a microbial community structure in smbs after long term smx removal was analyzed here the operational taxonomic unit otu represents the total quantity of bacteria used to evaluate bacterial diversity liu et al 2012 shen et al 2018b wang et al 2019 as can be seen in fig 8 a the otu in each sample approached saturation when the sequencing quantity exceeds 40 000 meaning that this quantity is sufficient to characterize the maximum bacteria amount the percentage of otu coverage from s0 to s10 meanwhile was found to range from 99 60 to 99 89 suggesting a good sequencing quality based on the bacterial classification results table s4 a genus level was selected for further analyses such a level is associated with both high bacteria amount and large difference between s0 and s1 s10 as compared to the other levels fig s5 shows the evolutionary relationships among bacteria as characterized using the megan taxonomic evolutionary tree while fig 8b uses a cluster tree to represent correlations between samples with respect to microbial community s0 s8 here a connecting line with a shorter length indicates that the two samples connected by the line are of similar taxonomic composition song et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b s3 s4 s7 and s8 given their similarly low levels of smx were grouped together while s2 s5 and s6 with their high levels of smx were assigned to the other group the results indicate that smx concentration has an a significant influence on bacterial composition demoling et al 2009 fig 9 presents the relative abundance of the top 25 bacteria in all samples where a wider relation column indicates a higher relative abundance of the given bacterium in the sample dechloromonas has been identified as a predominant bacterium in smx degradation and removal in a prior study involving a cw system coupled with microbial fuel cells zhang et al 2018a in our study the relative abundance levels of dechloromonas in s2 s4 and s6 are 3 1 11 6 and 5 2 respectively indicating that dechloromonas is related to the acidic condition in msl systems compared to s2 and s6 dechloromonas was found to have higher relative abundance level in s4 with a lower smx concentration opitutus meanwhile has been described in the literature as a bacterium with a resistance gene in activated sludge for the treatment of wastewater with high concentrations of antibiotics zhao et al 2019a in our study the abundance levels of opitutus are found to be relatively high in s1 and s5 8 7 and 12 7 respectively and in s4 and s8 9 3 and 6 1 respectively this finding suggests that opitutus could become more resistant to an alkaline environment with high smx concentration and a weak acidic one with low smx another bacterium klebsiella has been significantly detected in sputum and feces of patients treated with amoxicillin cephalosporin and smx suggesting its resistance to these antibiotics kumar et al 2019 our study shows that klebsiella is the most dominant bacterium with the highest relative abundance levels of 29 3 and 25 9 in s2 and s6 respectively these findings signal high resistance to an acidic environment with high smx concentration therefore among the identified top bacteria dechloromonas opitutus and klebsiella could be considered the most dominant bacteria in terms of their resistance to smx with potential degrading capacity in msl systems in reference to the control s0 these three bacteria were only found to be present in the samples s1 to s8 containing smx fig 10 a shows the total relative abundance of these three bacteria to be 34 2 2 2 22 6 14 5 31 9 2 3 and 7 0 from s2 to s8 respectively fig 10b meanwhile shows a nonlinear regression between total abundance of the above three bacteria and the net smx removal at the end of experiment day 90 the r2 value of 0 77 demonstrates a relatively significant relationship between total abundance of resistant bacteria and smx concentration in wastewater the higher abundance of smx resistant bacteria the stronger capacity for smx removal it can also be inferred from this analysis that high abundance levels of dechloromonas opitutus and klebsiella could contribute significantly to smx removal the bacterial analyses for the removal of organics phosphorus and nitrogen are shown in the supplementary material smx concentration and ph were taken into consideration in redundancy analysis rda due to their more direct influence of than material of pl on smb the rda biplot fig 10c was conducted in order to better understand the relationship between environmental conditions smx concentration and ph and bacterial abundance it was found that rda1 explained 18 92 of the total variability while rda2 explained 10 76 the smx concerned relationship classified as rda2 was given special attention the length of the dotted arrow line and that of solid arrow line represent the bacterial abundance and the effect of the environmental conditions respectively in reference to the figure and as has been noted elsewhere in literature song et al 2020 the smaller angle between bacterial abundance and smx concentration indicates a closer relationship between specific bacterium percentage and smx amount an acute angle meanwhile points to a positive correlation between the two lines forming the angle only bacteria with the top 10 relative abundance percentages in all samples were incorporated into the rda results klebsiella and opitutus were the closest two bacteria to one another in terms of smx concentration indicating that in both cases the abundance of the bacterium is positively correlated with smx removal a finding which is consistent with previous analyses in addition as has been noted elsewhere in literature cang et al 2007 ph could also affect bacterial abundance in this regard in our study we found that the abundance of opitutus had a positive relationship with alkaline environment while the abundance of klebsiella had a negative relationship with acidic environment in smbs 4 conclusions as an energy saving and eco friendly technology vertical flow msl system is an attractive option for decentralized treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics in rural settings this study constitutes the first attempt in investigating the main and interactive effects of material of pl concentration of smx and ph of influent in the smx removal process it was found that smx concentration had significantly negative effect on smx removal in msl systems acidic influent is more favorable for smx removal in the msl systems than alkaline influent compared to anthracite the medical stone with larger surface area could intensify the smx removal the optimal msl performance on smx removal is achieved under the conditions of low ph low smx concentration in influent and the use of medical stone as material of pl in msl systems adsorption is considered the key mechanism for smx removal during contact between wastewater and smbs pls in our study the novel use in this study of the stepwise cluster method which was demonstrated has great feasibility and capability to process discrete datasets as well as to quantify fit and forecast nonlinear relationships between smx removal and water quality parameter variation the results of microbial diversity analysis indicated that higher abundance of dechloromonas opitutus and klebsiella among the identified top bacteria could be considered as the most dominant bacteria in terms of their resistance to smx with potential degradation capacity in msl systems to gain better understanding of the mechanisms underlying smx removal further research and follow up experiments can be conducted to investigate the adaptive variations of microbial communities at the genomic level in msl systems as well as how these adaptations are influenced by smx concentration high efficiency removal of other emerging micropollutants and other organic compounds in rural decentralized wastewater may be achievable through msl system in the near future

17418,environmental contamination with fertilizers is threatening biodiversity in many ecosystems due to nitrate based eutrophication one opportunity for a cost efficient nitrate elimination are denitrification beds in which a microbial community thrives under anoxic conditions with polymeric plant material as a carbon and an electron source incoming nitrate is used as electron acceptor and reduced to molecular nitrogen projects realizing denitrification beds in field scale are sparse and robust data on their efficiency throughout the year mostly not available this study analyzed the nitrate elimination efficiency and microbiology of a 216 m3 denitrification bed over the time course of more than three years phylogenetic as well as transcriptomic analysis revealed that the reactor contained a biofilm community growing on the surface of the wood chips and a planktonic community both differed in composition but their variance was affected only to a minor extend by seasonal temperature changes cellulose degradation was mainly conducted by the biofilm population while denitrification was mostly conducted by the planktonic community methanogens were detectable only to a very minor extend using online data from the nitrate concentration of in and outflowing water as well as a hydrological model to predict the water inflow it was possible to establish a process model that sufficiently describes the denitrification process this model clearly indicates that the denitrification efficiency is mostly impacted by temperature and hydraulic retention time it also suggests that the simple design of the denitrification bed most likely leads to different flow paths through the reactor depending on the volumetric flow rate this study allows for the first time a robust estimation of the necessary reactor size for nitrate removal in a moderate continental climate setting it also suggests how future denitrification beds could be improved for better performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification bed microbial diversity system limitations hydraulic model 1 introduction nitrate contamination of ground and surface water is a major environmental thread decentralized water treatment solutions are necessary to reduce the impact of nitrate in a variety of ecosystems still the realization of decentralized autonomous water treatment solutions is so far sparse which might be due to a lack of knowledge regarding their functionality and optimal reactor design principles this study addresses this limitation by assessing biological and environmental impact factors for the functionality of an autonomous denitrification reactor and integrates this fundamental knowledge in a model for operation in a moderate continental climate nitrogen is a limiting element for the primary production in many ecosystems nevertheless with the invention of the haber bosch process the release of reactive nitrogen into the environment increased overwhelmingly anthropogenic nitrogen input with 9 7 1012 mole per year even outnumbers the natural biological amount of n fixation with 7 9 1012 mole per year canfield et al 2010 excessive use of artificial fertilizer and manure led to a substantial flooding of nitrogen compounds also to non agricultural areas which in turn causes or supports eutrophication water pollution greenhouse gas production hypoxia algae blooms and a loss of biodiversity gruber and galloway 2008 overall we can observe a disturbed nitrogen cycle in favor of terrestrial nitrogen input microorganisms are the main catalysts of the overall nitrogen cycle and play an important role to restore the disturbed nitrogen balance one important stage of this cycle is the denitrification process which leads to a reduction of nitrate no3 via different intermediates no2 no n2o to atmospheric nitrogen n2 which is released to the atmosphere the successive steps of the process are catalyzed by the no3 reductase nar nap the no2 reductase nir no reductase nor and n2o reductase nos knowles 1982 nitrite reduction is considered as a key reaction for the overall process and can be conducted by two coevolved and structurally different but functionally and physiologically equivalent enzymes nirs and nirk braker et al 1998 zumft 1997 of note not all denitrifying organisms possess every reductase necessary for the complete denitrification process for instance some organisms do not contain a n2o reductase and release nitrous oxide as end product in the environment which is a 300 times more potent greenhouse gas ghg compared to co2 knowles 1982 rhode 1990 the extreme nitrate inflow into the environment via agricultural fields would often necessitate a decentralized water treatment to limit the ecological consequences of over fertilization one decentralized approach is a constructed wetland the idea of this concept is to specifically develop an ecosystem on a defined scale with the purpose to treat the nitrate influx within this constructed system and reduce an uncontrolled spreading into adjacent areas it simulates natural wetlands including vegetation substrates soils microorganisms and water wu et al 2015 however one disadvantage of these systems is a limited electron donor availability for the denitrification process which leads to very low denitrification rates lu et al 2009 to overcome this space time yield disadvantage different types of denitrifying bioreactors wall bed and layer were developed and practically realized more recently by adding an external organic carbon source which enhances the denitrification process bednarek et al 2014 these so called field denitrification beds are a cost effective approach to remove excessive amounts of nitrogen the setup directs the concentrated runoff through a subterranean basin filled with a commonly available and inexpensive organic carbon source like for example wood chips grießmeier et al 2019 sealing of the denitrification bed top with a plastic liner creates anoxic conditions in these beds which directs the microorganisms to use nitrate instead of oxygen as terminal electron acceptor while the organic carbon source is used as an electron donor several studies investigated different carbon sources regarding their nitrate elimination efficiency blowes et al 1994 cameron and schipper 2010 greenan et al 2006 warneke et al 2011 more labile carbon sources like maize cobs corn stalks and wheat straw led to higher nitrate removal efficiencies but also more negative side effects like leaching of ammonium nh4 toc formation or greenhouse gas emission ghg cameron and schipper 2010 greenan et al 2006 healy et al 2012 warneke et al 2011 additionally saliling et al 2007 reported a longevity of wheat straw of only 0 5 years which questions the sustainability of a process based on this material although the wood chips achieved a lower nitrate removal efficiency they proved to be more reliable in the nitrate reduction process led to less unwanted side products and were stable for several years greenan et al 2006 grießmeier and gescher 2018 warneke et al 2011 wood chip driven reactors also seemed to be more resilient towards disturbances and higher nitrate loading rates which is probably due to the higher microbial diversity in these reactors grießmeier and gescher 2018 surprisingly the number of field studies that would aim to elucidate i microbial key players in denitrification beds ii the interplay of organisms and iii the impact of other process parameters like hydraulic retention time hrt or temperature on the community and the overall process is sparse in fact it is not known so far whether the denitrification process in the field is catalyzed by organisms in the planktonic phase of the reactor or within the biofilm growing on the wood chips although this should have a profound impact on an optimized reactor concept moreover we do not know whether the prevailing temperature fluctuations throughout the year shape differing microbial communities or if one major community dominates the denitrification process throughout the year an answer to this question would allow assumptions regarding the response time of the biocatalyst to environmental temperature fluctuations this study reports on factors that influence the performance of a denitrification bed localized in a moderate continental climate the intention for the construction of this denitrification bed was to preserve a fen that is threatened by eutrophication due to surrounding agricultural fields that discharge no3 containing drainage water directly into the fen s basin forst et al 1997 using an online monitoring station together with a water discharge simulation we established an overall model of the denitrification bed process in the study area and discovered why the simplicity of the process and reactor geometry goes along with performance limitations under certain conditions furthermore the aim of this study was to fundamentally reveal the microbial diversity and interaction of microorganisms within the overall wood chip degradation and nitrate elimination process by using amplicon as well as metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses 2 experimental procedures 2 1 study site the study area is a 34 ha fen called mürmes near mehren in the vulkaneifel germany n 50 9 20 633 o 6 53 18 911 agricultural fields are located on the northwest side and several drainages d6 d7 d8 d9 lead directly from these fields into the fen with an overall catchment area of 19 ha drainage d7 has the largest catchment area of approximately 8 9 ha previous studies revealed that the water from drainage d7 contains higher nitrate concentration on average 50 mg l compared to the other drainages forst et al 1997 in november 2016 a field denitrification bed was installed which intercepts the drainage flow from d7 between the agricultural fields and the fen wood chips beech were selected as a carbon source because previous laboratory investigations revealed that this carbon source is best suited to the prevailing conditions grießmeier and gescher 2018 the wood chip filled bed has a length of 18 m and a width of 10 m which corresponds to a filter area of 180 m2 and a total filter volume of 216 m3 at a basin depth of 1 2 m the excavated and filled basin was covered with a plastic foil and soil on top the influent drainage water was first directed into an underground shaft dn1000 and then via pipes dn 100 released into the bed a similar shaft was installed at the outlet of the bed and enabled a convenient sampling of the inlet and outlet water an inlet throttle in the inlet shaft ensured a defined maximum flow rate excess water was led around the bed via a by pass system to prevent an overloading in addition four degassing nozzles dn1000 and two shafts kg dn200 were installed alongside of the bed for substrate sampling at different spots of the reactor fig 1 provides a scheme of the field denitrification bed with all nozzles 1 2 3 4 and shafts 5 and 6 further called sampling points sp 2 2 monitoring station to study the functionality of the field denitrification bed different nitrogen species no3 no2 nh4 as well as the total organic carbon content toc ph and temperature were constantly observed from july 2016 until the end of june 2019 only the winter months from december to march could not be recorded due to the temperature sensitivity of the sensors moreover due to technical issues the measurement for the year 2016 end of march and beginning of april 2019 was partly incomplete a cabin was installed between the influent and effluent of the denitrification bed two solar panels offgrid eggenfelden germany on the roof of the cabin provided the power supply for the monitoring station the regular measurement of various parameters no3 no2 nh4 toc ph temperature was enabled by two different sensor types spectro lyser and ammo lyser s can measuring systems vienna austria two membrane pumps type flojet duplex pumped water alternating every hour from the inlet and outlet chamber to the monitoring station the water was carried through a pipe into which the two sensors protruded the sensors were cleaned once a month and calibrated regularly following the manufacturer s guidelines moreover sensors were cleaned before every measuring process with compressed air which removed water from the previous measurement additionally pump filters viptech großbettlingen germany were installed in front of the pumps to remove coarse material once a month samples from the in and outlet water were taken and analyzed via ion chromatography ic 1100 thermo scientific waltham usa to verify the quantities measured by the autonomously operating monitoring station the nitrate removal efficiency was calculated using the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations from the denitrification bed measured by the monitoring station for time with zero influent concentration or when effluent concentration exceeded the influent concentration the removal efficiency was set to zero the mean monthly nitrate removal efficiency and standard deviation were calculated from the nitrate removal efficiency of each measurement point table 2 2 3 dna and rna extraction samples for the planktonic phase were sampled at sp 3 and for the analysis of the biofilm phase at sp 2 as the wood chips were only accessible at this sampling point due to the denitrification bed construction fig 1 16s rrna diversity analysis was conducted when the weather was either warm and dry august september wet and cold november or at a moderate spring climate march april analyses began in august 2016 and ended in april 2018 for the diversity analysis of the planktonic phase triplicate samples of 12 to 15 ml volume were centrifuged and the pellets were suspended in the lysis solution from the innuspeed soil dna kit analytic jena further processing of the samples was conducted according to the manufacturer s guidelines the surface from triplicate samples of 200 mg wood chip material was scraped with a sterile scalpel to gain biofilm samples from the top of the wood chips dna was isolated using again the innuspeed soil dna kit dna isolation for metagenomic analysis of the planktonic phase was initiated by filtering 80 ml water using a filter funnel with a nitrocellulose membrane 0 22 µm which was transferred to the bead tube and further processed as per the manufacturer s guidelines dneasy power water kit qiagen venlo netherlands dna isolation for metagenomic analysis was conducted also with the biofilms that were scraped of the wood chip surface and further processed with the dneasy powerbiofilm kit qiagen venlo netherlands rna isolation for the metatranscriptomic analysis was conducted by imgm laboratories gmbh martinsried germany using either the rneasy powersoil total rna kit qiagen for the wood chip biofilms or the mirneasy micro kit qiagen for the planktonic phase samples for the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses were sampled in april 2018 and frozen directly on site on dry ice 2 4 sequencing methods and bioinformatic analysis the phylogenetic composition of the biofilm on the wood chips as well as of the planktonic community was analyzed via amplicon sequencing with corresponding triplicates from every sample over a 2 year timeframe to analyze the stability of the microbiome over the year and to assess a potential difference between the planktonic and biofilm phase of the reactor fragments of the 16s rrna genes

stopwatch and a calibrated beaker since the beginning of 2017 and constantly within the year 2018 to obtain an estimate of the continuous flow rate from the tile drain between june 2016 and july 2019 we simulated the tile drained fields 9 104 m2 with the 2 d hydrological model catflow zehe et al 2001 the model was set up with data on meteorological forcing rainfall sum global radiation air temperature wind velocity and air humidity in hourly resolution from the station dreis brück agm021 of the agrometeorological service of the state of rhineland palatia which is located at 13 km distance weather station dreis brück n d the major soil type is loam with some areas in the upper parts mapped as sandy loam and loamy sand respectively geological service of the state of rhineland palatia n d soil hydraulic conductivities for these soil textures were modeled to vary between 5 10 4 m s 1 in the upper 0 25 m to 5 10 6 m s 1 below 0 75 m depth tile drains were implemented as a conductive structure between 0 75 m and 0 65 m depth wienhöfer and zehe 2014 because the ground cover distribution during the simulation was unknown we ran the model with ten different crop dynamics for the simulation of evapotranspiration the combination of two crop dynamics that yielded the best match of observed and simulated discharges was selected figure s6 table s3 2 6 tracer test and

the conducted kruskal wallis variance analysis lead to a close clustering of all biofilm samples as one group and all planktonic samples as a second group an influence by the water temperature was not apparent figure s2 diversity analysis via 16s rrna amplicon sequencing can be sensitive due to a primer bias and does not detect the potential presence of eukaryotic organisms still the analysis of the metagenome confirmed that the majority of microorganisms in the planktonic as well as in the biofilm phase of the denitrification bed belong to the phylum proteobacteria fig 2 the metagenomic analysis also confirmed a similar bacterial distribution at the order level compared to the 16s rrna amplicon analysis metagenome based phylogeny analysis revealed also that fungi ascomycota and basidiomycota appeared on a larger scale with 13 only in the biofilm phase a detailed taxonomic classification graph at the order level of the metagenome sequencing analysis is presented in the supplementary section figure s3 furthermore the results of the 16s rrna amplicon analysis for archaea which could only be detected in the assembled metagenomes with 0 09 relative abundance in the planktonic phase and 0 007 in the biofilm phase are presented in the supplementary section figure s4 table s1 the stability of the microbiome over the different seasons and the accordance of 16s rrna and metagenome based phylogeny allowed us to assess the physiological function of the organisms via metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis from one time point fig 3 a displays the summed expression in tpm of genes involved in denitrification as well as those involved in the competing process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in the planktonic and biofilm phase evidently denitrification is the main nitrate reduction pathway whereas dnra plays only a minor role in the system denitrification occurs primarily in the planktonic phase tpm 796 9 whereas in the biofilm on the wood chips a far lower expression of key genes of the denitrification process could be detected tpm 14 8 the most highly expressed gene in the planktonic phase is nosz coding for the nitrous oxide reductase which catalyzes the last step of the denitrification process from n2o to n2 overall tpm 239 as the expression of denitrification genes was higher in the planktonic as in the biofilm phase the analysis of potential key players concentrated on the planktonic phase fig 3b the key genes for the denitrification process such as nosz norbc or nirs were predominantly expressed by organisms belonging to the proteobacteria a deeper phylogenetic analysis at the order level revealed that the key organisms for denitrification belonged mostly to the order burkholderiales as they had a total tpm for all denitrification genes of 235 9 followed by organisms belonging to the order rhodospirillales which primarily expressed the genes norbc and nosz fig 3b the overall gene expression of enzymes with cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic activity was significantly lower compared to those involved in the denitrification process but a relatively higher activity was revealed in the biofilm compared to the planktonic phase tpm 65 3 biofilm vs 16 5 planktonic bacteria and fungi are involved in the wood degradation process in approximately equal proportions table 1 presents the tpm for the cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes for bacteria compared to fungi at the phylum level the key cellulolytic organisms in the biofilm phase were found mainly in the ascomycota basidomycota and in the proteobacteria please find in the supplement a table listing the detailed expression values on the phylum and order level for the solid phase table s2 3 2 nitrate removal efficiency and limitations the denitrification bed achieved a nitrate removal efficiency of nearly 100 in several months march to may 2017 in may and june 2018 and june 2019 table 2 fig 4 figure s5a in some months however the denitrification performance decreased and nitrate was not removed completely as for instance in late november 2017 in march and early april 2018 and in march 2019 table 2 fig 4 as depicted in fig 4 flow rates into to the denitrification bed differed significantly over the years ranging from very high discharges to periods of drought lasting for several months along these lines a monthly measurement could not be provided in january 2018 because the inflow chamber was completely flooded in general there is a correlation between high flow rates through the denitrification bed and low nitrate removal performance r 0 69 for observed flow rates and removal efficiency months with high flow rates were also characterized by low water temperatures fig 5 3 3 tracer experiment and simulation of the nitrate removal in the field denitrification bed the tracer concentrations at the outlet of the denitrification bed started to rise 33 5 h after the injection the peak concentration could not be monitored because of technical difficulties such as power outages and concentration exceeding the detection range of the sensors the falling limb and the long tailing of the breakthrough curve in turn were captured well the two sensors located at different places in the outlet system measured very similar concentrations tracer breakthrough continued until 1042 h 43 4 days after the injection mean transport velocity and dispersion coefficient d were obtained as v 4 4 10 5 m s 1 and d 3 1 10 5 m 2 s 1 by fitting the cde eq 1 to the travel time pdf of the observed tracer mass fluxes which yielded a satisfactory match r 2 0 64 rmse 3 77 10 8 s 1 please see supplementary table s4 and figure s7 for details both temperature and volumetric flow rate seem to have an impact on removal efficiency within the denitrification bed figs 4 and 5 to throw more light on their influence and their sensitivity respectively two periods were chosen for simulation one period of 50 days sept to nov 2017 with a decreasing temperature and one period of around 100 days march to june 2018 with an increasing temperature blue highlighted areas in figs 4 and 5 influent concentrations of nitrate and temperature were taken from the recorded data the volumetric flow rate was taken from the hydrological model supplementary figure s6 and table s3 however the maximum possible flow rate in the simulation was limited to 1 5 l s which resulted in a volumetric flow rate of 129 m³ d the simulation result effluent nitrate concentration was then compared to the recorded data table 3 provides the model parameters which have been adapted to achieve a best fit χ² 78 942 see eq 5 additionally the range for the conducted sensitivity analysis is provided in table 3 the chosen range of parameters θt and kno3 are based on values in literature henze et al 2000 lewandowski 1982 the range for kdeni max20 c is drawn from the experimental results in batch experiments grießmeier and gescher 2018 for the cross section across we chose a range of 33 and the dispersion coefficient d is assumed to be in a range of 50 the simulation results for the nitrate effluent concentration shown in fig 6 fit very nice with the measured data however to identify the most sensitive parts of the model all five parameters in table 3 were chosen for a sensitivity analysis as we assume that temperature and retention time coupled to volumetric flow rate do mostly influence the performance of the denitrification bed these two parameters are shown in fig 6a the highest sensitivity or impact on the simulation results can be seen for temperatures below or equal to 8 c in both periods used for simulation this is also underlined in figure s6 which shows the highest error contribution found in the sensitivity analysis during these two periods see supplementary material the fitted value of 1 18 for θt is higher compared to the values known for biological wastewater treatment which are typically around 1 06 to 1 10 henze et al 2000 lewandowski 1982 higher values support a steeper increase of the reaction rate at low temperatures as a result θt is ranked one as the most sensitive parameter table s5 only for the error contribution between days 197 247 across is ranked one and θt is ranked two as excepted the active cross section across does have a higher impact at low volumetric flow rates between days 197 247 and a low influence between days 444 554 with higher flow rates the denitrification rate constant kdeni max20 c is ranked three and does have an impact but more in connection to temperature the dispersion coefficient d and the half saturation constant kno3 are not largely contributing to sensitivity 4 discussion the planning of a field denitrification bed requires a careful determination of the boundary conditions such as climate catchment area hydraulic circumstances and topography in order to find appropriate dimensions up to now a conclusive answer to the question on how such denitrifying bioreactors can be designed with respect to varying volumetric flow rate nitrate influent concentration and temperature is not available moorman et al 2010 pfannerstill et al 2016 we suggest that this study and the assembled model will lead to a new level of decision accuracy with regards to the buildup of new denitrification plants in areas with moderate climate knowledge on the hydraulic conditions are key for the design of denitrification beds but they are difficult to assess as their decentralized or remote settings often hamper or do not allow for continuous flow measurements in such cases it is required to obtain some data based on manual measurements or devices installed retroactively or estimate environmental flows with hydrological modeling approaches as conducted in this study a tracer provided a means to assess the transport behavior related to the flow characteristics wienhöfer et al 2009 with this information and data on the nitrate elimination efficiency we were able to parameterize the reactor model of nitrogen transformation fig 7 summarizes the available information based on the average values shown in table 2 temperature of groundwater and hrt within the reactor do play the key role similar key controlling factors were observed in other studies as low constant flow rates and elevated water temperatures had a positive effect on the nitrate removal efficiency hassanpour et al 2017 pfannerstill et al 2016 in case the denitrifying bioreactor is supposed to remove the entire nitrate the system needs at a temperature of 4 c nitrate influent concentrations as low as 7 mg l at an hrt of 2 days or up to 37 mg l with an hrt of 10 days depending on how much water has to be treated at very low temperatures the reactor volume might become quite large this problem is accentuated as nitrogen fertilizer is partly applied on agricultural fields in colder months and the nitrogen inflow into the systems particularly in these months is consequently high a here discovered problem is that the simple design of the denitrification beds most likely leads to different flow paths through the reactor depending on the retention time which is determined by the volumetric flow rate still the incomplete reactor usage at high flow rates could be prevented relatively easy by moderate constructional steering of the flow path regarding the construction of new denitrification beds it should also be acknowledged that the majority of denitrifying bacteria were found in the planktonic phase hence low hrt could lead to a significant loss of denitrifying organisms from the denitrification bed chun et al 2009 nevertheless it was surprising to observe a fast recovery of the denitrification performance after cold runoff rich periods one explanation for this recovery could be existing retention zones in the bed in which the concentration of denitrifying microorganisms was stable due to locally higher hrt sections with little resistance to flow dead zones have also been described in other studies christianson et al 2012 ghane et al 2019 from these dead zones the microorganisms could be slowly leached out with declining flow rate to the rest of the basin this would also explain the constant microbial composition over the seasons as the microbial diversity would not change fundamentally in this way it was not only possible to identify bacteria and especially representatives of the phylum proteobacteria as the most common phylum but also to determine that representatives of this phylum contribute significantly to the denitrification process and are therefore essential for its functionality although many proteobacterial species are able to degrade cellulose and couple this to an anaerobic respiration with nitrate we determined a share of labor and a localized catalysis of cellulose degradation and nitrate reduction respectively moreover fungi seem to have a prominent role within the process of biofilm based cellulose degradation apparently denitrifying organisms in the planktonic phase use fermentation end products from the cellulose hydrolyzing biofilm as an electron donor and are somehow excluded to a major extend from the wood chip biofilm although thriving in the biofilm would provide a higher concentration of fermentation end products that are diluted via the water flow through the reactor it is possible that end products of fungal secondary metabolism might play a role in steering the microbial biofilm diversity it should also be acknowledged that denitrification beds at least under the climatic conditions studied here do not seem be a major source of greenhouse gas production as long as water is flowing into the reactor the quantity of methanogenic species was extremely low nevertheless methane could be measured in warm and dry summer months data not shown moreover the n2o reductase was the most highly expressed enzyme in the planktonic phase this goes along with micro gas chromatography measurements that we conducted on site data not shown and that revealed extremely low concentrations of n2o in the gas outlet of the denitrification bed 5 conclusion in this study it was possible to develop a robust model for the operation of denitrification beds in a moderate continental climate temperature and hrt play the most important role for successful operation temperature limits the denitrification rates but does not influence the diversity of biocatalysts to a large extend hrt is not only important because it limits the time interval during which the water can be treated but also because it affects the flow path through the reactor and leads to a leaching of denitrifying species which dominate in the planktonic and not in the biofilm phase of the reactor the diversity analysis and preliminary data on off gas composition further suggest that greenhouse gas emissions play a minor role during reactor operation hence new reactors can grow in volume without affecting the sustainability of the process too much future research should focus on the integration of structures to strictly dictate the flow path through the reactor and at the same time consider the effect of the avoidance of areas without flow on the concentration of denitrifying organisms a passive partial circulation of water within the reactor could also be a solution to limit the reactor size and prevent a washout of biocatalysts 6 data availability all dna and rna raw sequencing data that were

17418,environmental contamination with fertilizers is threatening biodiversity in many ecosystems due to nitrate based eutrophication one opportunity for a cost efficient nitrate elimination are denitrification beds in which a microbial community thrives under anoxic conditions with polymeric plant material as a carbon and an electron source incoming nitrate is used as electron acceptor and reduced to molecular nitrogen projects realizing denitrification beds in field scale are sparse and robust data on their efficiency throughout the year mostly not available this study analyzed the nitrate elimination efficiency and microbiology of a 216 m3 denitrification bed over the time course of more than three years phylogenetic as well as transcriptomic analysis revealed that the reactor contained a biofilm community growing on the surface of the wood chips and a planktonic community both differed in composition but their variance was affected only to a minor extend by seasonal temperature changes cellulose degradation was mainly conducted by the biofilm population while denitrification was mostly conducted by the planktonic community methanogens were detectable only to a very minor extend using online data from the nitrate concentration of in and outflowing water as well as a hydrological model to predict the water inflow it was possible to establish a process model that sufficiently describes the denitrification process this model clearly indicates that the denitrification efficiency is mostly impacted by temperature and hydraulic retention time it also suggests that the simple design of the denitrification bed most likely leads to different flow paths through the reactor depending on the volumetric flow rate this study allows for the first time a robust estimation of the necessary reactor size for nitrate removal in a moderate continental climate setting it also suggests how future denitrification beds could be improved for better performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification bed microbial diversity system limitations hydraulic model 1 introduction nitrate contamination of ground and surface water is a major environmental thread decentralized water treatment solutions are necessary to reduce the impact of nitrate in a variety of ecosystems still the realization of decentralized autonomous water treatment solutions is so far sparse which might be due to a lack of knowledge regarding their functionality and optimal reactor design principles this study addresses this limitation by assessing biological and environmental impact factors for the functionality of an autonomous denitrification reactor and integrates this fundamental knowledge in a model for operation in a moderate continental climate nitrogen is a limiting element for the primary production in many ecosystems nevertheless with the invention of the haber bosch process the release of reactive nitrogen into the environment increased overwhelmingly anthropogenic nitrogen input with 9 7 1012 mole per year even outnumbers the natural biological amount of n fixation with 7 9 1012 mole per year canfield et al 2010 excessive use of artificial fertilizer and manure led to a substantial flooding of nitrogen compounds also to non agricultural areas which in turn causes or supports eutrophication water pollution greenhouse gas production hypoxia algae blooms and a loss of biodiversity gruber and galloway 2008 overall we can observe a disturbed nitrogen cycle in favor of terrestrial nitrogen input microorganisms are the main catalysts of the overall nitrogen cycle and play an important role to restore the disturbed nitrogen balance one important stage of this cycle is the denitrification process which leads to a reduction of nitrate no3 via different intermediates no2 no n2o to atmospheric nitrogen n2 which is released to the atmosphere the successive steps of the process are catalyzed by the no3 reductase nar nap the no2 reductase nir no reductase nor and n2o reductase nos knowles 1982 nitrite reduction is considered as a key reaction for the overall process and can be conducted by two coevolved and structurally different but functionally and physiologically equivalent enzymes nirs and nirk braker et al 1998 zumft 1997 of note not all denitrifying organisms possess every reductase necessary for the complete denitrification process for instance some organisms do not contain a n2o reductase and release nitrous oxide as end product in the environment which is a 300 times more potent greenhouse gas ghg compared to co2 knowles 1982 rhode 1990 the extreme nitrate inflow into the environment via agricultural fields would often necessitate a decentralized water treatment to limit the ecological consequences of over fertilization one decentralized approach is a constructed wetland the idea of this concept is to specifically develop an ecosystem on a defined scale with the purpose to treat the nitrate influx within this constructed system and reduce an uncontrolled spreading into adjacent areas it simulates natural wetlands including vegetation substrates soils microorganisms and water wu et al 2015 however one disadvantage of these systems is a limited electron donor availability for the denitrification process which leads to very low denitrification rates lu et al 2009 to overcome this space time yield disadvantage different types of denitrifying bioreactors wall bed and layer were developed and practically realized more recently by adding an external organic carbon source which enhances the denitrification process bednarek et al 2014 these so called field denitrification beds are a cost effective approach to remove excessive amounts of nitrogen the setup directs the concentrated runoff through a subterranean basin filled with a commonly available and inexpensive organic carbon source like for example wood chips grießmeier et al 2019 sealing of the denitrification bed top with a plastic liner creates anoxic conditions in these beds which directs the microorganisms to use nitrate instead of oxygen as terminal electron acceptor while the organic carbon source is used as an electron donor several studies investigated different carbon sources regarding their nitrate elimination efficiency blowes et al 1994 cameron and schipper 2010 greenan et al 2006 warneke et al 2011 more labile carbon sources like maize cobs corn stalks and wheat straw led to higher nitrate removal efficiencies but also more negative side effects like leaching of ammonium nh4 toc formation or greenhouse gas emission ghg cameron and schipper 2010 greenan et al 2006 healy et al 2012 warneke et al 2011 additionally saliling et al 2007 reported a longevity of wheat straw of only 0 5 years which questions the sustainability of a process based on this material although the wood chips achieved a lower nitrate removal efficiency they proved to be more reliable in the nitrate reduction process led to less unwanted side products and were stable for several years greenan et al 2006 grießmeier and gescher 2018 warneke et al 2011 wood chip driven reactors also seemed to be more resilient towards disturbances and higher nitrate loading rates which is probably due to the higher microbial diversity in these reactors grießmeier and gescher 2018 surprisingly the number of field studies that would aim to elucidate i microbial key players in denitrification beds ii the interplay of organisms and iii the impact of other process parameters like hydraulic retention time hrt or temperature on the community and the overall process is sparse in fact it is not known so far whether the denitrification process in the field is catalyzed by organisms in the planktonic phase of the reactor or within the biofilm growing on the wood chips although this should have a profound impact on an optimized reactor concept moreover we do not know whether the prevailing temperature fluctuations throughout the year shape differing microbial communities or if one major community dominates the denitrification process throughout the year an answer to this question would allow assumptions regarding the response time of the biocatalyst to environmental temperature fluctuations this study reports on factors that influence the performance of a denitrification bed localized in a moderate continental climate the intention for the construction of this denitrification bed was to preserve a fen that is threatened by eutrophication due to surrounding agricultural fields that discharge no3 containing drainage water directly into the fen s basin forst et al 1997 using an online monitoring station together with a water discharge simulation we established an overall model of the denitrification bed process in the study area and discovered why the simplicity of the process and reactor geometry goes along with performance limitations under certain conditions furthermore the aim of this study was to fundamentally reveal the microbial diversity and interaction of microorganisms within the overall wood chip degradation and nitrate elimination process by using amplicon as well as metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses 2 experimental procedures 2 1 study site the study area is a 34 ha fen called mürmes near mehren in the vulkaneifel germany n 50 9 20 633 o 6 53 18 911 agricultural fields are located on the northwest side and several drainages d6 d7 d8 d9 lead directly from these fields into the fen with an overall catchment area of 19 ha drainage d7 has the largest catchment area of approximately 8 9 ha previous studies revealed that the water from drainage d7 contains higher nitrate concentration on average 50 mg l compared to the other drainages forst et al 1997 in november 2016 a field denitrification bed was installed which intercepts the drainage flow from d7 between the agricultural fields and the fen wood chips beech were selected as a carbon source because previous laboratory investigations revealed that this carbon source is best suited to the prevailing conditions grießmeier and gescher 2018 the wood chip filled bed has a length of 18 m and a width of 10 m which corresponds to a filter area of 180 m2 and a total filter volume of 216 m3 at a basin depth of 1 2 m the excavated and filled basin was covered with a plastic foil and soil on top the influent drainage water was first directed into an underground shaft dn1000 and then via pipes dn 100 released into the bed a similar shaft was installed at the outlet of the bed and enabled a convenient sampling of the inlet and outlet water an inlet throttle in the inlet shaft ensured a defined maximum flow rate excess water was led around the bed via a by pass system to prevent an overloading in addition four degassing nozzles dn1000 and two shafts kg dn200 were installed alongside of the bed for substrate sampling at different spots of the reactor fig 1 provides a scheme of the field denitrification bed with all nozzles 1 2 3 4 and shafts 5 and 6 further called sampling points sp 2 2 monitoring station to study the functionality of the field denitrification bed different nitrogen species no3 no2 nh4 as well as the total organic carbon content toc ph and temperature were constantly observed from july 2016 until the end of june 2019 only the winter months from december to march could not be recorded due to the temperature sensitivity of the sensors moreover due to technical issues the measurement for the year 2016 end of march and beginning of april 2019 was partly incomplete a cabin was installed between the influent and effluent of the denitrification bed two solar panels offgrid eggenfelden germany on the roof of the cabin provided the power supply for the monitoring station the regular measurement of various parameters no3 no2 nh4 toc ph temperature was enabled by two different sensor types spectro lyser and ammo lyser s can measuring systems vienna austria two membrane pumps type flojet duplex pumped water alternating every hour from the inlet and outlet chamber to the monitoring station the water was carried through a pipe into which the two sensors protruded the sensors were cleaned once a month and calibrated regularly following the manufacturer s guidelines moreover sensors were cleaned before every measuring process with compressed air which removed water from the previous measurement additionally pump filters viptech großbettlingen germany were installed in front of the pumps to remove coarse material once a month samples from the in and outlet water were taken and analyzed via ion chromatography ic 1100 thermo scientific waltham usa to verify the quantities measured by the autonomously operating monitoring station the nitrate removal efficiency was calculated using the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations from the denitrification bed measured by the monitoring station for time with zero influent concentration or when effluent concentration exceeded the influent concentration the removal efficiency was set to zero the mean monthly nitrate removal efficiency and standard deviation were calculated from the nitrate removal efficiency of each measurement point table 2 2 3 dna and rna extraction samples for the planktonic phase were sampled at sp 3 and for the analysis of the biofilm phase at sp 2 as the wood chips were only accessible at this sampling point due to the denitrification bed construction fig 1 16s rrna diversity analysis was conducted when the weather was either warm

silva128 database which was downloaded via the metaxa2 database builder bengtsson palme et al 2018 2 5 flow measurement and simulation flow rates at the inlet pipe were measured once a month with a stopwatch and a calibrated beaker since the beginning of 2017 and constantly within the year 2018 to obtain an estimate of the continuous flow rate from the tile drain between june 2016 and july 2019 we simulated the tile drained fields 9 104 m2 with the 2 d hydrological model catflow zehe et al 2001 the model was set up with data on meteorological forcing rainfall sum global radiation air temperature wind velocity and air humidity in hourly resolution from the station dreis brück agm021 of the agrometeorological service of the state of rhineland palatia which is located at 13 km distance weather station dreis brück n d the major soil type is loam with some areas in the upper parts mapped as sandy loam and loamy sand respectively geological service of the state of rhineland palatia n d soil hydraulic conductivities for these soil textures were modeled to vary between 5 10 4 m s 1 in the upper 0 25 m to 5 10 6 m s 1 below 0 75 m depth tile drains were implemented as a conductive structure between 0 75 m and 0 65 m depth wienhöfer and zehe 2014 because the ground cover distribution during the simulation was unknown we ran the model with ten different crop dynamics for the simulation of evapotranspiration the combination of two crop dynamics that yielded the best match of observed and simulated discharges was selected figure s6 table s3 2 6 tracer test and

the conducted kruskal wallis variance analysis lead to a close clustering of all biofilm samples as one group and all planktonic samples as a second group an influence by the water temperature was not apparent figure s2 diversity analysis via 16s rrna amplicon sequencing can be sensitive due to a primer bias and does not detect the potential presence of eukaryotic organisms still the analysis of the metagenome confirmed that the majority of microorganisms in the planktonic as well as in the biofilm phase of the denitrification bed belong to the phylum proteobacteria fig 2 the metagenomic analysis also confirmed a similar bacterial distribution at the order level compared to the 16s rrna amplicon analysis metagenome based phylogeny analysis revealed also that fungi ascomycota and basidiomycota appeared on a larger scale with 13 only in the biofilm phase a detailed taxonomic classification graph at the order level of the metagenome sequencing analysis is presented in the supplementary section figure s3 furthermore the results of the 16s rrna amplicon analysis for archaea which could only be detected in the assembled metagenomes with 0 09 relative abundance in the planktonic phase and 0 007 in the biofilm phase are presented in the supplementary section figure s4 table s1 the stability of the microbiome over the different seasons and the accordance of 16s rrna and metagenome based phylogeny allowed us to assess the physiological function of the organisms via metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis from one time point fig 3 a displays the summed expression in tpm of genes involved in denitrification as well as those involved in the competing process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in the planktonic and biofilm phase evidently denitrification is the main nitrate reduction pathway whereas dnra plays only a minor role in the system denitrification occurs primarily in the planktonic phase tpm 796 9 whereas in the biofilm on the wood chips a far lower expression of key genes of the denitrification process could be detected tpm 14 8 the most highly expressed gene in the planktonic phase is nosz coding for the nitrous oxide reductase which catalyzes the last step of the denitrification process from n2o to n2 overall tpm 239 as the expression of denitrification genes was higher in the planktonic as in the biofilm phase the analysis of potential key players concentrated on the planktonic phase fig 3b the key genes for the denitrification process such as nosz norbc or nirs were predominantly expressed by organisms belonging to the proteobacteria a deeper phylogenetic analysis at the order level revealed that the key organisms for denitrification belonged mostly to the order burkholderiales as they had a total tpm for all denitrification genes of 235 9 followed by organisms belonging to the order rhodospirillales which primarily expressed the genes norbc and nosz fig 3b the overall gene expression of enzymes with cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic activity was significantly lower compared to those involved in the denitrification process but a relatively higher activity was revealed in the biofilm compared to the planktonic phase tpm 65 3 biofilm vs 16 5 planktonic bacteria and fungi are involved in the wood degradation process in approximately equal proportions table 1 presents the tpm for the cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes for bacteria compared to fungi at the phylum level the key cellulolytic organisms in the biofilm phase were found mainly in the ascomycota basidomycota and in the proteobacteria please find in the supplement a table listing the detailed expression values on the phylum and order level for the solid phase table s2 3 2 nitrate removal efficiency and limitations the denitrification bed achieved a nitrate removal efficiency of nearly 100 in several months march to may 2017 in may and june 2018 and june 2019 table 2 fig 4 figure s5a in some months however the denitrification performance decreased and nitrate was not removed completely as for instance in late november 2017 in march and early april 2018 and in march 2019 table 2 fig 4 as depicted in fig 4 flow rates into to the denitrification bed differed significantly over the years ranging from very high discharges to periods of drought lasting for several months along these lines a monthly measurement could not be provided in january 2018 because the inflow chamber was completely flooded in general there is a correlation between high flow rates through the denitrification bed and low nitrate removal performance r 0 69 for observed flow rates and removal efficiency months with high flow rates were also characterized by low water temperatures fig 5 3 3 tracer experiment and simulation of the nitrate removal in the field denitrification bed the tracer concentrations at the outlet of the denitrification bed started to rise 33 5 h after the injection the peak concentration could not be monitored because of technical difficulties such as power outages and concentration exceeding the detection range of the sensors the falling limb and the long tailing of the breakthrough curve in turn were captured well the two sensors located at different places in the outlet system measured very similar concentrations tracer breakthrough continued until 1042 h 43 4 days after the injection mean transport velocity and dispersion coefficient d were obtained as v 4 4 10 5 m s 1 and d 3 1 10 5 m 2 s 1 by fitting the cde eq 1 to the travel time pdf of the observed tracer mass fluxes which yielded a satisfactory match r 2 0 64 rmse 3 77 10 8 s 1 please see supplementary table s4 and figure s7 for details both temperature and volumetric flow rate seem to have an impact on removal efficiency within the denitrification bed figs 4 and 5 to throw more light on their influence and their sensitivity respectively two periods were chosen for simulation one period of 50 days sept to nov 2017 with a decreasing temperature and one period of around 100 days march to june 2018 with an increasing temperature blue highlighted areas in figs 4 and 5 influent concentrations of nitrate and temperature were taken from the recorded data the volumetric flow rate was taken from the hydrological model supplementary figure s6 and table s3 however the maximum possible flow rate in the simulation was limited to 1 5 l s which resulted in a volumetric flow rate of 129 m³ d the simulation result effluent nitrate concentration was then compared to the recorded data table 3 provides the model parameters which have been adapted to achieve a best fit χ² 78 942 see eq 5 additionally the range for the conducted sensitivity analysis is provided in table 3 the chosen range of parameters θt and kno3 are based on values in literature henze et al 2000 lewandowski 1982 the range for kdeni max20 c is drawn from the experimental results in batch experiments grießmeier and gescher 2018 for the cross section across we chose a range of 33 and the dispersion coefficient d is assumed to be in a range of 50 the simulation results for the nitrate effluent concentration shown in fig 6 fit very nice with the measured data however to identify the most sensitive parts of the model all five parameters in table 3 were chosen for a sensitivity analysis as we assume that temperature and retention time coupled to volumetric flow rate do mostly influence the performance of the denitrification bed these two parameters are shown in fig 6a the highest sensitivity or impact on the simulation results can be seen for temperatures below or equal to 8 c in both periods used for simulation this is also underlined in figure s6 which shows the highest error contribution found in the sensitivity analysis during these two periods see supplementary material the fitted value of 1 18 for θt is higher compared to the values known for biological wastewater treatment which are typically around 1 06 to 1 10 henze et al 2000 lewandowski 1982 higher values support a steeper increase of the reaction rate at low temperatures as a result θt is ranked one as the most sensitive parameter table s5 only for the error contribution between days 197 247 across is ranked one and θt is ranked two as excepted the active cross section across does have a higher impact at low volumetric flow rates between days 197 247 and a low influence between days 444 554 with higher flow rates the denitrification rate constant kdeni max20 c is ranked three and does have an impact but more in connection to temperature the dispersion coefficient d and the half saturation constant kno3 are not largely contributing to sensitivity 4 discussion the planning of a field denitrification bed requires a careful determination of the boundary conditions such as climate catchment area hydraulic circumstances and topography in order to find appropriate dimensions up to now a conclusive answer to the question on how such denitrifying bioreactors can be designed with respect to varying volumetric flow rate nitrate influent concentration and temperature is not available moorman et al 2010 pfannerstill et al 2016 we suggest that this study and the assembled model will lead to a new level of decision accuracy with regards to the buildup of new denitrification plants in areas with moderate climate knowledge on the hydraulic conditions are key for the design of denitrification beds but they are difficult to assess as their decentralized or remote settings often hamper or do not allow for continuous flow measurements in such cases it is required to obtain some data based on manual measurements or devices installed retroactively or estimate environmental flows with hydrological modeling approaches as conducted in this study a tracer provided a means to assess the transport behavior related to the flow characteristics wienhöfer et al 2009 with this information and data on the nitrate elimination efficiency we were able to parameterize the reactor model of nitrogen transformation fig 7 summarizes the available information based on the average values shown in table 2 temperature of groundwater and hrt within the reactor do play the key role similar key controlling factors were observed in other studies as low constant flow rates and elevated water temperatures had a positive effect on the nitrate removal efficiency hassanpour et al 2017 pfannerstill et al 2016 in case the denitrifying bioreactor is supposed to remove the entire nitrate the system needs at a temperature of 4 c nitrate influent concentrations as low as 7 mg l at an hrt of 2 days or up to 37 mg l with an hrt of 10 days depending on how much water has to be treated at very low temperatures the reactor volume might become quite large this problem is accentuated as nitrogen fertilizer is partly applied on agricultural fields in colder months and the nitrogen inflow into the systems particularly in these months is consequently high a here discovered problem is that the simple design of the denitrification beds most likely leads to different flow paths through the reactor depending on the retention time which is determined by the volumetric flow rate still the incomplete reactor usage at high flow rates could be prevented relatively easy by moderate constructional steering of the flow path regarding the construction of new denitrification beds it should also be acknowledged that the majority of denitrifying bacteria were found in the planktonic phase hence low hrt could lead to a significant loss of denitrifying organisms from the denitrification bed chun et al 2009 nevertheless it was surprising to observe a fast recovery of the denitrification performance after cold runoff rich periods one explanation for this recovery could be existing retention zones in the bed in which the concentration of denitrifying microorganisms was stable due to locally higher hrt sections with little resistance to flow dead zones have also been described in other studies christianson et al 2012 ghane et al 2019 from these dead zones the microorganisms could be slowly leached out with declining flow rate to the rest of the basin this would also explain the constant microbial composition over the seasons as the microbial diversity would not change fundamentally in this way it was not only possible to identify bacteria and especially representatives of the phylum proteobacteria as the most common phylum but also to determine that representatives of this phylum contribute significantly to the denitrification process and are therefore essential for its functionality although many proteobacterial species are able to degrade cellulose and couple this to an anaerobic respiration with nitrate we determined a share of labor and a localized catalysis of cellulose degradation and nitrate reduction respectively moreover fungi seem to have a prominent role within the process of biofilm based cellulose degradation apparently denitrifying organisms in the planktonic phase use fermentation end products from the cellulose hydrolyzing biofilm as an electron donor and are somehow excluded to a major extend from the wood chip biofilm although thriving in the biofilm would provide a higher concentration of fermentation end products that are diluted via the water flow through the reactor it is possible that end products of fungal secondary metabolism might play a role in steering the microbial biofilm diversity it should also be acknowledged that denitrification beds at least under the climatic conditions studied here do not seem be a major source of greenhouse gas production as long as water is flowing into the reactor the quantity of methanogenic species was extremely low nevertheless methane could be measured in warm and dry summer months data not shown moreover the n2o reductase was the most highly expressed enzyme in the planktonic phase this goes along with micro gas chromatography measurements that we conducted on site data not shown and that revealed extremely low concentrations of n2o in the gas outlet of the denitrification bed 5 conclusion in this study it was possible to develop a robust model for the operation of denitrification beds in a moderate continental climate temperature and hrt play the most important role for successful operation temperature limits the denitrification rates but does not influence the diversity of biocatalysts to a large extend hrt is not only important because it limits the time interval during which the water can be treated but also because it affects the flow path through the reactor and leads to a leaching of denitrifying species which dominate in the planktonic and not in the biofilm phase of the reactor the diversity analysis and preliminary data on off gas composition further suggest that greenhouse gas emissions play a minor role during reactor operation hence new reactors can grow in volume without affecting the sustainability of the process too much future research should focus on the integration of structures to strictly dictate the flow path through the reactor and at the same time consider the effect of the avoidance of areas without flow on the concentration of denitrifying organisms a passive partial circulation of water within the reactor could also be a solution to limit the reactor size and prevent a washout of biocatalysts 6 data availability all dna and rna raw sequencing data that were

17419,environmental risk assessment of complex chemical mixtures has increasingly been prioritized as a management goal especially in the regulatory sector although fipronil and its three degradates sulfone sulfide and desulfinyl have been frequently quantified in waterways little information is available about the likelihood and magnitude of ecological risk posed by these chemical mixtures collectively known as fiproles in surface water in the present study a probabilistic risk assessment of mixtures of fipronil and its three degradates was conducted for three effluent dominated southern california rivers los angeles river lar san gabriel river sgr and santa clara river scr california usa the assessments which used fiproles as an integrated proxy were based on three levels of toxicity endpoints median lethal concentration lc50 half maximal effective concentration ec50 and lowest observed effect concentration loec to gain comprehensive assessment information probabilistic approaches based on species sensitivity distribution ssd and exposure concentration distribution ecd were developed with the log logistic model by pooling the toxicity and occurrence data respectively the 5th percentile hazardous concentrations hc5s were calculated to be at low parts per billion levels enabling these values to be used to estimate the chemical specific benchmarks for components that lack ecotoxicity data the single substance potentially affected fraction sspaf of fiproles revealed risk levels for the three rivers in descending order lar sgr scr the overall risk probability estimated from the joint probability curve jpc by monte carlo simulation was 1 13 0 20 lc50 9 31 1 46 ec50 and 6 58 1 43 loec for the three rivers collectively these results derived from the fiproles indicates that fipronil and its degradates pose risks to the aquatic organisms in the surface water of the three rivers the present study provides a methodology for the use of a proxy in the risk assessment of chemical mixtures keywords fiproles probabilistic risk assessment of mixture surface water of river potentially affected fraction overall risk probability 1 introduction aquatic organisms are inevitably exposed to a plethora of contaminants in the environment bopp et al 2018 parkerton et al 2018 these complex mixtures may induce toxicity cumulatively independently synergistically or antagonistically consequently addressing combined exposure and risk assessment of complex mixtures is not as straightforward as for a single substance coors et al 2018 many investigations to date have focused on performing screening level single point assessment for individual compounds this approach neglects combined exposure and cannot outline the actual risk faced by the organisms even as it has been very successful in solving environmental problems caused by single stressors and or sources few cases to date have focused on cumulative risk assessment that takes multiple chemicals into account del signore et al 2016 lindim et al 2019 rand et al 2010 recognizing that organisms are generally exposed to multiple pollutants research activities are increasingly shifting toward addressing mixture assessment posthuma et al 2019 ramo et al 2018 as the single point assessment cannot procure the likelihood and magnitude of the risk probabilistic risk assessment based on species sensitivity distribution ssd and exposure concentration distribution ecd has been used to quantify the risk for mixtures of contaminants ecofram 1999 solomon and jones 2000 the cumulative risk assessment relies on the knowledge of the toxic mode of action tmoa for the components in the mixture assuming there are no interactions between chemicals in the mixture the concentration addition ca model is used to estimate the total toxic effect for chemicals with a similar tmoa while the independent action ia model is applied to chemicals with a dissimilar tmoa probabilistic risk assessment may be used to conduct community level evaluation giddings et al 2005 posthuma et al 2001 by providing results on the multiple substance potentially affected fraction mspaf and generating joint probability curves jpcs depicting the magnitude and likelihood of the risks of mixtures in addition environmental quality criteria can also be derived by the ssd model to link protective assessment goals to the mixture risk assessment posthuma et al 2019 fipronil is one of the phenylpyrazole insecticides it was introduced in 1985 by the company rhône poulenc and entered the crop insecticide market in 1993 levin and grabarnick 2018 it was registered in the u s in 1996 for commercial turf and indoor pest control but not registered for agricultural use in california fipronil is a nerve poison with a mode of action of blocking gamma amino butyric acid gaba regulated chloride channels to cause neural excitation and convulsions in insects resulting in death because fipronil is highly active broad spectrum and effective against insects that are resistant or tolerant to pyrethroid and carbamate insecticides it is a complementary alternative to these pesticides and has been widely used in both agriculture and non agricultural sectors such as structural pest control in urban areas hano et al 2019 indeed fipronil and its degradates have been frequently detected in the aquatic environment and have raised much concern in the environmental community budd et al 2015 sadaria et al 2017 single point assessments have been used to characterize the risks of fipronil and its three degradates sulfone sulfide and desulfinyl ensminger et al 2013 gan et al 2012 although the concentrations of each individual compound both fipronil as well as its degradates are typically low their combined concentrations might exceed the toxic benchmark especially given that fipronil degradates can be more toxic to some invertebrates than the parent compound sadaria et al 2019 weston and lydy 2014 thus it is necessary and imperative to characterize and predict the cumulative risk for fipronil and its degradates as a whole collectively referred to as total fiproles by applying the ssd approach backhaus and faust 2012 probabilistic risk assessments with potentially affected fraction paf and jpc approaches for a single substance were previously applied to fipronil fipronil sulfone and fipronil sulfide respectively in the surface water of canals and ponds wu et al 2015 as fipronil and its degradates share a similar tmoa hainzl et al 1998 zhao and salgado 2010 an assumption can be made that fiproles is a promising proxy for various potential mixtures of fipronil and its degradates this can be done by using the ssd model combined with the toxicity data of fipronil and its degradates to provide a single indicator e g single substance potentially affected fraction sspaf of the ecological risk associated with the mixture in terms of mixture risk assessment no study has been conducted on the total fipronil and its degradates by using fiproles as a proxy in an aquatic environment thus the goal of this study was to conduct a mixture risk assessment for fiproles in surface water a multi level approach for the risk assessment was adopted using screening level deterministic and probabilistic risk assessments based on three acute and chronic toxicity endpoints three effluent dominated rivers in southern california usa were selected to conduct the study because fipronil and its degradates were detected there previously maruya et al 2016 sengupta et al 2014 the expected output of this study was to illustrate the function of mixture risk assessment for chemical cocktails in surface waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

are paved to become concrete lined channels within the metropolitan region the scr located north of los angeles in the san gabriel mountains still has its natural riverbed in the majority of its waterway until reaching its coastal estuary there are several major water reclamation wastewater treatment plants wwtps built along the rivers i e three for lar five for sgr and four for scr respectively during dry season and low flow conditions one common feature of the three rivers is that more than 90 of the flow in the river is the effluent of these treatment works maruya et al 2016 sengupta et al 2014 a total of 48 surface water samples was collected from the three rivers during two dry season low flow events 26 july 2011 and 10 october 2011 from lar 6 stations and a reference station 27 july 2011 7 stations and a reference station and 11 october 2011 8 stations and a reference site from sgr 27 july 2013 6 stations a reference station and 3 stations in the estuary and 15 october 2013 6 stations and a reference station from scr fig 1 the grabbed water sample was transferred from a stainless steel bucket previously rinsed with methanol and deionized water into an amber 1 l bottle with preservatives 1 g l sodium azide and 50 mg l of ascorbic acid a set of equipment and water blank samples was also collected in the field for each sampling event all samples were kept on ice in the dark and were shipped to the laboratory for extraction within 48 h of collection 2 3 sample extraction and instrumental analysis extraction of the 1 l whole water sample was accomplished by liquid liquid extraction with methylene chloride the extracts were analyzed on an agilent 7890 gas chromatograph gc coupled to a 5975c quadrupole mass selective detector msd operated in the negative chemical ionization nci mode wilmington de usa detailed procedures of the extraction and analysis as well as the quality control data are provided in the supporting information 2 4 data analysis the risk assessment process used a tiered approach deterministic risk assessment was first conducted with calculation of risk quotient rq for individual fiprole compounds i e fipronil fip o fip i or fip d and total fiproles 1 r q m e c t t where mec represents measured exposure concentration and tt represents toxic threshold value such as median lethal concentration lc50 half maximal effective concentration ec50 or lowest observed effect concentration loec the rq value is mathematically equivalent to the so called toxic unit tu the lc50 values were from toxic thresholds of the mysid americamysis bahia the ec50 values of the midge chironomus dilutus were adopted in the rq calculation due to lack of data the loec values of only three species were used in the rq calculations for chronic risk evaluation i e a bahia for fipronil the water flea daphnia magna for fip o and fip i and the sheepshead minnow cyprinodon variegatus for fip d for screening level risk assessment the rq values were compared to the level of concern loc for aquatic animals the criteria are as follows 1 with lc50 and ec50 as the endpoints rq 0 5 high acute risk 0 05 rq 0 5 acute restricted use i e medium risk rq 0 05 acute endangered species i e low risk and 2 with the noec as the endpoint rq 1 chronic risk usepa since the toxic endpoints of the most sensitive species were used in the calculation the rq method was conservative as a screening level assessment to provide a general point estimate of potential of ecological risk for every sampling station to identify the main driver of chemical mixture risk the maximum cumulative ratio mcr was calculated using the sum of rq rqsum and maximum rq rqmax values in the following equation 2 m c r r q s u m r q m a x a single substance is driving the mixture risk when the mcr value approaches unity price and han 2011 certainly the denominator in eq 2 can be a sum of chemicals to reflect that the risk is primarily contributed by this subgroup the estimate of the risk could be attenuated only by counting on the main driver in the assessment of a mixture the magnitude of the missed risk mr could be easily estimated with 3 m r 1 1 m c r probabilistic approaches based on ssd were performed for the individual chemical as well as the mixture posthuma et al 2001 solomon and jones 2000 an ssd curve is a cumulative density function cdf of toxic benchmarks for a single toxicant the toxicity data and measured surface water concentrations were ranked as a percentile using the hazen plotting position 4 p e r c e n t i l e n 0 5 n where n is the rank number of data points and n is the total number of observations cunnane 1978 the ssd curves were created by fitting a log logistic distribution for lc50 ec50 and loec respectively

jpc monte carlo calculations 10 000 simulations were used to estimate the area under the curve auc ecofram 1999 zolezzi et al 2005 the data for fipronil and its three degradates were previously reported focusing on occurrence in the rivers maruya et al 2016 sengupta et al 2014 these data were used for the risk assessment in the present study table s1 a total of 86 toxicity data records for fipronil and its three degradates was obtained from the usepa pesticide ecotoxicity database ecotox http cfpub epa gov ecotox and from published literature wu et al 2015 three endpoints of toxicity data i e lc50 ec50 and loec were retrieved table s2 the loec was used instead of no observed effect concentration noec due to the latter s limited availability the species groups included crustaceans mollusks larval insects and fish the statistics and regression analysis were performed by using sigmaplot 13 systat software san jose ca the monte carlo simulation was achieved on microsoft excel 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection and distribution of fiprole and fiproles fipronil fip o fip i and fip d in the surface water were detected at 100 of the lar stations including the reference station table s3 they were also detected at 100 of the sgr stations excluding the reference site where none were detected for the scr stations no fiproles were found at the reference station or at the scr 6 site but they were detected at 100 of the other stations comparing the data of the three rivers between sampling events i and ii respectively no statistically significant difference was identified mann whitney test p 0 381 0 594 there was no statistically significant difference between the concentrations of the lar e g median 4 09 ng l for fipronil and sgr e g median 4 27 ng l for fipronil but the concentrations of the scr e g median 1 01 ng l for fipronil were different from that in the other two rivers probably due to the scr being located in mostly suburban environments kruskal wallis one way anova test the maximum values among the stations were 13 6 10 6 2 03 13 8 and 28 7 ng l for fipronil fip o fip i fip d and fiproles respectively in the two sampling events excluding the three stations in the scr estuary in this estuary concentrations of fipronil fip o fip i fip d and fiproles showed ranges of 2 34 19 2 ng l 1 83 7 74 ng l 1 30 3 76 ng l 6 38 15 0 ng l 11 9 45 9 ng l respectively the concentrations of fiproles in the three stations were significantly higher than the other inland stations of scr t test p 0 027 fip i the reduction product of fipronil had the lowest levels among the three degradates whereas the levels of fipronil fip o the oxidation product and fip d the photolysis product were comparable fig 2 the concentrations of fiproles were significantly higher than the concentrations of every individual fiprole p 0 001 the mean standard deviation and median values of fiproles concentrations were 21 1 4 65 and 22 2 ng l for the lar 9 80 6 56 and 10 3 ng l for the sgr and 6 46 10 9 and 3 07 ng l for the scr including the three stations in the estuary respectively fig s1 fipronil and its degradates were frequently detected in the surface waters of streams influents and effluents for example in the san francisco bay area in northern california fiproles derived from urban pest control in the influents and effluents of wwtps in the dry season showed concentration ranges of 19 122 ng l mean 80 8 31 6 median 82 5 ng l and 16 7 63 5 ng l mean 49 6 15 0 median 52 0 ng l respectively sadaria et al 2017 in a nationwide investigation fiproles concentrations ranged from less than the method detection limit mdl to 189 ng l mean 27 5 45 3 median 6 85 ng l in the surface water from 38 streams across the usa bradley et al 2017 fiprole concentrations in los angeles surface waters ranged from 32 to 246 ng l during 2008 2013 budd et al 2015 in non storm urban runoff from two neighborhoods in northern and southern california fipronil concentrations were 9 7 30 4 ng l and 248 488 ng l respectively bale et al 2017 additionally in urban storm runoff fiprole presented much higher concentrations than in non storm runoff carpenter et al 2016 gan et al 2012 in contrast the fiproles concentrations in the present study were generally at the lower end of the range compared to these previous studies 3 2 deterministic risk assessment by integrating the data for the three rivers the lc50 based rqs of the individual fiprole showed a range of 0 0 189 with the median values showing a range of 0 002 0 048 table s4 whereas the rq of fiproles showed a range of 0 0 336 mean 0 102 0 075 median 0 088 to the acute ec50 and chronic loec endpoints the mean rqs of fiproles were 0 669 0 484 median 0 582 and 0 846 0 825 median 0 671 respectively however the highest value acute ec50 and chronic loec endpoints belonged to different compounds fip o 1 41 and fipronil 3 88 respectively comparing the rqs of fiproles among the three rivers showed different situations for the three toxicity endpoints for both lc50 and ec50 the fiproles rqs of the lar lc50 0 158 0 052 ec50 1 05 0 38 were significantly higher than those of the sgr lc50 0 090 0 053 ec50 0 575 0 33 and the scr lc50 0 060 0 082 ec50 0 392 0 504 p 0 05 kruskal wallis test on data ranks but there was no statistically significant difference between the rqs of the sgr and the scr p 0 31 on the loec level the fiproles rqs of the lar 1 10 0 53 and the sgr 0 911 0 82 had no difference p 0 625 and were higher than those of the scr 0 526 1 00 compared to the epa s level of concerns locs up to 44 of stations presented a medium acute risk i e acute restricted use to aquatic organisms based on the rqs of lc50 table s5 for the acute risk of ec50 up to 98 of stations showed medium acute risk and 56 stations showed acute high risk the loc of chronic risk was exceeded in 33 of stations using loec in the rq calculation the european union eu and australia have more conservative locs than the usepa their locs of acute high risk are 0 01 and 0 1 respectively and 0 1 eu for chronic risk lee steere 2009 according to these locs up to 98 of stations exceeded acute high risk of the eu criterion in terms of both lc50 and ec50 rq values additionally 44 of stations exceeded the australian threshold of acute high risk while up to 93 of stations showed chronic risk using the eu s loc the mcr values varied with ranges of 1 14 2 57 1 12 2 91 and 1 01 1 26 for the rqs of lc50 ec50 and loec respectively fip o was the major contributor for both acute toxicity endpoints while fipronil was the major contributor for chronic toxicity in instances where the mixture chemical risk assessment was not performed the mr values indicated that the risk could be underestimated up to 61 66 and 20 for the three toxicity endpoints respectively in the present study the calculation of the rq values used the lowest available toxic benchmarks and involved only four species table s6 therefore the rq values may describe the worst case scenario without characterizing uncertainty so these values may have limited ecological meaning lee steere 2009 however the information provided by the mcr and mr values may guide risk management to mitigate the drivers of mixture toxicity backhaus et al 2015 it has been shown in some studies that the mcr values indicated that only a few of the contaminants significantly contributed to the mixture risk bopp et al 2019 even though only four compounds were targeted the results of the present study support this finding 3 3 probabilistic risk assessment 3 3 1 ssd and hc5 the ssds were developed by log logistic regression using the laboratory toxicity data for individual fiprole and fiproles fig 3 for comparing toxic effect distributions in different levels acute lc50 and ec50 and chronic loec endpoints were used table 1 the distributions with 8 or more data points were robust with r2 0 95 in the log logistic regression this included fipronil all three toxic levels fip o ec50 and fip i ec50 the log logistic regression was less robust r2 0 95 when the data points were 5 which included fip o loec fip i lc50 and loec and fip d all three toxic levels for fiproles the ssds were built r2 0 95 separately for the three toxic levels by combining the corresponding endpoints of the four chemicals fig s2 the hc5 values were estimated from the ssd by eq 12 table 2 and s6 based on the hc5 values and the toxic benchmarks used in the rq calculation the acute to chronic ratios acrs i e lc50 loec and ec50 loec and the ratio of lc50 ec50 were calculated for fipronil and fiproles table s7 the acrs lc50 loec of fipronil fipronil hc5 and fiproles hc5 were virtually identical when considering the uncertainties associated with the ratio values this was also true for the arcs of ec50 loec and lc50 ec50 their average values were 28 2 95 5 lc50 loec 2 91 13 4 lc50 ec50 6 01 22 1 ec50 loec respectively the surface water hc5 values of fiproles were 188 51 3 ng l lc50 9 08 15 1 ng l ec50 and 7 98 4 75 ng l loec this data can be used for calculating rq in the screening level assessment of cumulative risk for fipronil and its three degradates given that there is a lack of thresholds for the individual fiprole such as fip d giddings et al 2019 this data can also be adopted as a basis to derive fiproles criteria e g noec and predicted no effect concentration pnec by dividing an appropriate assessment factor af for regional evaluation bower and tjeerdema 2017 the hc5 data of fiprole were comparable with the benchmarks of the most sensitive species used in the rq calculation table s6 for example the fipronil hc5 values were 79 7 16 9 ng l lc50 27 7 20 9 ng l ec50 and 2 45 2 07 ng l loec these values were within a range of the toxic benchmarks used in the rq calculations by a factor of two based on the burr iii type ssd the calculated acute and chronic criteria values of fipronil were 39 ng l and 3 2 ng l respectively bower and tjeerdema 2017 in contrast giddings et al reported that acute hc5 values of eight commonly used pyrethroids showed a range of 0 82 34 ng l giddings et al 2019 chronic endpoints were used to build the ssds in previous studies sun et al 2017 however because there were limited chronic data available the toxicity data were estimated by converting the corresponding acute data via the acr duboudin et al 2004 zwart 2001 the value of 25 was recommended as the acr to calculate the chronic toxicity data based on various chemicals for fish and aquatic invertebrates kenaga 1982 an acr of 8 3 was also determined by computing the toxicity data of 456 species of aquatic invertebrate and fish raimondo et al 2007 the acrs of cypermethrin for ceriodaphnia dubia showed a range of 14 33 for different toxicity endpoints li and you 2015 the acrs in the present study shared the same range with the values in the previous reports so the average values could be used to estimate the chronic toxicity data for fiprole table s7 3 3 2 paf and jpc treating the fiproles as a single substance the sspaf was calculated using the log logistic regression parameters for each station table s8 including all the sampling stations the grand mean std values were 0 764 0 427 lc50 6 88 4 88 ec50 and 5 51 2 42 loec table s9 these values showed that acute lethal toxicity lc50 was the smallest among the three toxicity endpoints whereas acute sublethal ec50 and chronic loec toxicities were comparable fig s3 the criteria of paf results were low risk paf 1 moderate risk 1 paf 5 and high risk paf 5 ramo et al 2018 the mean data of the sspaf indicated fiproles posted low to moderate risk at the acute lethal toxicity level for aquatic organisms in the surface water of the three rivers and moderate to high risk at both acute sublethal and chronic toxicity levels regarding the individual rivers the sspaf mean value of the lar was the highest among the three rivers the risk levels of the three rivers in descending order were lar sgr scr fig 4 for comparison values of the mspaf for the mixture of fipronil and its three degradates were also calculated in terms of the ca mode and ia models and are presented with the above fiproles sspafs fig s4 the fiproles lc50 sspaf and the ia model mspaf 0 817 0 514 were almost identical and much higher respectively than the ca mode mspaf 0 031 0 027 the mean value of the ec50 fiproles sspaf 6 88 4 88 was higher than the mspaf values of both the ca 2 56 2 30 and the ia 1 83 1 44 modes but the values of the loec sspaf 5 71 2 42 and the mspafs were basically equivalent generally the differences shown in these comparisons indicated the risk assessment using the fiproles sspaf was more conservative than using the ca model and ia model mspafs if disregarding the tmoa in addition the similarity being presenting from these comparisons validated the estimate of the fiproles sspaf the sspaf mean values of the scr estuary were very higher than those of the river mainstream i e 1 19 0 653 vs 0 29 0 16 for lc50 ec50 12 0 8 68 vs 1 74 1 13 for ec50 7 86 2 80 vs 2 90 1 46 for loec table s9 nevertheless they were similar to those of the lar 1 14 0 175 11 1 2 30 7 78 0 803 thus these sspafs are shown separately with the other scr stations in fig 4 fipronil and its three degradates are moderately hydrophobic log kow 4 0 so that their transportation in the waterway can be in both dissolved and particle associated phases the higher concentrations of fiproles at the three stations indicated fipronil and its three degradates were retained and accumulated in the estuary consequently these chemicals might contribute more risks to the organisms residing in the estuary it implied monitoring and risk assessment of fiproles in estuary habitats should be very necessary du et al 2020 the exposure concentration distributions ecds were created by the log logistic regression with high r2 0 92 0 99 for the individual fiprole and the fiproles fig 3 and table s10 the jpcs of fiproles showed that the three curves closed the axes to different extents which revealed that the orps varied by category of toxicity i e ec50 loec lc50 fig 5 the orps were 1 13 0 20 lc50 9 31 1 46 ec50 and 6 58 1 43 loec for the three rivers as a whole table 2 the acute toxicity orp based on the ec50 benchmarks was 8 2 times higher than the acute toxicity orp based on the lc50 endpoints and 1 4 times higher than the chronic risk probability the orps results are interpreted as potential risk under 0 1 and clear risk greater than 1 li and you 2015 wang et al 2008 the fiproles lc50 orp value was near 1 but the risk of lethal acute toxicity was still assigned for the sake of conservation there was no doubt that fiproles posted both sublethal acute risk and chronic risk to the aquatic organisms in the three rivers when looking at each river individually the orps of fiproles exhibited different risks for each of the three rivers table 2 the orps of the three rivers were all greater than 1 for the ec50 and loec endpoints only the lc50 acute risk of the lar was barely higher than 1 while the values of the sgr and the scr showed a range of 0 1 1 a classification based on the orps of the three endpoints was consistent for the individual rivers i e lar sgr scr excluding the three estuary sites in addition a series of assessment factors i e 2 5 10 and 100 were used to predict the risk probabilities for the adverse effects of noec and pnec from the loec zolezzi et al 2005 the orps at these assessment factors increased to 8 47 12 6 17 6 and 38 0 respectively it appeared that fiproles certainly posed a chronic threat to the aquatic organisms in the rivers furthermore it could be deduced that the lar was a major contributor to the three river orps the occurrence of fipronil should be solely of urban origin in california because it is not registered for agricultural use down the drain transport offsite movement by washoff and runoff and wastewater effluent have been identified as primary sources of fiproles in the urban area cryder et al 2019 teerlink et al 2017 the higher orps for the lar and the sgr corroborated the fact that both rivers flow through the larger neighborhoods with the greater population density in the los angeles region while the lower orps for the scr was also in accordance with the situation of the lower population density and the smaller residential area 3 4 uncertainty and limitation these assessments were based on two sampling events during dry seasons the spatial distribution of the sampling sites the sampling temporal scale the sampling frequency the water flow rates and episodic release of effluent could affect the sample composition due to the features of the effluent dominated coastal river sengupta et al 2014 fate processes for fiprole compounds including degradation volatilization and adsorption in the riverine ecosystem may also reduce the occurrence in surface water maruya et al 2016 it is predicted that fiproles would pose an even higher risk in the storm water runoff in the wet season in southern california carpenter et al 2016 gan et al 2012 partitioning to suspended solids would be expected to decrease the freely dissolved fraction thus reducing bioavailability because pesticide concentrations are rarely constant over time in real world time variable concentration can exert influences on both quantifying exposure and ssd derived hc5 values kreuger 1998 van den brink et al 2019 first using discrete water samples to estimate occurrence of the pesticides may not be accurate when encountering fluctuation of the concentration and or flow condition the statistical identical concentrations of fiproles in the event i and ii indicated occurrence of fipronil and its degradates were likely stable during the low flow conditions in the sampling region even though it could be a coincidence thus to this situation time weighted concentration can be used to characterize the mean concentration during the sampling period xiong et al 2019 other than taking discrete samples a promising technique that could address the ultra low waterborne concentration bioavailability and time weighted concentration simultaneously is the passive sampling approach wang et al 2020 xue et al 2017 the results from this approach would offer more relevant evidence linking to the toxic effect one application of this technique involves using poly methyl methacrylate film in san diego creek a coastal stream in southern california to measure fiproles in the surface water lao et al 2016 second the ssd derived hc5 values may also have uncertainty if the toxicity data were measured under fluctuating concentration and pulsed aquatic exposure ashauer et al 2016 since the toxicity data were adopted from literature in the present study any inherent uncertainty with these data was unknown however toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tktd models have been recommended to address uncertainty of toxicity endpoints across different exposure regimes baudrot and charles 2019 the selection of toxicity endpoints affects the assessment result the acute risks based on the lc50 and the ec50 endpoints significantly differed by a factor of 8 24 1 95 for the fiproles in the surface waters it suggests that the lethal and the sublethal acute toxicity data should be used in the assessment separately even though they both characterize acute toxicity del signore et al 2016 if the chronic risk was deduced from this acute toxicity data by applying the acr discrepancies in risk estimates would appear despite limited or unavailable data on toxicity suitable toxicity endpoints must be carefully selected for the assessment for example using the data from local species the lack of toxicity data especially data for loec and fip d impeded the accurate assessment of the risk of fiproles however the conservativity of the mixture assessment was expected to compensate the shortage of toxicity data ramo et al 2018 more work is needed to obtain the necessary toxicity data and to validate the prediction of the probabilistic assessment for both exposure and toxicity fiproles in sediment and aquatic organisms also need to be addressed due to their moderate hydrophobicity building good ssd relies on the selection of the appropriate model in the present study the log logistic model was used due to its established usage and ease of calculations for multiple stressors as expected it presented high r2 values for both exposure and toxicity data there are several other models that could be selected such as log normal burr iii weibull and bootstrap regression before the log logistic model was determined to use the normal burr iii and weibull models were also evaluated in terms of fitting the toxicity data and deriving hc5 values the normal and weibull models showed as high r2 values good residual sum of squares rss and root mean squared errors rmses as the log logistic model table s11 and s12 the hc5 values calculated by the log logistic and the normal models only differed by a factor of 1 37 0 21 while the hc5 values derived by the log logistic and the weibull models differed by a factor of 2 33 0 51 however in general ranges of the 95 confidence intervals of the hc5 values derived from the normal and weibull models were larger than that from the log logistic model table s13 in addition the burr iii model showed very large uncertainty in the hc5 values consequently the log logistic model was selected to implement the rest of the calculations it was reported that the estimates of the hc5 were not highly influenced by the selection of the different models del signore et al 2016 for example the hc5s of organochlorine pesticides estimated from ssds were very close to each other with standard deviations mostly within a factor of 2 wang et al 2008 due to lacking measurements any uncertainty caused by bioavailability and time variable concentration was unable to be estimated at the present stage which implied the both factors should be investigated in the future thus among the above mentioned factors the selection of toxicity endpoints was the most sensitive parameter contributing to uncertainty of the risk assessment 5 conclusions this study is the first to apply fiproles to assess risk with the probabilistic approach for the mixture of fipronil and its degradates in surface waters the fiproles as an integrated proxy provided the hc5 values and the overall risk probability of the mixture the hc5 values derived from the ssds of fiproles had high robustness due to the pooled toxicity data of fipronil and its degradates these hc5 values provided the appropriate benchmarks for environmental quality criteria and could make the risk assessment doable for stressors lacking in toxicity data the rankings of the likelihoods of ecological impact among the rivers were presented by the sspaf and jpc results the use of fiproles as a surrogate for the mixture of chemical stressors simplified the risk assessment for these mixtures because they shared a similar mode of action the multiple endpoints showed different risks from the same exposure caution should be used to conduct the extrapolation of the risk between the different endpoints this approach also improved the current practice of evaluating emerging contaminants using the occurrence and toxicity datasets the results presented useful information for the risk management of fiproles in the effluent dominated waterways of southern california assessing fiproles in storm runoff sediment and estuary sampling in the wet season and using passive sampling techniques warrant consideration in future investigations nonparametric approaches such as bootstrap regression and bayesian statistical methods should also be considered in the development of the ssd

17419,environmental risk assessment of complex chemical mixtures has increasingly been prioritized as a management goal especially in the regulatory sector although fipronil and its three degradates sulfone sulfide and desulfinyl have been frequently quantified in waterways little information is available about the likelihood and magnitude of ecological risk posed by these chemical mixtures collectively known as fiproles in surface water in the present study a probabilistic risk assessment of mixtures of fipronil and its three degradates was conducted for three effluent dominated southern california rivers los angeles river lar san gabriel river sgr and santa clara river scr california usa the assessments which used fiproles as an integrated proxy were based on three levels of toxicity endpoints median lethal concentration lc50 half maximal effective concentration ec50 and lowest observed effect concentration loec to gain comprehensive assessment information probabilistic approaches based on species sensitivity distribution ssd and exposure concentration distribution ecd were developed with the log logistic model by pooling the toxicity and occurrence data respectively the 5th percentile hazardous concentrations hc5s were calculated to be at low parts per billion levels enabling these values to be used to estimate the chemical specific benchmarks for components that lack ecotoxicity data the single substance potentially affected fraction sspaf of fiproles revealed risk levels for the three rivers in descending order lar sgr scr the overall risk probability estimated from the joint probability curve jpc by monte carlo simulation was 1 13 0 20 lc50 9 31 1 46 ec50 and 6 58 1 43 loec for the three rivers collectively these results derived from the fiproles indicates that fipronil and its degradates pose risks to the aquatic organisms in the surface water of the three rivers the present study provides a methodology for the use of a proxy in the risk assessment of chemical mixtures keywords fiproles probabilistic risk assessment of mixture surface water of river potentially affected fraction overall risk probability 1 introduction aquatic organisms are inevitably exposed to a plethora of contaminants in the environment bopp et al 2018 parkerton et al 2018 these complex mixtures may induce toxicity cumulatively independently synergistically or antagonistically consequently addressing combined exposure and risk assessment of complex mixtures is not as straightforward as for a single substance coors et al 2018 many investigations to date have focused on performing screening level single point assessment for individual compounds this approach neglects combined exposure and cannot outline the actual risk faced by the organisms even as it has been very successful in solving environmental problems caused by single stressors and or sources few cases to date have focused on cumulative risk assessment that takes multiple chemicals into account del signore et al 2016 lindim et al 2019 rand et al 2010 recognizing that organisms are generally exposed to multiple pollutants research activities are increasingly shifting toward addressing mixture assessment posthuma et al 2019 ramo et al 2018 as the single point assessment cannot procure the likelihood and magnitude of the risk probabilistic risk assessment based on species sensitivity distribution ssd and exposure concentration distribution ecd has been used to quantify the risk for mixtures of contaminants ecofram 1999 solomon and jones 2000 the cumulative risk assessment relies on the knowledge of the toxic mode of action tmoa for the components in the mixture assuming there are no interactions between chemicals in the mixture the concentration addition ca model is used to estimate the total toxic effect for chemicals with a similar tmoa while the independent action ia model is applied to chemicals with a dissimilar tmoa probabilistic risk assessment may be used to conduct community level evaluation giddings et al 2005 posthuma et al 2001 by providing results on the multiple substance potentially affected fraction mspaf and generating joint probability curves jpcs depicting the magnitude and likelihood of the risks of mixtures in addition environmental quality criteria can also be derived by the ssd model to link protective assessment goals to the mixture risk assessment posthuma et al 2019 fipronil is one of the phenylpyrazole insecticides it was introduced in 1985 by the company rhône poulenc and entered the crop insecticide market in 1993 levin and grabarnick 2018 it was registered in the u s in 1996 for commercial turf and indoor pest control but not registered for agricultural use in california fipronil is a nerve poison with a mode of action of blocking gamma amino butyric acid gaba regulated chloride channels to cause neural excitation and convulsions in insects resulting in death because fipronil is highly active broad spectrum and effective against insects that are resistant or tolerant to pyrethroid and carbamate insecticides it is a complementary alternative to these pesticides and has been widely used in both agriculture and non agricultural sectors such as structural pest control in urban areas hano et al 2019 indeed fipronil and its degradates have been frequently detected in the aquatic environment and have raised much concern in the environmental community budd et al 2015 sadaria et al 2017 single point assessments have been used to characterize the risks of fipronil and its three degradates sulfone sulfide and desulfinyl ensminger et al 2013 gan et al 2012 although the concentrations of each individual compound both fipronil as well as its degradates are typically low their combined concentrations might exceed the toxic benchmark especially given that fipronil degradates can be more toxic to some invertebrates than the parent compound sadaria et al 2019 weston and lydy 2014 thus it is necessary and imperative to characterize and predict the cumulative risk for fipronil and its degradates as a whole collectively referred to as total fiproles by applying the ssd approach backhaus and faust 2012 probabilistic risk assessments with potentially affected fraction paf and jpc approaches for a single substance were previously applied to fipronil fipronil sulfone and fipronil sulfide respectively in the surface water of canals and ponds wu et al 2015 as fipronil and its degradates share a similar tmoa hainzl et al 1998 zhao and salgado 2010 an assumption can be made that fiproles is a promising proxy for various potential mixtures of fipronil and its degradates this can be done by using the ssd model combined with the toxicity data of fipronil and its degradates to provide a single indicator e g single substance potentially affected fraction sspaf of the ecological risk associated with the mixture in terms of mixture risk assessment no study has been conducted on the total fipronil and its degradates by using fiproles as a proxy in an aquatic environment thus the goal of this study was to conduct a mixture risk assessment for fiproles in surface water a multi level approach for the risk assessment was adopted using screening level deterministic and probabilistic risk assessments based on three acute and chronic toxicity endpoints three effluent dominated rivers in southern california usa were selected to conduct the study because fipronil and its degradates were detected there previously maruya et al 2016 sengupta et al 2014 the expected output of this study was to illustrate the function of mixture risk assessment for chemical cocktails in surface waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials fipronil and its three degradates fipronil sulfone fipronil sulfide and fipronil desulfinyl as well as polychlorinated biphenyls pcb 205 and pcb 208 and 4 4 dibromooctafluorobiphenyl dbofb were purchased from accustandard new haven ct usa florisil 60 100 mesh was supplied by supelco bellefonte pa usa deionized water was prepared by a millipore water purification system billerica ma usa sodium azide and ascorbic acid was purchased from mallinckrodt baker phillipsburg nj usa all solvents are optima grade or better glassware and sodium sulfate emd chemicals gibbstown nj usa were baked at 500 c for 4 h before use in the present study to avoid any equivocal statement and for brevity the parent fipronil compound s degradates are abbreviated as fip o for fipronil sulfone fip i for fipronil sulfide and fip d for fipronil desulfinyl the term fiprole represents any individual compound of fipronil and its degradates within a collection while fiproles refers to the sum of the parent compound as well as the three degradates 2 2 study area and sample collection surface water samples were collected from three rivers within the los angeles region ca usa i e los angeles river lar san gabriel river sgr and santa clara river scr the lar is 89 km long and covers a watershed area of 2170 km2 the sgr is 98 km long and covers a watershed area of 1800 km2 the scr extends 134 km and covers a watershed area of 4140 km2 fig 1 the lands used for residential area were 37 26 and only 2 of the lar sgr and scr watersheds respectively https www ladpw org wmd watershed purpus and morgan 2011 approximately 9 2 and 0 57 million of population are living in the three watersheds respectively stillwater sciences 2011 for flood control most of the natural riverbeds of both the lar and sgr are paved to become concrete lined channels within the metropolitan region the scr located north of los angeles in the san gabriel mountains still has its natural riverbed in the majority of its waterway until reaching its coastal estuary there are several major water reclamation wastewater treatment plants wwtps built along the rivers i e three for lar five for sgr and four for scr respectively during dry season and low flow conditions one common feature of the three rivers is that more than 90 of the flow in the river is the effluent of these treatment works maruya et al 2016 sengupta et al 2014 a total of 48 surface water samples was collected from the three rivers during two dry season low flow events 26 july 2011 and 10 october 2011 from lar 6 stations and a reference station 27 july 2011 7 stations and a reference station and 11 october 2011 8 stations and a reference site from sgr 27 july 2013 6 stations a reference station and 3 stations in the estuary and 15 october 2013 6 stations and a reference station from scr fig 1 the grabbed water sample was transferred from a stainless steel bucket previously rinsed with methanol and deionized water into an amber 1 l bottle with preservatives 1 g l sodium azide and 50 mg l of ascorbic acid a set of equipment and water blank samples was also collected in the field for each sampling event all samples were kept on ice in the dark and were shipped to the laboratory for extraction within 48 h of collection 2 3 sample extraction and instrumental analysis extraction of the 1 l whole water sample was accomplished by liquid liquid extraction with methylene chloride the extracts were analyzed on an agilent 7890 gas chromatograph gc coupled to a 5975c quadrupole mass selective detector msd operated in the negative chemical ionization nci mode wilmington de usa detailed procedures of the extraction and analysis as well as the quality control data are provided in the supporting information 2 4 data analysis the risk assessment process used a tiered approach deterministic risk assessment was first conducted with calculation of risk quotient rq for individual fiprole compounds i e fipronil fip o fip i or fip d and total fiproles 1 r q m e c t t where mec represents measured exposure concentration and tt represents toxic threshold value such as median lethal concentration lc50 half maximal effective concentration ec50 or lowest observed effect concentration loec the rq value is mathematically equivalent to the so called toxic unit tu the lc50 values were from toxic thresholds of the mysid americamysis bahia the ec50 values of the midge chironomus dilutus were adopted in the rq calculation due to lack of data the loec values of only three species were used in the rq calculations for chronic risk evaluation i e a bahia for fipronil the water flea daphnia magna for fip o and fip i and the sheepshead minnow cyprinodon variegatus for fip d for screening level risk assessment the rq values were compared to the level of concern loc for aquatic animals the criteria are as follows 1 with lc50 and ec50 as the endpoints rq 0 5 high acute risk 0 05 rq 0 5 acute restricted use i e medium risk rq 0 05 acute endangered species i e low risk and 2 with the noec as the endpoint rq 1 chronic risk usepa since the toxic endpoints of the most sensitive species were used in the calculation the rq method was conservative as a screening level assessment to provide a general point estimate of potential of ecological risk for every sampling station to identify the main driver of chemical mixture risk the maximum cumulative ratio mcr was calculated using the sum of rq rqsum and maximum rq rqmax values in the following equation 2 m c r r q s u m r q m a x a single substance is driving the mixture risk when the mcr value approaches unity price and han 2011 certainly the denominator in eq 2 can be a sum of chemicals to reflect that the risk is primarily contributed by this subgroup the estimate of the risk could be attenuated only by counting on the main driver in the assessment of a mixture the magnitude of the missed risk mr could be easily estimated with 3 m r 1 1 m c r probabilistic approaches based on ssd were performed for the individual chemical as well as the mixture posthuma et al 2001 solomon and jones 2000 an ssd curve is a cumulative density function cdf of toxic benchmarks for a single toxicant the toxicity data and measured surface water concentrations were ranked as a percentile using the hazen plotting position 4 p e r c e n t i l e n 0 5 n where n is the rank number of data points and n is the total number of observations cunnane 1978 the ssd curves were created by fitting a log logistic distribution for lc50 ec50 and loec respectively kooijman 1987 5 p 1 1 exp log c log α β where p is the cumulative probability of the log logistic distribution α is the mean of the toxic endpoint values β is a scale parameter related with the standard deviation of log α c is the toxic endpoint values note that eq 5 was also used to describe the ecds in which the mec replaced c and α and β were estimated by non linear regression of the sigmoid curve by using the tus the ecological risk was estimated by the potentially affected fraction paf for the sampling station at a given toxicity level 6 p a f 1 1 exp logtu β when the tu was

used as mentioned above but also was reversely used to estimate the 5th percentile hazardous concentration hc5 that is the community level effect threshold associated to the endpoint i e lc50 ec50 or loec 12 h c 5 α 10 β l n 19 the overall risk probability orp was characterized by the joint probability curve jpc that describes the probability of exceeding the concentration associated with a particular degree of effect the jpc was generated from the ssd and the exceedance probability function exf the exf could be transformed from the ecd the orp could be calculated as the area under the jpc monte carlo calculations 10 000 simulations were used to estimate the area under the curve auc ecofram 1999 zolezzi et al 2005 the data for fipronil and its three degradates were previously reported focusing on occurrence in the rivers maruya et al 2016 sengupta et al 2014 these data were used for the risk assessment in the present study table s1 a total of 86 toxicity data records for fipronil and its three degradates was obtained from the usepa pesticide ecotoxicity database ecotox http cfpub epa gov ecotox and from published literature wu et al 2015 three endpoints of toxicity data i e lc50 ec50 and loec were retrieved table s2 the loec was used instead of no observed effect concentration noec due to the latter s limited availability the species groups included crustaceans mollusks larval insects and fish the statistics and regression analysis were performed by using sigmaplot 13 systat software san jose ca the monte carlo simulation was achieved on microsoft excel 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection and distribution of fiprole and fiproles fipronil fip o fip i and fip d in the surface water were detected at 100 of the lar stations including the reference station table s3 they were also detected at 100 of the sgr stations excluding the reference site where none were detected for the scr stations no fiproles were found at the reference station or at the scr 6 site but they were detected at 100 of the other stations comparing the data of the three rivers between sampling events i and ii respectively no statistically significant difference was identified mann whitney test p 0 381 0 594 there was no statistically significant difference between the concentrations of the lar e g median 4 09 ng l for fipronil and sgr e g median 4 27 ng l for fipronil but the concentrations of the scr e g median 1 01 ng l for fipronil were different from that in the other two rivers probably due to the scr being located in mostly suburban environments kruskal wallis one way anova test the maximum values among the stations were 13 6 10 6 2 03 13 8 and 28 7 ng l for fipronil fip o fip i fip d and fiproles respectively in the two sampling events excluding the three stations in the scr estuary in this estuary concentrations of fipronil fip o fip i fip d and fiproles showed ranges of 2 34 19 2 ng l 1 83 7 74 ng l 1 30 3 76 ng l 6 38 15 0 ng l 11 9 45 9 ng l respectively the concentrations of fiproles in the three stations were significantly higher than the other inland stations of scr t test p 0 027 fip i the reduction product of fipronil had the lowest levels among the three degradates whereas the levels of fipronil fip o the oxidation product and fip d the photolysis product were comparable fig 2 the concentrations of fiproles were significantly higher than the concentrations of every individual fiprole p 0 001 the mean standard deviation and median values of fiproles concentrations were 21 1 4 65 and 22 2 ng l for the lar 9 80 6 56 and 10 3 ng l for the sgr and 6 46 10 9 and 3 07 ng l for the scr including the three stations in the estuary respectively fig s1 fipronil and its degradates were frequently detected in the surface waters of streams influents and effluents for example in the san francisco bay area in northern california fiproles derived from urban pest control in the influents and effluents of wwtps in the dry season showed concentration ranges of 19 122 ng l mean 80 8 31 6 median 82 5 ng l and 16 7 63 5 ng l mean 49 6 15 0 median 52 0 ng l respectively sadaria et al 2017 in a nationwide investigation fiproles concentrations ranged from less than the method detection limit mdl to 189 ng l mean 27 5 45 3 median 6 85 ng l in the surface water from 38 streams across the usa bradley et al 2017 fiprole concentrations in los angeles surface waters ranged from 32 to 246 ng l during 2008 2013 budd et al 2015 in non storm urban runoff from two neighborhoods in northern and southern california fipronil concentrations were 9 7 30 4 ng l and 248 488 ng l respectively bale et al 2017 additionally in urban storm runoff fiprole presented much higher concentrations than in non storm runoff carpenter et al 2016 gan et al 2012 in contrast the fiproles concentrations in the present study were generally at the lower end of the range compared to these previous studies 3 2 deterministic risk assessment by integrating the data for the three rivers the lc50 based rqs of the individual fiprole showed a range of 0 0 189 with the median values showing a range of 0 002 0 048 table s4 whereas the rq of fiproles showed a range of 0 0 336 mean 0 102 0 075 median 0 088 to the acute ec50 and chronic loec endpoints the mean rqs of fiproles were 0 669 0 484 median 0 582 and 0 846 0 825 median 0 671 respectively however the highest value acute ec50 and chronic loec endpoints belonged to different compounds fip o 1 41 and fipronil 3 88 respectively comparing the rqs of fiproles among the three rivers showed different situations for the three toxicity endpoints for both lc50 and ec50 the fiproles rqs of the lar lc50 0 158 0 052 ec50 1 05 0 38 were significantly higher than those of the sgr lc50 0 090 0 053 ec50 0 575 0 33 and the scr lc50 0 060 0 082 ec50 0 392 0 504 p 0 05 kruskal wallis test on data ranks but there was no statistically significant difference between the rqs of the sgr and the scr p 0 31 on the loec level the fiproles rqs of the lar 1 10 0 53 and the sgr 0 911 0 82 had no difference p 0 625 and were higher than those of the scr 0 526 1 00 compared to the epa s level of concerns locs up to 44 of stations presented a medium acute risk i e acute restricted use to aquatic organisms based on the rqs of lc50 table s5 for the acute risk of ec50 up to 98 of stations showed medium acute risk and 56 stations showed acute high risk the loc of chronic risk was exceeded in 33 of stations using loec in the rq calculation the european union eu and australia have more conservative locs than the usepa their locs of acute high risk are 0 01 and 0 1 respectively and 0 1 eu for chronic risk lee steere 2009 according to these locs up to 98 of stations exceeded acute high risk of the eu criterion in terms of both lc50 and ec50 rq values additionally 44 of stations exceeded the australian threshold of acute high risk while up to 93 of stations showed chronic risk using the eu s loc the mcr values varied with ranges of 1 14 2 57 1 12 2 91 and 1 01 1 26 for the rqs of lc50 ec50 and loec respectively fip o was the major contributor for both acute toxicity endpoints while fipronil was the major contributor for chronic toxicity in instances where the mixture chemical risk assessment was not performed the mr values indicated that the risk could be underestimated up to 61 66 and 20 for the three toxicity endpoints respectively in the present study the calculation of the rq values used the lowest available toxic benchmarks and involved only four species table s6 therefore the rq values may describe the worst case scenario without characterizing uncertainty so these values may have limited ecological meaning lee steere 2009 however the information provided by the mcr and mr values may guide risk management to mitigate the drivers of mixture toxicity backhaus et al 2015 it has been shown in some studies that the mcr values indicated that only a few of the contaminants significantly contributed to the mixture risk bopp et al 2019 even though only four compounds were targeted the results of the present study support this finding 3 3 probabilistic risk assessment 3 3 1 ssd and hc5 the ssds were developed by log logistic regression using the laboratory toxicity data for individual fiprole and fiproles fig 3 for comparing toxic effect distributions in different levels acute lc50 and ec50 and chronic loec endpoints were used table 1 the distributions with 8 or more data points were robust with r2 0 95 in the log logistic regression this included fipronil all three toxic levels fip o ec50 and fip i ec50 the log logistic regression was less robust r2 0 95 when the data points were 5 which included fip o loec fip i lc50 and loec and fip d all three toxic levels for fiproles the ssds were built r2 0 95 separately for the three toxic levels by combining the corresponding endpoints of the four chemicals fig s2 the hc5 values were estimated from the ssd by eq 12 table 2 and s6 based on the hc5 values and the toxic benchmarks used in the rq calculation the acute to chronic ratios acrs i e lc50 loec and ec50 loec and the ratio of lc50 ec50 were calculated for fipronil and fiproles table s7 the acrs lc50 loec of fipronil fipronil hc5 and fiproles hc5 were virtually identical when considering the uncertainties associated with the ratio values this was also true for the arcs of ec50 loec and lc50 ec50 their average values were 28 2 95 5 lc50 loec 2 91 13 4 lc50 ec50 6 01 22 1 ec50 loec respectively the surface water hc5 values of fiproles were 188 51 3 ng l lc50 9 08 15 1 ng l ec50 and 7 98 4 75 ng l loec this data can be used for calculating rq in the screening level assessment of cumulative risk for fipronil and its three degradates given that there is a lack of thresholds for the individual fiprole such as fip d giddings et al 2019 this data can also be adopted as a basis to derive fiproles criteria e g noec and predicted no effect concentration pnec by dividing an appropriate assessment factor af for regional evaluation bower and tjeerdema 2017 the hc5 data of fiprole were comparable with the benchmarks of the most sensitive species used in the rq calculation table s6 for example the fipronil hc5 values were 79 7 16 9 ng l lc50 27 7 20 9 ng l ec50 and 2 45 2 07 ng l loec these values were within a range of the toxic benchmarks used in the rq calculations by a factor of two based on the burr iii type ssd the calculated acute and chronic criteria values of fipronil were 39 ng l and 3 2 ng l respectively bower and tjeerdema 2017 in contrast giddings et al reported that acute hc5 values of eight commonly used pyrethroids showed a range of 0 82 34 ng l giddings et al 2019 chronic endpoints were used to build the ssds in previous studies sun et al 2017 however because there were limited chronic data available the toxicity data were estimated by converting the corresponding acute data via the acr duboudin et al 2004 zwart 2001 the value of 25 was recommended as the acr to calculate the chronic toxicity data based on various chemicals for fish and aquatic invertebrates kenaga 1982 an acr of 8 3 was also determined by computing the toxicity data of 456 species of aquatic invertebrate and fish raimondo et al 2007 the acrs of cypermethrin for ceriodaphnia dubia showed a range of 14 33 for different toxicity endpoints li and you 2015 the acrs in the present study shared the same range with the values in the previous reports so the average values could be used to estimate the chronic toxicity data for fiprole table s7 3 3 2 paf and jpc treating the fiproles as a single substance the sspaf was calculated using the log logistic regression parameters for each station table s8 including all the sampling stations the grand mean std values were 0 764 0 427 lc50 6 88 4 88 ec50 and 5 51 2 42 loec table s9 these values showed that acute lethal toxicity lc50 was the smallest among the three toxicity endpoints whereas acute sublethal ec50 and chronic loec toxicities were comparable fig s3 the criteria of paf results were low risk paf 1 moderate risk 1 paf 5 and high risk paf 5 ramo et al 2018 the mean data of the sspaf indicated fiproles posted low to moderate risk at the acute lethal toxicity level for aquatic organisms in the surface water of the three rivers and moderate to high risk at both acute sublethal and chronic toxicity levels regarding the individual rivers the sspaf mean value of the lar was the highest among the three rivers the risk levels of the three rivers in descending order were lar sgr scr fig 4 for comparison values of the mspaf for the mixture of fipronil and its three degradates were also calculated in terms of the ca mode and ia models and are presented with the above fiproles sspafs fig s4 the fiproles lc50 sspaf and the ia model mspaf 0 817 0 514 were almost identical and much higher respectively than the ca mode mspaf 0 031 0 027 the mean value of the ec50 fiproles sspaf 6 88 4 88 was higher than the mspaf values of both the ca 2 56 2 30 and the ia 1 83 1 44 modes but the values of the loec sspaf 5 71 2 42 and the mspafs were basically equivalent generally the differences shown in these comparisons indicated the risk assessment using the fiproles sspaf was more conservative than using the ca model and ia model mspafs if disregarding the tmoa in addition the similarity being presenting from these comparisons validated the estimate of the fiproles sspaf the sspaf mean values of the scr estuary were very higher than those of the river mainstream i e 1 19 0 653 vs 0 29 0 16 for lc50 ec50 12 0 8 68 vs 1 74 1 13 for ec50 7 86 2 80 vs 2 90 1 46 for loec table s9 nevertheless they were similar to those of the lar 1 14 0 175 11 1 2 30 7 78 0 803 thus these sspafs are shown separately with the other scr stations in fig 4 fipronil and its three degradates are moderately hydrophobic log kow 4 0 so that their transportation in the waterway can be in both dissolved and particle associated phases the higher concentrations of fiproles at the three stations indicated fipronil and its three degradates were retained and accumulated in the estuary consequently these chemicals might contribute more risks to the organisms residing in the estuary it implied monitoring and risk assessment of fiproles in estuary habitats should be very necessary du et al 2020 the exposure concentration distributions ecds were created by the log logistic regression with high r2 0 92 0 99 for the individual fiprole and the fiproles fig 3 and table s10 the jpcs of fiproles showed that the three curves closed the axes to different extents which revealed that the orps varied by category of toxicity i e ec50 loec lc50 fig 5 the orps were 1 13 0 20 lc50 9 31 1 46 ec50 and 6 58 1 43 loec for the three rivers as a whole table 2 the acute toxicity orp based on the ec50 benchmarks was 8 2 times higher than the acute toxicity orp based on the lc50 endpoints and 1 4 times higher than the chronic risk probability the orps results are interpreted as potential risk under 0 1 and clear risk greater than 1 li and you 2015 wang et al 2008 the fiproles lc50 orp value was near 1 but the risk of lethal acute toxicity was still assigned for the sake of conservation there was no doubt that fiproles posted both sublethal acute risk and chronic risk to the aquatic organisms in the three rivers when looking at each river individually the orps of fiproles exhibited different risks for each of the three rivers table 2 the orps of the three rivers were all greater than 1 for the ec50 and loec endpoints only the lc50 acute risk of the lar was barely higher than 1 while the values of the sgr and the scr showed a range of 0 1 1 a classification based on the orps of the three endpoints was consistent for the individual rivers i e lar sgr scr excluding the three estuary sites in addition a series of assessment factors i e 2 5 10 and 100 were used to predict the risk probabilities for the adverse effects of noec and pnec from the loec zolezzi et al 2005 the orps at these assessment factors increased to 8 47 12 6 17 6 and 38 0 respectively it appeared that fiproles certainly posed a chronic threat to the aquatic organisms in the rivers furthermore it could be deduced that the lar was a major contributor to the three river orps the occurrence of fipronil should be solely of urban origin in california because it is not registered for agricultural use down the drain transport offsite movement by washoff and runoff and wastewater effluent have been identified as primary sources of fiproles in the urban area cryder et al 2019 teerlink et al 2017 the higher orps for the lar and the sgr corroborated the fact that both rivers flow through the larger neighborhoods with the greater population density in the los angeles region while the lower orps for the scr was also in accordance with the situation of the lower population density and the smaller residential area 3 4 uncertainty and limitation these assessments were based on two sampling events during dry seasons the spatial distribution of the sampling sites the sampling temporal scale the sampling frequency the water flow rates and episodic release of effluent could affect the sample composition due to the features of the effluent dominated coastal river sengupta et al 2014 fate processes for fiprole compounds including degradation volatilization and adsorption in the riverine ecosystem may also reduce the occurrence in surface water maruya et al 2016 it is predicted that fiproles would pose an even higher risk in the storm water runoff in the wet season in southern california carpenter et al 2016 gan et al 2012 partitioning to suspended solids would be expected to decrease the freely dissolved fraction thus reducing bioavailability because pesticide concentrations are rarely constant over time in real world time variable concentration can exert influences on both quantifying exposure and ssd derived hc5 values kreuger 1998 van den brink et al 2019 first using discrete water samples to estimate occurrence of the pesticides may not be accurate when encountering fluctuation of the concentration and or flow condition the statistical identical concentrations of fiproles in the event i and ii indicated occurrence of fipronil and its degradates were likely stable during the low flow conditions in the sampling region even though it could be a coincidence thus to this situation time weighted concentration can be used to characterize the mean concentration during the sampling period xiong et al 2019 other than taking discrete samples a promising technique that could address the ultra low waterborne concentration bioavailability and time weighted concentration simultaneously is the passive sampling approach wang et al 2020 xue et al 2017 the results from this approach would offer more relevant evidence linking to the toxic effect one application of this technique involves using poly methyl methacrylate film in san diego creek a coastal stream in southern california to measure fiproles in the surface water lao et al 2016 second the ssd derived hc5 values may also have uncertainty if the toxicity data were measured under fluctuating concentration and pulsed aquatic exposure ashauer et al 2016 since the toxicity data were adopted from literature in the present study any inherent uncertainty with these data was unknown however toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tktd models have been recommended to address uncertainty of toxicity endpoints across different exposure regimes baudrot and charles 2019 the selection of toxicity endpoints affects the assessment result the acute risks based on the lc50 and the ec50 endpoints significantly differed by a factor of 8 24 1 95 for the fiproles in the surface waters it suggests that the lethal and the sublethal acute toxicity data should be used in the assessment separately even though they both characterize acute toxicity del signore et al 2016 if the chronic risk was deduced from this acute toxicity data by applying the acr discrepancies in risk estimates would appear despite limited or unavailable data on toxicity suitable toxicity endpoints must be carefully selected for the assessment for example using the data from local species the lack of toxicity data especially data for loec and fip d impeded the accurate assessment of the risk of fiproles however the conservativity of the mixture assessment was expected to compensate the shortage of toxicity data ramo et al 2018 more work is needed to obtain the necessary toxicity data and to validate the prediction of the probabilistic assessment for both exposure and toxicity fiproles in sediment and aquatic organisms also need to be addressed due to their moderate hydrophobicity building good ssd relies on the selection of the appropriate model in the present study the log logistic model was used due to its established usage and ease of calculations for multiple stressors as expected it presented high r2 values for both exposure and toxicity data there are several other models that could be selected such as log normal burr iii weibull and bootstrap regression before the log logistic model was determined to use the normal burr iii and weibull models were also evaluated in terms of fitting the toxicity data and deriving hc5 values the normal and weibull models showed as high r2 values good residual sum of squares rss and root mean squared errors rmses as the log logistic model table s11 and s12 the hc5 values calculated by the log logistic and the normal models only differed by a factor of 1 37 0 21 while the hc5 values derived by the log logistic and the weibull models differed by a factor of 2 33 0 51 however in general ranges of the 95 confidence intervals of the hc5 values derived from the normal and weibull models were larger than that from the log logistic model table s13 in addition the burr iii model showed very large uncertainty in the hc5 values consequently the log logistic model was selected to implement the rest of the calculations it was reported that the estimates of the hc5 were not highly influenced by the selection of the different models del signore et al 2016 for example the hc5s of organochlorine pesticides estimated from ssds were very close to each other with standard deviations mostly within a factor of 2 wang et al 2008 due to lacking measurements any uncertainty caused by bioavailability and time variable concentration was unable to be estimated at the present stage which implied the both factors should be investigated in the future thus among the above mentioned factors the selection of toxicity endpoints was the most sensitive parameter contributing to uncertainty of the risk assessment 5 conclusions this study is the first to apply fiproles to assess risk with the probabilistic approach for the mixture of fipronil and its degradates in surface waters the fiproles as an integrated proxy provided the hc5 values and the overall risk probability of the mixture the hc5 values derived from the ssds of fiproles had high robustness due to the pooled toxicity data of fipronil and its degradates these hc5 values provided the appropriate benchmarks for environmental quality criteria and could make the risk assessment doable for stressors lacking in toxicity data the rankings of the likelihoods of ecological impact among the rivers were presented by the sspaf and jpc results the use of fiproles as a surrogate for the mixture of chemical stressors simplified the risk assessment for these mixtures because they shared a similar mode of action the multiple endpoints showed different risks from the same exposure caution should be used to conduct the extrapolation of the risk between the different endpoints this approach also improved the current practice of evaluating emerging contaminants using the occurrence and toxicity datasets the results presented useful information for the risk management of fiproles in the effluent dominated waterways of southern california assessing fiproles in storm runoff sediment and estuary sampling in the wet season and using passive sampling techniques warrant consideration in future investigations nonparametric approaches such as bootstrap regression and bayesian statistical methods should also be considered in the development of the ssd
