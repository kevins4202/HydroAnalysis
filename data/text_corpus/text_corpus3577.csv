17885,the negative effects of ubiquitous microplastics on wastewater treatment have attracted increasing attention however the potential impacts of microplastics on anaerobic granular sludge ags remain unknown to fill this knowledge gap this paper investigated the response of ags to the exposure of model microplastics polyethylene terephthalate pet mps and provided insights into the mechanisms involved the 84 days long term exposure experiments demonstrated that pet mps at relatively low level 15 mp l 1 did not affect ags performance during anaerobic wastewater treatment while 75 300 mp l 1 of pet mps caused the decreases of cod removal efficiency and methane yields by 17 4 30 4 and 17 2 28 4 accompanied with the 119 4 227 8 increase in short chain fatty acid scfa accumulation and particle breakage extracellular polymeric substances eps analysis showed that dosage dependent tolerance of ags to pet mps was attributed to the induced eps producing protection role but pet mps at higher concentrations 75 300 mp l 1 suppressed eps generation correspondingly microbial community analysis revealed that the populations of key acidogens e g levilinea sp and methanogens e g methanosaeta sp decreased after long term exposure to pet mps assessment of the toxicity of pet mps revealed that the leached di n butyl phthalate dbp and the induced reactive oxygen species ros by pet mps were causing toxicity towards ags confirmed by the increases in cell mortality and lactate dehydrogenase ldh release these results provide novel insights into the ecological risk assessment of microplastics in anaerobic wastewater treatment system graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics polyethylene terephthalate anaerobic granular sludge methane production toxic mechanism 1 introduction microplastics which are defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm have raised global concerns due to their environmental risks murphy et al 2016 thompson et al 2004 widespread applications of microplastics in commercial products such as pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps medicines textiles and media blasting cheung and fok 2017 cole et al 2011 contribute to high levels of microplastic pollution to date microplastics e g polyethylene terephthalate pet polyethylene pe polyamide pa polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc are frequently detected in natural environment industrial and domestic wastewater and even sewage sludge cheung and fok 2017 eerkes medrano et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 yang et al 2019 recent toxicological studies have confirmed that microplastics cause adverse impacts on microorganisms wang et al 2020 for instance the exposure of polystyrene microplastics inhibited 50 growth rate of microalgae scenedesmus obliquus by blocking photosynthesis and destroying the cell walls liu et al 2020 which possibly be associated with the oxidative stress besides various chemical additives such as phthalates paes have been used in microplastics production to modify plasticity polymerization and durability however the additives can easily leach out from the microplastics due to the weak non covalent interactions via hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces interaction between additives and microplastics kiani et al 2018 luo et al 2018 salazar beltrán et al 2018 according to previous literatures kiani et al 2018 luo et al 2018 salazar beltrán et al 2018 dibutyl phthalate dbp di 2 ethyl hexyl phthalate dehp diethyl phthalate dep benzyl butyl phthalate bbp and dimethyl phthalate dmp are the main additives in polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics in the leaching experiment dibutyl phthalate dbp has the highest detection frequency luo et al 2018 phthalates have been found to be toxic to organisms by disrupting growth energy metabolism tissue differentiation and reproduction luo et al 2018 zaki and shoeib 2018 microplastics in large quantities are released into wastewater during their production utilization and disposal studies have shown that the municipal wastewater contained 15 70 5 23 mps l 1 of microplastics on average murphy et al 2016 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are generally considered as the final barriers for microplastics entering the natural environment carr et al 2016 li et al 2018 thus a large amount of microplastics inevitably accumulate in the wastewater treatment plants thereby causing the potential effects our previous studies found that the exposure of microplastics induced cytotoxicity for anaerobic flocculent sludge thereby inhibiting the performance of mesophilic anaerobic digester 37 1 c srt 15 d wei et al 2019a 2019b nevertheless the potential effects of microplastics on anaerobic granular sludge ags unit remain unknown as a more efficient anaerobic technology ags can improve the processing capacity of organic mattes and increase microbial concentration and solid liquid separation efficiency he et al 2017 the anaerobic reactors based on granular sludge e g the anaerobic up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor and anaerobic internal circulation ic reactor has been widely used for high strength organic wastewater treatment different from the flocculent sludge ags has a more complex hierarchical structure including acidogens syntrophic microcolonies and aceticlastic methanogens li et al 2017 excepting the layered distribution of abundant microbial community extracellular polymeric substances eps is also an indispensable backbone component of the ags which makes ags have stronger tolerance to external toxic environment than flocculent sludge ma et al 2013 therefore the objective of this study was to disclose the microbial responses of ags to the long term exposure of microplastics during anaerobic wastewater treatment polyethylene terephthalate microplastics pet mps as one of the most common of microplastics in wastewater lv et al 2019 yang et al 2019 were chosen as the model microplastics to be assessed in this work their concentration in the wastewater is 15 mp l 1 murphy et al 2016 but the large scale production and usage would lead to their increased release thus the effects of long term exposure of pet mps 15 300 mp l 1 on the activities and the properties of ags were specifically assessed the component and architecture variations of eps on ags after exposing to pet mps were quantified and visualized the variations of microbial community in ags when long term exposed to pet mps were also evaluated furthermore the toxic mechanisms of pet mps towards ags were explored from the aspects of oxidative stress and the toxic leachates 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and pet microplastics the ags used in this experiment derived from the laboratory scale up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating citric acid wastewater analysis of the particle size of ags by mastersizer 2000 malvern uk suggested that the average particle diameter of ags was 1 27 mm besides the ratio of volatile suspended solid vss to total suspended solid tss was 82 6 the average size of microplastics detected in wastewater was about 0 2 mm xu et al 2019 thus commercial pet mps with size of 0 2 mm were purchased from zhongcheng co ltd guangzhou china and used in this work 2 2 set up and operation of the bioreactors the responds of ags to the long term exposure of pet mps during wastewater treatment were investigated using five continuously operated uasb reactors one was used as control reactor with no pet mps exposure other four as experimental reactors were operated with a certain number of pet mps in this work 15 mp l 1 of pet mps was served as environmentally relevant concentration in municipal wastewater treatment systems according to murphy et al 2016 considering the increasing usage and annual output even the occurrence of sudden leakage event the higher levels pet mps of 75 mp l 1 150 mp l 1 and 300 mp l 1 were also chosen to assess in this work all reactors were operated continuously for 120 days which were divided into phase ⅰ baseline phase day 0 35 and phase ⅱ experiment phase day 36 120 in phase i the ags was inoculated into each reactor with tss of 2 g l each reactor was fed with simulated wastewater whose compositions were shown in si all reactors were operated at an organic loading rate olr of 2 0 kg cod m3 day and the carbon source was provided by glucose ph 6 9 0 1 with a concentration of 2000 mg l the hydraulic retention time hrt of each reactor was 24 h all reactors were cultivated thermostatically at 37 1 c during phase ⅰ no pet mps was added and the operational parameter was kept identically in each bioreactor in order to establish the similar and stable performance this phase was ended until each reactor reached stable and good enough performance for cod removal efficiency and methane yield within 10 disparity exposure experiments were conducted in phase ⅱ experiment phase day 36 120 by feeding simulated wastewater with various levels of pet mps in experimental reactors other operation conditions remained unchanged throughout the study the volume and composition of biogas h2 n2 ch4 co2 were measured every 24 h the cod in effluent from each reactor as well as the short chain fatty acid scfa i e acetic propionic and butyric acids concentrations were determined every 3 days triplicate samples were withdrawn from each reactor for microbial community analysis after the long term exposure test the granular size morphology and eps of ags from each reactor were also analyzed the particle size distribution of ags was measured by mastersizer 2000 malvern uk particle size detection range was set as 0 01 3500 μm the ags samples were placed into cuvette and the size data was measured with the shading coefficient of 12 15 more detailed information of the analysis of microbial community and morphology was described in the si 2 3 eps extraction and analysis eps was extracted with the modified oscillation ultrasound combined cationic resin extraction method liu et al 2010 after long term exposure test 0 05 nacl solution was used to wash the ags obtained from each bioreactor three times and the washed ags was suspended in 0 05 nacl solution to certain volume again the suspension liquid was treated via 2 min ultrasound followed by 10 min horizontal oscillation and another 2 min ultrasound the supernatant from the treated suspension was separated and collected by centrifugation at 9000g and 4 c for 15 min the residual ags was resuspended in 0 05 nacl solution to predetermined volume and mixed with 60 g g ss cation exchange resin cer then the mixtures were stirred continuously overnight at 4 c after that the mixtures were centrifugated for 30 min at 9000 g and 4 c to harvest the supernatant the two groups of supernatants were mixed to analyze the compositions the concentrations of proteins pn polysaccharides ps humic acids ha lipids and dna in eps were analyzed after the supernatants being filtrated through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membranes the proteins and humic acids were analyzed by a modified lowry method using bovine serum albumin and humic acids as the standards respectively frolund et al 1995 markwell et al 1978 the polysaccharides content was determined by the anthrone sulfuric acid colorimetry with glucose as standard laurentin and edwards 2003 the content of lipids was determined using the method in frings and dunn 1970 with commercial olive oil as standard diphenylamine colorimetry was used to determine dna using calf thymus as a standard solution gendimenico et al 1988 2 4 visual observation of eps distribution in ags a cutting edge technique combined multiple fluorescence labeling with confocal laser scanning microscope clsm was applied to observe the spatial distribution of eps components in ags chen et al 2007a 2007b detailed information about the excitation and emission wavelengths of dyes used to trace the associated targets was listed in table s1 samples obtained from each bioreactor were stored at 20 c immediately then the frozen samples were sectioned into 10 μm sections and fixed onto microslides for staining fitc 1 mg ml in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 50 μl concanavalin con a tetramethylrhodamine conjugate solution 0 25 mg ml in dmso 100 μl calcofluor white 30 mg ml in dmso 100 μl and nile red solution 0 01 mg ml in dmso 60 μl were successively added to sections at regular intervals it should be noted that after each staining the sections need to be washed with 1 pbs buffer to remove the redundant dye 2 5 experiments of impacts of pet microplastics on the steps of acidification and methanization the removal of cod i e glucose in this study in the wastewater by ags under anaerobic condition generally undergoes acidification and methanation steps the impacts of pet mps on the acidification and methanation were indicated by the degradation of glucose and the generation of methane via a series of batch tests in brief 100 ml of synthetic wastewater and pet mps at corresponding concentration were added into each serum bottles the ags was inoculated into each bottle with tss of 2 g l afterwards 10 5 g l of 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid besa was dosed in each serum bottle to inhibit the activity of methanogens all bottles were sealed and cultivated in a constant temperature incubator 170 rmp at 37 1 c after oxygen removal when the scfa concentrations stopped increasing after 2 days in this study indicating the acidification step was complete the degradation efficiencies of glucose were measured the operation of the impacts of pet mps on the methanization step was nearly same as the procedure described above except that the 2000 mg cod l glucose in synthetic wastewater was replaced by sodium acetate and no besa was added the cumulative methane production was monitored until it remained unchanged after 8 days in this study 2 6 determination of the released chemicals from pet microplastics as well as the impacts on methane production according to previous literatures kiani et al 2018 luo et al 2018 salazar beltrán et al 2018 and the manufacturers dbp dehp dep bbp and dmp are the main additives in pet mps in order to determine the corresponding concentration of those additives released from pet mps 100 ml of synthetic wastewater containing pet mps at four tested levels and ags with 2000 mg l of tss were added into each serum bottles then the mixtures were incubated at 37 1 c under anaerobic condition at different times 0 1 3 5 7 days the samples were withdrawn and centrifuged at 9000 g for 15 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filter membrane and the residual sludge was dried using a freeze dryer 20 c scientz 10 n china detailed information about the methods used to analyze the compositions of chemical additives in filtrate and sludge was recorded in the si the experiments of detected leachate from pet mps affecting methane production by ags were performed via the same procedure described in the impacts of pet mps on the acidification step above except that the pet mps was substituted by the corresponding concentrations of detected chemicals and no besa was added at different times 0 1 3 5 7 days the chemicals at corresponding leaching concentration were gradually added into the relevant bottles the methane production under the exposure of pet mps and leachates at corresponding concentrations were measured and compared 2 7 measurement of oxidative stress and cell viability the extent of oxidative stress induced by pet mps was evaluated by the production of reactive oxygen species ros at the end of exposure test it is well known that higher oxidative stress can cause cell death mu and chen 2011 thus the amount of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase ldh released was determined to indicate the integrity of cell membranes additionally the live dead microorganisms at the end of pet mps exposure test were counted using staining technique the detailed measurement methods for ros generation ldh release and live dead staining can be found in the si 2 8 other analytical methods the volume of biogas produced in the uasb reactor was recorded using gas flow meter the manometer was used to determine the biogas volume produced in batch bottle based on the differences of gas pressure in headspace a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd lunan 6890 was used to analyze the composition of biogas the methane yield was calculated based on the data of biogas volume and the methane percentage the concentration of scfa e g acetic propionic and butyric acids was measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with a fid detector agilent more detailed information of the measurement for biogas composition and scfa concentration was described in the si the procedures for determining cod tss and vss are detailed in the standard methods apha 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of ags during long term exposure to pet microplastics the cod removal efficiency and methane production in the ags reactors exposed to pet mps were monitored and the results were recorded in fig 1 on day 30 in phase ⅰ all reactors reached the stable state with the similar cod removal efficiency 89 3 and methane production 63 ml d throughout the phase ⅱ day 36 120 the average cod removal efficiency and the methane yield in the reactor feeding wastewater with 15 mp l 1 of pet mps were almost the same as the control reactor remaining at 89 8 and 61 ml d respectively however with the increase concentrations of pet mps 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 the cod removal efficiencies at the end of exposure time gradually decreased to 71 8 65 6 and 60 5 respectively aligning with the cod removal data the methane production also showed a descending trend gradually with the pet mps concentration raised in the reactor feeding wastewater with 300 mp l 1 of pet mps the methane production dropped to 45 ml d on day 120 representing a relative decrease of 28 4 compared to the control reactor 63 ml d besides scfa is an important intermediate product in the conversion process from cod to methane which is also link to the overall performance as shown in fig 1c the exposure of 15 mp l 1 of pet mps did not affect the scfa concentration in comparison to the control nevertheless in the reactors feeding wastewater with pet mps at 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 scfa concentrations increased from 182 8 mg cod l control to 401 1 mg cod l 505 1 mg cod l and 599 2 mg cod l at the end of operation indicating more scfa accumulation in short the influences of pet mps on ags performance were intensively related to the pet mps levels ags exhibited good tolerance for low concentration 15 mp l 1 of pet mps while high concentrations of pet mps 75 300 mp l 1 significantly inhibited ags activity with lower cod removal efficiency p 2 16e 07 2 02e 07 and 4 44e 08 and methane production p 0 004 0 008 and 0 006 as well as more scfa accumulation p 1 21e 05 1 83e 06 and 4 09e 06 observed 3 2 effect of pet microplastics on the morphology characteristics of ags fig 2a demonstrated the particle size distribution of the ags in each reactor at the end of exposure test results showed that particle size distributions of ags varied from 0 to 3080 μm compared to the ags in control reactor the particle size of the ags in experimental reactors exposed to 75 300 mp l 1 of pet mps presented a decrease trend which was reflected in the larger proportion of small particle size also the medium particle diameter dx 50 of ags in the reactor exposed to 15 mp l 1 of pet mps 1235 μm was similar with the control 1275 μm whereas the dx 50 of the ags exposed to higher pet mps concentrations 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 decreased to 1165 1080 and 984 μm respectively this indicated that higher pet mps concentrations would cause granule breakage the surface morphologies of ags from control reactor and experimental reactor exposed to 300 mp l 1 of pet mps were observed by scanning electron microscope as seen in fig 2 b the granule from control reactor was intact and compact while granule from experimental reactor exposed to 300 mp l 1 of pet mps had an impair surface with many cracks and the granule had a tendency to dissociation it was observed at higher magnification that the exposure of pet mps reduced the amounts of filamentous shaped microbes which might be regarded as methanosaeta like cells besides the cavities as transport channels for nutrient substances and biogas can be observed in the control but the porosities were clogged after long term exposure of pet mps this indicated that more and more small size microplastics and lysed tissue were accumulated on ags which would prevent the nutrient matrix transfer and biogas emission dai et al 2016 yu et al 2019 it was a reasonable explanation for a part of ags floatation in the experimental reactor observed 3 3 effect of pet microplastics on the eps of ags as an indispensable part of ags eps play the significant roles in maintaining the granules structure and defensing the external toxic substances mu et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 the dominant components in eps of ags from control reactor were the proteins followed by α d glucopyranose polysaccharides β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids which evenly wrapped around the granules the long term exposure of pet mps at 300 mp l 1 remarkably decreased the eps amounts fig 3 especially center proteins which would have adverse impact on granules structure further quantification analysis of eps was showed in fig 3 compared to the control there was no obvious change in the contents of proteins and dna in eps at the presence of 15 mp l 1 pet mps but the content of polysaccharides lipids and humic acids increased by 22 8 22 5 and 21 3 respectively this suggested that low level of pet mps enhanced eps secretion thereby protecting the microorganisms against toxicity this was a reasonable explanation for the unaffected ags performances observed in the reactor exposed to 15 mp l 1 pet mps but with pet mps levels increasing from 75 to 300 mp l 1 the amounts of proteins humic acids polysaccharides and lipids all decreased previous study in mu et al 2012 reported that the reduction of eps caused by zno nps could result in their impotent protections towards the inner anaerobes of ags with increased deaths of microorganisms in this work the contents of dna in eps also showed an upward trend indicating that higher levels of pet mps suppressed eps secretion causing cells death 3 4 effect of pet microplastics on the microbial community in order to analyze the variations of microbial community in the ags after long term exposure of pet mps high throughput sequencing was carried out in the control reactor and experimental reactor exposed to 300 mp l 1 of pet mps the ags from control and experimental reactors yielded 44263 and 42807 effective sequences representing 337 operational taxonomic units otus on average this pattern indicated that the long term exposure to pet mps reduced the total microbial populations additionally rarefaction curves of the samples from two reactors fig s1 demonstrated that the sequencing depths were enough to cover the whole microbial species and the sequencing data was reasonable the abundance and diversity of the microorganisms were evaluated using alpha diversity analysis from fig 4 a no significantly p 0 87 0 14 and 0 20 differences in the indexes of chao 383 21 vs 380 22 shannon 3 44 0 02 vs 3 41 0 02 and pd whole tree 36 2 vs 34 1 between two reactors were observed the results indicated that the microbial structure and diversity of ags did not be affected remarkably by the long term exposure of pet mps bacterial and archaeal phyla were both detected in the control reactor and experimental reactor fig 4b it is well known that methanogens belong to euryarchaeota expectedly the long term exposure of pet mps at 300 mp l 1 reduced the abundance of euryarchaeota from 30 9 to 25 4 besides euryarchaeota the microbial communities of two reactors were also predominated by actinobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes which have been reported to have the capacity of converting organic compounds to volatile fatty acids vfas wang et al 2018 aside from chloroflexi the abundances of actinobacteria and bacteroidetes in the reactor exposed to 300 mp l 1 of pet mps decreased from 20 3 to 10 2 17 5 and 8 3 respectively however the exposure of pet mps increased the relative abundance of synergistetes it should be noted that this increase might be attributed to the decreased total microbial populations detected and pet mps may not necessarily increase their absolute abundance i e the total populations of synergistetes taxonomic compositions of the microbial community at the genus level were showed in fig 4c which consisted of various anaerobes relevant to acidification and methanization it can be seen that methanosaeta sp and methanobacterium sp were shared in two reactors which were associated with the methanization the exposure of pet mps 300 mps l 1 distinctly decreased the abundances of these two genera by 26 2 and 19 9 compared to control methanosaeta sp as a kind of aceticlastic methanogen has been documented to be able to produce methane by utilizing acetate sundberg et al 2013 thus their obvious reduction might be the reason for more scfa accumulation in the experimental reactor observed besides the populations of most acidogens were also declining in the experimental reactor for example levilinea sp and longilinea sp are two kinds of carbohydrates utilizing genera with organic acids as the product yamada et al 2006 2007 their populations dropped by 64 5 and 63 2 respectively similarly syntrophobacter sp is known as an acetogen which was less abundant after long term exposure of pet mps to sum up the long term exposure of pet mps at 300 mps l 1 reduced the populations of key acidogens and methanogens which were closely related to the deteriorative performance in the experimental reactor exposed to pet mps 3 5 insights into the toxic mechanisms of the pet microplastics on the ags degradation of organic matter glucose as substrates by ags under anaerobic condition generally undergoes acidification and methanization steps he et al 2017 if these two processes are affected the treatment performance will be influenced inevitably thus the effects of pet mps on the acidification and methanization were investigated in order to disclose the function of pet mps the effects on acidification were assessed by inhibiting methanogens activity and the results were exhibited in fig s2a the low level of pet mps at 15 mp l 1 had no impact on glucose degradation while at the 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 of pet mps it decreased to 90 1 88 3 and 86 1 of the control respectively the profiles of methane production from acidification product also showed a similar trend fig s2b it revealed that higher levels of pet mps suppressed both acidification and methanization steps which was consistent with the decreased abundances of acidogens and methanogens observed in microbial communities but this raised a very interesting and important question how pet mps induced toxic effects it has been reported that the adverse effects of microplastics on different aquatic species e g amphibalanus amphitrite and perna perna were associated with their leachates gandara et al 2016 li et al 2016 phthalates were the common chemical additives used to modify the properties of pet mps some researches have verified that release of phthalates was related to temperature and higher storage temperature promoted the phthalates leaching luo et al 2018 thus the mesophilic 37 1 c anaerobic wastewater treatment was preferable for migrations of additives in our leaching tests the only chemical additive detected was dbp which was in accord with the reports of suhrhoff and scholz boettcher 2016 the leaching curves of dbp from four studied levels of pet mps were presented in fig s3 more dbp leached out with the increasing pet mps levels several studies have found that dbp posed a serious hazard to biota such as zebrafish larvae pu et al 2020 rat li et al 2009 collembolan jensen et al 2001 and microalga cunha et al 2019 the methane productions by ags exposed to dbp leached in fig s4 demonstrated that dbp leached from 75 to 300 mp l 1 of pet mps also suppressed the methane production the cumulative methane productions by ags exposed to pet mps and corresponding dbp leached were compared in fig 5 a the results showed that 15 mp l 1 of pet mps and corresponding dbp leached did not affect the methane production compared to the control in contrast the cumulative methane productions by ags exposed to pet mps at 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 was 91 7 86 8 and 81 1 of the control and methane productions by ags exposed to corresponding dbp leached was 93 7 88 9 and 84 3 of the control this indicated that the inhibitory effects of pet mps were relevant to the released dbp which would be one factor for the toxicity of pet mps like many other microscale nanoscale particles microplastics exposure has been reported to up regulate oxidative stress in organisms via ros e g h2o2 o2 and oh generation jeong et al 2016 the large surface area of microplastics supply a higher proportion of reactive groups displayed on their surface which can react with molecular dioxygen and produce ros through free radical and catalytic reactions donaldson et al 2003 even in the anaerobic environment submicromolar oxygen still remains in the medium which can interact with abundant active sites on microplastic surface and generate ros through dismutation and fenton reaction degli esposti and mclennan 1998 mu et al mu and chen 2011 had detected the ros production induced by zno nanoparticles in the anaerobic digester organisms protect themselves against the moderate oxidative stress though antioxidant system inherently ma et al 2016 but higher levels of oxidative stress can trigger pro inflammatory responses through the activation of redox sensitive signaling pathways resulting in cell deaths several studies jeong et al 2016 lei et al 2018 have demonstrated that the ros induced by microplastics caused acute toxicity towards different aquatic species to figure out the relevant toxic mechanisms of pet mps more deeply the ros amounts with and without pet mps exposure during wastewater treatment of ags were determined and compared in fig 5b compared with the control the exposure of pet mps at 15 mp l 1 had no impact on the ros production but the presence of mps l 1 at 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 enhanced ros production by 9 2 12 5 and 17 3 respectively lactate dehydrogenase ldh as a kind of endocellular enzyme can be released into the extracellular matrix while the cell membrane is severely damaged zheng et al 2017 thus it is generally used to indicate the integrity of cell membranes aligning with the ros production data ldh release presented an upward trend while the pet mps levels increased from 75 to 300 mp l 1 in comparison to the control while ldh release at the presence of 15 mp l 1 of pet mps was similar with that in the control also the results of the live dead cells count assay of ags visually supported this point as seen in fig 5c the fraction of the dead cells in the presence of 300 mp l 1 pet mps increased from 5 1 control to 16 3 hence ros induced by pet mps would be another contributor to causing toxic effects towards ags 4 conclusions in the continuously operated uasb system of this work the long term exposure of pet mps at 15 mp l 1 had no effects on the ags performance whereas the higher levels 75 300 mp l 1 of pet mps inhibited the cod removal and methane production accompanied with more scfa accumulation and granule breakage quantitative and visualized analysis of eps found that the low levels of pet mps 15 mp l 1 enhanced eps secretion but higher levels of pet mps 75 300 mp l 1 suppressed eps generation the long term exposure of pet mps at 300 mp l 1 decreased the populations of key acidogens and methanogens such as methanosaeta sp methanobacterium sp levilinea sp and longilinea sp correspondingly higher levels of pet mps suppressed both acidification and methanization steps toxic mechanism assessment illustrated that the leaching dbp and excess oxidative stress induced by pet mps were the major factors to the deteriorative performance of ags supporting by the release of ldh and the decline viability of cells declaration of competing interest

17885,the negative effects of ubiquitous microplastics on wastewater treatment have attracted increasing attention however the potential impacts of microplastics on anaerobic granular sludge ags remain unknown to fill this knowledge gap this paper investigated the response of ags to the exposure of model microplastics polyethylene terephthalate pet mps and provided insights into the mechanisms involved the 84 days long term exposure experiments demonstrated that pet mps at relatively low level 15 mp l 1 did not affect ags performance during anaerobic wastewater treatment while 75 300 mp l 1 of pet mps caused the decreases of cod removal efficiency and methane yields by 17 4 30 4 and 17 2 28 4 accompanied with the 119 4 227 8 increase in short chain fatty acid scfa accumulation and particle breakage extracellular polymeric substances eps analysis showed that dosage dependent tolerance of ags to pet mps was attributed to the induced eps producing protection role but pet mps

high levels of microplastic pollution to date microplastics e g polyethylene terephthalate pet polyethylene pe polyamide pa polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc are frequently detected in natural environment industrial and domestic wastewater and even sewage sludge cheung and fok 2017 eerkes medrano et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 yang et al 2019 recent toxicological studies have confirmed that microplastics cause adverse impacts on microorganisms wang et al 2020 for instance the exposure of polystyrene microplastics inhibited 50 growth rate of microalgae scenedesmus obliquus by blocking photosynthesis and destroying the cell walls liu et al 2020 which possibly be associated with the oxidative stress besides various chemical additives such as phthalates paes have been used in microplastics production to modify plasticity polymerization and durability however the additives can easily leach out from the microplastics due to the weak non covalent interactions via hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces interaction between additives and microplastics kiani et al 2018 luo et al 2018 salazar beltrán et al 2018 according to previous literatures kiani et al 2018 luo et al 2018 salazar beltrán et al 2018 dibutyl phthalate dbp di 2 ethyl hexyl phthalate dehp diethyl phthalate dep benzyl butyl phthalate bbp and dimethyl phthalate dmp are the main additives in polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics in the leaching experiment dibutyl phthalate dbp has the highest detection frequency luo et al 2018 phthalates have been found to be toxic to organisms by disrupting growth energy metabolism tissue differentiation and reproduction luo et al 2018 zaki and shoeib 2018 microplastics in large quantities are released into wastewater during their production utilization and disposal studies have shown that the municipal wastewater contained 15 70 5 23 mps l 1 of microplastics on average murphy et al 2016 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are generally considered as the final barriers for microplastics entering the natural environment carr et al 2016 li et al 2018 thus a large amount of microplastics inevitably accumulate in the wastewater treatment plants thereby causing the potential effects our previous studies found that the exposure of microplastics induced cytotoxicity for anaerobic flocculent sludge thereby inhibiting the performance of mesophilic anaerobic digester 37 1 c srt 15 d wei et al 2019a 2019b nevertheless the potential effects of microplastics on anaerobic granular sludge ags unit remain unknown as a more efficient anaerobic technology ags can improve the processing capacity of organic mattes and increase microbial concentration and solid liquid separation efficiency he et al 2017 the anaerobic reactors based on granular sludge e g the anaerobic up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor and anaerobic internal circulation ic reactor has been widely used for high strength organic wastewater treatment different from the flocculent sludge ags has a more complex hierarchical structure including acidogens syntrophic microcolonies and aceticlastic methanogens li et al 2017 excepting the layered distribution of abundant microbial community extracellular polymeric substances eps is also an indispensable backbone component of the ags which makes ags have stronger tolerance to external toxic environment than flocculent sludge ma et al 2013 therefore the objective of this study was to disclose the microbial responses of ags to the long term exposure of microplastics during anaerobic wastewater treatment polyethylene terephthalate microplastics pet mps as one of the most common of microplastics in wastewater lv et al 2019 yang et al 2019 were chosen as the model microplastics to be assessed in this work their concentration in the wastewater is 15 mp l 1 murphy et al 2016 but the large scale production and usage would lead to their increased release thus the effects of long term exposure of pet mps 15 300 mp l 1 on the activities and the properties of ags were specifically assessed the component and architecture variations of eps on ags after exposing to pet mps were quantified and visualized the variations of microbial community in ags when long term exposed to pet mps were also evaluated furthermore the toxic mechanisms of pet mps towards ags were explored from the aspects of oxidative stress and the toxic leachates 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and pet microplastics the ags used in this experiment derived from the laboratory scale up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating citric acid wastewater analysis of the particle size of ags by mastersizer 2000 malvern uk suggested that the average particle diameter of ags was 1 27 mm besides the ratio of volatile suspended solid vss to total suspended solid tss was 82 6 the average size of microplastics detected in wastewater was about 0 2 mm xu et al 2019 thus commercial pet mps with size of 0 2 mm were purchased from zhongcheng co ltd guangzhou china and used in this work 2 2 set up and operation of the bioreactors the responds of ags to the long term exposure of pet mps during wastewater treatment were investigated using five continuously operated uasb reactors one was used as control reactor with no pet mps exposure other four as experimental reactors were operated with a certain number of pet mps in this work 15 mp l 1 of pet mps was served as environmentally relevant concentration in municipal wastewater treatment systems according to murphy et al 2016 considering the increasing usage and annual output even the occurrence of sudden leakage event the higher levels pet mps of 75 mp l 1 150 mp l 1 and 300 mp l 1 were also chosen to assess in this work all reactors were operated continuously for 120 days which were divided into phase ⅰ baseline phase day 0 35 and phase ⅱ experiment phase day 36 120 in phase i the ags was inoculated into each reactor with tss of 2 g l each reactor was fed with simulated wastewater whose compositions were shown in si all reactors were operated at an organic loading rate olr of 2 0 kg cod m3 day and the carbon source was provided by glucose ph 6 9 0 1 with a concentration of 2000 mg l the hydraulic retention time hrt of each reactor was 24 h all reactors were cultivated thermostatically at 37 1 c during phase ⅰ no pet mps was added and the operational parameter was kept identically in each bioreactor in order to establish the similar and stable performance this phase was ended until each reactor reached stable and good enough performance for cod removal efficiency and methane yield within 10 disparity exposure experiments were conducted in phase ⅱ experiment phase day 36 120 by feeding simulated wastewater with various levels of pet mps in experimental reactors other operation conditions remained unchanged throughout the study the volume and composition of biogas h2 n2 ch4 co2 were measured every 24 h the cod in effluent from each reactor as well as the short chain fatty acid scfa i e acetic propionic and butyric acids concentrations were determined every 3 days triplicate samples were withdrawn from each reactor for microbial community analysis after the long term exposure test the granular size morphology and eps of ags from each reactor were also analyzed the particle size distribution of ags was measured by mastersizer 2000 malvern uk particle size detection range was set as 0 01 3500 μm the ags samples were placed into cuvette and the size data was measured with the shading coefficient of 12 15 more detailed information of the analysis of microbial community and morphology was described in the si 2 3 eps extraction and analysis eps was extracted with the modified oscillation ultrasound combined cationic resin extraction method liu et al 2010 after long term exposure test 0 05 nacl solution was used to wash the ags obtained from each bioreactor three times and the washed ags was suspended in 0 05 nacl solution to certain volume again the suspension liquid was treated via 2 min ultrasound followed by 10 min horizontal oscillation and another 2 min ultrasound the supernatant from the treated suspension was separated and collected by centrifugation at 9000g and 4 c for 15 min the residual ags was resuspended in 0 05 nacl solution to predetermined volume and mixed with 60 g g ss cation exchange resin cer then the mixtures were stirred continuously overnight at 4 c after that the mixtures were centrifugated for 30 min at 9000 g and 4 c to harvest the supernatant the two groups of supernatants were mixed to analyze the compositions the concentrations of proteins pn polysaccharides ps humic acids ha lipids and dna in eps were analyzed after the supernatants being filtrated through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membranes the proteins and humic acids were analyzed by a modified lowry method using bovine serum albumin and humic acids as the standards respectively frolund et al 1995 markwell et al 1978 the polysaccharides content was determined by the anthrone sulfuric acid colorimetry with glucose as standard laurentin and edwards 2003 the content of lipids was determined using the method in frings and dunn 1970 with commercial olive oil as standard diphenylamine colorimetry was used to determine dna using calf thymus as a standard solution gendimenico et al 1988 2 4 visual observation of eps distribution in ags a cutting edge technique combined multiple fluorescence labeling with confocal laser scanning microscope clsm was applied to observe the spatial distribution of eps components in ags chen et al 2007a 2007b detailed information about the excitation and emission wavelengths of dyes used to trace the associated targets was listed in table s1 samples obtained from each bioreactor were stored at 20 c immediately then the frozen samples were sectioned into 10 μm sections and fixed onto microslides for staining fitc 1 mg ml in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 50 μl concanavalin con a tetramethylrhodamine conjugate solution 0 25 mg ml in dmso 100 μl calcofluor white 30 mg ml in dmso 100 μl and nile red solution 0 01 mg ml in dmso 60 μl were successively added to sections at regular intervals it should be noted that after each staining the sections need to be washed with 1 pbs buffer to remove the redundant dye 2 5 experiments of impacts of pet microplastics on the steps of acidification and methanization the removal of cod i e glucose in this study in the wastewater by ags under anaerobic condition generally undergoes acidification and methanation steps the impacts of pet mps on the acidification and methanation were indicated by the degradation of glucose and the generation of methane via a series of batch tests in brief 100 ml of synthetic wastewater and pet mps at corresponding concentration were added into each serum bottles the ags was inoculated into each bottle with tss of 2 g l afterwards 10 5 g l of 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid besa was dosed in each serum bottle to inhibit the activity of methanogens all bottles were sealed and cultivated in a constant temperature incubator 170 rmp at 37 1 c after oxygen removal when the scfa concentrations stopped increasing after 2 days in this study indicating the acidification step was complete the degradation efficiencies of glucose were measured the operation of the impacts of pet mps on the methanization step was nearly same as the procedure described above except that the 2000 mg cod l glucose in synthetic wastewater was replaced by sodium acetate and no besa was added the cumulative methane production was monitored until it remained unchanged after 8 days in this study 2 6 determination of the released chemicals from pet microplastics as well as the impacts on methane production according to previous literatures kiani et al 2018 luo et al 2018 salazar beltrán et al 2018 and the manufacturers dbp dehp dep bbp and dmp are the main additives in pet mps in order to determine the corresponding concentration of those additives released from pet mps 100 ml of synthetic wastewater containing pet mps at four tested levels and ags with 2000 mg l of tss were added into each serum bottles then the mixtures were incubated at 37 1 c under anaerobic condition at different times 0 1 3 5 7 days the samples were withdrawn and centrifuged at 9000 g for 15 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filter membrane and the residual sludge was dried using a freeze dryer 20 c scientz 10 n china detailed information about the methods used to analyze the compositions of chemical additives in filtrate and sludge was recorded in the si the experiments of detected leachate from pet mps affecting methane production by ags were performed via the same procedure described in the impacts of pet mps on the acidification step above except that the pet mps was substituted by the corresponding concentrations of detected chemicals and no besa was added at different times 0 1 3 5 7 days the chemicals at corresponding leaching concentration were gradually added into the relevant bottles the methane production under the exposure of pet mps and leachates at corresponding concentrations were measured and compared 2 7 measurement of oxidative stress and cell viability the extent of oxidative stress induced by pet mps was evaluated by the production of reactive oxygen species ros at the end of exposure test it is well known that higher oxidative stress can cause cell death mu and chen 2011 thus the amount of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase ldh released was determined to indicate the integrity of cell membranes additionally the live dead microorganisms at the end of pet mps exposure test were counted using staining technique the detailed measurement methods for ros generation ldh release and live dead staining can be found in the si 2 8 other analytical methods the volume of biogas produced in the uasb reactor was recorded using gas flow meter the manometer was used to determine the biogas volume produced in batch bottle based on the differences of gas pressure in headspace a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd lunan 6890 was used to analyze the composition of biogas the methane yield was calculated based on the data of biogas volume and the methane percentage the concentration of scfa e g acetic propionic and butyric acids was measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with a fid detector agilent more detailed information of the measurement for biogas composition and scfa concentration was described in the si the procedures for determining cod tss and vss are detailed in the standard methods apha 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of ags during long term exposure to pet microplastics the cod removal efficiency and methane production in the ags reactors exposed to pet mps were monitored and the results were recorded in fig 1 on day 30 in phase ⅰ all reactors reached the stable state with the similar cod removal efficiency 89 3 and methane production 63 ml d throughout the phase ⅱ day 36 120 the average cod removal efficiency and the methane yield in the reactor feeding wastewater with 15 mp l 1 of pet mps were almost the same as the control reactor remaining at 89 8 and 61 ml d respectively however with the increase concentrations of pet mps 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 the cod removal efficiencies at the end of exposure time gradually decreased to 71 8 65 6 and 60 5 respectively aligning with the cod removal data the methane production also showed a descending trend gradually with the pet mps concentration raised in the reactor feeding wastewater with 300 mp l 1 of pet mps the methane production dropped to 45 ml d on day 120 representing a relative decrease of 28 4 compared to the control reactor 63 ml d besides scfa is an important intermediate product in the conversion process from cod to methane which is also link to the overall performance as shown in fig 1c the exposure of 15 mp l 1 of pet mps did not affect the scfa concentration in comparison to the control nevertheless in the reactors feeding wastewater with pet mps at 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 scfa concentrations increased from 182 8 mg cod l control to 401 1 mg cod l 505 1 mg cod l and 599 2 mg cod l at the end of operation indicating more scfa accumulation in short the influences of pet mps on ags performance were intensively related to the pet mps levels ags exhibited good tolerance for low concentration 15 mp l 1 of pet mps while high concentrations of pet mps 75 300 mp l 1 significantly inhibited ags activity with lower cod removal efficiency p 2 16e 07 2 02e 07 and 4 44e 08 and methane production p 0 004 0 008 and 0 006 as well as more scfa accumulation p 1 21e 05 1 83e 06 and 4 09e 06 observed 3 2 effect of pet microplastics on the morphology characteristics of ags fig 2a demonstrated the particle size distribution of the ags in each reactor at the end of exposure test results showed that particle size distributions of ags varied from 0 to 3080 μm compared to the ags in control reactor the particle size of the ags in experimental reactors exposed to 75 300 mp l 1 of pet mps presented a decrease trend which was reflected in the larger proportion of small particle size also the medium particle diameter dx 50 of ags in the reactor exposed to 15 mp l 1 of pet mps 1235 μm was similar with the control 1275 μm whereas the dx 50 of the ags exposed to higher pet mps concentrations 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 decreased to 1165 1080 and 984 μm respectively this indicated that higher pet mps concentrations would cause granule breakage the surface morphologies of ags from control reactor and experimental reactor exposed to 300 mp l 1 of pet mps were observed by scanning electron microscope as seen in fig 2 b the granule from control reactor was intact and compact while granule from experimental reactor exposed to 300 mp l 1 of pet mps had an impair surface with many cracks and the granule had a tendency to dissociation it was observed at higher magnification that the exposure of pet mps reduced the amounts of filamentous shaped microbes which might be regarded as methanosaeta like cells besides the cavities as transport channels for nutrient substances and biogas can be observed in the control but the porosities were clogged after long term exposure of pet mps this indicated that more and more small size microplastics and lysed tissue were accumulated on ags which would prevent the nutrient matrix transfer and biogas emission dai et al 2016 yu et al 2019 it was a reasonable explanation for a part of ags floatation in the experimental reactor observed 3 3 effect of pet microplastics on the eps of ags as an indispensable part of ags eps play the significant roles in maintaining the granules structure and defensing the external toxic substances mu et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 the dominant components in eps of ags from control reactor were the proteins followed by α d glucopyranose polysaccharides β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids which evenly wrapped around the granules the long term exposure of pet mps at 300 mp l 1 remarkably decreased the eps amounts fig 3 especially center proteins which would have adverse impact on granules structure further quantification analysis of eps was showed in fig 3 compared to the control there was no obvious change in the contents of proteins and dna in eps at the presence of 15 mp l 1 pet mps but the content of polysaccharides lipids and humic acids increased by 22 8 22 5 and 21 3 respectively this suggested that low level of pet mps enhanced eps secretion thereby protecting the microorganisms against toxicity this was a reasonable explanation for the unaffected ags performances observed in the reactor exposed to 15 mp l 1 pet mps but with pet mps levels increasing from 75 to 300 mp l 1 the amounts of proteins humic acids polysaccharides and lipids all decreased previous study in mu et al 2012 reported that the reduction of eps caused by zno nps could result in their impotent protections towards the inner anaerobes of ags with increased deaths of microorganisms in this work the contents of dna in eps also showed an upward trend indicating that higher levels of pet mps suppressed eps secretion causing cells death 3 4 effect of pet microplastics on the microbial community in order to analyze the variations of microbial community in the ags after long term exposure of pet mps high throughput sequencing was carried out in the control reactor and experimental reactor exposed to 300 mp l 1 of pet mps the ags from control and experimental reactors yielded 44263 and 42807 effective sequences representing 337 operational taxonomic units otus on average this pattern indicated that the long term exposure to pet mps reduced the total microbial populations additionally rarefaction curves of the samples from two reactors fig s1 demonstrated that the sequencing depths were enough to cover the whole microbial species and the sequencing data was reasonable the abundance and diversity of the microorganisms were evaluated using alpha diversity analysis from fig 4 a no significantly p 0 87 0 14 and 0 20 differences in the indexes of chao 383 21 vs 380 22 shannon 3 44 0 02 vs 3 41 0 02 and pd whole tree 36 2 vs 34 1 between two reactors were observed the results indicated that the microbial structure and diversity of ags did not be affected remarkably by the long term exposure of pet mps bacterial and archaeal phyla were both detected in the control reactor and experimental reactor fig 4b it is well known that methanogens belong to euryarchaeota expectedly the long term exposure of pet mps at 300 mp l 1 reduced the abundance of euryarchaeota from 30 9 to 25 4 besides euryarchaeota the microbial communities of two reactors were also predominated by actinobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes which have been reported to have the capacity of converting organic compounds to volatile fatty acids vfas wang et al 2018 aside from chloroflexi the abundances of actinobacteria and bacteroidetes in the reactor exposed to 300 mp l 1 of pet mps decreased from 20 3 to 10 2 17 5 and 8 3 respectively however the exposure of pet mps increased the relative abundance of synergistetes it should be noted that this increase might be attributed to the decreased total microbial populations detected and pet mps may not necessarily increase their absolute abundance i e the total populations of synergistetes taxonomic compositions of the microbial community at the genus level were showed in fig 4c which consisted of various anaerobes relevant to acidification and methanization it can be seen that methanosaeta sp and methanobacterium sp were shared in two reactors which were associated with the methanization the exposure of pet mps 300 mps l 1 distinctly decreased the abundances of these two genera by 26 2 and 19 9 compared to control methanosaeta sp as a kind of aceticlastic methanogen has been documented to be able to produce methane by utilizing acetate sundberg et al 2013 thus their obvious reduction might be the reason for more scfa accumulation in the experimental reactor observed besides the populations of most acidogens were also declining in the experimental reactor for example levilinea sp and longilinea sp are two kinds of carbohydrates utilizing genera with organic acids as the product yamada et al 2006 2007 their populations dropped by 64 5 and 63 2 respectively similarly syntrophobacter sp is known as an acetogen which was less abundant after long term exposure of pet mps to sum up the long term exposure of pet mps at 300 mps l 1 reduced the populations of key acidogens and methanogens which were closely related to the deteriorative performance in the experimental reactor exposed to pet mps 3 5 insights into the toxic mechanisms of the pet microplastics on the ags degradation of organic matter glucose as substrates by ags under anaerobic condition generally undergoes acidification and methanization steps he et al 2017 if these two processes are affected the treatment performance will be influenced inevitably thus the effects of pet mps on the acidification and methanization were investigated in order to disclose the function of pet mps the effects on acidification were assessed by inhibiting methanogens activity and the results were exhibited in fig s2a the low level of pet mps at 15 mp l 1 had no impact on glucose degradation while at the 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 of pet mps it decreased to 90 1 88 3 and 86 1 of the control respectively the profiles of methane production from acidification product also showed a similar trend fig s2b it revealed that higher levels of pet mps suppressed both acidification and methanization steps which was consistent with the decreased abundances of acidogens and methanogens observed in microbial communities but this raised a very interesting and important question how pet mps induced toxic effects it has been reported that the adverse effects of microplastics on different aquatic species e g amphibalanus amphitrite and perna perna were associated with their leachates gandara et al 2016 li et al 2016 phthalates were the common chemical additives used to modify the properties of pet mps some researches have verified that release of phthalates was related to temperature and higher storage temperature promoted the phthalates leaching luo et al 2018 thus the mesophilic 37 1 c anaerobic wastewater treatment was preferable for migrations of additives in our leaching tests the only chemical additive detected was dbp which was in accord with the reports of suhrhoff and scholz boettcher 2016 the leaching curves of dbp from four studied levels of pet mps were presented in fig s3 more dbp leached out with the increasing pet mps levels several studies have found that dbp posed a serious hazard to biota such as zebrafish larvae pu et al 2020 rat li et al 2009 collembolan jensen et al 2001 and microalga cunha et al 2019 the methane productions by ags exposed to dbp leached in fig s4 demonstrated that dbp leached from 75 to 300 mp l 1 of pet mps also suppressed the methane production the cumulative methane productions by ags exposed to pet mps and corresponding dbp leached were compared in fig 5 a the results showed that 15 mp l 1 of pet mps and corresponding dbp leached did not affect the methane production compared to the control in contrast the cumulative methane productions by ags exposed to pet mps at 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 was 91 7 86 8 and 81 1 of the control and methane productions by ags exposed to corresponding dbp leached was 93 7 88 9 and 84 3 of the control this indicated that the inhibitory effects of pet mps were relevant to the released dbp which would be one factor for the toxicity of pet mps like many other microscale nanoscale particles microplastics exposure has been reported to up regulate oxidative stress in organisms via ros e g h2o2 o2 and oh generation jeong et al 2016 the large surface area of microplastics supply a higher proportion of reactive groups displayed on their surface which can react with molecular dioxygen and produce ros through free radical and catalytic reactions donaldson et al 2003 even in the anaerobic environment submicromolar oxygen still remains in the medium which can interact with abundant active sites on microplastic surface and generate ros through dismutation and fenton reaction degli esposti and mclennan 1998 mu et al mu and chen 2011 had detected the ros production induced by zno nanoparticles in the anaerobic digester organisms protect themselves against the moderate oxidative stress though antioxidant system inherently ma et al 2016 but higher levels of oxidative stress can trigger pro inflammatory responses through the activation of redox sensitive signaling pathways resulting in cell deaths several studies jeong et al 2016 lei et al 2018 have demonstrated that the ros induced by microplastics caused acute toxicity towards different aquatic species to figure out the relevant toxic mechanisms of pet mps more deeply the ros amounts with and without pet mps exposure during wastewater treatment of ags were determined and compared in fig 5b compared with the control the exposure of pet mps at 15 mp l 1 had no impact on the ros production but the presence of mps l 1 at 75 150 and 300 mp l 1 enhanced ros production by 9 2 12 5 and 17 3 respectively lactate dehydrogenase ldh as a kind of endocellular enzyme can be released into the extracellular matrix while the cell membrane is severely damaged zheng et al 2017 thus it is generally used to indicate the integrity of cell membranes aligning with the ros production data ldh release presented an upward trend while the pet mps levels increased from 75 to 300 mp l 1 in comparison to the control while ldh release at the presence of 15 mp l 1 of pet mps was similar with that in the control also the results of the live dead cells count assay of ags visually supported this point as seen in fig 5c the fraction of the dead cells in the presence of 300 mp l 1 pet mps increased from 5 1 control to 16 3 hence ros induced by pet mps would be another contributor to causing toxic effects towards ags 4 conclusions in the continuously operated uasb system of this work the long term exposure of pet mps at 15 mp l 1 had no effects on the ags performance whereas the higher levels 75 300 mp l 1 of pet mps inhibited the cod removal and methane production accompanied with more scfa accumulation and granule breakage quantitative and visualized analysis of eps found that the low levels of pet mps 15 mp l 1 enhanced eps secretion but higher levels of pet mps 75 300 mp l 1 suppressed eps generation the long term exposure of pet mps at 300 mp l 1 decreased the populations of key acidogens and methanogens such as methanosaeta sp methanobacterium sp levilinea sp and longilinea sp correspondingly higher levels of pet mps suppressed both acidification and methanization steps toxic mechanism assessment illustrated that the leaching dbp and excess oxidative stress induced by pet mps were the major factors to the deteriorative performance of ags supporting by the release of ldh and the decline viability of cells declaration of competing interest

17886,reverse osmosis ro technology is promising in the sustainable production of fresh water however expansion of ro use has been hindered by membrane fouling mainly inorganic fouling known as scaling although membrane mineral scaling by chemical means have been investigated extensively mineral scaling triggered by microbial activity has been largely neglected in this study the simultaneous biomineralization of caco3 and caso4 in the presence of three different microbial communities from fresh water wastewater and seawater was investigated in the presence of either 13 or 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 in the media the fresh water microbial community produced calcite vaterite and vaterite gypsum respectively the wastewater community produced vaterite and vaterite gypsum respectively and the seawater community produced aragonite in both conditions the results showed that the concentration of salts and the microbial composition influence the types of precipitates produced the mechanisms of crystal formation of caco3 and gypsum by these communities were also investigated by determining the need for metabolic active cells the effect of a calcium channel blocker and the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps the results showed that metabolically active cells can lead to production of eps and formation of ca2 gradient along the cells through calcium channels which will trigger formation of biominerals the prevention of biomineralization by these consortia was also investigated with two common polymeric ro antiscalants i e polyacrylic acid paa and polymaleic acid pma results showed that these antiscalants do not prevent the formation of the bio precipitates suggesting that novel approaches to prevent biomineralization in ro systems still needs to be investigated graphical abstract image 1 keywords biomineralization reverse osmosis scaling caco3 caso4 antiscalants 1 introduction in a world struggling to access clean water reverse osmosis ro membranes can be used to convert different water sources like seawater brackish water and wastewater to fresh potable water duan et al 2014 thompson et al 2012 however membrane fouling especially when high concentrations of organic and inorganic compounds are present in the feed water slows down ro plant expansion and makes the process inefficient in terms of water recovery and energy consumption al amoudi 2010 duan et al 2014 since ro membranes have almost reached the thermodynamic limit the best approach to increase the water recovery and decrease maintenance and operation cost is by reducing membrane fouling duan et al 2014 fouling can happen by organic compounds colloids microorganisms biofouling and salts with low solubility scaling greenlee et al 2010 thompson et al 2012 when

for scalant production in ro systems zarga et al 2013 ion concentrations of ca2 and co3 2 or so4 2 and availability of nucleation sites are the two main factors governing caco3 and caso4 precipitation

treating the system by controlling ph which is not effective for caso4 scaling or adding antiscalants which is the most common approach bystrianský et al 2016 greenlee et al 2010 antiscalants are synthetic organic compounds consisting of polyphosphates phosphonates and polycarboxylates antony et al 2011 bystrianský et al 2016 greenlee et al 2010 a very small dosage of these compounds prevents or postpones crystal growth by different mechanisms like adsorbing to the surface cations of the critical nuclei greenlee et al 2010 prisciandaro et al 2012 most studies on scale formation by microorganisms have been done in simplified conditions like using a single species or investigating the precipitation of one salt moreover to the best of our knowledge no study has been done on the effect of antiscalants on biomineralization scaling in ro system is a complex phenomenon with various parameters in order to have a better understanding of scaling in a real condition more complex systems should be studied thus in this study simultaneous biomineralization of caco3 and caso4 by three environmental microbial communities from fresh water wastewater and seawater was investigated although different researchers have studied the biomineralization mechanisms by bacteria dhami et al 2014 ercole et al 2012 stocks fischer et al 1999 thompson and ferris 1990 wei et al 2015 it is still an open question of how bacteria cause mineralization to better understand this phenomenon and possibly suggest methods to prevent the biomineralization in ro systems the biomineralization mechanisms were investigated finally the effect of two common polycarboxylates antiscalants polyacrylic acid paa and polymaleic acid pma on biomineralization was investigated these two antiscalants were chosen because they have quite different structures fig s1 so they may prevent scaling through different mechanisms neither polyphosphate nor phosphonate antiscalants were used because they might form calcium phosphate precipitates in our system antony et al 2011 2 materials and methods materials and detailed procedure for sample collection characterization of biominerals and statistical analysis are given in the supporting information 2 1 consortia enrichment and characterization details for fresh water consortium enrichment has been provided in our previous work okyay and rodrigues 2015 initial enrichment of the wastewater consortium was done by inoculating 0 5 ml of the harvested wastewater community in 50 ml nb 10x medium supplemented with 13 mm of ca2 and so4 2 table s1 the same procedure was used for seawater consortia except that the medium used for enrichment contained seawater salts trace elements and vitamins table s1 to investigate the effect of ca2 and so4 2 concentrations on the three consortia each consortium was further enriched in its respective media with 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 instead of 13 mm these two concentrations were selected since calcium concentration in wastewater and seawater can be around 3 mm and 13 mm brito et al 2006 lei et al 2018 respectively while for sulfate the concentration can be around 6 mm for wastewater and 50 mm for seawater brito et al 2006 van den brand et al 2018 considering concentration polarization on the membrane surface as well as increasing in feed concentration in a multi stage ro plant the ions concentration can rise to around 79 mm sheikholeslami and lau 2012 the consortia grown in either 13 or 79 mm ca2 and so4 2 for each water sample were harvested and their dna were extracted for sequencing as previously described nguyen and rodrigues 2018 the sequencing data were deposited into the ncbi database under sra accession number prjna565073 2 2 biomineralization assay for all three consortia the biomineralization assay was done as follows in triplicates two media with different concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 13 mm and 79 mm were prepared the saturation index si for each media with respect to caco3 and caso4 was calculated by equation 1 using geochemist s workbench gwb 11 0 6 aqueous solution llc using thermo tdat database table s2 1 saturation index si log c a 2 s o 4 2 k sp where ca2 and so4 2 are the activities of the calcium and sulfate ions respectively and ksp is the solubility constant the three consortia were grown separately from their frozen stocks in the respective isolation media with 13 mm ions after each consortium reached late log phase they were transferred to fresh media three times to stabilize the consortium communities then the cells were harvested and washed with sterile nacl 0 85 three times the optical density od of the cells was adjusted to 1 5 at 600 nm after that 1 ml of the suspended cells were inoculated in different 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of the media with 13 mm or 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 the media without cells were prepared as negative controls to account for any potential abiotic precipitation for further characterization of the precipitates a piece of sterile glass slide was put in each flask to collect the minerals produced the flasks were incubated at 25 c and 150 rpm an aliquot of 1 ml of each flask was taken before starting the experiment t 0 and after 3 days t 3d and filtered with 0 2 μm polyethersulfone pes membrane sterile syringe filter vwr the filtered samples were immediately diluted 1 000 times in sterile filtered deionized water diw to measure the calcium concentration using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas perkinelmer aanalyst 200 after 3 days the ph of the media was measured mettler toledo le 438 and precipitates attached to the glass slides were washed with diw to remove the media and dried at 40 c overnight 2 3 biomineralization mechanisms three hypotheses were investigated according to the literature domínguez et al 2015 ercole et al 2012 the procedure to investigate the role of cell walls on nucleation is described in the supporting information 2 3 1 assay to investigate whether crystal formation occurs in the presence of unbound extracellular polymeric substances eps only effect of eps on crystal formation in the media with 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 for each consortium was investigated in triplicate same procedure to grow each consortium in media containing 79 mm ca2 and so4 2 in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks with 300 ml of media was used as described earlier this initial culture of the consortia was called main culture when the cells reached their early stationary phase in the main culture 12 h for fresh water 24 h for wastewater and 6 h for seawater consortia a 40 ml aliquot of the culture was taken incubation of the main culture continued under the same conditions with the remainder of the media for two more sampling at late stationary phase i e after 24 h and at the end of the experiment i e 3 days the aliquots at early and late stationary phases were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c the supernatants were filtered into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask with a low protein binding 0 05 μm pes sterile filter tisch scientific to remove the cells and keep only the soluble eps the filtered solutions containing only unbound eps with the salts were incubated at 150 rpm at 25 c to see if any precipitation happened due to the presence of eps without the cells media without cells were used as abiotic controls and aliquots were collected and processed like the main culture at early and late exponential phases after 3 days incubation of the main culture supernatants were taken for aas as well as the precipitates the precipitates of the main culture early stationary phase and late stationary were analyzed with xrd and sem fig s2 equation s1 presented in the supporting information was used to calculate precipitation amounts for each condition investigated 2 3 2 role of calcium channels in mineral formation derivatives of vanadate have been shown to block calcium channels in bacteria desrosiers et al 1996 to investigate the role of calcium channels in biomineralization sodium vanadate was added at 250 μm to the media with 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 cells were grown as described earlier an aliquot of 1 ml of the cell suspension with od equal to 1 5 was inoculated into 50 ml of media with and without sodium vanadate media with no inoculation were used as negative controls and inoculated media without sodium vanadate was used as positive controls a volume of 200 μl of samples and controls were transferred into a 96 well plate to monitor consortium growth by measuring od at 600 nm samples were incubated at 150 rpm at 25 c for 3 days the growth curves were obtained by plotting the average od versus time at the end of the experiment samples were prepared for analysis with aas and xrd as previously described precipitation amount was calculated using equation s1 all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 4 effect of antiscalants on biomineralization paa and pma were used to study whether they can inhibit biomineralization as well as chemical precipitation the typical dosage of antiscalants in ro plant feed is 2 10 mg l singh 2005 in this experiment since the concentration of ca2 and so4 2 79 mm was higher than the feed concentration of desalination plants higher dosages of antiscalants were used four different dosages of the polymers were added to the media with 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 5 and 10 mg l of paa and 10 and 20 mg l of pma a higher dosage of pma was tested since preliminary testing data not shown showed that the paa is more effective than pma in preventing scale formation each consortium was grown as described earlier an aliquot of the prepared consortium was inoculated to the media with and without four different dosages of the antiscalants media without cells were prepared as controls for all concentrations of antiscalants after 3 days of incubation at 25 c at 150 rpm samples were prepared for aas and xrd as mentioned before precipitation amount was calculated using equation s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 role of the consortia composition in biomineralization the comparison of the calcium concentration in the media at the beginning and end of the microbial growth in different samples showed that only samples inoculated with bacteria presented decreasing calcium concentrations and presence of mineral precipitates while there were no statistically significant changes in the samples without bacteria fig 1 these results show that metabolic active cells are necessary for biomineralization in addition to changes in calcium concentration the final ph of the samples increased while there were no statistically significant ph changes in the controls fig 1 the differences in ph in the samples and not in the controls can be explained by the presence of ureolytic bacteria in the samples since the media contained urea furthermore presence of urea in these types of water source is not uncommon due to animal excretion ureolytic bacteria degrade urea causing an increase in the ph by consuming h and producing hco3 and nh4 an increase in ph promotes deprotonation of hco3 to form co3 2 which can react with ca2 to promote caco3 formation in the form of calcite vaterite or aragonite burt et al 2018 okyay and rodrigues 2015 meanwhile caco3 precipitation produces more h thus decreasing the ph mccallum and guhathakurta 1970 zarga et al 2013 in samples with 79 mm of ca2 instead of 13 mm of ca2 it was expected that there would be more calcium ions available to react with the co3 2 produced by the ureolytic bacteria to form caco3 it should be noted that ph does not affect caso4 precipitation and vice versa like it does for the caco3 formation therefore these changes in ph made us hypothesized that caco3 precipitation could be occurring in all samples zarga et al 2013 to confirm this hypothesis the biominerals produced by the different consortia were characterized by xrd and sem eds fig 2 and fig s3 for the fresh water consortium at 13 mm of ca2 and so4 2 crystals were identified as polygonal plate like calcite and spherical vaterite while only rhombohedral calcite was formed by the wastewater consortium in the same medium and salt concentrations surprisingly at 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 both consortia formed the same types of crystals with the same morphologies identified as round shape vaterite as well as hexagonal shape gypsum the precipitates produced by seawater consortia at both salt conditions were needle like shaped crystals of aragonite greenlee et al 2010 these results confirmed our earlier hypothesis that all investigated consortia were able to produce caco3 however the investigated consortia produced different types of calcium carbonate and some of them could also produce gypsum depending on the different salt conditions the topic related to crystal formation by microorganisms is still controversial while some researchers believe environmental conditions determine the crystal structure and morphology others claim that bacteria may genetically control the shape of the biominerals gonzález muñoz et al 2010 if the latter is true consortia composition should be different for different precipitates formed to investigate the effect of microbial community diversity in the formation of crystals the genomic dna of the three consortia grown with 13 mm and 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 were sequenced the result of this investigation aimed to determine the effect of the change in salt composition of the media on the consortia composition as well as determine whether the consortia composition would affect the precipitates structures and morphologies according to fig 3 the genus composition was different for the different sites and the salt concentrations also affected the relative genus abundances in each consortium some of the genera found in fresh water and wastewater consortia were similar while the genera found in seawater were vastly different from the other two consortia stenotrophomonas was identified as the most abundant 50 genus in fresh water consortium in both 13 mm and 79 mm media followed by comamonas the relative abundance of both genera decreased with increasing concentration of ca2 and so4 2 while the relative abundance of unclassified bacteria and enterobacter increased stenotrophomonas and comamonas were present in the wastewater consortia too but they were not as dominant as in the fresh water elizabethkingia and chromobacterium had the highest abundance in wastewater consortia with elizabethkingia s abundance decreasing in the media containing 79 mm while the chromobacterium s abundance remained nearly the same myroides abundance increased from the 13 mm to the 79 mm media for wastewater consortia although the media used for fresh water and wastewater were the same at 13 mm different crystals with different morphologies were formed e g calcite and vaterite for fresh water and only calcite for wastewater however at 79 mm even though the consortia between the two water samples were different identical precipitates were formed in both consortia i e vaterite and gypsum in previous studies three different species of stenotrophomonas isolated from a limestone statue andrei et al 2017 a mine garcía g et al 2016 and a karstic cave rusznyák et al 2012 have been reported to be able to produce caco3 precipitates elizabethkingia and comamonas okyay et al 2016 were also identified in consortia able to form caco3 andrei et al 2017 identified the precipitates produced by stenotrophomonas as vaterite similarly in the samples of fresh water that had stenotrophomonas as the most abundant genus formation of vaterite was observed formation of calcite by wastewater consortium at 13 mm can be related to the presence of chromobacterium which had been identified as one of the genera present in two caves made of calcite c canveras et al 2001 seawater consortia were analyzed separately because the medium composition was different from the fresh water and wastewater consortia and there were no common genera between the two other consortia vibrio was the most abundant genus in the seawater consortia followed by photobacterium in 13 mm medium and unclassified marine genera in 79 mm the relative abundance of vibrio and photobacterium decreased from the consortium enriched with 13 mm of ca2 and so4 2 compared to the consortium enriched with 79 mm while for marinomonas tenacibaculum and some unclassified genera the changes were the opposite needle shaped aragonite formation in liquid media containing seawater salts by certain species of vibrio isolated from seawater has been previously reported mccallum and guhathakurta 1970 however moderately halophilic vibrio strains isolated from a saltern produced magnesium calcite on agar plates containing different ratio of mg2 to ca2 in this case no calcite or aragonite was observed rivadeneyra et al 1994 as observed in all samples at 13 mm of ca2 different forms of caco3 were formed among all the caco3 precipitates calcite is considered the most thermodynamically stable and most common bacterially formed caco3 other caco3 such as vaterite and aragonite have also been reported to be produced by bacteria it has been suggested that for the formation of vaterite or aragonite instead of calcite organic compounds e g eps or certain ions like mg2 should be present greenlee et al 2010 for instance organic molecules may have three dimensional structures forming microenvironments with suitable conditions such as ph and supersaturation or exposing specific binding sites to allow nucleation to start furthermore organic molecules may allow specific ion coordination which could lead to the formation of different crystals with different shapes ercole et al 2012 sondi and salopek sondi 2005 for instance kawaguchi and decho 2002 showed that specific proteins produced by cyanobacteria schizothrix sp could determine the morphology of the caco3 to be either aragonite or calcite considering the sequencing results it seems reasonable to expect different genera in each consortium will produce different organic molecules e g eps which would lead to production of different types of caco3 polymorphs as observed in this study at 13 mm the microbial composition clearly seems to play an important role in the morphology of the caco3 formed on the other hand at 79 mm despite differences in culture composition both fresh and wastewater consortia produced the same types of crystals probably because at this condition the water chemistry in particular the ca2 co3 2 ratio was the dominant factor determining the precipitate type caco3 caso4 and the morphology plate sphere rhombohedral and hexagonal dhami et al 2014 in the 79 mm media both caco3 and gypsum were formed not many studies have investigated the mechanisms of gypsum crystallization by bacteria but similar to caco3 the eps and cells can act as nucleation sites for gypsum crystallization thompson and ferris 1990 no gypsum was observed in 13 mm media most likely because no supersaturation not even in microenvironments happened due to the low concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 in the bulk while caco3 may not affect gypsum precipitation significantly gypsum crystals can affect the type of caco3 precipitation y zarga et al 2013 observed that in a simple precipitation of caco3 the crystals were identified as vaterite but in mixed precipitation experiments where gypsum was also formed caco3 precipitated as calcite this result does not match our results since we observed vaterite formation with the gypsum precipitation which further highlights the potential role of bacteria on crystal structure and morphology the unique composition of eps produced by the seawater consortia may have played a role in aragonite formation instead of calcite or vaterite as with the fresh water and wastewater consortia however the more probable explanation for aragonite formation is the presence of high concentrations of mg2 in the media which inhibit calcite growth and promote formation of aragonite fig s3 kawano and hwang 2011 rivadeneyra et al 1994 bacteria have shown to be able to cause precipitation of caco3 and caso4 in different conditions they have also been shown to be the main players in determining the structure of the precipitates at least at 13 mm for both fresh water and wastewater consortia the results also show that at higher salt concentrations such as 79 mm the water chemistry can also influence the shape of the minerals of precipitations to further explore how the bacteria cause precipitation and potentially mitigate scaling effects the mechanisms for biomineralization of these consortia were also investigated 3 2 biomineralization mechanisms by the consortia different researchers have studied the mechanisms by which bacteria can cause mineralization especially for caco3 but it is still an open question of how bacteria cause mineralization three hypotheses were investigated according to the literature as described below domínguez et al 2015 ercole et al 2012 3 2 1 crystal formation by eps extracellular polymeric substances are organic molecules produced by bacteria in terms of biomineralization eps has been described to either inhibit or promote precipitation dupraz and visscher 2005 eps can inhibit calcium precipitation by simply binding ca2 and decreasing the calcium ion activity on the other hand if the eps becomes saturated with respect to calcium ions inhibition stops and nucleation starts dupraz and visscher 2005 according to fig 4 in the presence of unbound eps precipitation occurred in the samples without cells with unbound eps only either at early or late stationary phases as well as in the samples containing both cells and eps for all three consortia for the fresh water consortium the precipitation amount was higher in samples containing active cells which shows the contribution of cells and bound eps for biomineralization as well these results are in agreement with dhami et al 2014 which observed more caco3 precipitation in samples with active bacteria compared to samples with crude urease enzymes on the other hand for the wastewater and seawater consortia there was no statistically significant difference between the eps samples with and without cells suggesting for these two consortia unbound eps not the cells and bound eps might play a major role in nucleation this hypothesis was further investigated in sections 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 moreover the cell concentration measured by od fig s4 was 0 33 0 01 0 41 0 06 and 0 77 0 02 for fresh water wastewater and seawater respectively as a result role of cells in precipitation for fresh water consortium cannot be correlated to cell concentration since this consortium had the lowest cell concentration among the three consortia characterization of the precipitates showed that same structure of crystals was formed in samples with eps cells as well as in unbound eps only obtained in early and late stationary phases for both fresh water and wastewater figs s5 and s6 these results further prove that soluble eps plays a role in determining the structure and morphology of the crystals which agrees with the literature kim et al 2016 on the other hand for the seawater consortium besides the aragonite produced in all conditions with cells eps calcite and vaterite were also produced in the presence of unbound eps only collected in late stationary phase fig 5 these results show although cells did not significantly affect the amount of precipitation their presence could change the crystals structure for the seawater consortium 3 2 2 cell walls as nucleation sites many researchers believe the bacterial cell wall with bound eps can act as a nucleation site by adsorbing metal cations on its negatively charged functional groups douglas and beveridge 1998 ercole et al 2012 thompson and ferris 1990 when a sufficient number of cations adsorb on the cell wall or bound eps supersaturation occurs douglas and beveridge 1998 supersaturation leads to nucleation on the cell wall after nucleation crystal growth will occur by adsorbing additional cations and anions thompson and ferris 1990 demonstrated different stages of gypsum calcite and magnesite crystal growth around a cyanobacterial cell named synechococcus sp by transmission electron microscopy tem other researchers have shown sem images of calcium carbonate crystals associated with bacterial cells to demonstrate how crystal growth can occur on bacterial surface dhami et al 2014 stocks fischer et al 1999 however bacteria acting as nucleation centers and the mechanism by which this can occur has not been conclusively proven kim et al 2016 in this study no precipitation was observed by inoculating dead cells of the three consortia to the media with 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 and 1 5 mm of co3 2 at ph 8 2 0 2 similar results had been observed by other studies mccallum and guhathakurta 1970 stocks fischer et al 1999 thompson and ferris 1990 as a result the authors believe adsorption cannot be responsible for nucleation otherwise precipitation would occur on the dead cells as well moreover measuring the ca2 concentration in the media with live and dead cell for the three consortia data not shown demonstrated that dead cells can adsorb calcium ions while the amount of calcium ions adsorbed on live cells was negligible probably because of protons flooding across the cell membrane due to the electron transport chains douglas and beveridge 1998 since crystal formation around the cells have been demonstrated by many studies the authors believe this phenomenon happens as a result of the accumulation of ca2 around the cell due to the fact that bacteria pump out calcium ions through calcium channels to keep the intracellular concentrations of ca2 at lower levels harouaka et al 2016 thompson and ferris 1990 to investigate this hypothesis we studied the effect of a calcium channel blocker on biomineralization by the three consortia 3 2 3 calcium channels role in biomineralization to keep the intracellular calcium concentration at a low level bacteria naturally pump calcium ions to the surrounding region of the cell through calcium channels calcium transport channels described in prokaryotes include atpases berkelman et al 1994 desrosiers et al 1996 domínguez et al 2015 electrochemical potential driven ca2 transporters ivey et al 1993 voltage dependent channels matsushita et al 1988 and mechanosensitive ca2 ion channels nazarenko et al 2003 over time the pumping of calcium outside the cells through some of these channels may cause supersaturation of ions in the vicinity of the cells which may lead to nucleation and crystallization harouaka et al 2016 weiner and dove 2003 if this mechanism plays a role in microbial biomineralization blocking the calcium channels should prevent biomineralization the function of some of these ca2 pumps has been reported to be inhibited by sodium vanadate desrosiers et al 1996 the effect of addition of 250 μm sodium vanadate to the 79 mm growth media on the extent of microbial growth precipitation amount and crystal structure of the precipitation was investigated for the three consortia according to fig 6 the amount of precipitation for fresh water consortium decreased in the medium with the inhibitor present compared to the medium without the inhibitor while the extent of microbial growth was the same in both conditions fig s7 for wastewater and seawater consortia no differences in precipitation amounts were observed suggesting that either the ca2 transport channels are not involved in biomineralization or that other types of channels not inhibited by sodium vanadate studied here could be involved in the precipitation for the fresh water consortium the crystals were characterized with xrd the results fig s8 identified the precipitates in both media as vaterite and gypsum indicating that the channel blocker did not change the type of crystal formed by the consortia these results suggest that p type atpase ca2 channels blocked by this inhibitor can play a role in accumulation of calcium ions in the extracellular environment since disturbing one type of calcium transport system decreased the amount of precipitation however it should be noted that the precipitation was not completely inhibited for the fresh water consortium moreover wastewater and seawater consortia produced the same amount of precipitates in the presence of the calcium channel blocker these results can potentially be correlated with the findings on the effect of eps on biomineralization as discussed earlier for fresh water consortium cells or eps bound to the cells seemed to be playing a significant role in biomineralization probably by providing nucleation sites while for wastewater and seawater consortia the presence of cells or eps bound to the cells were not essential for precipitation hence disturbing calcium channels affect the precipitation for fresh water consortium but not the wastewater and seawater consortia which were mainly affected by the unbound eps this finding clearly suggests that there might be different mechanisms used by the microorganisms to produce precipitates future studies investigating different types of calcium channel blockers is suggested to further validate this observation moreover since the role of ca2 in prokaryotes have not been studied as much as in eukaryotes domínguez et al 2015 there might be some other mechanisms for prokaryotic organisms to pump calcium ions outside the cells which has not been discovered yet 3 3 antiscalants effect on biomineralization two common antiscaling polymers paa and pma used in desalination plants to prevent scaling were used to investigate biomineralization inhibition or elongate the induction time induction time is the time distance between supersaturation and first signs of precipitation during which nuclei form olsson 1995 in the literature three different mechanisms have been reported for how antiscalants work i antiscalants inhibit or slow down crystal formation by blocking the nucleation sites on small nuclei ii antiscalants decrease the activity of lattice cations like calcium and make the cations unavailable for crystal growth through coordination or chelation iii antiscalants disperse the particles greenlee et al 2010 a study on the antiscaling mechanism of paa showed that the first mechanism is applicable for this polymer le gouellec and elimelech 2002 while to our knowledge no study has been done to elucidate the mode of action of pma as antiscaling according to table s3 at all conditions i e two dosages of two antiscalants precipitation happened for all consortia either after 3 or 5 days in all the samples precipitation happened in 3 days except for all conditions for seawater and for fresh water at two conditions 10 mg l paa and 20 mg l pma where precipitation happened only after 5 days furthermore the structure of the crystal formed in the presence of the antiscalant changed with exception for wastewater gypsum formation was inhibited in the fresh water and calcite was produced instead of aragonite for the seawater consortia these results showed that these antiscalants cannot completely inhibit biomineralization in the current tested conditions although they were able to elongate the precipitation time for fresh water and seawater consortia moreover antiscalants can potentially affect the structure of the biominerals two explanations can be proposed to justify the elongation of precipitation time first since either eps production or ca2 accumulation on the cell continuously promote nuclei formation at some point insufficient antiscalant molecules will be present to prevent crystal growth second antiscalant degradation by the consortia could be taking place ashfaq et al 2019 sweity et al 2013 antiscalant degradation by bacteria seems more likely after 5 days compared to the beginning of the incubation because bacteria will first use the carbon sources that are easier for them to metabolize following by degradation of polymers as a new carbon source this hypothesis offers an opportunity for future experiments to investigate whether bacteria in these consortia use the paa or pma antiscalants as their carbon sources these results can potentially be correlated to the mechanisms of the biomineralization where the role of cells as nucleation site is significant for fresh water consortium but not for wastewater and seawater consortia hence it is possible that charge neutralization occurs on the fresh water bacteria cells due to accumulation of positively charged calcium ions then the anionic antiscalants can prevent the crystal growth on cells by adsorbing on them châtellier et al 2001 to determine the exact mechanism additional experiments will need to be conducted however the effect of the different consortia is clear while in the presence of the fresh water consortium antiscalants were able to greatly diminish the formation of crystals in the presence of the wastewater consortium the antiscalants were not able to reduce crystal formation to the same degree similar to the eps experiment the results for the seawater consortium were surprising instead of aragonite which was formed in the media without the polymers calcite was formed in the media with the antiscalant polymers since the formation of aragonite in the seawater medium is mainly due to the presence of mg2 it is likely that the polymers adsorb the magnesium ions preventing them from participating in the crystal growth without mg2 which stabilizes aragonite the more stable crystal structure of caco3 calcite forms instead antiscalants which have shown to be effective to prevent chemical scaling can only prevent gypsum formation by fresh water consortium but they cannot prevent biomineralization of caco3 and caso4 in other conditions while for fresh water and seawater consortia they changed the crystals structure however more experiments with different ratio of calcium and different antiscalants would be valuable in future studies 4 conclusion biological mineralization of caco3 and caso4 in conditions similar to ro systems from three different sources i e fresh water wastewater and seawater were investigated in two different concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 13 and 79 mm metabolically active microorganisms were able to produce calcite vaterite aragonite and gypsum the production of different types of crystals with different morphologies were correlated to the diversity of microorganisms as well as to water chemistry the mechanism of biomineralization was determined to involve accumulation of ca2 ions around the cells through calcium channels not adsorption as well as production of eps produced by the consortia addition of two polycarboxylate antiscalants paa and pma at different dosages to the media showed that although these polymers are great for preventing chemical mineralization they cannot inhibit biomineralization these results highlight the important role of

17886,reverse osmosis ro technology is promising in the sustainable production of fresh water however expansion of ro use has been hindered by membrane fouling mainly inorganic fouling known as scaling although membrane mineral scaling by chemical means have been investigated extensively mineral scaling triggered by microbial activity has been largely neglected in this study the simultaneous biomineralization of caco3 and caso4 in the presence of three different microbial communities from fresh water wastewater and seawater was investigated in the presence of either 13 or 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 in the media the fresh water microbial community produced calcite vaterite and vaterite gypsum respectively the wastewater community produced vaterite and vaterite gypsum respectively and the seawater community produced aragonite in both conditions the results showed that the concentration of salts and the microbial composition influence the types of precipitates produced the mechanisms of crystal formation of caco3 and gypsum by these communities were also investigated by determining the need for metabolic active cells the effect of a calcium channel blocker and the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps the results showed that metabolically active cells can lead to production of eps and formation of ca2 gradient along the cells through calcium channels which will trigger formation of biominerals the prevention of biomineralization by these consortia was also investigated with two common polymeric ro antiscalants i e polyacrylic acid paa and polymaleic acid pma results showed that these antiscalants do not prevent the formation of the bio precipitates suggesting that novel approaches to prevent biomineralization in ro systems still needs to be investigated graphical abstract image 1 keywords biomineralization reverse osmosis scaling caco3 caso4 antiscalants 1 introduction in a world struggling to access clean water reverse osmosis ro

al amoudi 2010 duan et al 2014 since ro membranes have almost reached the thermodynamic limit the best approach to increase the water recovery and decrease maintenance and operation cost is by reducing membrane fouling duan et al 2014 fouling can happen by organic compounds colloids microorganisms biofouling and salts with low solubility scaling greenlee et al 2010 thompson et al 2012 when dealing with scaling calcium carbonate caco3 and calcium sulfate caso4 are of main concern for ro systems greenlee et al 2010 weiner and dove 2003 nucleation and crystal growth are the two main steps for scalant production in ro systems zarga et al 2013 ion concentrations of ca2 and co3 2 or so4 2 and availability of nucleation sites are the two main factors governing caco3 and caso4 precipitation burt et al 2018 wei et al 2015 the favorable condition for crystal formation could be provided not only by abiotic parameters but also by biotic parameters the biomineralization of caco3 has been reported to occur in different environments such as seawater fresh water wastewater and soil by a large variety of bacteria such as cyanobacteria sulfate reducing bacteria nitrate reducing bacteria methanogens heterotrophs and urea degrading bacteria kawano and hwang 2011 okyay and rodrigues 2015 onal okyay and frigi rodrigues 2014 wei et al 2015 showed that three urea hydrolyzing species isolated from marine sediment can produce calcite in cubic and rhombic shapes on the other hand gypsum caso4 2h2o formation by microorganisms is understudied and has only been reported to be produced by cyanobacteria thompson and ferris 1990 scaling has been dealt with three main approaches i changing the system design and operational parameters ii changing the feed water and iii chemically treating the system by controlling ph which is not effective for caso4 scaling or adding antiscalants which is the most common approach bystrianský et al 2016 greenlee et al 2010 antiscalants are synthetic organic compounds consisting of polyphosphates phosphonates and polycarboxylates antony et al 2011 bystrianský et al 2016 greenlee et al 2010 a very small dosage of these compounds prevents or postpones crystal growth by different mechanisms like adsorbing to the surface cations of the critical nuclei greenlee et al 2010 prisciandaro et al 2012 most studies on scale formation by microorganisms have been done in simplified conditions like using a single species or investigating the precipitation of one salt moreover to the best of our knowledge no study has been done on the effect of antiscalants on biomineralization scaling in ro system is a complex phenomenon with various parameters in order to have a better understanding of scaling in a real condition more complex systems should be studied thus in this study simultaneous biomineralization of caco3 and caso4 by three environmental microbial communities from fresh water wastewater and seawater was investigated although different researchers have studied the biomineralization mechanisms by bacteria dhami et al 2014 ercole et al 2012 stocks fischer et al 1999 thompson and ferris 1990 wei et al 2015 it is still an open question of how bacteria cause mineralization to better understand this phenomenon and possibly suggest methods to prevent the biomineralization in ro systems the biomineralization mechanisms were investigated finally the effect of two common polycarboxylates antiscalants polyacrylic acid paa and polymaleic acid pma on biomineralization was investigated these two antiscalants were chosen because they have quite different structures fig s1 so they may prevent scaling through different mechanisms neither polyphosphate nor phosphonate antiscalants were used because they might form calcium phosphate precipitates in our system antony et al 2011 2 materials and methods materials and detailed procedure for sample collection characterization of biominerals and statistical analysis are given in the supporting information 2 1 consortia enrichment and characterization details for fresh water consortium enrichment has been provided in our previous work okyay and rodrigues 2015 initial enrichment of the wastewater consortium was done by inoculating 0 5 ml of the harvested wastewater community in 50 ml nb 10x medium supplemented with 13 mm of ca2 and so4 2 table s1 the same procedure was used for seawater consortia except that the medium used for enrichment contained seawater salts trace elements and vitamins table s1 to investigate the effect of ca2 and so4 2 concentrations on the three consortia each consortium was further enriched in its respective media with 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 instead of 13 mm these two concentrations were selected since calcium concentration in wastewater and seawater can be around 3 mm and 13 mm brito et al 2006 lei et al 2018 respectively while for sulfate the concentration can be around 6 mm for wastewater and 50 mm for seawater brito et al 2006 van den brand et al 2018 considering concentration polarization on the membrane surface as well as increasing in feed concentration in a multi stage ro plant the ions concentration can rise to around 79 mm sheikholeslami and lau 2012 the consortia grown in either 13 or 79 mm ca2 and so4 2 for each water sample were harvested and their dna were extracted for sequencing as previously described nguyen and rodrigues 2018 the sequencing data were deposited into the ncbi database under sra accession number prjna565073 2 2 biomineralization assay for all three consortia the biomineralization assay was done as follows in triplicates two media with different concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 13 mm and 79 mm were prepared the saturation index si for each media with respect to caco3 and caso4 was calculated by equation 1 using geochemist s workbench gwb 11 0 6 aqueous solution llc using thermo tdat database table s2 1 saturation index si log c a 2 s o 4 2 k sp where ca2 and so4 2 are the activities of the calcium and sulfate ions respectively and ksp is the solubility constant the three consortia were grown separately from their frozen stocks in the respective isolation media with 13 mm ions after each consortium reached late log phase they were transferred to fresh media three times to stabilize the consortium communities then the cells were harvested and washed with sterile nacl 0 85 three times the optical density od of the cells was adjusted to 1 5 at 600 nm after that 1 ml of the suspended cells were inoculated in different 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of the media with 13 mm or 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 the media without cells were prepared as negative controls to account for any potential abiotic precipitation for further characterization of the precipitates a piece of sterile glass slide was put in each flask to collect the minerals produced the flasks were incubated at 25 c and 150 rpm an aliquot of 1 ml of each flask was taken before starting the experiment t 0 and after 3 days t 3d and filtered with 0 2 μm polyethersulfone pes membrane sterile syringe filter vwr the filtered samples were immediately diluted 1 000 times in sterile filtered deionized water diw to measure the calcium concentration using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas perkinelmer aanalyst 200 after 3 days the ph of the media was measured mettler toledo le 438 and precipitates attached to the glass slides were washed with diw to remove the media and dried at 40 c overnight 2 3 biomineralization mechanisms three hypotheses were investigated according to the literature domínguez et al 2015 ercole et al 2012 the procedure to investigate the role of cell walls on nucleation is described in the supporting information 2 3 1 assay to investigate whether crystal formation occurs in the presence of unbound extracellular polymeric substances eps only effect of eps on crystal formation in the media with 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 for each consortium was investigated in triplicate same procedure to grow each consortium in media containing 79 mm ca2 and so4 2 in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks with 300 ml of media was used as described earlier this initial culture of the consortia was called main culture when the cells reached their early stationary phase in the main culture 12 h for fresh water 24 h for wastewater and 6 h for seawater consortia a 40 ml aliquot of the culture was taken incubation of the main culture continued under the same conditions with the remainder of the media for two more sampling at late stationary phase i e after 24 h and at the end of the experiment i e 3 days the aliquots at early and late stationary phases were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c the supernatants were filtered into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask with a low protein binding 0 05 μm pes sterile filter tisch scientific to remove the cells and keep only the soluble eps the filtered solutions containing only unbound eps with the salts were incubated at 150 rpm at 25 c to see if any precipitation happened due to the presence of eps without the cells media without cells were used as abiotic controls and aliquots were collected and processed like the main culture at early and late exponential phases after 3 days incubation of the main culture supernatants were taken for aas as well as the precipitates the precipitates of the main culture early stationary phase and late stationary were analyzed with xrd and sem fig s2 equation s1 presented in the supporting information was used to calculate precipitation amounts for each condition investigated 2 3 2 role of calcium channels in mineral formation derivatives of vanadate have been shown to block calcium channels in bacteria desrosiers et al 1996 to investigate the role of calcium channels in biomineralization sodium vanadate was added at 250 μm to the media with 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 cells were grown as described earlier an aliquot of 1 ml of the cell suspension with od equal to 1 5 was inoculated into 50 ml of media with and without sodium vanadate media with no inoculation were used as negative controls and inoculated media without sodium vanadate was used as positive controls a volume of 200 μl of samples and controls were transferred into a 96 well plate to monitor consortium growth by measuring od at 600 nm samples were incubated at 150 rpm at 25 c for 3 days the growth curves were obtained by plotting the average od versus time at the end of the experiment samples were prepared for analysis with aas and xrd as previously described precipitation amount was calculated using equation s1 all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 4 effect of antiscalants on biomineralization paa and pma were used to study whether they can inhibit biomineralization as well as chemical precipitation the typical dosage of antiscalants in ro plant feed is 2 10 mg l singh 2005 in this experiment since the concentration of ca2 and so4 2 79 mm was higher than the feed concentration of desalination plants higher dosages of antiscalants were used four different dosages of the polymers were added to the media with 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 5 and 10 mg l of paa and 10 and 20 mg l of pma a higher dosage of pma was tested since preliminary testing data not shown showed that the paa is more effective than pma in preventing scale formation each consortium was grown as described earlier an aliquot of the prepared consortium was inoculated to the media with and without four different dosages of the antiscalants media without cells were prepared as controls for all concentrations of antiscalants after 3 days of incubation at 25 c at 150 rpm samples were prepared for aas and xrd as mentioned before precipitation amount was calculated using equation s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 role of the consortia composition in biomineralization the comparison of the calcium concentration in the media at the beginning and end of the microbial growth in different samples showed that only samples inoculated with bacteria presented decreasing calcium concentrations and presence of mineral precipitates while there were no statistically significant changes in the samples without bacteria fig 1 these results show that metabolic active cells are necessary for biomineralization in addition to changes in calcium concentration the final ph of the samples increased while there were no statistically significant ph changes in the controls fig 1 the differences in ph in the samples and not in the controls can be explained by the presence of ureolytic bacteria in the samples since the media contained urea furthermore presence of urea in these types of water source is not uncommon due to animal excretion ureolytic bacteria degrade urea causing an increase in the ph by consuming h and producing hco3 and nh4 an increase in ph promotes deprotonation of hco3 to form co3 2 which can react with ca2 to promote caco3 formation in the form of calcite vaterite or aragonite burt et al 2018 okyay and rodrigues 2015 meanwhile caco3 precipitation produces more h thus decreasing the ph mccallum and guhathakurta 1970 zarga et al 2013 in samples with 79 mm of ca2 instead of 13 mm of ca2 it was expected that there would be more calcium ions available to react with the co3 2 produced by the ureolytic bacteria to form caco3 it should be noted that ph does not affect caso4 precipitation and vice versa like it does for the caco3 formation therefore these changes in ph made us hypothesized that caco3 precipitation could be occurring in all samples zarga et al 2013 to confirm this hypothesis the biominerals produced by the different consortia were characterized by xrd and sem eds fig 2 and fig s3 for the fresh water consortium at 13 mm of ca2 and so4 2 crystals were identified as polygonal plate like calcite and spherical vaterite while only rhombohedral calcite was formed by the wastewater consortium in the same medium and salt concentrations surprisingly at 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 both consortia formed the same types of crystals with the same morphologies identified as round shape vaterite as well as hexagonal shape gypsum the precipitates produced by seawater consortia at both salt conditions were needle like shaped crystals of aragonite greenlee et al 2010 these results confirmed our earlier hypothesis that all investigated consortia were able to produce caco3 however the investigated consortia produced different types of calcium carbonate and some of them could also produce gypsum depending on the different salt conditions the topic related to crystal formation by microorganisms is still controversial while some researchers believe environmental conditions determine the crystal structure and morphology others claim that bacteria may genetically control the shape of the biominerals gonzález muñoz et al 2010 if the latter is true consortia composition should be different for different precipitates formed to investigate the effect of microbial community diversity in the formation of crystals the genomic dna of the three consortia grown with 13 mm and 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 were sequenced the result of this investigation aimed to determine the effect of the change in salt composition of the media on the consortia composition as well as determine whether the consortia composition would affect the precipitates structures and morphologies according to fig 3 the genus composition was different for the different sites and the salt concentrations also affected the relative genus abundances in each consortium some of the genera found in fresh water and wastewater consortia were similar while the genera found in seawater were vastly different from the other two consortia stenotrophomonas was identified as the most abundant 50 genus in fresh water consortium in both 13 mm and 79 mm media followed by comamonas the relative abundance of both genera decreased with increasing concentration of ca2 and so4 2 while the relative abundance of unclassified bacteria and enterobacter increased stenotrophomonas and comamonas were present in the wastewater consortia too but they were not as dominant as in the fresh water elizabethkingia and chromobacterium had the highest abundance in wastewater consortia with elizabethkingia s abundance decreasing in the media containing 79 mm while the chromobacterium s abundance remained nearly the same myroides abundance increased from the 13 mm to the 79 mm media for wastewater consortia although the media used for fresh water and wastewater were the same at 13 mm different crystals with different morphologies were formed e g calcite and vaterite for fresh water and only calcite for wastewater however at 79 mm even though the consortia between the two water samples were different identical precipitates were formed in both consortia i e vaterite and gypsum in previous studies three different species of stenotrophomonas isolated from a limestone statue andrei et al 2017 a mine garcía g et al 2016 and a karstic cave rusznyák et al 2012 have been reported to be able to produce caco3 precipitates elizabethkingia and comamonas okyay et al 2016 were also identified in consortia able to form caco3 andrei et al 2017 identified the precipitates produced by stenotrophomonas as vaterite similarly in the samples of fresh water that had stenotrophomonas as the most abundant genus formation of vaterite was observed formation of calcite by wastewater consortium at 13 mm can be related to the presence of chromobacterium which had been identified as one of the genera present in two caves made of calcite c canveras et al 2001 seawater consortia were analyzed separately because the medium composition was different from the fresh water and wastewater consortia and there were no common genera between the two other consortia vibrio was the most abundant genus in the seawater consortia followed by photobacterium in 13 mm medium and unclassified marine genera in 79 mm the relative abundance of vibrio and photobacterium decreased from the consortium enriched with 13 mm of ca2 and so4 2 compared to the consortium enriched with 79 mm while for marinomonas tenacibaculum and some unclassified genera the changes were the opposite needle shaped aragonite formation in liquid media containing seawater salts by certain species of vibrio isolated from seawater has been previously reported mccallum and guhathakurta 1970 however moderately halophilic vibrio strains isolated from a saltern produced magnesium calcite on agar plates containing different ratio of mg2 to ca2 in this case no calcite or aragonite was observed rivadeneyra et al 1994 as observed in all samples at 13 mm of ca2 different forms of caco3 were formed among all the caco3 precipitates calcite is considered the most thermodynamically stable and most common bacterially formed caco3 other caco3 such as vaterite and aragonite have also been reported to be produced by bacteria it has been suggested that for the formation of vaterite or aragonite instead of calcite organic compounds e g eps or certain ions like mg2 should be present greenlee et al 2010 for instance organic molecules may have three dimensional structures forming microenvironments with suitable conditions such as ph and supersaturation or exposing specific binding sites to allow nucleation to start furthermore organic molecules may allow specific ion coordination which could lead to the formation of different crystals with different shapes ercole et al 2012 sondi and salopek sondi 2005 for instance kawaguchi and decho 2002 showed that specific proteins produced by cyanobacteria schizothrix sp could determine the morphology of the caco3 to be either aragonite or calcite considering the sequencing results it seems reasonable to expect different genera in each consortium will produce different organic molecules e g eps which would lead to production of different types of caco3 polymorphs as observed in this study at 13 mm the microbial composition clearly seems to play an important role in the morphology of the caco3 formed on the other hand at 79 mm despite differences in culture composition both fresh and wastewater consortia produced the same types of crystals probably because at this condition the water chemistry in particular the ca2 co3 2 ratio was the dominant factor determining the precipitate type caco3 caso4 and the morphology plate sphere rhombohedral and hexagonal dhami et al 2014 in the 79 mm media both caco3 and gypsum were formed not many studies have investigated the mechanisms of gypsum crystallization by bacteria but similar to caco3 the eps and cells can act as nucleation sites for gypsum crystallization thompson and ferris 1990 no gypsum was observed in 13 mm media most likely because no supersaturation not even in microenvironments happened due to the low concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 in the bulk while caco3 may not affect gypsum precipitation significantly gypsum crystals can affect the type of caco3 precipitation y zarga et al 2013 observed that in a simple precipitation of caco3 the crystals were identified as vaterite but in mixed precipitation experiments where gypsum was also formed caco3 precipitated as calcite this result does not match our results since we observed vaterite formation with the gypsum precipitation which further highlights the potential role of bacteria on crystal structure and morphology the unique composition of eps produced by the seawater consortia may have played a role in aragonite formation instead of calcite or vaterite as with the fresh water and wastewater consortia however the more probable explanation for aragonite formation is the presence of high concentrations of mg2 in the media which inhibit calcite growth and promote formation of aragonite fig s3 kawano and hwang 2011 rivadeneyra et al 1994 bacteria have shown to be able to cause precipitation of caco3 and caso4 in different conditions they have also been shown to be the main players in determining the structure of the precipitates at least at 13 mm for both fresh water and wastewater consortia the results also show that at higher salt concentrations such as 79 mm the water chemistry can also influence the shape of the minerals of precipitations to further explore how the bacteria cause precipitation and potentially mitigate scaling effects the mechanisms for biomineralization of these consortia were also investigated 3 2 biomineralization mechanisms by the consortia different researchers have studied the mechanisms by which bacteria can cause mineralization especially for caco3 but it is still an open question of how bacteria cause mineralization three hypotheses were investigated according to the literature as described below domínguez et al 2015 ercole et al 2012 3 2 1 crystal formation by eps extracellular polymeric substances are organic molecules produced by bacteria in terms of biomineralization eps has been described to either inhibit or promote precipitation dupraz and visscher 2005 eps can inhibit calcium precipitation by simply binding ca2 and decreasing the calcium ion activity on the other hand if the eps becomes saturated with respect to calcium ions inhibition stops and nucleation starts dupraz and visscher 2005 according to fig 4 in the presence of unbound eps precipitation occurred in the samples without cells with unbound eps only either at early or late stationary phases as well as in the samples containing both cells and eps for all three consortia for the fresh water consortium the precipitation amount was higher in samples containing active cells which shows the contribution of cells and bound eps for biomineralization as well these results are in agreement with dhami et al 2014 which observed more caco3 precipitation in samples with active bacteria compared to samples with crude urease enzymes on the other hand for the wastewater and seawater consortia there was no statistically significant difference between the eps samples with and without cells suggesting for these two consortia unbound eps not the cells and bound eps might play a major role in nucleation this hypothesis was further investigated in sections 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 moreover the cell concentration measured by od fig s4 was 0 33 0 01 0 41 0 06 and 0 77 0 02 for fresh water wastewater and seawater respectively as a result role of cells in precipitation for fresh water consortium cannot be correlated to cell concentration since this consortium had the lowest cell concentration among the three consortia characterization of the precipitates showed that same structure of crystals was formed in samples with eps cells as well as in unbound eps only obtained in early and late stationary phases for both fresh water and wastewater figs s5 and s6 these results further prove that soluble eps plays a role in determining the structure and morphology of the crystals which agrees with the literature kim et al 2016 on the other hand for the seawater consortium besides the aragonite produced in all conditions with cells eps calcite and vaterite were also produced in the presence of unbound eps only collected in late stationary phase fig 5 these results show although cells did not significantly affect the amount of precipitation their presence could change the crystals structure for the seawater consortium 3 2 2 cell walls as nucleation sites many researchers believe the bacterial cell wall with bound eps can act as a nucleation site by adsorbing metal cations on its negatively charged functional groups douglas and beveridge 1998 ercole et al 2012 thompson and ferris 1990 when a sufficient number of cations adsorb on the cell wall or bound eps supersaturation occurs douglas and beveridge 1998 supersaturation leads to nucleation on the cell wall after nucleation crystal growth will occur by adsorbing additional cations and anions thompson and ferris 1990 demonstrated different stages of gypsum calcite and magnesite crystal growth around a cyanobacterial cell named synechococcus sp by transmission electron microscopy tem other researchers have shown sem images of calcium carbonate crystals associated with bacterial cells to demonstrate how crystal growth can occur on bacterial surface dhami et al 2014 stocks fischer et al 1999 however bacteria acting as nucleation centers and the mechanism by which this can occur has not been conclusively proven kim et al 2016 in this study no precipitation was observed by inoculating dead cells of the three consortia to the media with 79 mm of ca2 and so4 2 and 1 5 mm of co3 2 at ph 8 2 0 2 similar results had been observed by other studies mccallum and guhathakurta 1970 stocks fischer et al 1999 thompson and ferris 1990 as a result the authors believe adsorption cannot be responsible for nucleation otherwise precipitation would occur on the dead cells as well moreover measuring the ca2 concentration in the media with live and dead cell for the three consortia data not shown demonstrated that dead cells can adsorb calcium ions while the amount of calcium ions adsorbed on live cells was negligible probably because of protons flooding across the cell membrane due to the electron transport chains douglas and beveridge 1998 since crystal formation around the cells have been demonstrated by many studies the authors believe this phenomenon happens as a result of the accumulation of ca2 around the cell due to the fact that bacteria pump out calcium ions through calcium channels to keep the intracellular concentrations of ca2 at lower levels harouaka et al 2016 thompson and ferris 1990 to investigate this hypothesis we studied the effect of a calcium channel blocker on biomineralization by the three consortia 3 2 3 calcium channels role in biomineralization to keep the intracellular calcium concentration at a low level bacteria naturally pump calcium ions to the surrounding region of the cell through calcium channels calcium transport channels described in prokaryotes include atpases berkelman et al 1994 desrosiers et al 1996 domínguez et al 2015 electrochemical potential driven ca2 transporters ivey et al 1993 voltage dependent channels matsushita et al 1988 and mechanosensitive ca2 ion channels nazarenko et al 2003 over time the pumping of calcium outside the cells through some of these channels may cause supersaturation of ions in the vicinity of the cells which may lead to nucleation and crystallization harouaka et al 2016 weiner and dove 2003 if this mechanism plays a role in microbial biomineralization blocking the calcium channels should prevent biomineralization the function of some of these ca2 pumps has been reported to be inhibited by sodium vanadate desrosiers et al 1996 the effect of addition of 250 μm sodium vanadate to the 79 mm growth media on the extent of microbial growth precipitation amount and crystal structure of the precipitation was investigated for the three consortia according to fig 6 the amount of precipitation for fresh water consortium decreased in the medium with the inhibitor present compared to the medium without the inhibitor while the extent of microbial growth was the same in both conditions fig s7 for wastewater and seawater consortia no differences in precipitation amounts were observed suggesting that either the ca2 transport channels are not involved in biomineralization or that other types of channels not inhibited by sodium vanadate studied here could be involved in the precipitation for the fresh water consortium the crystals were characterized with xrd the results fig s8 identified the precipitates in both media as vaterite and gypsum indicating that the channel blocker did not change the type of crystal formed by the consortia these results suggest that p type atpase ca2 channels blocked by this inhibitor can play a role in accumulation of calcium ions in the extracellular environment since disturbing one type of calcium transport system decreased the amount of precipitation however it should be noted that the precipitation was not completely inhibited for the fresh water consortium moreover wastewater and seawater consortia produced the same amount of precipitates in the presence of the calcium channel blocker these results can potentially be correlated with the findings on the effect of eps on biomineralization as discussed earlier for fresh water consortium cells or eps bound to the cells seemed to be playing a significant role in biomineralization probably by providing nucleation sites while for wastewater and seawater consortia the presence of cells or eps bound to the cells were not essential for precipitation hence disturbing calcium channels affect the precipitation for fresh water consortium but not the wastewater and seawater consortia which were mainly affected by the unbound eps this finding clearly suggests that there might be different mechanisms used by the microorganisms to produce precipitates future studies investigating different types of calcium channel blockers is suggested to further validate this observation moreover since the role of ca2 in prokaryotes have not been studied as much as in eukaryotes domínguez et al 2015 there might be some other mechanisms for prokaryotic organisms to pump calcium ions outside the cells which has not been discovered yet 3 3 antiscalants effect on biomineralization two common antiscaling polymers paa and pma used in desalination plants to prevent scaling were used to investigate biomineralization inhibition or elongate the induction time induction time is the time distance between supersaturation and first signs of precipitation during which nuclei form olsson 1995 in the literature three different mechanisms have been reported for how antiscalants work i antiscalants inhibit or slow down crystal formation by blocking the nucleation sites on small nuclei ii antiscalants decrease the activity of lattice cations like calcium and make the cations unavailable for crystal growth through coordination or chelation iii antiscalants disperse the particles greenlee et al 2010 a study on the antiscaling mechanism of paa showed that the first mechanism is applicable for this polymer le gouellec and elimelech 2002 while to our knowledge no study has been done to elucidate the mode of action of pma as antiscaling according to table s3 at all conditions i e two dosages of two antiscalants precipitation happened for all consortia either after 3 or 5 days in all the samples precipitation happened in 3 days except for all conditions for seawater and for fresh water at two conditions 10 mg l paa and 20 mg l pma where precipitation happened only after 5 days furthermore the structure of the crystal formed in the presence of the antiscalant changed with exception for wastewater gypsum formation was inhibited in the fresh water and calcite was produced instead of aragonite for the seawater consortia these results showed that these antiscalants cannot completely inhibit biomineralization in the current tested conditions although they were able to elongate the precipitation time for fresh water and seawater consortia moreover antiscalants can potentially affect the structure of the biominerals two explanations can be proposed to justify the elongation of precipitation time first since either eps production or ca2 accumulation on the cell continuously promote nuclei formation at some point insufficient antiscalant molecules will be present to prevent crystal growth second antiscalant degradation by the consortia could be taking place ashfaq et al 2019 sweity et al 2013 antiscalant degradation by bacteria seems more likely after 5 days compared to the beginning of the incubation because bacteria will first use the carbon sources that are easier for them to metabolize following by degradation of polymers as a new carbon source this hypothesis offers an opportunity for future experiments to investigate whether bacteria in these consortia use the paa or pma antiscalants as their carbon sources these results can potentially be correlated to the mechanisms of the biomineralization where the role of cells as nucleation site is significant for fresh water consortium but not for wastewater and seawater consortia hence it is possible that charge neutralization occurs on the fresh water bacteria cells due to accumulation of positively charged calcium ions then the anionic antiscalants can prevent the crystal growth on cells by adsorbing on them châtellier et al 2001 to determine the exact mechanism additional experiments will need to be conducted however the effect of the different consortia is clear while in the presence of the fresh water consortium antiscalants were able to greatly diminish the formation of crystals in the presence of the wastewater consortium the antiscalants were not able to reduce crystal formation to the same degree similar to the eps experiment the results for the seawater consortium were surprising instead of aragonite which was formed in the media without the polymers calcite was formed in the media with the antiscalant polymers since the formation of aragonite in the seawater medium is mainly due to the presence of mg2 it is likely that the polymers adsorb the magnesium ions preventing them from participating in the crystal growth without mg2 which stabilizes aragonite the more stable crystal structure of caco3 calcite forms instead antiscalants which have shown to be effective to prevent chemical scaling can only prevent gypsum formation by fresh water consortium but they cannot prevent biomineralization of caco3 and caso4 in other conditions while for fresh water and seawater consortia they changed the crystals structure however more experiments with different ratio of calcium and different antiscalants would be valuable in future studies 4 conclusion biological mineralization of caco3 and caso4 in conditions similar to ro systems from three different sources i e fresh water wastewater and seawater were investigated in two different concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 13 and 79 mm metabolically active microorganisms were able to produce calcite vaterite aragonite and gypsum the production of different types of crystals with different morphologies were correlated to the diversity of microorganisms as well as to water chemistry the mechanism of biomineralization was determined to involve accumulation of ca2 ions around the cells through calcium channels not adsorption as well as production of eps produced by the consortia addition of two polycarboxylate antiscalants paa and pma at different dosages to the media showed that although these polymers are great for preventing chemical mineralization they cannot inhibit biomineralization these results highlight the important role of microorganisms in scaling which is usually neglected while developing methods to prevent scaling in ro systems funding this publication was made possible by nprp grant nprp 11s 1211 170085 and nprp9

resulting in complete failure of the digestion process in this experimental study we demonstrated that one of the causes for the digester failure under low ph conditions is due to accelerated decay of methanogenic biomass when enriched acetate degrading methanogens were exposed to a low ph environment ph 5 1 with phosphoric acid in a batch experiment without external substrate the specific decay rate was observed to increase as much as 10 times of that at ph 7 0 the specific decay rate for formate degrader was also found to increase under low ph conditions whilst the fermentative microorganisms in the cultures appeared to be tolerant to low ph conditions a propidium mono azide quantitative polymerase chain reaction pma qpcr analysis revealed that the archaeal biomass dominated by methanogens dropped by 71 79 from the initial concentration after 6 days of the acidic batch experiment whilst the bacterial biomass dominating acidogens decreased by only 25 the decrease in the number of living cells in the batch experiments at different ph was monitored with time to determine a correlation between decay rate and incubation ph graphical abstract image 1 keywords acidic failure adm1 anaerobic digestion archaea inhibition methanogen 1 introduction to increase the sources of renewable energy numerous anaerobic digestion plants converting organic waste to biogas are being built world wide ferella et al 2019 gao et al 2020 most of these biogas plants use chemostat reactors fed with food waste animal manure and or municipal solid waste kaparaju et al 2009 organic food waste is an ideal source for biogas recovery as most of the food waste is readily biodegradable to save space and cost of construction the biogas recovery systems are often built as high loaded plants horváth et al 2016 these high loaded plants often encounter acidic failure when very high loads of biodegradable material are unexpectedly fed to the reactor in principle the acidic failure is caused by the imbalance of reaction rates between fermentative microorganisms acidogens fast grower and methanogens slow grower the acidogens produce organic acids volatile fatty acids lactate etc in proportion to its growth whilst the methanogens remove acetate and hydrogen and formate which are the end products of acidogenic reactions batstone et al 2002 during high loading conditions the acidogens produce a high amount of organic acids which are not proportionally removed by the slow growing methanogens resulting in the accumulation of organic acids in extreme cases the accumulation of organic acid and a corresponding decrease in ph result in inhibition of methanogen leading to acidic failure of reactor belostotskiy et al 2015 latif et al 2017 to cope with the acidic failure the influent feeding is temporarily reduced or discontinued until the concentrations of the accumulated organic acids decrease to an acceptable level according to zhang et al 2012 about 40 days were needed to recover the biogas production after digester was operated under acidic conditions ph 5 4 for two weeks on the other hand capson tojo et al 2017 reported that the continued process deterioration due to acidic failure ph 5 9 over 8 days of operation was recovered after only 2 weeks of operational pause to achieve maximum biogas yield it is important to develop reliable operational strategies to prevent digester failure and to identify the key process reactions for fast process recovery in case of failure therefore in biogas production engineering the development of process understanding to avoid the risks of acidic failure is one of the key focus areas ghofrani isfahani et al 2019 developed a supervisory control module for the biogas plants where the reactor ph volatile fatty acid concentrations and methane gas production rate were monitored to calculate the acceptable influent feeding to improve digester control strategies it is therefore important to include the mechanisms that affect the methanogenic activity into the mathematical model in this regard the inhibition of methanogen has been widely studied low ph high concentrations of non ionised volatile fatty acids and hydrogen sulphide etc have been identified as inhibitory parameters contributing to the acidic failure van kessel and russell 1996 horn et al 2003 kim et al 2004 lv et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 in all of these studies the inhibition is accounted for by applying an inhibition term to the growth rate reversible inhibition of specific methane production rate and the effect on biomass decay is completely neglected only a few studies are available which distinguish between the inhibition in growth and decay processes hao et al 2012 experimentally demonstrated that starvation of the methanogenic culture could increase the kinetic decay rate by as much as 2 3 times besides the studies for the anaerobes hao et al 2009 also showed that the kinetic decay rates of aerobes in the activated sludge sample were also increased during the starvation conditions in another study liu et al 2018 found that high nitrite concentration inactivated the nitrite oxidising microorganism where the microbial growth was simultaneously inhibited based on these experimental studies it was hypothesised that in addition to growth inhibition the accelerated decay of methanogenic microorganisms could contribute to the risk of acidic failure and subsequent process recovery under inhibitory conditions ngo et al 2016 experienced that methane production was lost after 10 days of the acidic failure where the operation of the lab scale reactor was halted during the days and the methanogenic reaction could not be recovered even after the reactor sludge was washed with water to remove the volatile fatty acids accumulated in the system one explanation for the observed behaviour could be that the acidic failure irreversibly inactivated the methanogens of the culture the focus of this experimental study was to elucidate how the decay rate of methanogens was affected during acidic failure low ph a set of laboratory scale chemostat reactors were fed with a synthetic substrate to enrich methanogenic biomass the enriched biomass from the continuous reactor was used in batch experiments without an external substrate to collect data on the change in active inactive cells over time to avoid the compounding effect of a high concentration of volatile fatty acids on biomass decay the experiments were conducted by reducing the ph with phosphoric acid the experimental data was further used in an adaptation of iwa anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 to simulate the decay rate of target microorganisms and explain the process recovery after a failure 2 material and methods 2 1 incubation of methanogenic cultures two units of 10 l jar fermenter mdl 1000 bem japan were operated in chemostat mode to grow enriched biomass of acetoclastic methanogen and hydrogenotrophic methanogen respectively the reactors were operated at 35 c with 15 day of hydraulic retention time the seed sludge for the reactors was obtained from a mesophilic anaerobic digester at hiagari municipal wastewater treatment plant kitakyushu japan the first unit acetate fed system was used to enrich acetate degrader acetoclastic methanogen where only acetate buffer ch3cooh ch3coona 4 1 mole basis having 1000 mgcod l was fed as a sole organic carbon source the second reactor formate fed system was fed with formate buffer hcooh hcoona 2 5 1 mole basis having 1000 mgcod l to enrich formate degrader hydrogenotrophic methanogen as each carbon source was composed of the organic acid and its na salt the ph of the 2 reactors was automatically maintained to be at around 7 3 by the sodium ion and the bicarbonate produced in the continuous operation both carbon sources were mixed with ammonium nitrogen nh4cl nh4hco3 1 1 mole basis 1000 mgn l phosphate na2hpo4 kh2po4 9 1 mole basis 50 mgp l cobalt 2 mgco l and nickel 2 mgni l in tap water to create synthetic medium for each reactor regular measurement of solid concentration soluble cod concentration and the biogas production in each reactor were performed during the operation as shown in table s1 after stable operation for 90 days the measured solid concentration was 168 20 mgcod l for the acetate fed reactor and 242 30 mgcod l for the formate fed reactor respectively the effluent soluble cod concentration was observed to be 10 40 mgcod l in both reactors whilst the conversion ratio of methane to the influent cod was attained to be 77 5 for the acetate fed reactor and 75 4 for the formate fed reactor respectively 2 2 batch experiments after over 3 months of continuous operation with the chemostat reactors 1200 ml of sludge was harvested from each chemostat reactor for use in the first set batch experiments set i the harvested sludge was centrifuged and washed with deionised water at 9 187g of centrifugal force 8000 rpm using a high speed refrigerated centrifuge himac cr22gⅱ hitachi japan after mixing phosphate buffer with the sludge pellets the sludge was evenly transferred to four 300 ml flasks equipped with a stirring device and a silicone rubber plug having a thin water sealed tube to release biogas during the incubation the conditions in each experiment were different with respect to ph and phosphate buffer concentration flask 1 ph 7 0 with 0 5 mmol p l 15 mgp l flask 2 ph 7 0 with 50 mmol p l 1500 mg p l flask 3 ph 5 1 with 0 5 mmol p l flask 4 ph 5 1 with 50 mmol p l two different concentrations of phosphate buffer were used at each selected ph so that the unintended impact of phosphorus concentration on the biomass decay could be assessed the air headspace in batch flasks was purged using a 0 5 l min flow rate of dinitrogen gas for 3 min the flasks were placed in a temperature controlled water bath at 35 c and incubated without the addition of external substrates during the incubation about 5 ml of the sludge was withdrawn every 24 h interval for further analysis the volume loss due to sampling was compensated by adding an equivalent volume of dinitrogen gas in the flask the batch incubations were run for 6 days where each experiment was duplicated with two flasks in each set to collect additional data to study the impact of ph on the biomass decay another set of batch experiments set ii was performed using the sludge from chemostat reactors in this set of experiments the ph of each flask was adjusted to 5 1 5 5 6 0 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 using 50 mm phosphate buffer with a small amount of naoh or h3po4 apart from the ph conditioning the experimental procedure was identical to the one used in the previously described batch experiments the second set of batch experiments was also used to evaluate the recovery of methanogenic reactions after the low ph inhibition at the end of the experiment day 6 the sludges set at ph 5 1 and those set at ph 7 0 were spiked with 3200 mgcod l of the same substrate as those fed to the chemostat reactors the methane production rates over the flasks for 22 days were monitored to assess system recovery 2 3 living cell counting a commercial cell staining kit live dead baclighttm cell viability kit l 7012 molecular probes usa was used to measure the number of living microorganisms during the batch experiments hao et al 2009 in this experimental method the reagents selectively reacted to living cells to generate green fluorescence to ensure that the cells were placed in a monolayer on the glass slide the collected sludge samples from the flasks were dispersed using ultrasonic wave before the microscopic observation for the pre treatment of ultrasonication the sludge sample 5 ml was centrifuged and washed with deionised water fig s1 the washed sludge sample was then diluted as much as 10 times with the deionised water and 5 ml of the diluted sample was placed in a 15 ml glass test tube in an ice water bucket the ultrasonic wave 20 khz was loaded to the diluted sample for 45 s using an ultrasonic disrupter ud 200 tomy japan at level 3 of power tension with 30 w power consumption of the instrument this experimental method was determined from a set of preliminary experiments with varied ultrasonication time fig s2 which enabled to maximise the cell viability liu et al 2018 after labelling the living microorganisms with the cell staining kit according to the manufacture s protocol 7 6 μl of the labelled sample was placed on the glass slide with a micropipette which ensured the sample liquid volume was perfectly spread over the area of the coverslip 22 22 mm 484 mm2 without leakage from the edge of the coverslip for the microscopic observation a fluorescence microscope eclipse 80i nikon japan ds fi2 nikon japan equipped with a bandpass filter cube gfp b excitation wavelength 460 500 nm emission wavelength 515 560 nm was used to record the fluorescent cell area per microscopic field at 200 magnification 10 20 a binarised image analysing software having 1280 960 pixels was used quick grain inotech japan at the magnification the software covered 0 786 mm2 of the coverslip area pixel resolution 0 8 μm which allowed to detect the living microorganism in 1 2 10 2 μl per photo per microscopic field a total of 30 photos were taken per glass slide at different places which corresponded to about 5 of the coverslip area fig s3 from the fluorescent cell area per microscopic field μm2 field the concentration of living biomass was estimated the datasets were statistically analysed using a commercial data analysis software igor pro wavemetrics usa also assuming each fluorescent spot was equivalent to a single living cell conversion factors to calculate the number of living cells from the fluorescent cell area were estimated the conversion factors were estimated to be 5 9 μm2 fluorescent cell area cell spot for the acetate fed system and 5 2 and μm2 fluorescent cell area cell spot for the formate fed systems respectively fig s4 the estimated values of 5 2 5 9 were noticeably higher than typical microbial cell sizes in electron microscopic observations mentioned in literature and books microbial cell diameter 1 0 μm and this was likely due to lens flare of the strong green fluoresce around the stained cells therefore the microscopic observation was completed within 0 5 1 days where the intensity of fluorescence was kept constant 2 4 pma qpcr analysis to measure fractions of archaea and bacteria in the sludge samples a pma qpcr analysis was conducted where genes of only living microorganisms were amplified and detected zacharias et al 2015 at the beginning and the end of the batch experiments 7 5 ml of sludge sample was washed and thickened in phosphate buffer ph 7 4 with the above mentioned high speed refrigerated centrifuge at 2 297g 4000 rpm for 5 min the thickened sample was diluted with 25 μm propidium monoazide pma to 1 ml and kept for 5 min under a dark condition followed by 5 min radiation of blue led light in ice water using illuminator tlb 01 gel company usa after recovery of the composite dna with a cell disruption pre treatment using tube mixer as one japan for 10 min followed by the extraction in 10 mm tris buffer using powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories usa the qpcr reaction was performed in its 20 μl sample composed of 0 5 μl of composite dna sample 10 μl of innudry qpcr mastermix probe analytik jena germany 2 μl of primer probe mix and 7 5 μl of nuclease free water the 16s rrna gene fragments were amplified on a pcr technique using a universal primer probe set uni340f uni806r and uni516f takara bio japan and an archaea specific primer probe set arch349f arch806r and arch516f takara bio japan according to the methods in takai and horikoshi 2000 from the numerical difference between the number of cells detected with the universal primer set and those detected with the archaea specific primer set the number of living bacterial cells was calculated the pcr amplification was performed using takara ex taq polymerase takara bio japan and a qtower3g thermal cycler analytik jena germany where the enzymes were activated at 98 c for 2 min followed by a sequential treatment composed of 50 cycles of denaturation at 98 c for 10 s annealing at 50 c for 45 s and extension at 72 c for 30 s together with a blank these samples were analysed using qpcrsoft 3 4 software analytik jena germany yanagawa et al 2019 2 5 process modelling to check the consistency of the experimental results and investigate the relationship between the ph and decay rate iwa anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 was used to simulate the lab experiments steady state simulation was carried out for each chemostat reactor using the operational conditions of each reactor to estimate concentrations of different solids fractions in the reactor effluent these microbial concentrations were compared with the fractions of methanogens and acidogens detected with pma qpcr technique and the living cell concentrations measured by the cell staining method a virtual biogas plant was built on a computer to simulate the batch plant responses under acidic conditions table s3 for the above programming and process calculations a commercial process simulator gps x ver 8 0 hydromantis environmental software solutions canada was used the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were adapted from the literature henze et al 2000 batstone et al 2002 jimenez et al 2013 except for those that were measured in this study table s2 the maximum specific growth rates of the methanogens were estimated from the curve fitting of the methanogenic recovery using the ph neutralised sludge after the low ph inhibition experiments whilst the half saturation coefficients of the substrates for the methanogens were estimated from the effluent soluble cod concentrations of the chemostat reactors 3 results and discussion 3 1 low ph inhibition for methanogens as shown in fig 1 photo s1 and photo s2 the living biomass estimated from the fluorescent cell area per microscopic field decreased considerably along with time in the flasks set at a ph of 5 1 in the initial phase the living cell area was counted to be about 800 μm2 field about 140 fluorescent spots field for the acetate fed system and about 1400 μm2 field about 270 fluorescent spots field for the formate fed system respectively after 24 h the fluorescent cell area in both the experiments decreased by about 30 at day 6 the area for the acetate fed system reached about 200 μm2 field about 40 fluorescent spots field whilst the area for the formate fed system also decreased to 400 μm2 field about 80 fluorescent spots field which was about 1 4 of the initial fluorescent cell area on the other hand the decrease of fluorescent cell areas of the flasks set at a ph of 7 0 was very little indicating that the biomass decay in the systems was very limited wang et al 2015 suggested that high phosphate concentration 1500 mgp l could inhibit methanogenic activity even at neutral ph however in the present study it appeared that the concentration of phosphate 15 1500 mgp l was not influential on the biomass decay and the decay rate was mainly dependent on ph proton concentration these experimental results suggested that the low ph enhanced the decay rate of methanogenic biomass the results from the set ii batch experiments with different initial ph values of 5 1 5 5 6 0 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 were shown on semi logarithmic plots in fig 2 the experimental results from these batch experiments indicated that the decay rate of living biomass correlated to the initial ph condition in the flasks higher biomass decay rates were evident at lower ph indicating that the low ph environments accelerated the biomass decay this observation was consistent with the conclusion from set i batch experiments comparing the fluorescent cell area at the initial phase to that at day 6 the fluorescent cell area of the acetate fed system was dropped by 84 2 6 for ph 5 1 77 7 5 for ph 5 5 64 2 0 for ph 6 0 43 4 7 for ph 6 5 28 2 4 for ph 7 0 26 2 8 for ph 7 5 respectively the low ph driven biomass decay was also recognised in the formate fed system at the end of the batch experiment the fluorescent cell area was decreased by 83 2 8 for ph 5 1 79 5 4 for ph 5 5 63 7 5 for ph 6 0 44 1 8 for ph 6 5 34 3 4 for ph 7 0 33 1 5 for ph 7 5 respectively considering that the decay rate of a microorganism was generally expressed as a first order reaction it was expected that the experiment s data of living cells on the semi logarithmic plot would show a linear trend constant slope however in plots for the datasets at lower ph than 6 0 the data seemed not to be linearly plotted one possible reason for this observed behaviour could be that the enriched sludge contained two or more microorganisms with different sensitivity to ph this hypothesis was tested by evaluating a two microorganism decay model to explain the experimental data in the next section 3 2 statistical analysis of biomass decay a double exponential function as shown in equation 1 was used to describe the decay of two microorganisms and to explain the non linearity in experimental data from the low ph batch tests the active biomass concentration at any time xactive t fluorescent cell area was estimated based on the initial concentrations of the two microorganisms xa 0 and xb 0 and their first order specific decay rates ba and bb respectively 1 x a c t i v e t x a 0 exp b a t x b 0 exp b b t the experimental datasets with non linear plots were used to determine the values of initial concentrations xa 0 xb 0 and the decay rates ba and bb in the double exponential model the estimated xa 0 and xb 0 for the acetate fed system were xa 0 577 39 μm2 field and xb 0 215 39 μm2 field for set i and xa 0 593 40 μm2 field and xb 0 221 40 μm2 field for set ii in both sets about 73 of the living biomass was accounted for xa fraction for the formate fed system xa fraction was about 53 of the living biomass these calculation results including the estimated values of ba and bb were reported in table s4 acetate fed system and table s5 formate fed system the estimated higher specific decay rate values for one of the biomasses was found to be statistically significant with high confidence level p 0 05 in the datasets for ph 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 respectively on the other hand since the datasets for ph 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 showed almost a linear decrease on semi logarithmic plot the estimated ba and bb were almost equal to each other e g ba 0 058 10 6 d 1 and bb 0 055 10 6 d 1 for the acetate fed system at ph 7 0 moreover it was not possible to determine a unique set of xa 0 and xb 0 in these experiments as indicated by a large 95 confidence intervals of xa 0 and xb 0 ranging between 108 108 and 108 108 in which the estimated values compensated each other as each biomass type could not be distinguished from each other in this experimental ph range these data sets were simulated with a single exponential equation having a lumped state variable of xa 0 and xb 0 xa b 0 and a lumped specific decay rate ba b the estimated specific decay rate values using this approach had also high confidence interval p 0 05 as shown in fig 3 in both the acetate fed system and the formate fed system it seemed that the ph lower than 6 0 significantly increased the specific decay rates of xa fraction in the normal ph range around 7 0 ba b was around 0 05 0 07 d 1 in both the systems when the experimental ph was decreased to 6 0 the ba value in both the systems increased to 0 39 0 46 d 1 similarly for a ph of 5 5 and 5 0 the ba value increased to 0 62 d 1 and 0 87 1 1 d 1 respectively these experiments demonstrated that the biomass decay of methanogenic culture was accelerated in a low ph environment as described in pma qpcr analysis section next the archaeal methanogenic biomass was found to be dominant in both the systems therefore the xa fraction the dominant portion of the fluorescent cell area in the above analysis affected by low ph was attributed to methanogenic biomass on the other hand the ph tolerant xb fraction the minor portion of the fluorescent cell area was attributed to acidogen biomass found to be present in pma qpcr analysis 3 3 analysis of biomass constituents as shown in fig 4 the pma qpcr experiment demonstrated that the archaeal biomass was considerably lost when the cultures were exposed to the low ph at 5 1 for 6 days whereas the decrease of bacterial biomass was small in the acetate fed system the archaeal biomass was accounted for about 78 of total living microorganisms in the culture and this fraction decreased to 27 at the end of the batch experiment indicating that significant methanogenic biomass decay took place during the incubation period for the formate fed system the initial archaeal biomass in the culture was estimated to be 67 of total living microorganisms which also decreased to 21 after 6 days in both the systems about 75 of the initial living cells were inactivated during 6 days of incubation under ph 5 1 acetate fed system 140 106 cells ml 35 106 cells ml formate fed system 240 106 cells ml 70 106 cells ml and approximately 90 of the cell death was recognised as the archaeal biomass decay acetate fed system 95 of 105 106 cells decrement ml formate fed system 86 of 170 106 cells decrement ml for the acetate fed system xa 0 was accounted for about 73 4 9 of the fluorescent cell area whilst xb 0 was present in its 27 4 9 these values were consistent with the archaeal fraction 78 and bacterial fraction 22 detected with pma qpcr technique respectively for the formate fed system the estimated xa 0 fraction 55 8 8 was slightly lower the archaeal fraction detected with the pma qpcr technique 67 nevertheless these experimental results indicated that archaeal biomass was the dominant microorganism in both the systems and the species were easily inactivated under low ph environment based on the conversion coefficients of fluorescent cell area per cell spot μm2 fluorescent cell area cell spot it seemed that about 108 of viable cells 120 15 106 cell spots ml were present per 1 ml of the culture collected from the chemostat reactor of the acetate fed system which decreased to about 30 6 106 cell spots ml at day 6 in the experiment set ph at 5 1 similarly for the formate fed system the number of fluorescent spots in the initial phase 200 30 106 cell spots ml decreased to 60 11 106 cell spots ml after day 6 in the acidic environment although a slight mismatch was found between the number of living cells detected by the pma qpcr method and the number of living cells detected by the fluorescent cell counting both visualisation techniques seemed to yield almost comparable results in total living cell number according to shibata et al 1987 and nakamura et al 1989 1 106 active cell ml was supposed to be almost equivalent to 1 mg l order of magnitude for microbial suspended solid since the sludge concentrations in the chemostat reactors were about 200 mgcod l for both systems 168 20 mgcod l for the acetate fed system 242 30 mgcod l for formate fed system these measured living cell concentrations of the 2 cultures 120 140 106 cells ml for the acetate fed system 180 240 106 cells ml for formate fed system were quite reasonable this consistency was maintained at the end of the experiment of 6 days acetate fed system 30 40 106 cells ml vs 51 mgcod l formate fed system 50 60 106 cells ml vs 80 mgcod l recently ravindran et al 2019 presented that a comparative number of ascaris ova were obtained among the measurements of culture fluorescent cell counting with live dead baclight kit and cell counting with pma qpcr method these detection consistencies were also found in the microbial cell counting in addition to the above experimental techniques the relative fractions of each microorganism in the chemostat reactor were estimated by using adm1 model for the acetate fed system the concentrations of xac acetoclastic methanogenic archaea xh2 hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea and xapo total acidogeninc bacteria xsu xaa xfa xc4 xpro were calculated to be 129 mgcod l 1 0 mgcod l and 25 mgcod l respectively when the simulations were performed using the laboratory operating conditions the inert fraction xu in the sludge was estimated to be about 8 of total particulate cod the total particulate cod 168 mgcod l estimated by the model was almost identical to the measured solid concentration in sludge 148 188 mgcod l the estimated archaeal fraction xac xh2 of the active biomass 84 was comparable to that measured with pma qpcr analysis 78 in the simulation of low ph batch experiments using the estimated specific decay rate of 0 83 d 1 for methanogens the model simulated that 96 of methanogens in the culture were lost under the acidic environment in 6 days whilst only 12 of acidogens were inactivated this was also consistent with the pma qpcr analysis which revealed that the losses of archaea and bacteria were 90 and 25 respectively the relative fraction of different microorganisms in the formate fed system also responded in a very similar manner to those of the acetate fed system the measured particulate cod of 212 272 mgcod l in the chemostat reactor matched well with the model prediction of 242 mgcod l about 92 of the sludge cod was predicted to be the sum of active biomass xh2 168 mgcod l xac 2 mgcod l xapo 53 mgcod l from the model the archaeal fraction and bacterial fraction were calculated to decrease to 8 mgcod l and 47 mgcod l after 6 days of the low ph experiment respectively this also supported the pma qpcr analytical results where archaeal biomass bacterial biomass was detected as 67 33 in the initial phase and 21 79 at the end of the low ph experiment 3 4 recovery of methanogenic activity after low ph environment at the end of the batch experiment at low ph set ii the recovery of methanogenic activity was examined by increasing the ph of the batch reactor and adding respective substrate acetate formate as shown the results in fig 5 the response of the sludge in the flasks initially set at ph 5 1 was distinct from those kept at ph 7 0 the addition of substrate to the flasks kept at a ph of 7 0 showed quick conversion of external substrate to methane within 1 2 days as the observed methane production rate was comparable to that from the freshly collected sludge from the chemostat reactor the methanogenic reaction rate under ph 7 0 seemed to be maintained even after 6 days of the incubation without substrate on the other hand the sludge of the flasks initially set at a ph of 5 1 required almost 18 20 days to complete the methane production this indicated that enhanced decay of methanogen at ph of 5 1 led to significant loss of methanogenic biomass causing a recovery lag since more methanogenic biomass decay was anticipated when the culture was exposed to lower ph and longer sludge retention in the acidic environment the above experimental results could explain the reason of the noticeably delayed recovery from the severe acidic failure ph 5 4 for 2 weeks and the relatively fast recovery from the moderate failure ph 5 9 for 8 days experienced by zhang et al 2012 and capson tojo et al 2017 respectively which were described in the introduction section 3 5 impact of accelerated methanogen s decay on biogas plant to highlight the significance of the results in this study the periods required for process recovery of a virtual biogas plant with without the enhanced decay during acidic failure were comparatively discussed using adm1 the acidic failure was simulated by feeding a high load of monosaccharide to the reactor followed by a sudden ph drop to ph 5 0 as soon as the ph dropped the plant operator discontinued the influent feeding for 5 days after 5 days the reactor ph in the reactor was adjusted to 7 0 by alkali dosing to express the acceleration of the methanogen decay a low ph inhibition switching function of i ph 0 i ph 1 was developed for the specific decay rates of methanogens as shown in equation 2 the proposed switching function was a modification of the ph inhibition function used in adm1 for the growth inhibition batstone et al 2002 in the proposed equation the value of values of n ph ul and ph ll were used 0 25 6 6 and 5 9 respectively the low level of the ph ph ll was such that it resulted in a specific decay rate as high as about 20 times iph exp 3 0 05 the curves adopted these parameter values were able to cover the measured specific decay rates against ph for both acetate fed system and the formate fed system as shown the lines in fig 3 2 specific decay rate b i p h i p h

performance was instantly recovered from the acidic failure when the reactor ph was neutralised after the ph neutralisation the plant could produce biogas from the vfas accumulated in the reactor this simulation behaviour suggested that plant operators could achieve normal operation after adjusting the ph in a digester which was quite contrary to the reported observations on the other hand in the simulations with the ph inhibition function on decay the concentration of methanogenic biomass was reduced by 90 during the acidic failure event for 5 days consequently even after neutralisation of the reactor ph almost no methane gas was produced the vfas accumulated in the reactor were not quickly decomposed and about 18 days of the operation pause was needed until the vfas concentration reached a reasonable level furthermore as the methanogenic biomass concentration in the reactor was still low the influent loading needed to be controlled until the vfa concentration reduced to an acceptable level the simulation results suggested that the full recovery of the methanogenic biomass would require about 30 days the results of this study suggested that control strategies for digester operation would need to focus on good ph management in digesters to minimise the risk of losing the methanogenic biomass in the reactor that would require a long recovery period 4 conclusion the effect of low ph inhibition on anaerobic microorganism was investigated using different experimental techniques the experimental data was further validated through anaerobic digestion modelling the key conclusions from this study are listed below 1 low ph conditions enhance the decay rate of methanogenic microorganisms causing irreversible inhibition at ph 5 1 almost 90 of acetoclastic methanogen and hydrogenotrophic methanogen were lost from the cultures within 6 days of incubation whereas the acidogenic bacteria were found to be more tolerant to the acidic environment 2 the low ph inhibition was mainly attributed to the proton concentration in the system the inhibition response at ph 5 1 with 50 mmol p l of phosphate buffer was comparable to that with 0 5 mmol p l thus ruling out the effect of phosphate buffer on the decay rate 3 the number of living microbial cells measured with the commercial fluorescent kit was comparable to those detected with pma qpcr method the active biomass concentration predicted by adm1 also correlated well to the measured values from the fluorescent cell staining method and the pma qpcr method 4 incorporation of the mechanism of irreversible low ph inhibition on methanogen decay was able to simulate the delay in methane generation for a plant recovering after acidic failure when the reactor was exposed to low ph at 5 0 for 5 days more than 30 days were needed until the methanogenic biomass in the reactor was fully recovered declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17887,acidic failure is relatively common in anaerobic digesters that receive readily biodegradable food wastes at high loading under low ph conditions the activity of methanogenic biomass decreases resulting in complete failure of the digestion process in this experimental study we demonstrated that one of the causes for the digester failure under low ph conditions is due to accelerated decay of methanogenic biomass when enriched acetate degrading methanogens were exposed to a low ph environment ph 5 1 with phosphoric acid in a batch experiment without external substrate the specific decay rate was observed to increase as much as 10 times of that at ph 7 0 the specific decay rate for formate degrader was also found to increase under low ph conditions whilst the fermentative microorganisms in the cultures appeared to be tolerant to low ph conditions a propidium mono azide quantitative polymerase chain reaction pma qpcr analysis revealed that the archaeal biomass dominated by methanogens dropped by 71 79 from the initial concentration after 6 days of the acidic batch experiment whilst the bacterial biomass dominating acidogens decreased by only 25 the decrease in the number of living cells in the batch experiments at different ph was monitored with time to determine a correlation between decay rate and incubation ph graphical abstract image 1 keywords acidic failure adm1 anaerobic digestion archaea inhibition methanogen 1 introduction to increase the sources of renewable energy numerous anaerobic digestion plants converting organic waste to biogas are being built world wide ferella et al 2019 gao et al 2020 most of these biogas plants use chemostat reactors fed with food waste animal manure and or municipal solid waste kaparaju et al 2009 organic food waste is an ideal source for biogas recovery as most of the food waste is readily biodegradable to save space and cost of construction the biogas recovery systems are often built as high loaded plants horváth et al 2016 these high loaded plants often encounter acidic failure when very high loads of biodegradable material are unexpectedly fed to the reactor in principle the acidic failure is caused by the imbalance of reaction rates between fermentative microorganisms acidogens fast grower and methanogens slow grower the acidogens produce organic acids volatile fatty acids lactate etc in proportion to its growth whilst the methanogens remove acetate and hydrogen and formate which are the end products of acidogenic reactions batstone et al 2002 during high loading conditions the acidogens produce a high amount of organic acids which are not proportionally removed by the slow growing methanogens resulting in the accumulation of organic acids in extreme cases the accumulation of organic acid and a corresponding decrease in ph result in inhibition of methanogen leading to acidic failure of reactor belostotskiy et al 2015 latif et al 2017 to cope with the acidic failure the influent feeding is temporarily reduced or discontinued until the concentrations of the accumulated organic acids decrease to an acceptable level according to zhang et al 2012 about 40 days were needed to recover the biogas production after digester was operated under acidic conditions ph 5 4 for two weeks on the other hand capson tojo et al 2017 reported that the continued process deterioration due to acidic failure ph 5 9 over 8 days of operation was recovered after only 2 weeks of operational pause to achieve maximum biogas yield it is important to develop reliable operational strategies to prevent digester failure and to identify the key process reactions for fast process recovery in case of failure therefore in biogas production engineering the development of process understanding to avoid the risks of acidic failure is one of the key focus areas ghofrani isfahani et al 2019 developed a supervisory control module for the biogas plants where the reactor ph volatile fatty acid concentrations and methane gas production rate were monitored to calculate the acceptable influent feeding to improve digester control strategies it is therefore important to include the mechanisms that affect the methanogenic activity into the mathematical model in this regard the inhibition of methanogen has been widely studied low ph high concentrations of non ionised volatile fatty acids and hydrogen sulphide etc have been identified as inhibitory parameters contributing to the acidic failure van kessel and russell 1996 horn et al 2003 kim et al 2004 lv et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 in all of these studies the inhibition is accounted for by applying an inhibition term to the growth rate reversible inhibition of specific methane production rate and the effect on biomass decay is completely neglected only a few studies are available which distinguish between the inhibition in growth and decay processes hao et al 2012 experimentally demonstrated that starvation of the methanogenic culture could increase the kinetic decay rate by as much as 2 3 times besides the studies for the anaerobes hao et al 2009 also showed that the kinetic decay rates of aerobes in the activated sludge sample were also increased during the starvation conditions in another study liu et al 2018 found that high nitrite concentration inactivated the nitrite oxidising microorganism where the microbial growth was simultaneously inhibited based on these experimental studies it was hypothesised that in addition to growth inhibition the accelerated decay of methanogenic microorganisms could contribute to the risk of acidic failure and subsequent process recovery under inhibitory conditions ngo et al 2016 experienced that methane production was lost after 10 days of the acidic failure where the operation of the lab scale reactor was halted during the days and the methanogenic reaction could not be recovered even after the reactor sludge was washed with water to remove the volatile fatty acids accumulated in the system one explanation for the observed behaviour could be that the acidic failure irreversibly inactivated the methanogens of the culture the focus of this experimental study was to elucidate how the decay rate of methanogens was affected during acidic failure low ph a set of laboratory scale chemostat reactors were fed with a synthetic substrate to enrich methanogenic biomass the enriched biomass from the continuous reactor was used in batch experiments without an external substrate to collect data on the change in active inactive cells over time to avoid the compounding effect of a high concentration of volatile fatty acids on biomass decay the experiments were conducted by reducing the ph with phosphoric acid the experimental data was further used in an adaptation of iwa anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 to simulate the decay rate of target microorganisms and explain the process recovery after a failure 2 material and methods 2 1 incubation of methanogenic cultures two units of 10 l jar fermenter mdl 1000 bem japan were operated in chemostat mode to grow enriched biomass of acetoclastic methanogen and hydrogenotrophic methanogen respectively the reactors were operated at 35 c with 15 day of hydraulic retention time the seed sludge for the reactors was obtained from a mesophilic anaerobic digester at hiagari municipal wastewater treatment plant kitakyushu japan the first unit acetate fed system was used to enrich acetate degrader acetoclastic methanogen where only acetate buffer ch3cooh ch3coona 4 1 mole basis having 1000 mgcod l was fed as a sole organic carbon source the second reactor formate fed system was fed with formate buffer hcooh hcoona 2 5 1 mole basis having 1000 mgcod l to enrich formate degrader hydrogenotrophic methanogen as each carbon source was composed of the organic acid and its na salt the ph of the 2 reactors was automatically maintained to be at around 7 3 by the sodium ion and the bicarbonate produced in the continuous operation both carbon sources were mixed with ammonium nitrogen nh4cl nh4hco3 1 1 mole basis 1000 mgn l phosphate na2hpo4 kh2po4 9 1 mole basis 50 mgp l cobalt 2 mgco l and nickel 2 mgni l in tap water to create synthetic medium for each reactor regular measurement of solid concentration soluble cod concentration and the biogas production in each reactor were performed during the operation as shown in table s1 after stable operation for 90 days the measured solid concentration was 168 20 mgcod l for the acetate fed reactor and 242 30 mgcod l for the formate fed reactor respectively the effluent soluble cod concentration was observed to be 10 40 mgcod l in both reactors whilst the conversion ratio of methane to the influent cod was attained to be 77 5 for the acetate fed reactor and 75 4 for the formate fed reactor respectively 2 2 batch experiments after over 3 months of continuous operation with the chemostat reactors 1200 ml of sludge was harvested from each chemostat reactor for use in the first set batch experiments set i the harvested sludge was centrifuged and washed with deionised water at 9 187g of centrifugal force 8000 rpm using a high speed refrigerated centrifuge himac cr22gⅱ hitachi japan after mixing phosphate buffer with the sludge pellets the sludge was evenly transferred to four 300 ml flasks equipped with a stirring device and a silicone rubber plug having a thin water sealed tube to release biogas during the incubation the conditions in each experiment were different with respect to ph and phosphate buffer concentration flask 1 ph 7 0 with 0 5 mmol p l 15 mgp l flask 2 ph 7 0 with 50 mmol p l 1500 mg p l flask 3 ph 5 1 with 0 5 mmol p l flask 4 ph 5 1 with 50 mmol p l two different concentrations of phosphate buffer were used at each selected ph so that the unintended impact of phosphorus concentration on the biomass decay could be assessed the air headspace in batch flasks was purged using a 0 5 l min flow rate of dinitrogen gas for 3 min the flasks were placed in a temperature controlled water bath at 35 c and incubated without the addition of external substrates during the incubation about 5 ml of the sludge was withdrawn every 24 h interval for further analysis the volume loss due to sampling was compensated by adding an equivalent volume of dinitrogen gas in the flask the batch incubations were run for 6 days where each experiment was duplicated with two flasks in each set to collect additional data to study the impact of ph on the biomass decay another set of batch experiments set ii was performed using the sludge from chemostat reactors in this set of experiments the ph of each flask was adjusted to 5 1 5 5 6 0 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 using 50 mm phosphate buffer with a small amount of naoh or h3po4 apart from the ph conditioning the experimental procedure was identical to the one used in the previously described batch experiments the second set of batch experiments was also used to evaluate the recovery of methanogenic reactions after the low ph inhibition at the end of the experiment day 6 the sludges set at ph 5 1 and those set at ph 7 0 were spiked with 3200 mgcod l of the same substrate as those fed to the chemostat reactors the methane production rates over the flasks for 22 days were monitored to assess system recovery 2 3 living cell counting a commercial cell staining kit live dead baclighttm cell viability kit l 7012 molecular probes usa was used to measure the number of living microorganisms during the batch experiments hao et al 2009 in this experimental method the reagents selectively reacted to living cells to generate green fluorescence to ensure that the cells were placed in a monolayer on the glass slide the collected sludge samples from the flasks were dispersed using ultrasonic wave before the microscopic observation for the pre treatment of ultrasonication the sludge sample 5 ml was centrifuged and washed with deionised water fig s1 the washed sludge sample was then diluted as much as 10 times with the deionised water and 5 ml of the diluted sample was placed in a 15 ml glass test tube in an ice water bucket the ultrasonic wave 20 khz was loaded to the diluted sample for 45 s using an ultrasonic disrupter ud 200 tomy japan at level 3 of power tension with 30 w power consumption of the instrument this experimental method was determined from a set of preliminary experiments with varied ultrasonication time fig s2 which enabled to maximise the cell viability liu et al 2018 after labelling the living microorganisms with the cell staining kit according to the manufacture s protocol 7 6 μl of the labelled sample was placed on the glass slide with a micropipette which ensured the sample liquid volume was perfectly spread over the area of the coverslip 22 22 mm 484 mm2 without leakage from the edge of the coverslip for the microscopic observation a fluorescence microscope eclipse 80i nikon japan ds fi2 nikon japan equipped with a bandpass filter cube gfp b excitation wavelength 460 500 nm emission wavelength 515 560 nm was used to record the fluorescent cell area per microscopic field at 200 magnification 10 20 a binarised image analysing software having 1280 960 pixels was used quick grain inotech japan at the magnification the software covered 0 786 mm2 of the coverslip area pixel resolution 0 8 μm which allowed to detect the living microorganism in 1 2 10 2 μl per photo per microscopic field a total of 30 photos were taken per glass slide at different places which corresponded to about 5 of the coverslip area fig s3 from the fluorescent cell area per microscopic field μm2 field the concentration of living biomass was estimated the datasets were statistically analysed using a commercial data analysis software igor pro wavemetrics usa also assuming each fluorescent spot was equivalent to a single living cell conversion factors to calculate the number of living cells from the fluorescent cell area were estimated the conversion factors were estimated to be 5 9 μm2 fluorescent cell area cell spot for the acetate fed system and 5 2 and μm2 fluorescent cell area cell spot for the formate fed systems respectively fig s4 the estimated values of 5 2 5 9 were noticeably higher than typical microbial cell sizes in electron microscopic observations mentioned in literature and books microbial cell diameter 1 0 μm and this was likely due to lens flare of the strong green fluoresce around the stained cells therefore the microscopic observation was completed within 0 5 1 days where the intensity of fluorescence was kept constant 2 4 pma qpcr analysis to measure fractions of archaea and bacteria in the sludge samples a pma qpcr analysis was conducted where genes of only living microorganisms were amplified and detected zacharias et al 2015 at the beginning and the end of the batch experiments 7 5 ml of sludge sample was washed and thickened in phosphate buffer ph 7 4 with the above mentioned high speed refrigerated centrifuge at 2 297g 4000 rpm for 5 min the thickened sample was diluted with 25 μm propidium monoazide pma to 1 ml and kept for 5 min under a dark condition followed by 5 min radiation of blue led light in ice water using illuminator tlb 01 gel company usa after recovery of the composite dna with a cell disruption pre treatment using tube mixer as one japan for 10 min followed by the extraction in 10 mm tris buffer using powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories usa the qpcr reaction was performed in its 20 μl sample composed of 0 5 μl of composite dna sample 10 μl of innudry qpcr mastermix probe analytik jena germany 2 μl of primer probe mix and 7 5 μl of nuclease free water the 16s rrna gene fragments were amplified on a pcr technique using a universal primer probe set uni340f uni806r and uni516f takara bio japan and an archaea specific primer probe set arch349f arch806r and arch516f takara bio japan according to the methods in takai and horikoshi 2000 from the numerical difference between the number of cells detected with the universal primer set and those detected with the archaea specific primer set the number of living bacterial cells was calculated the pcr amplification was performed using takara ex taq polymerase takara bio japan and a qtower3g thermal cycler analytik jena germany where the enzymes were activated at 98 c for 2 min followed by a sequential treatment composed of 50 cycles of denaturation at 98 c for 10 s annealing at 50 c for 45 s and extension at 72 c for 30 s together with a blank these samples were analysed using qpcrsoft 3 4 software analytik jena germany yanagawa et al 2019 2 5 process modelling to check the consistency of the experimental results and investigate the relationship between the ph and decay rate iwa anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 was used to simulate the lab experiments steady state simulation was carried out for each chemostat reactor using the operational conditions of each reactor to estimate concentrations of different solids fractions in the reactor effluent these microbial concentrations were compared with the fractions of methanogens and acidogens detected with pma qpcr technique and the living cell concentrations measured by the cell staining method a virtual biogas plant was built on a computer to simulate the batch plant responses under acidic conditions table s3 for the above programming and process calculations a commercial process simulator gps x ver 8 0 hydromantis environmental software solutions canada was used the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were adapted from the literature henze et al 2000 batstone et al 2002 jimenez et al 2013 except for those that were measured in this study table s2 the maximum specific growth rates of the methanogens were estimated from the curve fitting of the methanogenic recovery using the ph neutralised sludge after the low ph inhibition experiments whilst the half saturation coefficients of the substrates for the methanogens were estimated from the effluent soluble cod concentrations of the chemostat reactors 3 results and discussion 3 1 low ph inhibition for methanogens as shown in fig 1 photo s1 and photo s2 the living biomass estimated from the fluorescent cell area per microscopic field decreased considerably along with time in the flasks set at a ph of 5 1 in the initial phase the living cell area was counted to be about 800 μm2 field about 140 fluorescent spots field for the acetate fed system and about 1400 μm2 field about 270 fluorescent spots field for the formate fed system respectively after 24 h the fluorescent cell area in both the experiments decreased by about 30 at day 6 the area for the acetate fed system reached about 200 μm2 field about 40 fluorescent spots field whilst the area for the formate fed system also decreased to 400 μm2 field about 80 fluorescent spots field which was about 1 4 of the initial fluorescent cell area on the other hand the decrease of fluorescent cell areas of the flasks set at a ph of 7 0 was very little indicating that the biomass decay in the systems was very limited wang et al 2015 suggested that high phosphate concentration 1500 mgp l could inhibit methanogenic activity even at neutral ph however in the present study it appeared that the concentration of phosphate 15 1500 mgp l was not influential on the biomass decay and the decay rate was mainly dependent on ph proton concentration these experimental results suggested that the low ph enhanced the decay rate of methanogenic biomass the results from the set ii batch experiments with different initial ph values of 5 1 5 5 6 0 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 were shown on semi logarithmic plots in fig 2 the experimental results from these batch experiments indicated that the decay rate of living biomass correlated to the initial ph condition in the flasks higher biomass decay rates were evident at lower ph indicating that the low ph environments accelerated the biomass decay this observation was consistent with the conclusion from set i batch experiments comparing the fluorescent cell area at the initial phase to that at day 6 the fluorescent cell area of the acetate fed system was dropped by 84 2 6 for ph 5 1 77 7 5 for ph 5 5 64 2 0 for ph 6 0 43 4 7 for ph 6 5 28 2 4 for ph 7 0 26 2 8 for ph 7 5 respectively the low ph driven biomass decay was also recognised in the formate fed system at the end of the batch experiment the fluorescent cell area was decreased by 83 2 8 for ph 5 1 79 5 4 for ph 5 5 63 7 5 for ph 6 0 44 1 8 for ph 6 5 34 3 4 for ph 7 0 33 1 5 for ph 7 5 respectively considering that the decay rate of a microorganism was generally expressed as a first order reaction it was expected that the experiment s data of living cells on the semi logarithmic plot would show a linear trend constant slope however in plots for the datasets at lower ph than 6 0 the data seemed not to be linearly plotted one possible reason for this observed behaviour could be that the enriched sludge contained two or more microorganisms with different sensitivity to ph this hypothesis was tested by evaluating a two microorganism decay model to explain the experimental data in the next section 3 2 statistical analysis of biomass decay a double exponential function as shown in equation 1 was used to describe the decay of two microorganisms and to explain the non linearity in experimental data from the low ph batch tests the active biomass concentration at any time xactive t fluorescent cell area was estimated based on the initial concentrations of the two microorganisms xa 0 and xb 0 and their first order specific decay rates ba and bb respectively 1 x a c t i v e t x a 0 exp b a t x b 0 exp b b t the experimental datasets with non linear plots were used to determine the values of initial concentrations xa 0 xb 0 and the decay rates ba and bb in the double exponential model the estimated xa 0 and xb 0 for the acetate fed system were xa 0 577 39 μm2 field and xb 0 215 39 μm2 field for set i and xa 0 593 40 μm2 field and xb 0 221 40 μm2 field for set ii in both sets about 73 of the living biomass was accounted for xa fraction for the formate fed system xa fraction was about 53 of the living biomass these calculation results including the estimated values of ba and bb were reported in table s4 acetate fed system and table s5 formate fed system the estimated higher specific decay rate values for one of the biomasses was found to be statistically significant with high confidence level p 0 05 in the datasets for ph 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 respectively on the other hand since the datasets for ph 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 showed almost a linear decrease on semi logarithmic plot the estimated ba and bb were almost equal to each other e g ba 0 058 10 6 d 1 and bb 0 055 10 6 d 1 for the acetate fed system at ph 7 0 moreover it was not possible to determine a unique set of xa 0 and xb 0 in these experiments as indicated by a large 95 confidence intervals of xa 0 and xb 0 ranging between 108 108 and 108 108 in which the estimated values compensated each other as each biomass type could not be distinguished from each other in this experimental ph range these data sets were simulated with a single exponential equation having a lumped state variable of xa 0 and xb 0 xa b 0 and a lumped specific decay rate ba b the estimated specific decay rate values using this approach had also high confidence interval p 0 05 as shown in fig 3 in both the acetate fed system and the formate fed system it seemed that the ph lower than 6 0 significantly increased the specific decay rates of xa fraction in the normal ph range around 7 0 ba b was around 0 05 0 07 d 1 in both the systems when the experimental ph was decreased to 6 0 the ba value in both the systems increased to 0 39 0 46 d 1 similarly for a ph of 5 5 and 5 0 the ba value increased to 0 62 d 1 and 0 87 1 1 d 1 respectively these experiments demonstrated that the biomass decay of methanogenic culture was accelerated in a low ph environment as described in pma qpcr analysis section next the archaeal methanogenic biomass was found to be dominant in both the systems therefore the xa fraction the dominant portion of the fluorescent cell area in the above analysis affected by low ph was attributed to methanogenic biomass on the other hand the ph tolerant xb fraction the minor portion of the fluorescent cell area was attributed to acidogen biomass found to be present in pma qpcr analysis 3 3 analysis of biomass constituents as shown in fig 4 the pma qpcr experiment demonstrated that the archaeal biomass was considerably lost when the cultures were exposed to the low ph at 5 1 for 6 days whereas the decrease of bacterial biomass was small in the acetate fed system the archaeal biomass was accounted for about 78 of total living microorganisms in the culture and this fraction decreased to 27 at the end of the batch experiment indicating that significant methanogenic biomass decay took place during the incubation period for the formate fed system the initial archaeal biomass in the culture was estimated to be 67 of total living microorganisms which also decreased to 21 after 6 days in both the systems about 75 of the initial living cells were inactivated during 6 days of incubation under ph 5 1 acetate fed system 140 106 cells ml 35 106 cells ml formate fed system 240 106 cells ml 70 106 cells ml and approximately 90 of the cell death was recognised as the archaeal biomass decay acetate fed system 95 of 105 106 cells decrement ml formate fed system 86 of 170 106 cells decrement ml for the acetate fed system xa 0 was accounted for about 73 4 9 of the fluorescent cell area whilst xb 0 was present in its 27 4 9 these values were consistent with the archaeal fraction 78 and bacterial fraction 22 detected with pma qpcr technique respectively for the formate fed system the estimated xa 0 fraction 55 8 8 was slightly lower the archaeal fraction detected with the pma qpcr technique 67 nevertheless these experimental results indicated that archaeal biomass was the dominant microorganism in both the systems and the species were easily inactivated under low ph environment based on the conversion coefficients of fluorescent cell area per cell spot μm2 fluorescent cell area cell spot it seemed that about 108 of viable cells 120 15 106 cell spots ml were present per 1 ml of the culture collected from the chemostat reactor of the acetate fed system which decreased to about 30 6 106 cell spots ml at day 6 in the experiment set ph at 5 1 similarly for the formate fed system the number of fluorescent spots in the initial phase 200 30 106 cell spots ml decreased to 60 11 106 cell spots ml after day 6 in the acidic environment although a slight mismatch was found between the number of living cells detected by the pma qpcr method and the number of living cells detected by the fluorescent cell counting both visualisation techniques seemed to yield almost comparable results in total living cell number according to shibata et al 1987 and nakamura et al 1989 1 106 active cell ml was supposed to be almost equivalent to 1 mg l order of magnitude for microbial suspended solid since the sludge concentrations in the chemostat reactors were about 200 mgcod l for both systems 168 20 mgcod l for the acetate fed system 242 30 mgcod l for formate fed system these measured living cell concentrations of the 2 cultures 120 140 106 cells ml for the acetate fed system 180 240 106 cells ml for formate fed system were quite reasonable this consistency was maintained at the end of the experiment of 6 days acetate fed system 30 40 106 cells ml vs 51 mgcod l formate fed system 50 60 106 cells ml vs 80 mgcod l recently ravindran et al 2019 presented that a comparative number of ascaris ova were obtained among the measurements of culture fluorescent cell counting with live dead baclight kit and cell counting with pma qpcr method these detection consistencies were also found in the microbial cell counting in addition to the above experimental techniques the relative fractions of each microorganism in the chemostat reactor were estimated by using adm1 model for the acetate fed system the concentrations of xac acetoclastic methanogenic archaea xh2 hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea and xapo total acidogeninc bacteria xsu xaa xfa xc4 xpro were calculated to be 129 mgcod l 1 0 mgcod l and 25 mgcod l respectively when the simulations were performed using the laboratory operating conditions the inert fraction xu in the sludge was estimated to be about 8 of total particulate cod the total particulate cod 168 mgcod l estimated by the model was almost identical to the measured solid concentration in sludge 148 188 mgcod l the estimated archaeal fraction xac xh2 of the active biomass 84 was comparable to that measured with pma qpcr analysis 78 in the simulation of low ph batch experiments using the estimated specific decay rate of 0 83 d 1 for methanogens the model simulated that 96 of methanogens in the culture were lost under the acidic environment in 6 days whilst only 12 of acidogens were inactivated this was also consistent with the pma qpcr analysis which revealed that the losses of archaea and bacteria were 90 and 25 respectively the relative fraction of different microorganisms in the formate fed system also responded in a very similar manner to those of the acetate fed system the measured particulate cod of 212 272 mgcod l in the chemostat reactor matched well with the model prediction of 242 mgcod l about 92 of the sludge cod was predicted to be the sum of active biomass xh2 168 mgcod l xac 2 mgcod l xapo 53 mgcod l from the model the archaeal fraction and bacterial fraction were calculated to decrease to 8 mgcod l and 47 mgcod l after 6 days of the low ph experiment respectively this also supported the pma qpcr analytical results where archaeal biomass bacterial biomass was detected as 67 33 in the initial phase and 21 79 at the end of the low ph experiment 3 4 recovery of methanogenic activity after low ph environment at the end of the batch experiment at low ph set ii the recovery of methanogenic activity was examined by increasing the ph of the batch reactor and adding respective substrate acetate formate as shown the results in fig 5 the response of the sludge in the flasks initially set at ph 5 1 was distinct from those kept at ph 7 0 the addition of substrate to the flasks kept at a ph of 7 0 showed quick conversion of external substrate to methane within 1 2 days as the observed methane production rate was comparable to that from the freshly collected sludge from the chemostat reactor the methanogenic reaction rate under ph 7 0 seemed to be maintained even after 6 days of the incubation without substrate on the other hand the sludge of the flasks initially set at a ph of 5 1 required almost 18 20 days to complete the methane production this indicated that enhanced decay of methanogen at ph of 5 1 led to significant loss of methanogenic biomass causing a recovery lag since more methanogenic biomass decay was anticipated when the culture was exposed to lower ph and longer sludge retention in the acidic environment the above experimental results could explain the reason of the noticeably delayed recovery from the severe acidic failure ph 5 4 for 2 weeks and the relatively fast recovery from the moderate failure ph 5 9 for 8 days experienced by zhang et al 2012 and capson tojo et al 2017 respectively which were described in the introduction section 3 5 impact of accelerated methanogen s decay on biogas plant to highlight the significance of the results in this study the periods required for process recovery of a virtual biogas plant with without the enhanced decay during acidic failure were comparatively discussed using adm1 the acidic failure was simulated by feeding a high load of monosaccharide to the reactor followed by a sudden ph drop to ph 5 0 as soon as the ph dropped the plant operator discontinued the influent feeding for 5 days after 5 days the reactor ph in the reactor was adjusted to 7 0 by alkali dosing to express the acceleration of the methanogen decay a low ph inhibition switching function of i ph 0 i ph 1 was developed for the specific decay rates of methanogens as shown in equation 2 the proposed switching function was a modification of the ph inhibition function used in adm1 for the growth inhibition batstone et al 2002 in the proposed equation the value of values of n ph ul and ph ll were used 0 25 6 6 and 5 9 respectively the low level of the ph ph ll was such that it resulted in a specific decay rate as high as about 20 times iph exp 3 0 05 the curves adopted these parameter values were able to cover the measured specific decay rates against ph for both acetate fed system and the formate fed system as shown the lines in fig 3 2 specific decay rate b i p h i p h

performance was instantly recovered from the acidic failure when the reactor ph was neutralised after the ph neutralisation the plant could produce biogas from the vfas accumulated in the reactor this simulation behaviour suggested that plant operators could achieve normal operation after adjusting the ph in a digester which was quite contrary to the reported observations on the other hand in the simulations with the ph inhibition function on decay the concentration of methanogenic biomass was reduced by 90 during the acidic failure event for 5 days consequently even after neutralisation of the reactor ph almost no methane gas was produced the vfas accumulated in the reactor were not quickly decomposed and about 18 days of the operation pause was needed until the vfas concentration reached a reasonable level furthermore as the methanogenic biomass concentration in the reactor was still low the influent loading needed to be controlled until the vfa concentration reduced to an acceptable level the simulation results suggested that the full recovery of the methanogenic biomass would require about 30 days the results of this study suggested that control strategies for digester operation would need to focus on good ph management in digesters to minimise the risk of losing the methanogenic biomass in the reactor that would require a long recovery period 4 conclusion the effect of low ph inhibition on anaerobic microorganism was investigated using different experimental techniques the experimental data was further validated through anaerobic digestion modelling the key conclusions from this study are listed below 1 low ph conditions enhance the decay rate of methanogenic microorganisms causing irreversible inhibition at ph 5 1 almost 90 of acetoclastic methanogen and hydrogenotrophic methanogen were lost from the cultures within 6 days of incubation whereas the acidogenic bacteria were found to be more tolerant to the acidic environment 2 the low ph inhibition was mainly attributed to the proton concentration in the system the inhibition response at ph 5 1 with 50 mmol p l of phosphate buffer was comparable to that with 0 5 mmol p l thus ruling out the effect of phosphate buffer on the decay rate 3 the number of living microbial cells measured with the commercial fluorescent kit was comparable to those detected with pma qpcr method the active biomass concentration predicted by adm1 also correlated well to the measured values from the fluorescent cell staining method and the pma qpcr method 4 incorporation of the mechanism of irreversible low ph inhibition on methanogen decay was able to simulate the delay in methane generation for a plant recovering after acidic failure when the reactor was exposed to low ph at 5 0 for 5 days more than 30 days were needed until the methanogenic biomass in the reactor was fully recovered declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17888,in drinking water treatment natural organic matter nom is effectively removed from surface water using ion exchange iex a main drawback of using iex for nom removal is the production of spent iex regeneration brine a polluting waste that is expensive to discharge in this work we studied ceramic nanofiltration as a treatment for the spent nom rich brine with the aim to reduce the volume of this waste and to recycle salt compared to polymeric nanofiltration the fouling was limited when nom is rejected and concentrated a clean permeate with the regeneration salt nacl could be produced and reused in the iex regeneration process bench scale studies revealed that nom could be effectively separated from the nacl solution by steric effects however the separation of nacl from other salts present in the brine such as na2so4 was not sufficient for reuse purposes the low sulphate rejection was mainly due to the low zeta potential of the membrane at the high ionic strength of the brine the permeate of the ceramic nanofiltration should be treated further to obtain a sodium chloride quality that can be recycled as a regenerant solution for ion exchange further treatment steps will benefit from the removal of nom from the brine graphical abstract image 1 keywords nom rich brine ceramic nanofiltration ion exchange 1 introduction natural organic matter nom is one of the rising problems for drinking water treatment from surface waters and its removal at the beginning of a treatment train improves many downstream processes matilainen and sillanpää 2010 ion exchange iex can remove negatively charged nom including nom fractions that are not targeted by conventional coagulation grefte et al 2011 there are two main problems related to the use of iex for nom removal upstream the surface water treatment system 1 the conventional fixed iex bed configuration is not suitable for application at the beginning of the treatment and 2 regeneration of iex resin produces a polluting waste stream that can be difficult to manage and expensive to discharge the first problem is mainly linked to clogging by suspended solids however it can be solved by avoiding packed beds columns verdickt et al 2012 galjaard and koreman 2015 this was first achieved with the introduction of the magnetic ion exchange process miex over twenty years ago morran et al 1996 afterwards the miex system is scaled up and patented bourke et al 1999 more recently two new configurations have been introduced the suspended ion exchange six galjaard and koreman 2015 and fluidized iex fix cornelissen et al 2010 verdickt et al 2012 these two systems can also be used in the first stages of a surface water treatment train a recent review by levchuk et al 2018 showed that iex consistently removes nom from drinking water sources and that the unremoved nom generally between 10 and 40 percent is uncharged although the concentrations may differ all configurations produce high saline waste streams which consist of sodium chloride nacl sodium sulphate na2so4 sodium nitrate and humic and fulvic acids the second problem is the disposal of this waste stream which is still a drawback for the application of all iex processes in full scale water treatment verdickt 2012 in general saline waste streams are frequently produced in drinking water or industrial water production probably the largest amount is produced as a result of seawater desalination jones et al 2019 other sources of saline waste streams are inland desalinisation installations such as in the treatment of brackish groundwater with reverse osmosis and spent regenerants from iex processes conventional methods to dispose brines are landfill ground storage deep well injection evaporation ponds and discharge in the sewer or in coastal area in the sea brandt et al 2016 neale and schäfer 2009 panagopoulos et al 2019 however risks linked to landfill and ground storage include pollution of ground water and salt pollution of soil mohamed et al 2005 in addition discharge in the sea can have a negative impact on the sea ecology the brine has different salinity compared to the sea and may contain pollutants neale and schäfer 2009 in some cases zero liquid discharge technologies are used the goal of zero liquid discharge is to concentrate the dissolved salts as much as possible with technologies as reverse osmosis or electro dialysis subramani and jacangelo 2014 finally an evaporation and a crystallisation technology is used to obtain the dry salt the drawback of this technology is the energy use of the evaporation and crystallisation step panagopoulos et al 2019 to the authors knowledge there is few literature specific for waste management of brine from iex for nom removal for drinking water production the nom rich brine from several pilot and full scale plants with miex and conventional iex has also been reported to be disposed in conventional waste water treatment plants wwtp schippers et al 2005 amini et al 2015 arias paic et al 2016 for most of the treatment plants described by amini et al 2015 this is done after dilution and slow discharge however depending on e g the brine composition and volume discharge to a municipal wwtp is often not feasible biological treatment can be challenged by the presence of salts romero barranco et al 2001 moreover the specific nom in the iex brine is considered not readily biodegradable the external costs for brines treatment are high e g between 50 and 200 euro m3 in the european flanders region ceulemans et al 2015 in addition drinking water companies deal with restrictions regarding waste disposal meaning that brine treatment for reuse and recovery is of interest as a sustainable solution to brine management two approaches are used and or studied to reduce the volume of brine waste reusing the brine multiple times before disposal and treating the brine to recover the resources in the brine for instance the water the regeneration salts and the nom regeneration brine has been reused for e g iex full scale and pilots in the netherlands in the united kingdom in belgium and in the united states schippers et al 2005 vaudevire and koreman 2013 verdickt et al 2012 amini et al 2015 verdickt and schoutteten 2018 in the water treatment plants described by amini et al 2015 portions of low conductivity brine were recycled as raw drinking water and in some cases the brine was reused until a minimum conductivity was reached the conductivity in this case can be an indicator of the remaining concentration of nacl in the brine in the pilot plant from schippers et al 2005 the regenerant was reused three times before disposal first the resin bed was regenerated by a three times used solution and subsequently by a two and one time used solution and finally with fresh regenerant 10 percent nacl schippers et al 2005 for the pilot study of verdickt et al 2012 the waste brine was reused after flocculation with 6 g fecl3 l filter pressing and ph adjustment verdickt et al 2012 observed that the sulphate so4 2 accumulated in the reused brine reduced the removal of sulfates nitrates and alkalinity from the main process water but this did not affect the nom removal greatly although reusing the brine can reduce the waste volumes and the use of chemicals amini et al 2015 schippers et al 2005 verdickt et al 2012 this approach has as the main drawback that it creates a limit for the amount of resin per litre of water that can be regenerated verdickt and schoutteten 2018 the volume of the brine after regeneration is generally larger than the volume of the brine before regeneration because the resin also needs a rinse with clean water before returning in the ion exchanger if the resin cannot be rinsed properly excessive salt ends up in the treated water verdickt and schoutteten 2018 research on nom rich brine treatment has been focussed on treatment technologies that use polymeric membranes for pressure driven membranes the range of molecular weight cut off mwco was mostly in the nanofiltration range schippers et al 2005 vaudevire and koreman 2013 kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 leong et al 2015 the resources that could be recovered from the brine has mainly been the nom and the regeneration salt typically nacl concentrated nom has been suggested to be used in agriculture and food industry and the clean regeneration salt solution could be recycled in iex regeneration itself schippers et al 2005 leong et al 2015 vaudevire and koreman 2013 haddad et al 2019 vaudevire et al 2019 when brine is treated however other anions from the raw water could also accumulate in the nacl regenerant for instance in case of raw water containing so4 2 this anion has a high affinity for the iex resin and also accumulates in the regenerant brine therefore it would be beneficial if the membrane could combine rejection of so4 2 with nom rejection without limiting the passage of cl to the permeate polymeric nanofiltration for iex brine treatment removed nom by about 90 percent and more schippers et al 2005 kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 vaudevire and koreman 2013 jirícek et al 2015 ceulemans et al 2015 the passage of cl was high but some of the tightest membranes showed some cl rejection kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 leong et al 2015 where measured the rejection of so4 2 was between 75 and 90 percent vaudevire and koreman 2013 leong et al 2015 in case of direct brine reuse after treatment because of the presence of resin rinse water in the brines concentration should be included in the treatment therefore dynamic vapour decompression vaudevire and koreman 2013 and membrane distillation jirícek et al 2015 ceulemans et al 2015 have been considered after nanofiltration electrodialysis has also been studied as alternative treatment for nom rich iex brine kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 haddad et al 2019 vaudevire et al 2019 in particular vaudevire et al 2019 were interested in the recovery of concentrated nom and nacl water for regeneration reuse vaudevire et al 2019 piloted a two stage process monovalent selective electrodialysis with high removal of cl and low removal of nom and standard elecrodialysis with removal of inorganic content and conservation of nom according to haddad et al 2019 monovalent selective electrodialys is a promising option for nom iex brine treatment however an attention point of the technologies that use polymeric membranes is that their performances can decrease in the presence of nom e g due to fouling as shown by gryta et al 2001 lindstrand et al 2000 lee et al 2002 and hong and elimelech 1997 therefore additional technologies were used to counteract nom fouling in nom iex brine membrane treatment e g frequent feed forward flush during nanofiltration vaudevire and koreman 2013 and vibratory shear enhanced processing vsep leong et al 2015 vsep enhances cross flow using vibrations along the membrane surface this paper is focused on ceramic nanofiltration membranes because of their advantages over polymeric membranes e g higher fluxes and lower fouling characteristics hofs et al 2011 amta 2018 in addition ceramic membranes are supposed to be more durable than the polymeric membranes both mechanical strength and chemical resistance are better sondhi et al 2003 van der bruggen et al 2003 nom removed by iex is supposed to be mostly composed of humic substances grefte et al 2011 and therefore bench scale rejection tests were performed with ceramic membranes using nom that was isolated from iex brines from two different water treatment plants in addition the rejection of nacl and na2so4 in nom rich brine was studied waste brine can have varying ionic strengths depending on the iex regeneration system and the varying composition of the negative ions in the raw water to simulate this different ionic strengths and concentrations of nacl and na2so4 were used for testing in addition the influence of the zeta potential and the nom charge on the rejection of nom and salts from the simulated brines was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the membranes the commercial ceramic membranes inopor gmbh germany used in this study have a support layer of al2o3 and a separation layer of tio2 according to the manufacturer the mean pore size of the separation layer was 0 9 nm and the membrane porosity was 30 40 percent for the filtration tests we used a single channel tubular shaped membrane with an internal diameter of 7 mm and filtration area of 0 00163 m2 for the zeta potential tests see section 3 1 2 a flat disk membrane with the same characteristics as the tubular membrane was used the mwco of a membrane is the molecular weight of a compound that shows 90 percent retention to measure the mwco of the tubular ceramic membrane for the filtration tests a solution of demineralized water and a mixture of polyethylene glycol peg of five sizes i e 200 300 400 600 and 1000 da sigma aldrich germany was filtered this procedure was similar of those by shang et al 2017 and kramer et al 2019 the peg of each size had a concentration of 0 6 g l in the mixture the filtration was in cross flow mode and the concentrate was recirculated as feed after 60 70 and 80 min of filtration three permeate samples were collected temperature range 22 25 c trans membrane pressure range 2 9 3 1 bar flux range 41 43 lmh cross flow velocity 1 28 1 31 m s the feed was sampled twice during the collection of the first and third permeate after 0 45 μm filtration the samples were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography prominence shimadzu japan with a refractive index detector rid 20a shimadzu japan and two gel permeation chromatography columns for size exclusion 5 μm 30 å pss gmbh germany knowing the elution time of the single sizes of peg the signal of the refractive index detector for permeate and feed samples were compared to calculate the membrane retention of each peg size further a streaming potential measurement was used to determine the zeta potential of the membrane the zeta potential is the potential difference between the slippery plane of the electrical double layer that consists of the stern layer and the diffuse layer of a surface and the surrounding stable electrolyte and it gives an indication of the charge in the proximity of the membrane the zeta potential is thus frequently used as a tool to describe the charge of membranes hurwitz et al 2010 the measurement was performed on 0 02 m 0 01 m dices of a flat disk membrane the streaming potential was measured by an electrokinetic analyzer surpass anton paar austria with tangential mode an electrolyte solution passed through the channel formed by two membrane dices as explained by chang 2016 an electrolyte solution removes from the surface of the channel the ions with opposite charge compared to the charge of the surface of the channel causing a difference in the electrical potential between the two ends of the channel the measured streaming potential ζ was used by the electrokinetic analyzer to calculate the zeta potential according to the helmholtz smoluchowski relation christoforou et al 1985 with equation 1 1 ζ d i d p η ε r ε 0 l a where di dp streaming current coefficient l length of membrane dice a cross section area of the channel η viscosity ε 0 vacuum permittivity and ε r relative permittivity of the background solution nacl solutions of 0 01 m and 0 1 m were used to simulate the zeta potential for various brine conditions it was not possible to measure the zeta potential in a nacl solution of 1m because this was outside the measurement range of the instrument the ph was adjusted manually from 4 to 8 or 9 with a temperature range of 22 25 c the debye length also gives an indication of the effect of membrane charge the debye length is distance in the double layer where the surface electric potential of a charged surface is decreased by 1 e magnitude sillanpää and shestakova 2017 for different solution ion strengths 0 01 0 1 and 1 m we calculated the debye length κ 1 m in water at 20 c was calculated

samples were provided by two dutch water companies vitens and pwn both samples contained nom that has been recovered from spent iex regenerant brines and these samples contained mostly humic substances the nom of vitens had a groundwater origin while the nom of pwn had a surface water origin for the characterisation of nom the organic carbon of five nom fractions was measured by het water laboratorium the netherlands using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd as described in huber et al 2011 the five nom fractions i e biopolymers humic substances building blocks low molecular weight acids and low molecular weight neutrals form the chromatographic fractionation of organic carbon cdoc huber et al 2011 2 3 nom and salt tests rejection tests were performed with four membranes synthetic brines and waste brines from iex treatment of different locations this paper shows only the results of the membrane with the lowest mwco and the synthetic brines the other results are shown in the supplementary data appendix the synthetic feed solution for the vitens and pwn nom and salts filtration experiments was prepared by adding the nom into demineralized water with dissolved nacl and na2so4 sigma aldrich germany carl roth germany at varying concentrations composition set ionic strength and ph of the feed solutions used in the filtration experiments were divided into four series as summarized in table 1 the filtration was in cross flow mode and the concentrate was recirculated as feed the experiments could not be repeated using the same membrane instead for each experiment the permeate was sampled at three different times after the system was stable after 60 min of filtration three permeate samples were collected one after another for 30 min the feed was sampled twice during the collection of the first and third permeate temperature range 27 42 c with manual adjustment of a needle valve and pump speed the cross flow velocity and the flux were maintained constant during sampling and were 1 3 0 1 m s and 31 7 lmh respectively except for the 0 1 m experiment at ph 4 which had a flux of 20 lmh the cross flow velocity provided turbulent flow with a reynolds number of 9100 inside the tubular membrane directly after each experiment the membrane was flushed forward with demineralized feed water before each experiment after the last experiment of each series and after each experiment at ph 4 the ultrapure water permeability was measured temperature range 20 32 c trans membrane pressure of approximately 3 bar recirculation cross flow velocity of approximately 1 3 m s after the final permeability tests of series 1 series 2 series 3 and the experiments at ph 4 the membrane was cleaned with 2 h soak in a solution of 0 2 percent naocl nom was measured as dissolved organic carbon doc in the feed and permeate samples the samples were measured after 0 45 μm filtration by a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan the concentration of na so4 2 and cl in most of the feed and permeate samples were determined by ionic chromatography metrohm ag switserland anions and cations were identified based on their specific charge groups and interaction with two ion exchange columns metrosep c6 150 4 0 and a supp 150 4 0 metrohm ag switserland for some of the experiments only so4 2 was measured using a test cell kit spectroquant merck germany for both ion chromatography and kits the samples were filtrated with a 0 45 μm filter and diluted according to the measurement range of the instruments 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the ceramic nanofiltration membrane 3 1 1 mwco the measured mwco of the tightest membrane was 560 da fig 1 due to the size distribution of the pores pegs with lower molecular weight were also partially rejected other membranes from the same manufacturer tested in a previous study had a similar mwco in the range of 490 99 da average standard deviation however these membranes had a narrower pore size distribution shang et al 2017 commercially available ceramic membranes cannot reach very low mwco the lowest mwco for commercial ceramic membranes approximately 450 da seems to be provided by the membranes described by puhlfurb et al 2000 as a comparison polymeric nanofiltration membranes as described in section 1 cover the range of 200 400 da the mwco of the other membranes is shown in the supplementary data appendix 3 1 2 zeta potential of ceramic membrane at varying ionic strength the zeta potential of the membrane measured in the nacl solution was negative fig 2 it was dependent on the ph and the membrane had a less negative zeta potential at lower ph this behaviour is confirmed by literature for ti oh surface groups of tio2 van gestel et al 2002 the membrane s zeta potential was also dependent on the ionic strength of the solution at 0 01 m ionic strength the ceramic membrane had more negative zeta potential than at 0 1 m the decreasing zeta potential is according to the diffuse double layer theory dlvo theory although the zeta potential at 1m could not be measured it can be argued that the charge effect of the membrane would be even lower this hypothesis was confirmed by the calculated debye length which was small table 2 the effect of the lower zeta potential for the higher ionic strength feed solutions has also been observed bargeman et al 2015 during experiments at nearly saturated salt solutions counter ions present at higher concentrations can shield the potential of the electrical double layer of a surface where the zeta potential is measured and consequently decrease the effect of its charge at the electrokinetic slipping plane where the zeta potential is measured skluzacek et al 2007 3 2 character of nom the lc ocd analyses confirmed that the nom provided by vitens and pwn abstracted from iex brines was mostly humic substances between 82 percent and 89 percent of the cdoc table 3 this was expected because anionic exchange mainly removes nom by electrostatic interactions cornelissen et al 2008 and humic substances and building blocks are negatively charged huber et al 2011 minor hydrophobic interactions between nom and iex resin cornelissen et al 2008 might explain the presence of very low concentrations of low molecular weight neutrals that are according to huber et al 2011 uncharged humic substances are mostly 1000 da the smaller fractions building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals are in the range of 300 500 da and less than 350 da respectively huber et al 2011 3 3 rejection experiments 3 3 1 nom rejection at high ionic strength the experiments showed rejections of nom of at least 97 percent with one exception 94 percent even considering the relatively large mwco 560 da of our ceramic membrane other studies with polymeric nanofiltration have reported over 99 percent removal of humic acids but with smaller pore sizes between 200 and 400 da schippers et al 2005 jirícek et al 2015 in our experiments nom retention was independent of ionic strength the nacl na2so4 ionic strength ratio and the ph of the feed 4 8 the independence of ph and ionic strength shows that the zeta potential fig 2 and thus the effect of membrane charge had no influence on nom retention the mwco measurements in combination with the lc ocd measurements suggest that the removal of nom can be attributed mainly to steric hindrance fig 1 shows that the membrane was able to reject 90 percent of polymers larger than approximately 600 da therefore we can assume that humic substances 1000 da were completely rejected due to the pore size distribution of the membrane smaller nom fractions were also likely partially rejected the expected rejection of building blocks from 300 to 500 da approximated with the rejection of polymers of 400 da could have been nearly 73 percent the rejection of low molecular weight neutrals smaller than 350 da is expected to be much less because the rejection for peg molecules of 350 da and 200 da was only 65 percent and 25 percent respectively when these expected rejection percentages are applied to the nom fraction composition of table 3 the calculated composite rejection of nom is between 92 and 97 percent which is close to the measured nom rejection during the filtrations experiments additional tests with membranes with larger pore sizes and or brines from different iex treatment locations show that the used cut off measurement method predicted fairly well the retention of nom knowing its lc ocd profile supplementary data appendix for series 1 2 and 3 see table 1 the ph of the feed solutions was ph 8 which is close to the common ph of the waste brine during the first experiments of these series the ultrapure water permeability dropped from 13 to 14 5 lmhbar to 10 lmhbar and then stabilized at 8 lmhbar see e g fig 3 for series 2 the ultrapure water permeability was recovered to at least 8 lmhbar after each nom and salt tests using only forward flushing with demineralized water without the need of chemical cleaning or other fouling treatment these results suggest the presence of higher osmotic pressure difference between feed and permeate due to rejection of so4 2 or nom the trans membrane pressure during the experiments at ph 8 was between 3 and 7 bar and the provided and the flux was between 24 and 38 lmh as a comparison the flux of the polymeric membrane tested by vaudevire and koreman 2013 was approximately five times lower for iex brine with the same or lower doc concentrations and for a higher trans membrane pressure 6 10 bar 3 3 2 influence of nom on salt rejection in all the experiments there was a high passage of nacl indicated by a cl retention of less than 5 percent so4 2 was rejected to a larger extent compared to cl because so4 2 has a larger hydration size and energy tansel 2012 a lower diffusion coefficient meihong et al 2008 and a higher charge valence than cl in particular the higher so4 2 retention at 0 1m compared to 1m showed that charge had an influence at 0 1 m ionic strength where the membrane is expected to be negatively charged fig 2 in the mixed nacl na2so4 solutions without nom the retention of so4 2 was 36 percent at 0 1 m and only 9 percent at 1 m fig 4 lower so4 2 rejection at higher ionic strength was also observed in additional experiments with membranes with a higher mwco supplementary data appendix the negative membrane charge at 0 1 m was confirmed by the donnan effect because the retention of so4 2 in the mixed feed solution was higher compared to the pure so4 2 solution fig 4 according to the donnan effect when the membrane is negatively charged the na ions easily permeate the membrane for the permeate to be electrically neutral anions need to permeate as well the passage of monovalent cl is preferential because it is less affected by charge repulsion than the divalent so4 2 in this case the rejection of cl in mixed ions solution can even be negative as frequently observed in literature e g pérez gonzález et al 2015 bargeman et al 2015 the donnan effect was not evident in the experiments with the higher mwco probably due to the larger pore size supplementary data appendix the rejection of so4 2 improved between 2 and 3 times in the presence of nom additional tests with a membrane at higher mwco also showed this behaviour supplementary data appendix this has been observed before by e g tang et al 2007 tang et al 2007 argued that two mechanisms could be the cause of improved so4 2 retention in the presence of nom membrane pore size reduction by nom fouling and increased negative charge by nom in the proximity of the membrane in the experiments with nom the rejection of so4 2 was higher when the ph of the feed was decreased from 8 to 4 fig 4 humic substances are generally negatively charged at ph 8 and less charged at lower ph literature reports e g zero charge at ph 3 and less de souza and bragança 2018 bratskaya et al 2008 saito et al 2004 thus at ph 4 humic substances were nearly uncharged a lower charge density decreases the repulsion between nom and membrane wall and consequently enhances nom fouling tang et al 2007 and likely pore size reduction the permeability of the membrane was lower during the experiments at ph 4 compared to ph 8 as shown by fig 5 for the nom experiments at 0 1 m ionic strength the comparison between the experiments at different ph suggests that pore size reduction was the main mechanism involved in the improved so4 2 rejection in the presence of nom fouling might thus improve the steric rejection of membranes however other mechanisms linked to fouling can have a negative effect on rejection hoek and elimelech 2003 described how cake fouling can enhance concentration polarisation in polymeric membranes by modifying the cross flow characteristics of the filtration and by inhibiting back diffusion for ceramic ultrafiltration in the presence of nom shang et al 2014 observed a lower rejection of phosphate for a background solution with nacl compared to a background solution with cacl2 of the same ionic strength this was attributed to both zeta potential decrease of the nom and cake enhanced concentration polarisation due to fouling shang et al 2014 because ca2 can bind to the acid functional groups of nom li et al 2011 shao et al 2011 in spent iex brine however the cations are mainly na which can make ceramic nanofiltration suitable for brine treatment at high fluxes in our experiments nom had a positive effect on the removal of so4 2 presenting a rejection was between 20 and 80 percent the composition of the permeates of the experiments with nom are shown in the supplementary data appendix and the so4 2 concentrations were between 0 3 and 16 9 g l however the maximum allowed concentration of so4 2 for direct regenerant reuse of the nacl solution is not known yet the limit is influenced by e g the required removal of ions and nom for water treatment and the available iex resin sites influenced by biological resin binding and resin dosage which may vary at different locations and iex systems however a study on six spent brine treatment considered that the recovered regenerant was suitable for reuse in a scenario where the contamination of anions and trace pollutants was decreased by more than 90 percent of the original concentration vaudevire et al 2019 therefore to recover a clean nacl solution other techniques would need to improve the removal of so4 2 nevertheless the use of ceramic nanofiltration with a mwco of about 600 da has two advantages which might be beneficial for separation applications first nom can be concentrated and recovered at high fluxes second the nom free permeate can further be treated more efficiently e g by subsequent filtration with tighter polymeric membranes or by chemical precipitation of so4 2 these two options are currently under investigation 4 conclusions ceramic nanofiltration as a treatment for spent nom rich brine from iex was studied with the aim to reduce the volume of this waste and recover humic substances and or regeneration fluid the aim was in first instance to reject and concentrate nom the results demonstrated that a commercial ceramic membrane with loose pore sizes 600 da could reject more than 97 percent of the nom even at high ionic strength while the passage of nacl was 95 percent or more compared to polymeric nanofiltration the fouling was limited the zeta potential at high ionic strength was nearly zero and this suggests that the rejection mechanism of nom was steric hindrance while the steric separation of nom and inorganic anions could be achieved during loose nanofiltration the separation between na2so4 and nacl was more complicated specifically in relation to high ionic strength of the brine at low ionic strength separation between the divalent anion so4 2 and the monovalent ion cl was possible due to the high negative zeta potential divalent anions rejection and donnan effect at high ion strength the zeta potential of the membrane decreased and therefore also the rejection of so4 2 decreased in the presence of nom however it was observed that the rejection of so4 2 slightly increased probably due to pore size reduction by nom fouling to reuse the permeate as a regenerant solution the concentration of so4 2 should be further reduced polymeric nanofiltration and chemical so4 2 precipitation are currently under investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17888,in drinking water treatment natural organic matter nom is effectively removed from surface water using ion exchange iex a main drawback of using iex for nom removal is the production of spent iex regeneration brine a polluting waste that is expensive to discharge in this work we studied ceramic nanofiltration as a treatment for the spent nom rich brine with the aim to reduce the volume of this waste and to recycle salt compared to polymeric nanofiltration the fouling was limited when nom is rejected and concentrated a clean permeate with the regeneration salt nacl could be produced and reused in the iex regeneration process bench scale studies revealed that nom could be effectively separated from the nacl solution by steric effects however the separation of nacl from other salts present in the brine such as na2so4 was not sufficient for reuse purposes the low sulphate rejection was mainly due to the low zeta potential of the membrane at the high ionic strength of the brine the permeate of the ceramic nanofiltration should be treated further to obtain a sodium chloride quality that can be recycled as a regenerant solution for ion exchange further treatment steps will benefit from the removal of nom from the brine graphical abstract image 1 keywords nom rich brine ceramic nanofiltration ion exchange 1 introduction natural organic matter nom is one of the rising problems for drinking water treatment from surface waters and its removal at the beginning of a treatment train improves many downstream processes matilainen and sillanpää 2010 ion exchange iex can remove negatively charged nom including nom fractions that are not targeted by conventional coagulation grefte et al 2011 there are two main problems related to the use of iex for nom removal upstream the surface water treatment system 1 the conventional fixed iex bed configuration is not suitable for application at the beginning of the treatment and 2 regeneration of iex resin produces a polluting waste stream that can be difficult to manage and expensive to discharge the first problem is mainly linked to clogging by suspended solids however it can be solved by avoiding packed beds columns verdickt et al 2012 galjaard and koreman 2015 this was first achieved with the introduction of the magnetic ion exchange process miex over twenty years ago morran et al 1996 afterwards the miex system is scaled up and patented bourke et al 1999 more recently two new configurations have been introduced the suspended ion exchange six galjaard and koreman 2015 and fluidized iex fix cornelissen et al 2010 verdickt et al 2012 these two systems can also be used in the first stages of a surface water treatment train a recent review by levchuk et al 2018 showed that iex consistently removes nom from drinking water sources and that the unremoved nom generally between 10 and 40 percent is uncharged although the concentrations may differ all configurations produce high saline waste streams which consist of sodium chloride nacl sodium sulphate na2so4 sodium nitrate and humic and fulvic acids the second problem is the disposal of this waste stream which is still a drawback for the application of all iex processes in full scale water treatment verdickt 2012 in general saline waste streams are frequently produced in drinking water or industrial water production probably the largest amount is produced as a result of seawater desalination jones et al 2019 other sources of saline waste streams are inland desalinisation installations such as in the treatment of brackish groundwater with reverse osmosis and spent regenerants from iex processes conventional methods to dispose brines are landfill ground storage deep well injection evaporation ponds and discharge in the sewer or in coastal area in the sea brandt et al 2016 neale and schäfer 2009 panagopoulos et al 2019 however risks linked to landfill and ground storage include pollution of ground water and salt pollution of soil mohamed et al 2005 in addition discharge in the sea can have a negative impact on the sea ecology the brine has different salinity compared to the sea and may contain pollutants neale and schäfer 2009 in some cases zero liquid discharge technologies are used the goal of zero liquid discharge is to concentrate the dissolved salts as much as possible with technologies as reverse osmosis or electro dialysis subramani and jacangelo 2014 finally an evaporation and a crystallisation technology is used to obtain the dry salt the drawback of this technology is the energy use of the evaporation and crystallisation step panagopoulos et al 2019 to the authors knowledge there is few literature specific for waste management of brine from iex for nom removal for drinking water production the nom rich brine from several pilot and full scale plants with miex and conventional iex has also been reported to be disposed in conventional waste water treatment plants wwtp schippers et al 2005 amini et al 2015 arias paic et al 2016 for most of the treatment plants described by amini et al 2015 this is done after dilution and slow discharge however depending on e g the brine composition and volume discharge to a municipal wwtp is often not feasible biological treatment can be challenged by the presence of salts romero barranco et al 2001 moreover the specific nom in the iex brine is considered not readily biodegradable the external costs for brines treatment are high e g between 50 and 200 euro m3 in the european flanders region ceulemans et al 2015 in addition drinking water companies deal with restrictions regarding waste disposal meaning that brine treatment for reuse and recovery is of interest as a sustainable solution to brine management two approaches are used and or studied to reduce the volume of brine waste reusing the brine multiple times before disposal and treating the brine to recover the resources in the brine for instance the water the regeneration salts and the nom regeneration brine has been reused for e g iex full scale and pilots in the netherlands in the united kingdom in belgium and in the united states schippers et al 2005 vaudevire and koreman 2013 verdickt et al 2012 amini et al 2015 verdickt and schoutteten 2018 in the water treatment plants described by amini et al 2015 portions of low conductivity brine were recycled as raw drinking water and in some cases the brine was reused until a minimum conductivity was reached the conductivity in this case can be an indicator of the remaining concentration of nacl in the brine in the pilot plant from schippers et al 2005 the regenerant was reused three times before disposal first the resin bed was regenerated by a three times used solution and subsequently by a two and one time used solution and finally with fresh regenerant 10 percent nacl schippers et al 2005 for the pilot study of verdickt et al 2012 the waste brine was reused after flocculation with 6 g fecl3 l filter pressing and ph adjustment verdickt et al 2012 observed that the sulphate so4 2 accumulated in the reused brine reduced the removal of sulfates nitrates and alkalinity from the main process water but this did not affect the nom removal greatly although reusing the brine can reduce the waste volumes and the use of chemicals amini et al 2015 schippers et al 2005 verdickt et al 2012 this approach has as the main drawback that it creates a limit for the amount of resin per litre of water that can be regenerated verdickt and schoutteten 2018 the volume of the brine after regeneration is generally larger than the volume of the brine before regeneration because the resin also needs a rinse with clean water before returning in the ion exchanger if the resin cannot be rinsed properly excessive salt ends up in the treated water verdickt and schoutteten 2018 research on nom rich brine treatment has been focussed on treatment technologies that use polymeric membranes for pressure driven membranes the range of molecular weight cut off mwco was mostly in the nanofiltration range schippers et al 2005 vaudevire and koreman 2013 kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 leong et al 2015 the resources that could be recovered from the brine has mainly been the nom and the regeneration salt typically nacl concentrated nom has been suggested to be used in agriculture and food industry and the clean regeneration salt solution could be recycled in iex regeneration itself schippers et al 2005 leong et al 2015 vaudevire and koreman 2013 haddad et al 2019 vaudevire et al 2019 when brine is treated however other anions from the raw water could also accumulate in the nacl regenerant for instance in case of raw water containing so4 2 this anion has a high affinity for the iex resin and also accumulates in the regenerant brine therefore it would be beneficial if the membrane could combine rejection of so4 2 with nom rejection without limiting the passage of cl to the permeate polymeric nanofiltration for iex brine treatment removed nom by about 90 percent and more schippers et al 2005 kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 vaudevire and koreman 2013 jirícek et al 2015 ceulemans et al 2015 the passage of cl was high but some of the tightest membranes showed some cl rejection kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 leong et al 2015 where measured the rejection of so4 2 was between 75 and 90 percent vaudevire and koreman 2013 leong et al 2015 in case of direct brine reuse after treatment because of the presence of resin rinse water in the brines concentration should be included in the treatment therefore dynamic vapour decompression vaudevire and koreman 2013 and membrane distillation jirícek et al 2015 ceulemans et al 2015 have been considered after nanofiltration electrodialysis has also been studied as alternative treatment for nom rich iex brine kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 haddad et al 2019 vaudevire et al 2019 in particular vaudevire et al 2019 were interested in the recovery of concentrated nom and nacl water for regeneration reuse vaudevire et al 2019 piloted a two stage process monovalent selective electrodialysis with high removal of cl and low removal of nom and standard elecrodialysis with removal of inorganic content and conservation of nom according to haddad et al 2019 monovalent selective electrodialys is a promising option for nom iex brine treatment however an attention point of the technologies that use polymeric membranes is that their performances can decrease in the presence of nom e g due to fouling as shown by gryta et al 2001 lindstrand et al 2000 lee et al 2002 and hong and elimelech 1997 therefore additional technologies were used to counteract nom fouling in nom iex brine membrane treatment e g frequent feed forward flush during nanofiltration vaudevire and koreman 2013 and vibratory shear enhanced processing vsep leong et al 2015 vsep enhances cross flow using vibrations along the membrane surface this paper is focused on ceramic nanofiltration membranes because of their advantages over polymeric membranes e g higher fluxes and lower fouling characteristics hofs et al 2011 amta 2018 in addition ceramic membranes are supposed to be more durable than the polymeric membranes both mechanical strength and chemical resistance are better sondhi et al 2003 van der bruggen et al 2003 nom removed by iex is supposed to be mostly composed of humic substances grefte et al 2011 and therefore bench scale rejection tests were performed with ceramic membranes using nom that was isolated from iex brines from two different water treatment plants in addition the rejection of nacl and na2so4 in nom rich brine was studied waste brine can have varying ionic strengths depending on the iex regeneration system and the varying composition of the negative ions in the raw water to simulate this different ionic strengths and concentrations of nacl and na2so4 were used for testing in addition the influence of the zeta potential and the nom charge on the rejection of nom and salts from the simulated brines was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the membranes the commercial ceramic membranes inopor gmbh germany used in this study have a support layer of al2o3 and a separation layer of tio2 according to the manufacturer the mean pore size of the separation layer was 0 9 nm and the membrane porosity was 30 40 percent for the filtration tests we used a single channel tubular shaped membrane with an internal diameter of 7 mm and filtration area of 0 00163 m2 for the zeta potential tests see section 3 1 2 a flat disk membrane with the same characteristics as the tubular membrane was used the mwco of a membrane is the molecular weight of a compound that shows 90 percent retention to measure the mwco of the tubular ceramic membrane for the filtration tests a solution of demineralized water and a mixture of polyethylene glycol peg of five sizes i e 200 300 400 600 and 1000 da sigma aldrich germany was filtered this procedure was similar of those by shang et al 2017 and kramer et al 2019 the peg of each size had a concentration of 0 6 g l in the mixture the filtration was in cross flow mode and the concentrate was recirculated as feed after 60 70 and 80 min of filtration three permeate samples were collected temperature range 22 25 c trans membrane pressure range 2 9 3 1 bar flux range 41 43 lmh cross flow velocity 1 28 1 31 m s the feed was sampled twice during the collection of the first and third permeate after 0 45 μm filtration the samples were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography prominence shimadzu japan with a refractive index detector rid 20a shimadzu japan and two gel permeation chromatography columns for size exclusion 5 μm 30 å pss gmbh germany knowing the elution time of the single sizes of peg the signal of the refractive index detector for permeate and feed samples were compared to calculate the membrane retention of each peg size further a streaming potential measurement was used to determine the zeta potential of the membrane the zeta potential is the potential difference between the slippery plane of the electrical double layer that consists of the stern layer and the diffuse layer of a surface and the surrounding stable electrolyte and it gives an indication of the charge in the proximity of the membrane the zeta potential is thus frequently used as a tool to describe the charge of membranes hurwitz et al 2010 the measurement was performed on 0 02 m 0 01 m dices of a flat disk membrane the streaming potential was measured by an electrokinetic analyzer surpass anton paar austria with tangential mode an electrolyte solution passed through the channel formed by two membrane dices as explained by chang 2016 an electrolyte solution removes from the surface of the channel the ions with opposite charge compared to the charge of the surface of the channel causing a difference in the electrical potential between the two ends of the channel the measured streaming potential ζ was used by the electrokinetic analyzer to calculate the zeta potential according to the helmholtz smoluchowski relation christoforou et al 1985 with equation 1 1 ζ d i d p η ε r ε 0 l a where di dp streaming current coefficient l length of membrane dice a cross section area of the channel η viscosity ε 0 vacuum permittivity and ε r relative permittivity of the background solution nacl solutions of 0 01 m and 0 1 m were used to simulate the zeta potential for various brine conditions it was not possible to measure the zeta potential in a nacl solution of 1m because this was outside the measurement range of the instrument the ph was adjusted manually from 4 to 8 or 9 with a temperature range of 22 25 c the debye length also gives an indication of the effect of membrane charge the debye length is distance in the double layer where the surface electric potential of a charged surface is decreased by 1 e magnitude sillanpää and shestakova 2017 for different solution ion strengths 0 01 0 1 and 1 m we calculated the debye length κ 1 m in water at 20 c was calculated

samples were provided by two dutch water companies vitens and pwn both samples contained nom that has been recovered from spent iex regenerant brines and these samples contained mostly humic substances the nom of vitens had a groundwater origin while the nom of pwn had a surface water origin for the characterisation of nom the organic carbon of five nom fractions was measured by het water laboratorium the netherlands using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd as described in huber et al 2011 the five nom fractions i e biopolymers humic substances building blocks low molecular weight acids and low molecular weight neutrals form the chromatographic fractionation of organic carbon cdoc huber et al 2011 2 3 nom and salt tests rejection tests were performed with four membranes synthetic brines and waste brines from iex treatment of different locations this paper shows only the results of the membrane with the lowest mwco and the synthetic brines the other results are shown in the supplementary data appendix the synthetic feed solution for the vitens and pwn nom and salts filtration experiments was prepared by adding the nom into demineralized water with dissolved nacl and na2so4 sigma aldrich germany carl roth germany at varying concentrations composition set ionic strength and ph of the feed solutions used in the filtration experiments were divided into four series as summarized in table 1 the filtration was in cross flow mode and the concentrate was recirculated as feed the experiments could not be repeated using the same membrane instead for each experiment the permeate was sampled at three different times after the system was stable after 60 min of filtration three permeate samples were collected one after another for 30 min the feed was sampled twice during the collection of the first and third permeate temperature range 27 42 c with manual adjustment of a needle valve and pump speed the cross flow velocity and the flux were maintained constant during sampling and were 1 3 0 1 m s and 31 7 lmh respectively except for the 0 1 m experiment at ph 4 which had a flux of 20 lmh the cross flow velocity provided turbulent flow with a reynolds number of 9100 inside the tubular membrane directly after each experiment the membrane was flushed forward with demineralized feed water before each experiment after the last experiment of each series and after each experiment at ph 4 the ultrapure water permeability was measured temperature range 20 32 c trans membrane pressure of approximately 3 bar recirculation cross flow velocity of approximately 1 3 m s after the final permeability tests of series 1 series 2 series 3 and the experiments at ph 4 the membrane was cleaned with 2 h soak in a solution of 0 2 percent naocl nom was measured as dissolved organic carbon doc in the feed and permeate samples the samples were measured after 0 45 μm filtration by a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan the concentration of na so4 2 and cl in most of the feed and permeate samples were determined by ionic chromatography metrohm ag switserland anions and cations were identified based on their specific charge groups and interaction with two ion exchange columns metrosep c6 150 4 0 and a supp 150 4 0 metrohm ag switserland for some of the experiments only so4 2 was measured using a test cell kit spectroquant merck germany for both ion chromatography and kits the samples were filtrated with a 0 45 μm filter and diluted according to the measurement range of the instruments 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the ceramic nanofiltration membrane 3 1 1 mwco the measured mwco of the tightest membrane was 560 da fig 1 due to the size distribution of the pores pegs with lower molecular weight were also partially rejected other membranes from the same manufacturer tested in a previous study had a similar mwco in the range of 490 99 da average standard deviation however these membranes had a narrower pore size distribution shang et al 2017 commercially available ceramic membranes cannot reach very low mwco the lowest mwco for commercial ceramic membranes approximately 450 da seems to be provided by the membranes described by puhlfurb et al 2000 as a comparison polymeric nanofiltration membranes as described in section 1 cover the range of 200 400 da the mwco of the other membranes is shown in the supplementary data appendix 3 1 2 zeta potential of ceramic membrane at varying ionic strength the zeta potential of the membrane measured in the nacl solution was negative fig 2 it was dependent on the ph and the membrane had a less negative zeta potential at lower ph this behaviour is confirmed by literature for ti oh surface groups of tio2 van gestel et al 2002 the membrane s zeta potential was also dependent on the ionic strength of the solution at 0 01 m ionic strength the ceramic membrane had more negative zeta potential than at 0 1 m the decreasing zeta potential is according to the diffuse double layer theory dlvo theory although the zeta potential at 1m could not be measured it can be argued that the charge effect of the membrane would be even lower this hypothesis was confirmed by the calculated debye length which was small table 2 the effect of the lower zeta potential for the higher ionic strength feed solutions has also been observed bargeman et al 2015 during experiments at nearly saturated salt solutions counter ions present at higher concentrations can shield the potential of the electrical double layer of a surface where the zeta potential is measured and consequently decrease the effect of its charge at the electrokinetic slipping plane where the zeta potential is measured skluzacek et al 2007 3 2 character of nom the lc ocd analyses confirmed that the nom provided by vitens and pwn abstracted from iex brines was mostly humic substances between 82 percent and 89 percent of the cdoc table 3 this was expected because anionic exchange mainly removes nom by electrostatic interactions cornelissen et al 2008 and humic substances and building blocks are negatively charged huber et al 2011 minor hydrophobic interactions between nom and iex resin cornelissen et al 2008 might explain the presence of very low concentrations of low molecular weight neutrals that are according to huber et al 2011 uncharged humic substances are mostly 1000 da the smaller fractions building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals are in the range of 300 500 da and less than 350 da respectively huber et al 2011 3 3 rejection experiments 3 3 1 nom rejection at high ionic strength the experiments showed rejections of nom of at least 97 percent with one exception 94 percent even considering the relatively large mwco 560 da of our ceramic membrane other studies with polymeric nanofiltration have reported over 99 percent removal of humic acids but with smaller pore sizes between 200 and 400 da schippers et al 2005 jirícek et al 2015 in our experiments nom retention was independent of ionic strength the nacl na2so4 ionic strength ratio and the ph of the feed 4 8 the independence of ph and ionic strength shows that the zeta potential fig 2 and thus the effect of membrane charge had no influence on nom retention the mwco measurements in combination with the lc ocd measurements suggest that the removal of nom can be attributed mainly to steric hindrance fig 1 shows that the membrane was able to reject 90 percent of polymers larger than approximately 600 da therefore we can assume that humic substances 1000 da were completely rejected due to the pore size distribution of the membrane smaller nom fractions were also likely partially rejected the expected rejection of building blocks from 300 to 500 da approximated with the rejection of polymers of 400 da could have been nearly 73 percent the rejection of low molecular weight neutrals smaller than 350 da is expected to be much less because the rejection for peg molecules of 350 da and 200 da was only 65 percent and 25 percent respectively when these expected rejection percentages are applied to the nom fraction composition of table 3 the calculated composite rejection of nom is between 92 and 97 percent which is close to the measured nom rejection during the filtrations experiments additional tests with membranes with larger pore sizes and or brines from different iex treatment locations show that the used cut off measurement method predicted fairly well the retention of nom knowing its lc ocd profile supplementary data appendix for series 1 2 and 3 see table 1 the ph of the feed solutions was ph 8 which is close to the common ph of the waste brine during the first experiments of these series the ultrapure water permeability dropped from 13 to 14 5 lmhbar to 10 lmhbar and then stabilized at 8 lmhbar see e g fig 3 for series 2 the ultrapure water permeability was recovered to at least 8 lmhbar after each nom and salt tests using only forward flushing with demineralized water without the need of chemical cleaning or other fouling treatment these results suggest the presence of higher osmotic pressure difference between feed and permeate due to rejection of so4 2 or nom the trans membrane pressure during the experiments at ph 8 was between 3 and 7 bar and the provided and the flux was between 24 and 38 lmh as a comparison the flux of the polymeric membrane tested by vaudevire and koreman 2013 was approximately five times lower for iex brine with the same or lower doc concentrations and for a higher trans membrane pressure 6 10 bar 3 3 2 influence of nom on salt rejection in all the experiments there was a high passage of nacl indicated by a cl retention of less than 5 percent so4 2 was rejected to a larger extent compared to cl because so4 2 has a larger hydration size and energy tansel 2012 a lower diffusion coefficient meihong et al 2008 and a higher charge valence than cl in particular the higher so4 2 retention at 0 1m compared to 1m showed that charge had an influence at 0 1 m ionic strength where the membrane is expected to be negatively charged fig 2 in the mixed nacl na2so4 solutions without nom the retention of so4 2 was 36 percent at 0 1 m and only 9 percent at 1 m fig 4 lower so4 2 rejection at higher ionic strength was also observed in additional experiments with membranes with a higher mwco supplementary data appendix the negative membrane charge at 0 1 m was confirmed by the donnan effect because the retention of so4 2 in the mixed feed solution was higher compared to the pure so4 2 solution fig 4 according to the donnan effect when the membrane is negatively charged the na ions easily permeate the membrane for the permeate to be electrically neutral anions need to permeate as well the passage of monovalent cl is preferential because it is less affected by charge repulsion than the divalent so4 2 in this case the rejection of cl in mixed ions solution can even be negative as frequently observed in literature e g pérez gonzález et al 2015 bargeman et al 2015 the donnan effect was not evident in the experiments with the higher mwco probably due to the larger pore size supplementary data appendix the rejection of so4 2 improved between 2 and 3 times in the presence of nom additional tests with a membrane at higher mwco also showed this behaviour supplementary data appendix this has been observed before by e g tang et al 2007 tang et al 2007 argued that two mechanisms could be the cause of improved so4 2 retention in the presence of nom membrane pore size reduction by nom fouling and increased negative charge by nom in the proximity of the membrane in the experiments with nom the rejection of so4 2 was higher when the ph of the feed was decreased from 8 to 4 fig 4 humic substances are generally negatively charged at ph 8 and less charged at lower ph literature reports e g zero charge at ph 3 and less de souza and bragança 2018 bratskaya et al 2008 saito et al 2004 thus at ph 4 humic substances were nearly uncharged a lower charge density decreases the repulsion between nom and membrane wall and consequently enhances nom fouling tang et al 2007 and likely pore size reduction the permeability of the membrane was lower during the experiments at ph 4 compared to ph 8 as shown by fig 5 for the nom experiments at 0 1 m ionic strength the comparison between the experiments at different ph suggests that pore size reduction was the main mechanism involved in the improved so4 2 rejection in the presence of nom fouling might thus improve the steric rejection of membranes however other mechanisms linked to fouling can have a negative effect on rejection hoek and elimelech 2003 described how cake fouling can enhance concentration polarisation in polymeric membranes by modifying the cross flow characteristics of the filtration and by inhibiting back diffusion for ceramic ultrafiltration in the presence of nom shang et al 2014 observed a lower rejection of phosphate for a background solution with nacl compared to a background solution with cacl2 of the same ionic strength this was attributed to both zeta potential decrease of the nom and cake enhanced concentration polarisation due to fouling shang et al 2014 because ca2 can bind to the acid functional groups of nom li et al 2011 shao et al 2011 in spent iex brine however the cations are mainly na which can make ceramic nanofiltration suitable for brine treatment at high fluxes in our experiments nom had a positive effect on the removal of so4 2 presenting a rejection was between 20 and 80 percent the composition of the permeates of the experiments with nom are shown in the supplementary data appendix and the so4 2 concentrations were between 0 3 and 16 9 g l however the maximum allowed concentration of so4 2 for direct regenerant reuse of the nacl solution is not known yet the limit is influenced by e g the required removal of ions and nom for water treatment and the available iex resin sites influenced by biological resin binding and resin dosage which may vary at different locations and iex systems however a study on six spent brine treatment considered that the recovered regenerant was suitable for reuse in a scenario where the contamination of anions and trace pollutants was decreased by more than 90 percent of the original concentration vaudevire et al 2019 therefore to recover a clean nacl solution other techniques would need to improve the removal of so4 2 nevertheless the use of ceramic nanofiltration with a mwco of about 600 da has two advantages which might be beneficial for separation applications first nom can be concentrated and recovered at high fluxes second the nom free permeate can further be treated more efficiently e g by subsequent filtration with tighter polymeric membranes or by chemical precipitation of so4 2 these two options are currently under investigation 4 conclusions ceramic nanofiltration as a treatment for spent nom rich brine from iex was studied with the aim to reduce the volume of this waste and recover humic substances and or regeneration fluid the aim was in first instance to reject and concentrate nom the results demonstrated that a commercial ceramic membrane with loose pore sizes 600 da could reject more than 97 percent of the nom even at high ionic strength while the passage of nacl was 95 percent or more compared to polymeric nanofiltration the fouling was limited the zeta potential at high ionic strength was nearly zero and this suggests that the rejection mechanism of nom was steric hindrance while the steric separation of nom and inorganic anions could be achieved during loose nanofiltration the separation between na2so4 and nacl was more complicated specifically in relation to high ionic strength of the brine at low ionic strength separation between the divalent anion so4 2 and the monovalent ion cl was possible due to the high negative zeta potential divalent anions rejection and donnan effect at high ion strength the zeta potential of the membrane decreased and therefore also the rejection of so4 2 decreased in the presence of nom however it was observed that the rejection of so4 2 slightly increased probably due to pore size reduction by nom fouling to reuse the permeate as a regenerant solution the concentration of so4 2 should be further reduced polymeric nanofiltration and chemical so4 2 precipitation are currently under investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17889,groundwater is a vital source of freshwater in both urban and rural regions of the world however its injudicious abstraction and rapidly increasing contamination are posing a severe threat for sustainable water supply worldwide geographical information system gis based groundwater quality evaluation using groundwater quality index gqi has been proved to be a cost effective tool for assessing groundwater quality and its variability at a larger scale however the conventional gqi approach is unable to deal with uncertainties involved in the assessment of environmental problems to overcome this limitation a novel hybrid framework integrating fuzzy logic with the gis based gqi is proposed in this study for assessing groundwater quality and its spatial variability the proposed hybrid framework is demonstrated through a case study in a hard rock terrain of southern india using ten prominent groundwater quality parameters measured during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons two conventional gis based gqi models gqi 10 using all the ten groundwater quality parameters and gqi 7 using seven concerned critical groundwater quality parameters as well as hybrid fuzzy gis based gqi fgqi models using seven critical parameters were developed for the two seasons and the results were compared the trapezoidal membership functions classified the model input parameters into desirable acceptable and unacceptable classes based on the experts knowledge and water quality standards for drinking purposes the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in groundwater were found within the who desirable limits for drinking water throughout the year while the concentrations of seven parameters tds no3 n na cl k f and hardness exceed their permissible limits during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons a comparative evaluation of gqi models revealed that the fgqi model predicts groundwater quality better than the conventional gqi 10 and gqi 7 models gqi modeling results suggest that the groundwater of most of eastern and southern parts 60 in pre monsoon season 90 in post monsoon season of the study area is unsuitable for drinking further the groundwater quality deteriorates during post monsoon seasons compared to pre monsoon seasons which indicates an increased influx of contaminants from different industries mining areas waste disposal sites and agricultural fields during monsoon seasons this finding calls for the strict enforcement of regulations for proper handling of effluents from various contamination sources in the study area it is concluded that the fuzzy logic based decision making approach fgqi is more reliable and pragmatic for groundwater quality assessment and analysis at a larger scale it can serve as a useful tool for the water planners and decision makers in efficiently monitoring and managing groundwater quality at watershed or basin scales graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water quality fuzzy logic groundwater quality index

of ecosystems as well as economic growth and social development of our societies iah 2008 unesco 2015 increase in urbanization industrialization and agricultural activities have adversely affected the quality of both surface water and groundwater across the globe groundwater being more reliable source of freshwater is under enormous pressure to fulfill water demands for increasing global population especially in developing countries including india according to world bank 2010 india is the largest consumer of groundwater in the world with an estimated annual groundwater use of about 230 km3 india is facing groundwater crisis in the 21st century due to its overexploitation cgwb 2017 as well as growing contamination from point and non point sources of pollution soe 2009 contrary to surface water contamination groundwater contamination is difficult to detect because of being hidden and once contaminated the groundwater can remain so for decades or even for hundreds of years due to relatively slow movement of water and contaminants in the subsurface environment therefore there is an urgent need to develop efficient management strategies for the sustainable utilization and protection of vital groundwater resources to this end it is imperative to have a suitable tool technique for effective monitoring and assessment of groundwater quality at a larger scale which in turn can serve as an effective tool for improved management and development of vital groundwater resources one possible management alternative is through the development of water quality indices to provide a comprehensive assessment of surface water and groundwater quality water quality indices wqi is a simple mathematical tool that can provide a distinct picture of overall water quality status over an area based on important water quality parameters abbasi and abbasi 2012 the wqi based maps are easily understandable and aid in creating public awareness on groundwater surface water pollution as well as in enforcing regulations for proper managements of wastes released from various sources and imposing restrictions on groundwater extraction which in turn can help formulate effective management strategies for protecting aquifers from contamination e g saeedi et al 2010 vadiati et al 2016 in past few decades the wqi approach was followed by many researchers worldwide e g bolton et al 1978 babiker et al 2007 nasiri et al 2007 machiwal et al 2011 vicente et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 jasmin and mallikarjuna 2014 boateng et al 2016 selvaganapathi et al 2017 lumb et al 2011 provided a comprehensive review on the evolution of wqi over the years and highlighted major limitations embedded in the process of index development and provided recommendations to overcome the drawbacks many of the past researches on wqi focused particularly on surface water with very limited number of studies dealing with groundwater it is important to mention that biological properties bacteria algae etc and physico chemical properties temperature turbidity color dissolved oxygen ph etc are important parameters for surface water quality evaluation whereas hydro chemical properties major cations and anions are important parameters for groundwater quality evaluation vadiati et al 2016 thus a variety of water quality parameters are involved in the evaluation of groundwater quality and data constraints often impede the process of groundwater quality index gqi development probably tiwari and mishra 1985 were the first to formulate a methodology for drinking water suitability using surface water quality index lumb et al 2011 vadiati et al 2016 adopting their procedure several studies were carried out dealing with gqi development in different parts of the world lumb et al 2011 in the recent past several researchers have also employed gis based gqi to evaluate groundwater quality and analyze spatial variability of groundwater quality parameters babiker et al 2007 was pioneer in proposing the development of gis based gqi using a statistical procedure to calculate an index based on the world health organization who standards for drinking water this methodology has been widely employed by subsequent researchers to assess groundwater quality and its spatial variability e g nas and ali 2010 machiwal et al 2011 el fadel et al 2014 vadiati et al 2016 apart from analyzing the drinking water suitability using gqi a few studies have also been carried out for assessing irrigation water suitability using gqi for example soltan 1999 evaluated groundwater quality of artesian wells in egypt for irrigation water suitability based on gqi whereas stigter et al 2006 used groundwater gqi as an assessment tool for the agricultural regions of portugal groundwater quality index gqi is easy to calculate using the threshold values of different groundwater quality parameters and the results are very convenient to interpret however one of the major issues with the traditional wqis for both surface water and groundwater is that they fail to deal with the uncertainty and subjectivity that are inherent in the assessment of environmental problems silvert 2000 especially while classifying water quality near the parameter threshold boundary chang et al 2001 to overcome this subjectivity and to incorporate environmental uncertainty in the groundwater quality evaluation process the application of artificial intelligence ai based computational methods are highly recommended maiti et al 2013 araghinejad 2013 patki et al 2015 bagherzadeh et al 2018 salari et al 2018 the available ai methods can be classified into two broad categories a symbolic ai and b computational ai the former mainly deals with the development of knowledge based system while the latter deals with the development of behavior based system chau 2006 the computational ai includes neural networks genetic algorithm fuzzy systems etc among various computational ai methods fuzzy logic fl is extensively used to deal with complex water related environmental problems mckone and deshpande 2005 ghosh and mujumdar 2006 chau 2006 mohebbi tafreshi et al 2018 owing to its capability to deal with non linearity and uncertainty involved in environmental systems chanapathi et al 2019 in addition to this fl serves as an effective tool for conveying the results to the public and beneficiaries in a much understandable linguistic format li et al 2018 the fuzzy logic was introduced by zadeh 1965 and is based on fuzzy set theory in contrast to the classical mathematics which is based on the crisp set theory ocampo duque et al 2006 first used fuzzy inference system fis to evaluate river water quality in spain and identified the fuzzy wqi to be more robust compared to the traditional wqi a few studies have used fuzzy logic to evaluate groundwater quality dahiya et al 2007 jinturkar et al 2010 hosseini moghari et al 2015 mohamed et al 2019 and it has been recommended for the evaluation of complex water quality problems all of these studies implemented fuzzy logic based gqi for point based groundwater samples collected from open bore wells dahiya et al 2007 hosseini moghari et al 2015 gorai et al 2016 vadiati et al 2016 agoubi et al 2016 mohamed et al 2019 or from hand pumps jinturkar et al 2010 and did not map the spatial variation of groundwater quality furthermore a general difficulty has been reported in validating fuzzy based gqi owing to the linguistic subjectivity involved in the construction of fuzzy based indices ocampo duque et al 2013 it is evident from the review of literature presented above that the application of fuzzy logic for developing gis based gqi is in its infancy and little attention has been given to employ fuzzy logic to address the non linearity and uncertainty involved in the spatial mapping of gqi machiwal et al 2018 also the issue involved in the validation of fuzzy based gqi has not been addressed to date considering these research gaps and the need for an efficient methodology for evaluating groundwater quality at larger scales the goal of this study is to develop a novel hybrid framework by integrating fuzzy logic with the gis based gqi to assess groundwater quality and its spatial variability at larger scales this hybrid framework is named fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index henceforth called fgqi and its efficacy and applicability are demonstrated through a case study in a hard rock terrain of tamil nadu state south india also for the first time the issue concerning validation of the developed fgqi has been addressed in this study two recent studies conducted in a few parts of tiruchirappalli district selvakumar et al 2017 rajendran et al 2019 deal with the basic geochemical analysis of groundwater at limited locations using statistical and or graphical methods which also indicate the necessity for an efficient methodology to assess groundwater quality at a larger scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of study area 2 1 1 location and climate the study area selected for this study is tiruchirappalli district also known as trichy which is situated in the central position of tamil nadu state in the southern part of india fig 1 it is located between 10 16 and 11 22 north latitude and 78 15 and 79 16 east longitude and encompasses an area of approximately 4403 83 km2 it is sub divided into 14 administrative units known as blocks namely anthanallur lalgudi manachanallur manapparai manikandam marungapuri musiri pullambadi tattayangarpettai tiruverumbur thottiyam thuraiyur uppliyapuram and vaiyampatti fig 1 the main source of surface water is the cauvery river and its tributaries ayyar uppar and koraiyar rivers which flow through the center of the study area the area is characterized by tropical wet and dry climate with hot and dry summer from march to may normal to moderate monsoon rainfall from june to december followed by mild cold and moist winter during january and february the monsoon season in the study area occurs in two phases june to september from the southwest monsoon and october to december from the northeast monsoon with the former contributing 32 to the annual rainfall and the latter being the major rainy season contributing 48 owing to the cauvery river dispute the surface water reserves are not sufficient during the non monsoon season resulting in heavy dependency on groundwater reserves for drinking and irrigation purposes this situation calls for proper groundwater management in the river basin 2 1 2 hydrogeology and land characteristics the study area predominantly consists of three geological groups i the bhavani group of formations comprising of fissile hornblende gneiss of archaean age in the north covering 30 of the study area ii the migmatite complexes made up of hornblende biotite gneiss of archaean age extending in the south occupying about 37 of the study area and iii the quaternary formations of alluvium belonging to the cainozoic age underlying the cauvery river in the central region covering 10 of the area fig s1 additionally patches of limestone of the trichinopoly group and sandstone of the gondwana group of mesozoic age are confined to the east of the study area jenifer and jha 2017 a massive stretch of charnockite of charnockite group is found in the extreme north and south of the study area granite prevailing in the central and western portions of the study area is mostly hard and easily weathered the anorthosite intrusive igneous rocks of the sathayamangalam group are exposed in the southwestern part of the study area are mainly comprised of calcium rich coarse crystals the hard rocks in the study area possess negligible primary porosity but are rendered porous and permeable due to secondary porosity by fracturing and weathering groundwater yields from granite and gneiss formation are better than charnockite formations shale sandstone clay and alluvium act as unconfined or leaky confined aquifers in some parts of the study area the aquifer is highly heterogeneous due to changes in the lithology texture and structural features within a short span of distance groundwater in the study area is usually found at depths of 2 20 m below the ground in the weathered formations unconfined aquifers and it is tapped mostly through dug wells deeper fractured formations leaky confined or confined aquifers occur at depths of 20 40 m which are tapped through bore wells or dug cum bore wells cgwb 2008 the land use land cover map of the study area is shown in fig 2 a major portion of the study area 66 53 has agricultural land wherein crops like paddy cereals fruits vegetables oil seeds and fiber crops such as cotton sugarcane and pulses are grown fallow land covers 11 45 forest 9 98 water bodies 6 34 and settlement covers 3 62 mining activities are limited to about 2 of the study area mostly concentrated near the cauvery river where sand and sandstone mining is prevalent a few mining sites are also located in the eastern and southern parts of the study area where predominantly limestone is excavated on the other hand a variety of industries and some gasoline stations are present in different parts of the study area fig 2 b with the cluster of industries located in the central portion of the study area these industries and gasoline stations coupled with mining and agricultural activities constitute potential sources of contamination for surface water bodies and groundwater jenifer 2018 jenifer and jha 2018 2 1 3 data acquisition for the groundwater quality assessment of the unconfined aquifer system underlying the study area groundwater quality data of 24 observation wells during pre monsoon season july 2013 and 37 observation wells during post monsoon season january 2014 fig 1 were obtained from institute of water studies chennai tamil nadu both the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons groundwater quality data were used in this study to investigate seasonal variation in the groundwater quality and the influence of the rainfall on the quality of groundwater the obtained groundwater quality parameters consisted of major anions and cations including total dissolved solids tds nitrate nitrogen no3 n calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na chloride cl potassium k fluoride f sulphate so4 2 and hardness measured as caco3 these ten groundwater quality parameters were employed for developing gqi for assessing the suitability of groundwater for drinking water supply in the study area in this study only prominent water quality parameters were considered based on their importance in affecting groundwater quality as reported in the earlier studies conducted in some parts of tiruchirappalli district e g jameel and sirajudeen 2006 venkatesan et al 2013 selvakumar et al 2017 rajendran et al 2019 and their impacts on human health also another reason for considering only important water quality parameters is due to the fact that the inclusion of more parameters less prominent water quality parameters in the groundwater quality model unnecessarily increases uncertainty thus the consideration of less important unimportant water quality parameters is neither technically sound nor practically useful significant 2 2 development of gis based groundwater quality index gqi models the hybrid framework adopted in this study for developing fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index fgqi is illustrated in fig 3 the complete procedure can be segregated into three major steps viz geostatistical analysis development of traditional gis based gqi models and development of fuzzy gis based gqi fgqi models 2 2 1 geostatistical analysis geostatistical analysis especially spatial interpolation of point data is the first and foremost step for developing gqi because further model development depends heavily on it since it is nearly impossible to obtain field data for each point throughout the study area spatial interpolation techniques were used to estimate the data at un sampled points using the data from sampled points inverse distance weighting idw kriging and co kriging are most widely used spatial interpolation methods idw is a deterministic interpolation technique that estimates value at unmeasured points on the basis of its closeness to the measured points on other hand kriging is a geostatistical interpolation technique which uses spatial statistics of the measured points to estimate values at unmeasured points whereas co kriging is an extension of kriging in which an auxiliary variable is used to help the kriging estimator the auxiliary variable is the one which is highly correlated with the primary variable kriging co kriging performs better than the idw method when the data are near normally distributed kerry and oliver 2007a and have no extreme values kerry and oliver 2007b among the kriging and co kriging methods co kriging is found to be superior when the correlation coefficient between the primary and auxiliary variable is more than 0 5 yates and warrick 1987 tables s1 and s2 show correlation between all the ten groundwater quality parameters during pre monsoon season and post monsoon season respectively finally groundwater quality parameters following near normal distribution were interpolated by employing kriging co kriging considering correlation coefficient values of the parameters tables s1 and s2 the choice between kriging and co kriging was finally decided based on the least value of root mean square error rmse on the other hand the groundwater quality parameters having no near normal distribution were interpolated using idw which efficiently captures the extreme values that are most likely in case of groundwater quality data mueller et al 2004 thus the interpolation methods used to prepare concentration maps of individual groundwater quality parameters for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are shown in table 1 using suitable interpolation methods concentration maps of 50 m 50 m pixel size were prepared using gis for all the groundwater quality parameters for both the seasons and a summary of the basic statistics of the concentrations of individual parameters during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons is presented in table 1 further these maps were used for analyzing spatial variability of the concentration of individual groundwater quality parameters 2 2 2 traditional gis based groundwater quality index gqi models the concentration maps were employed to compute gis based gqi following the procedure proposed by babiker et al 2007 firstly the concentration maps of each parameter were used to create normalized maps also known as concentration index maps ci by comparing the parameter concentration value x with its standard threshold t using eqn 1 the who standards for drinking water who 2004 and the indian standards is for drinking water provided by the bureau of indian standards bis 2012 were used as shown in table 1 thereafter the rank r maps of all the parameters were generated using eqn 2 1 c i x t x t 2 r 0 5 c i 2 4 5 c i 5 3 w m e a n r f o r t d s c a 2 m g 2 s o 4 2 k f h a r d n e s s m e a n r 2 f o r n o 3 n n a c l 4 g q i 100 r 1 w 1 r 2 w 2 r n w n n furthermore the weights w for each parameter were determined as mean of the respective rank values however as suggested by babiker et al 2007 the potential parameters were given higher weights as shown in eqn 3 in this study nitrate nitrogen no3 n sodium na and chloride cl were identified as potential health risk parameters for the study area excess levels of nitrate are known to cause blue baby syndrome whereas excess chloride levels are known to increase colon cancer risk aieta and berg 1986 although higher sodium levels do not pose a serious threat to the human health it creates a risk to the people under low sodium diet which is usually recommended for hypertension high blood pressure and congestive heart failure patients finally the gqi values were calculated using eqn 4 which lie between 0 and 100 two traditional conventional gqi models of the study area for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons were prepared using all the ten groundwater quality parameters and are denoted as gqi 10 models using total dissolved solids tds nitrate nitrogen no3 n calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na chloride cl potassium k fluoride f sulphate so4 2 and hardness measured as caco3 similarly two more traditional gqi maps were prepared for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons using only the parameters whose concentration values exceed their permissible limits henceforth called concerned critical parameters in this study and are denoted as gqi 7 models using seven concerned critical parameters namely total dissolved solids tds nitrate nitrogen no3 n sodium na chloride cl potassium k fluoride f and hardness the computed index values in each case were categorized into suitable classes to generate four traditional gqi maps based on the classification scheme proposed by babiker et al 2007 2 2 3 fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index fgqi model since its inception by zadeh 1965 fuzzy logic fl has helped researchers to induce human knowledge and experience to deal with the uncertainty and vagueness involved while assessing natural systems fuzzy logic maps input to output using fuzzy inference system fis that combines fl and experts knowledge via four main components viz fuzzification fuzzy inference rules aggregation and defuzzification two most important fuzzy inference systems are mamdani fis mamdani 1976 and sugeno fis sugeno 1985 mamdani fis is most widely used for environmental applications due to its simplicity and practical application icaga 2007 scannapieco et al 2012 and it has been employed in this study for the development of fgqi 2 2 3 1 fuzzification the fuzzification of the input and output is done by constructing membership functions mfs membership function mf is a curve which shows the degree of belongingness membership value of the data to a particular class the membership value was determined using experts knowledge and drinking water quality standards of who who 2004 and bis bis 2012 as shown in table 1 and s3 fig 4 a h show the chosen mfs for the input and output variables trapezoidal mfs were adopted in this study as they are the most commonly used functions in many studies kosko 1993 the inputs to the fis were the concentration maps of the concerned parameters similar to the traditional gqi 7 map so as to reduce the uncertainty the trapezoidal membership functions of all the seven groundwater quality parameters and fgqi were constructed using following equation hosseini moghari et al 2015 5 f x a b c d 0 x a o r d x a x a b a x b 1 b x c d x d c c x d where x is the parameter to be fuzzified and a b c and d are the linguistic variables used to divide the parameters into different classes table s4 the input parameters were divided into three classes desirable concentration value less than or equal to the desirable limit acceptable concentration value between desirable and permissible limits and unacceptable concentration value more than the permissible limit based on the who and bis standards for drinking water fig 4 a g and table s4 the outputs values of fgqi were classified into five classes namely unacceptable poor moderate good and excellent fig 4 h and table s5 2 2 3 2 fuzzy inference rules the fuzzy inference rules are in the form of if then format they map the input class categories to the output class categories the if part is called an antecedent and the then part is called a consequent for example if the concentration of a parameter e g tds is desirable then the water quality fgqi is excellent fuzzy rules for the study area were designed by using experts knowledge and carefully considering the parameters having potential health risk i e no3 n cl and na an outline showing the design of fuzzy inference rules is depicted in fig 5 the main premise while designing the fuzzy inference rules was even if one water quality parameter exceeds the permissible limit for drinking water then the water is not suitable for direct consumption by the people all the fuzzy inference rules were designed keeping this main premise in mind moreover while designing the fuzzy inference rules three potential health risk parameters no3 n cl and na were also taken into special consideration this main premise ensures the practicality of the developed water quality index in judging drinking water suitability this is important to emphasize here as this knowledge helps to inculcate human understanding in the fuzzy logic assessment of groundwater quality 2 2 3 3 aggregation of fuzzy rules once the fuzzy inference rules were designed the next step was combining all the designed fuzzy inference rules the aggregation of the consequent part of the fuzzy inference rules is needed to calculate a single fuzzy output which is fgqi in this study maximum method ross 2004 was used as an aggregation procedure in this study which applies union operation on all the truncated output fuzzy sets 2 2 3 4 defuzzification finally defuzzifying the aggregated output value was carried out to convert the fuzzy sets to a numeric value the final numeric score obtained is fuzzy groundwater quality index fgqi the most commonly used centroid of area coa method ross 2004 was employed for defuzzification of the fuzzy sets the detailed description of all the fuzzy set operations and fis can be found in ross 2004 all the fl operations were carried out in matlab r2014a mathworks 2014 whereas the gis operations were carried out in arcgis 10 2 2 esri 2014 thus fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index fgqi maps of the study area were prepared for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons using seven concerned parameters 2 3 validation of the developed gqi models for the first time the validation of fgqi has been attempted in this study because it is a difficult task it is important to emphasize that fgqi is developed based on linguistic terminology in the form of fuzzy rules equations are only used to map the parameters which reduce the non linearity of the fuzzy model the best method to validate an index is to use impact factors or indicators ocampo duque et al 2006 however relating an impact factor to groundwater quality is furthermore challenging and it is not possible in some situations in this study the fgqi and traditional gqi models developed for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons were validated qualitatively using land use land cover and industry location maps fig 2 a and b as well as quantitatively using site specific groundwater quality data obtained from the analysis of groundwater samples collected from different observation wells over the study area these water quality data indicate the status of groundwater quality with minimum uncertainty since unacceptable concentration of even one parameter renders the water unsuitable for drinking and other domestic proposes the score of a given groundwater quality index was examined for the observation well with respect to its number of unsafe parameters parameters exceeding their acceptable permissible limits 3 results and discussion 3 1 variability of groundwater quality parameter concentration in the study area the concentration maps created using spatial interpolation of the point values of the concentrations of ten groundwater quality parameters for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are shown in fig 6 a and b the concentration maps are categorized into three classes on the basis of the desirable and permissible limits of who and bis for drinking water table s3 as it can be seen from fig 6 a and b that calcium magnesium and sulphate are the safe parameters as they are well within the desirable limits throughout the study area during both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons however the remaining 7 parameters i e tds no3 n na cl k f and hardness exceed their permissible limits in some parts of the study area and hence they are considered as critical concerned parameters for assessing the suitability of groundwater for drinking purpose the spatial variability of groundwater quality during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons is discussed in the subsequent sub sections 3 1 1 concentration maps of groundwater quality parameters for the pre monsoon season it is apparent from fig 6 a that in the pre monsoon season groundwater in the unconfined aquifer underlying the south western part of the study area vaiyampatti block has unacceptable concentrations of all the critical concerned groundwater quality parameters except potassium this is mainly due to the fact that vaiyampatti block lies at the downstream end of the cauvery river and a significant amount of surface pollutants from the upstream portion are deposited in this block which gradually percolate into the unconfined aquifer the concentration of tds in groundwater ranges from 157 to 3202 mg l table 1 and exceeds its permissible limit for drinking in 5 of the study area further the no3 n concentration exceeds its permissible limit in 8 of the study area which is mainly due to anthropogenic sources like chemical fertilizer application in the agricultural fields other non agricultural sources of nitrate include seepage from septic tanks and cesspools heap of cattle dung etc less than 2 of the area has unacceptable concentration of sodium in groundwater in vaiyampatti block the chloride concentration in groundwater is relatively higher in parts of lalgudi thiruverumbur thottiyam and vaiyampatti blocks the major source of chloride is the effluent molasses from paper and pulp industries fig 2 b potassium concentration in the groundwater exceeds the who prescribed limit of 12 mg l in 10 of the study area the increase in fluoride concentration is mainly due to the geogenic source i e dissolution of natural minerals like apatite biotite cryolite fluorite etc from the igneous rocks fig 6 a shows that the total hardness of groundwater is relatively high in the study area which can be attributed to considerable limestone deposits in this region 3 1 2 concentration maps of groundwater quality parameters for the post monsoon season although some similar patterns of pre monsoon can be observed in the post monsoon season the concentrations of groundwater quality parameters significantly differ in the post monsoon season fig 6 b the tds concentration in groundwater during the post monsoon season ranges from 190 to 3028 mg l the area under the desirable concentration region has considerably decreased from 24 6 in the pre monsoon season to 7 37 in the post monsoon season in case of no3 n concentration in the area unacceptable groundwater quality region has reduced to 5 7 in the post monsoon season due to the dilution of pollutant in groundwater during monsoon season fig 6 b reveals that the concentrations of calcium magnesium and sulphate are within their prescribed limits in both the seasons unacceptable concentration of sodium is found in some parts of marungapuri block in the post monsoon season in addition to vaiyampatti block which suffers from high sodium concentration in the pre monsoon season as well although only 5 of the study area shows unacceptable chloride concentration in groundwater during the post monsoon season the area under desirable groundwater quality region has reduced from 44 41 in the pre monsoon season to 27 6 in the post monsoon season the spatial distribution of potassium concentration in groundwater shows that the unacceptable concentration occurs in many blocks viz manapparai manachanallur musiri vaiyampatti lalgudi and pullambadi covering 13 of the study area furthermore the concentration of fluoride in groundwater exceeds its prescribed limit in less than 1 of the study area which is confined to the southernmost part of marungapuri block the total hardness of groundwater ranging between 95 and 880 mg l table 1 in the pre monsoon has increased drastically to 150 1500 mg l in the postmonsoon season the area under the unacceptable level of hardness increased to 7 73 in the post monsoon season compared to the pre monsoon season generally the dilution of pollutants occurs during the rainy monsoon season and hence groundwater quality is expected to improve in the post monsoon season as compared to the pre monsoon season however the spatial variability of the concentrations of different groundwater quality parameters in the study area during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons clearly reveals that the effect of pollutant dilution is very less in the study area consequently unlike common observations in many past studies on groundwater quality evaluation the groundwater quality deteriorates in the post monsoon season thereby indicating that the concentration of groundwater quality parameters in the study area is significantly increased by the recharge during the rainy monsoon season 3 2 traditional gis based gwqi maps the gqi 10 and gqi 7 maps for the pre monsoon season are shown in fig 7 a and fig 7 b respectively the values of gqi 10 vary from 65 15 to 89 58 with a mean value of 76 33 table 2 according to the values of indices obtained the gqi 10 map of the study area was classified into two classes medium quality gqi 10 60 80 and high quality gqi 10 80 for drinking water babiker et al 2007 with the northern portion of the study area belonging to the high quality groundwater fig 7 a the gqi 7 map fig 7 b significantly differs from the gqi 10 map with gqi 7 values always lower than gqi 10 values the gqi 7 values range from 52 84 to 86 73 with a mean value of 68 26 table 2 the southwest vaiyampatti block eastern lalgudi block and southeast thiruverumbur block parts of the study area have lower quality gqi 7 60 groundwater for drinking however the northwest part of the study area western portion of uppliyapuram block has high quality groundwater while the central portion of the study area has medium quality groundwater for the drinking purpose fig 7 b moreover gqi 10 and gqi 7 maps of the study area for the post monsoon season are shown in fig 7 d and e the gqi 10 values range from 61 90 to 88 48 with a mean of 73 05 table 2 the classification of gqi 10 map for the post monsoon season is similar to that of the pre monsoon season and only the northern part of the study area has high quality groundwater fig 7 d the gqi 7 map fig 7 e for the post monsoon season differs largely compared to the gqi 10 map with the gqi 7 values varying from 48 95 to 85 28 mean 63 92 table 2 it evident that the southwest vaiyampatti block southern manapparai block and southern east thiruverumbur block parts of the study area have low quality groundwater fig 7 e but the northern part uppliyapuram block has high quality groundwater based on the above discussion it is emphasized that the gqi 7 values are always lower than gqi 10 values and the gqi 7 map is more practical and reliable than the gqi 10 map the gqi 7 is able to successfully map the polluted blocks vaiyampatti lalgudi thiruverumbur and manapparai blocks under the low quality category while the gqi 10 maps them under medium quality category further as gqi 10 uses more number of water quality parameters compared to gqi 7 it introduces more uncertainty and high computation demand 3 3 fuzzy gis based gqi fgqi maps fuzzy logic was applied to the gis based concentration maps for the concerned parameters to generate fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index fgqi maps of the study area for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons fig 7 c and f the fgqi was developed bearing in mind the inherent uncertainty associated with environmental systems the fgqi values for the pre monsoon season range from 12 18 to 86 42 with a mean of 59 80 table 2 based on which fgqi map was prepared as shown in fig 7 c it is apparent from this figure that except the northern uppliyapuram block and central thuraiyur and musiri blocks parts of the study area other parts of the area has low quality fgqi 60 groundwater for drinking extremely low values of fgqi 20 can be seen in the southwest part of the study area fig 7 c on the other hand the fgqi values for the post monsoon season vary from 13 81 to 86 42 with a mean of 55 22 table 2 based on the fgqi most of the regions of the study area fall under the category of low quality fgqi 60 groundwater in the post monsoon season whereas the northern part of the study area falls under the category of high quality fgqi 80 groundwater fig 7 f a few locations scattered patches in the central and southern parts of the study area have medium quality 60 fgqi 80 groundwater for drinking 3 4 comparison of traditional and fuzzy gis based gwqi models and validation a comparative evaluation of the gqi 10 gqi 7 and fgqi models was performed to examine the relative performance of these models in predicting actual groundwater quality status during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in the study area as illustrated in fig 8 a and b it is clear from these figures that the gqi 10 values are always higher than gqi 7 values this is expected as the safe parameters increase the values of gqi further for most of the observation wells the fgqi values are much lower than gqi 10 and gqi 7 values however for the observation wells having concentrations of all the groundwater quality parameters much lower than their permissible limits the fgqi values are almost equal to or more than the values of gqi 10 and gqi 7 as evident in case of observation well numbers 6 10 15 and 20 in the pre monsoon season fig 8 a as well as observation well numbers 3 5 19 31 and 33 in the post monsoon season fig 8 b moreover the validation of traditional and fuzzy gis based gwqi models for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons is illustrated in fig 8 c and d during the pre monsoon season it is obvious from fig 8 c that the fgqi model predicts low quality gwqi 60 groundwater for drinking when the number of critical parameters is more than one whereas the gqi 10 and gqi 7 models predict medium quality 60 gwqi 80 groundwater for the same observation wells similar trend can be seen for the post monsoon season as well fig 8 d these findings along with the findings of qualitative validation using land use land cover and industry location maps clearly highlight the superiority of fgqi models and emphasize the need for using fuzzy logic in developing gis based groundwater quality models for assessing groundwater quality at larger scales the fgqi model evidently predicts groundwater drinking quality status as per the practical logic and correctly indicate the safe groundwater as high quality i e it can be directly consumed for drinking and unsafe groundwater as low quality i e no direct consumption or domestic use one of the important findings while comparing the developed groundwater quality indices is that the post monsoon groundwater quality is lower than the pre monsoon groundwater quality thereby indicating that the dilution effect in the monsoon season is not prevalent in the study area the groundwater quality of the northern part of the study area which is occupied by mostly hilly forest is almost the same during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in the remaining parts of the study area the groundwater quality deteriorates in the monsoon post monsoon season which is attributed to the improper management of effluents from industrial mining and waste dumping areas as well as leaching of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural fields during monsoon seasons there is a large decrease in fgqi and gqi values in the southwest part of the study area in the post monsoon season fig 7 d f this may be due to chemical iron and steel industries located in this part of the study area fig 2 b moreover the central and southern parts of the study area seem to have lower fgqi and gqi values in the post monsoon season because of nitrate and potassium pollution in the monsoon season due to agricultural activities this calls for proper management of solid and liquid wastes and efficient application of fertilizers and pesticides in the study area 4 conclusions in this paper a novel hybrid framework considering fuzzy logic and gis based groundwater quality index gqi is proposed to evaluate and analyze groundwater quality at larger scales the proposed hybrid approach is named fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index henceforth denoted as fgqi and it is demonstrated through a case study in an unconfined aquifer system of southern india using salient groundwater quality parameters measured at multiple sites during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons fuzzy logic was applied to deal with non linearity and uncertainty inherent in natural environmental systems traditional gis based groundwater quality index gqi models and hybrid gis based gqi models using fuzzy logic were developed for both the seasons following the drinking water guidelines of world health organization who 2004 and bureau of indian standards bis 2012 for the first time the developed gqi models were rigorously evaluated in this study through inter comparison and validation initially a geostatistical analysis was carried out to prepare concentration maps of different groundwater quality parameters and analyze their spatial and seasonal variability basic statistical analysis revealed that ca2 mg2 and so4 2 are safe parameters concentration values well within the who desirable limits for drinking water during both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons however the remaining seven parameters tds no3 n na cl k f and hardness are critical with concentration values greater than their permissible limits for drinking during both the seasons hence traditional gis based gqi models were developed for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons using all the ten groundwater quality parameters denoted as gqi 10 as well as using only seven concerned critical parameters denoted as gqi 7 in addition fgqi models for both the seasons were developed using seven concerned critical parameters experts knowledge along with the who and bis guidelines for drinking water were employed to design fuzzy inference rules a comparative evaluation of the traditional gqi models and fgqi models indicated that the fgqi models predict groundwater quality status more realistically than the traditional gqi models because the former incorporate human thinking and handle uncertainty involved in the natural system analysis efficiently it also emphasizes that only critical prominent water quality parameters should be used for developing gis based gqi models in order to ensure reliable and useful results thus the proposed fuzzy based decision making approach along with gis based gqi fgqi is more reliable for assessing groundwater quality at larger scales gqi modeling results suggest that the groundwater of eastern and southern parts of the study area is unsuitable for drinking domestic usage during both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons moreover the post monsoon water quality status in the study area is lower than that of the pre monsoon season which indicates increased influx of pollutants from industrial mining agricultural and waste dumping areas during monsoon seasons the hybrid framework proposed in this study can easily be replicated in other regions of the world for evaluating the suitability of groundwater or surface water quality for domestic and or agricultural purposes particularly it is strongly recommended for the assessment and monitoring of groundwater quality at watershed basin scales in other agro climatic regions and hydrogeologic settings of india and the world based on the findings of this study it is recommended that concerned water planners and decision makers must formulate improved and comprehensive strategies for the efficient management of effluents from different industries mining areas waste disposal sites and agricultural fields so as to avoid groundwater contamination by anthropogenic sources in the region prevention of aquifer surface water contamination is indispensable for protecting crucial groundwater and surface water resources so as to ensure sustainable utilization and management of available water resources it is worth mentioning that the protection of groundwater resources and prevention or reduction of harmful hazards is more feasible and less expensive options than the remediation of polluted groundwater resources due to physical inaccessibility complex processes and huge expenses therefore future studies should focus on the efficient assessment of groundwater contamination risk at basin regional scales for the planning decision making and policy perspectives of groundwater protection and recharge programs authors contribution madan kumar jha conceptualization methodology resources manuscript preparation review and

17889,groundwater is a vital source of freshwater in both urban and rural regions of the world however its injudicious abstraction and rapidly increasing contamination are posing a severe threat for sustainable water supply worldwide geographical information system gis based groundwater quality evaluation using groundwater quality index gqi has been proved to be a cost effective tool for assessing groundwater quality and its variability at a larger scale however the conventional gqi approach is unable to deal with uncertainties involved in the assessment of environmental problems to overcome this limitation a novel hybrid framework integrating fuzzy logic with the gis based gqi is proposed in this study for assessing groundwater quality and its spatial variability the proposed hybrid framework is demonstrated through a case study in a hard rock terrain of southern india using ten prominent groundwater quality parameters measured during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons two conventional gis based gqi models gqi 10 using all the ten groundwater quality parameters and gqi 7 using seven concerned critical groundwater quality parameters as well as hybrid fuzzy gis based gqi fgqi models using seven critical parameters were developed for the two seasons and the results were compared the trapezoidal membership functions classified the model input parameters into desirable acceptable and unacceptable classes based on the experts knowledge and water quality standards for drinking purposes the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in groundwater were found within the who desirable limits for drinking water throughout the year while the concentrations of seven parameters tds no3 n na cl k f and hardness exceed their permissible limits during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons a comparative evaluation of gqi models revealed that the fgqi model predicts groundwater quality better than the conventional gqi 10 and gqi 7 models gqi modeling results suggest that the groundwater of most of eastern and southern parts 60 in pre monsoon season 90 in post monsoon season of the study area is unsuitable for drinking further the groundwater quality deteriorates during post monsoon seasons compared to pre monsoon seasons which indicates an increased influx of contaminants from different industries mining areas waste disposal sites and agricultural fields during monsoon seasons this finding calls for the strict enforcement of regulations for proper handling of effluents from various contamination sources in the study area it is concluded that the fuzzy logic based decision making approach fgqi is more reliable and pragmatic for groundwater quality assessment and analysis at a larger scale it can serve as a useful tool for the water planners and decision makers in efficiently monitoring and managing groundwater quality at watershed or basin scales graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water quality fuzzy logic groundwater quality index

of ecosystems as well as economic growth and social development of our societies iah 2008 unesco 2015 increase in urbanization industrialization and agricultural activities have adversely affected the quality of both surface water and groundwater across the globe groundwater being more reliable source of freshwater is under enormous pressure to fulfill water demands for increasing global population especially in developing countries including india according to world bank 2010 india is the largest consumer of groundwater in the world with an estimated annual groundwater use of about 230 km3 india is facing groundwater crisis in the 21st century due to its overexploitation cgwb 2017 as well as growing contamination from point and non point sources of pollution soe 2009 contrary to surface water contamination groundwater contamination is difficult to detect because of being hidden and once contaminated the groundwater can remain so for decades or even for hundreds of years due to relatively slow movement of water and contaminants in the subsurface environment therefore there is an urgent need to develop efficient management strategies for the sustainable utilization and protection of vital groundwater resources to this end it is imperative to have a suitable tool technique for effective monitoring and assessment of groundwater quality at a larger scale which in turn can serve as an effective tool for improved management and development of vital groundwater resources one possible management alternative is through the development of water quality indices to provide a comprehensive assessment of surface water and groundwater quality water quality indices wqi is a simple mathematical tool that can provide a distinct picture of overall water quality status over an area based on important water quality parameters abbasi and abbasi 2012 the wqi based maps are easily understandable and aid in creating public awareness on groundwater surface water pollution as well as in enforcing regulations for proper managements of wastes released from various sources and imposing restrictions on groundwater extraction which in turn can help formulate effective management strategies for protecting aquifers from contamination e g saeedi et al 2010 vadiati et al 2016 in past few decades the wqi approach was followed by many researchers worldwide e g bolton et al 1978 babiker et al 2007 nasiri et al 2007 machiwal et al 2011 vicente et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 jasmin and mallikarjuna 2014 boateng et al 2016 selvaganapathi et al 2017 lumb et al 2011 provided a comprehensive review on the evolution of wqi over the years and highlighted major limitations embedded in the process of index development and provided recommendations to overcome the drawbacks many of the past researches on wqi focused particularly on surface water with very limited number of studies dealing with groundwater it is important to mention that biological properties bacteria algae etc and physico chemical properties temperature turbidity color dissolved oxygen ph etc are important parameters for surface water quality evaluation whereas hydro chemical properties major cations and anions are important parameters for groundwater quality evaluation vadiati et al 2016 thus a variety of water quality parameters are involved in the evaluation of groundwater quality and data constraints often impede the process of groundwater quality index gqi development probably tiwari and mishra 1985 were the first to formulate a methodology for drinking water suitability using surface water quality index lumb et al 2011 vadiati et al 2016 adopting their procedure several studies were carried out dealing with gqi development in different parts of the world lumb et al 2011 in the recent past several researchers have also employed gis based gqi to evaluate groundwater quality and analyze spatial variability of groundwater quality parameters babiker et al 2007 was pioneer in proposing the development of gis based gqi using a statistical procedure to calculate an index based on the world health organization who standards for drinking water this methodology has been widely employed by subsequent researchers to assess groundwater quality and its spatial variability e g nas and ali 2010 machiwal et al 2011 el fadel et al 2014 vadiati et al 2016 apart from analyzing the drinking water suitability using gqi a few studies have also been carried out for assessing irrigation water suitability using gqi for example soltan 1999 evaluated groundwater quality of artesian wells in egypt for irrigation water suitability based on gqi whereas stigter et al 2006 used groundwater gqi as an assessment tool for the agricultural regions of portugal groundwater quality index gqi is easy to calculate using the threshold values of different groundwater quality parameters and the results are very convenient to interpret however one of the major issues with the traditional wqis for both surface water and groundwater is that they fail to deal with the uncertainty and subjectivity that are inherent in the assessment of environmental problems silvert 2000 especially while classifying water quality near the parameter threshold boundary chang et al 2001 to overcome this subjectivity and to incorporate environmental uncertainty in the groundwater quality evaluation process the application of artificial intelligence ai based computational methods are highly recommended maiti et al 2013 araghinejad 2013 patki et al 2015 bagherzadeh et al 2018 salari et al 2018 the available ai methods can be classified into two broad categories a symbolic ai and b computational ai the former mainly deals with the development of knowledge based system while the latter deals with the development of behavior based system chau 2006 the computational ai includes neural networks genetic algorithm fuzzy systems etc among various computational ai methods fuzzy logic fl is extensively used to deal with complex water related environmental problems mckone and deshpande 2005 ghosh and mujumdar 2006 chau 2006 mohebbi tafreshi et al 2018 owing to its capability to deal with non linearity and uncertainty involved in environmental systems chanapathi et al 2019 in addition to this fl serves as an effective tool for conveying the results to the public and beneficiaries in a much understandable linguistic format li et al 2018 the fuzzy logic was introduced by zadeh 1965 and is based on fuzzy set theory in contrast to the classical mathematics which is based on the crisp set theory ocampo duque et al 2006 first used fuzzy inference system fis to evaluate river water quality in spain and identified the fuzzy wqi to be more robust compared to the traditional wqi a few studies have used fuzzy logic to evaluate groundwater quality dahiya et al 2007 jinturkar et al 2010 hosseini moghari et al 2015 mohamed et al 2019 and it has been recommended for the evaluation of complex water quality problems all of these studies implemented fuzzy logic based gqi for point based groundwater samples collected from open bore wells dahiya et al 2007 hosseini moghari et al 2015 gorai et al 2016 vadiati et al 2016 agoubi et al 2016 mohamed et al 2019 or from hand pumps jinturkar et al 2010 and did not map the spatial variation of groundwater quality furthermore a general difficulty has been reported in validating fuzzy based gqi owing to the linguistic subjectivity involved in the construction of fuzzy based indices ocampo duque et al 2013 it is evident from the review of literature presented above that the application of fuzzy logic for developing gis based gqi is in its infancy and little attention has been given to employ fuzzy logic to address the non linearity and uncertainty involved in the spatial mapping of gqi machiwal et al 2018 also the issue involved in the validation of fuzzy based gqi has not been addressed to date considering these research gaps and the need for an efficient methodology for evaluating groundwater quality at larger scales the goal of this study is to develop a novel hybrid framework by integrating fuzzy logic with the gis based gqi to assess groundwater quality and its spatial variability at larger scales this hybrid framework is named fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index henceforth called fgqi and its efficacy and applicability are demonstrated through a case study in a hard rock terrain of tamil nadu state south india also for the first time the issue concerning validation of the developed fgqi has been addressed in this study two recent studies conducted in a few parts of tiruchirappalli district selvakumar et al 2017 rajendran et al 2019 deal with the basic geochemical analysis of groundwater at limited locations using statistical and or graphical methods which also indicate the necessity for an efficient methodology to assess groundwater quality at a larger scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of study area 2 1 1 location and climate the study area selected for this study is tiruchirappalli district also known as trichy which is situated in the central position of tamil nadu state in the southern part of india fig 1 it is located between 10 16 and 11 22 north latitude and 78 15 and 79 16 east longitude and encompasses an area of approximately 4403 83 km2 it is sub divided into 14 administrative units known as blocks namely anthanallur lalgudi manachanallur manapparai manikandam marungapuri musiri pullambadi tattayangarpettai tiruverumbur thottiyam thuraiyur uppliyapuram and vaiyampatti fig 1 the main source of surface water is the cauvery river and its tributaries ayyar uppar and koraiyar rivers which flow through the center of the study area the area is characterized by tropical wet and dry climate with hot and dry summer from march to may normal to moderate monsoon rainfall from june to december followed by mild cold and moist winter during january and february the monsoon season in the study area occurs in two phases june to september from the southwest monsoon and october to december from the northeast monsoon with the former contributing 32 to the annual rainfall and the latter being the major rainy season contributing 48 owing to the cauvery river dispute the surface water reserves are not sufficient during the non monsoon season resulting in heavy dependency on groundwater reserves for drinking and irrigation purposes this situation calls for proper groundwater management in the river basin 2 1 2 hydrogeology and land characteristics the study area predominantly consists of three geological groups i the bhavani group of formations comprising of fissile hornblende gneiss of archaean age in the north covering 30 of the study area ii the migmatite complexes made up of hornblende biotite gneiss of archaean age extending in the south occupying about 37 of the study area and iii the quaternary formations of alluvium belonging to the cainozoic age underlying the cauvery river in the central region covering 10 of the area fig s1 additionally patches of limestone of the trichinopoly group and sandstone of the gondwana group of mesozoic age are confined to the east of the study area jenifer and jha 2017 a massive stretch of charnockite of charnockite group is found in the extreme north and south of the study area granite prevailing in the central and western portions of the study area is mostly hard and easily weathered the anorthosite intrusive igneous rocks of the sathayamangalam group are exposed in the southwestern part of the study area are mainly comprised of calcium rich coarse crystals the hard rocks in the study area possess negligible primary porosity but are rendered porous and permeable due to secondary porosity by fracturing and weathering groundwater yields from granite and gneiss formation are better than charnockite formations shale sandstone clay and alluvium act as unconfined or leaky confined aquifers in some parts of the study area the aquifer is highly heterogeneous due to changes in the lithology texture and structural features within a short span of distance groundwater in the study area is usually found at depths of 2 20 m below the ground in the weathered formations unconfined aquifers and it is tapped mostly through dug wells deeper fractured formations leaky confined or confined aquifers occur at depths of 20 40 m which are tapped through bore wells or dug cum bore wells cgwb 2008 the land use land cover map of the study area is shown in fig 2 a major portion of the study area 66 53 has agricultural land wherein crops like paddy cereals fruits vegetables oil seeds and fiber crops such as cotton sugarcane and pulses are grown fallow land covers 11 45 forest 9 98 water bodies 6 34 and settlement covers 3 62 mining activities are limited to about 2 of the study area mostly concentrated near the cauvery river where sand and sandstone mining is prevalent a few mining sites are also located in the eastern and southern parts of the study area where predominantly limestone is excavated on the other hand a variety of industries and some gasoline stations are present in different parts of the study area fig 2 b with the cluster of industries located in the central portion of the study area these industries and gasoline stations coupled with mining and agricultural activities constitute potential sources of contamination for surface water bodies and groundwater jenifer 2018 jenifer and jha 2018 2 1 3 data acquisition for the groundwater quality assessment of the unconfined aquifer system underlying the study area groundwater quality data of 24 observation wells during pre monsoon season july 2013 and 37 observation wells during post monsoon season january 2014 fig 1 were obtained from institute of water studies chennai tamil nadu both the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons groundwater quality data were used in this study to investigate seasonal variation in the groundwater quality and the influence of the rainfall on the quality of groundwater the obtained groundwater quality parameters consisted of major anions and cations including total dissolved solids tds nitrate nitrogen no3 n calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na chloride cl potassium k fluoride f sulphate so4 2 and hardness measured as caco3 these ten groundwater quality parameters were employed for developing gqi for assessing the suitability of groundwater for drinking water supply in the study area in this study only prominent water quality parameters were considered based on their importance in affecting groundwater quality as reported in the earlier studies conducted in some parts of tiruchirappalli district e g jameel and sirajudeen 2006 venkatesan et al 2013 selvakumar et al 2017 rajendran et al 2019 and their impacts on human health also another reason for considering only important water quality parameters is due to the fact that the inclusion of more parameters less prominent water quality parameters in the groundwater quality model unnecessarily increases uncertainty thus the consideration of less important unimportant water quality parameters is neither technically sound nor practically useful significant 2 2 development of gis based groundwater quality index gqi models the hybrid framework adopted in this study for developing fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index fgqi is illustrated in fig 3 the complete procedure can be segregated into three major steps viz geostatistical analysis development of traditional gis based gqi models and development of fuzzy gis based gqi fgqi models 2 2 1 geostatistical analysis geostatistical analysis especially spatial interpolation of point data is the first and foremost step for developing gqi because further model development depends heavily on it since it is nearly impossible to obtain field data for each point throughout the study area spatial interpolation techniques were used to estimate the data at un sampled points using the data from sampled points inverse distance weighting idw kriging and co kriging are most widely used spatial interpolation methods idw is a deterministic interpolation technique that estimates value at unmeasured points on the basis of its closeness to the measured points on other hand kriging is a geostatistical interpolation technique which uses spatial statistics of the measured points to estimate values at unmeasured points whereas co kriging is an extension of kriging in which an auxiliary variable is used to help the kriging estimator the auxiliary variable is the one which is highly correlated with the primary variable kriging co kriging performs better than the idw method when the data are near normally distributed kerry and oliver 2007a and have no extreme values kerry and oliver 2007b among the kriging and co kriging methods co kriging is found to be superior when the correlation coefficient between the primary and auxiliary variable is more than 0 5 yates and warrick 1987 tables s1 and s2 show correlation between all the ten groundwater quality parameters during pre monsoon season and post monsoon season respectively finally groundwater quality parameters following near normal distribution were interpolated by employing kriging co kriging considering correlation coefficient values of the parameters tables s1 and s2 the choice between kriging and co kriging was finally decided based on the least value of root mean square error rmse on the other hand the groundwater quality parameters having no near normal distribution were interpolated using idw which efficiently captures the extreme values that are most likely in case of groundwater quality data mueller et al 2004 thus the interpolation methods used to prepare concentration maps of individual groundwater quality parameters for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are shown in table 1 using suitable interpolation methods concentration maps of 50 m 50 m pixel size were prepared using gis for all the groundwater quality parameters for both the seasons and a summary of the basic statistics of the concentrations of individual parameters during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons is presented in table 1 further these maps were used for analyzing spatial variability of the concentration of individual groundwater quality parameters 2 2 2 traditional gis based groundwater quality index gqi models the concentration maps were employed to compute gis based gqi following the procedure proposed by babiker et al 2007 firstly the concentration maps of each parameter were used to create normalized maps also known as concentration index maps ci by comparing the parameter concentration value x with its standard threshold t using eqn 1 the who standards for drinking water who 2004 and the indian standards is for drinking water provided by the bureau of indian standards bis 2012 were used as shown in table 1 thereafter the rank r maps of all the parameters were generated using eqn 2 1 c i x t x t 2 r 0 5 c i 2 4 5 c i 5 3 w m e a n r f o r t d s c a 2 m g 2 s o 4 2 k f h a r d n e s s m e a n r 2 f o r n o 3 n n a c l 4 g q i 100 r 1 w 1 r 2 w 2 r n w n n furthermore the weights w for each parameter were determined as mean of the respective rank values however as suggested by babiker et al 2007 the potential parameters were given higher weights as shown in eqn 3 in this study nitrate nitrogen no3 n sodium na and chloride cl were identified as potential health risk parameters for the study area excess levels of nitrate are known to cause blue baby syndrome whereas excess chloride levels are known to increase colon cancer risk aieta and berg 1986 although higher sodium levels do not pose a serious threat to the human health it creates a risk to the people under low sodium diet which is usually recommended for hypertension high blood pressure and congestive heart failure patients finally the gqi values were calculated using eqn 4 which lie between 0 and 100 two traditional conventional gqi models of the study area for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons were prepared using all the ten groundwater quality parameters and are denoted as gqi 10 models using total dissolved solids tds nitrate nitrogen no3 n calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na chloride cl potassium k fluoride f sulphate so4 2 and hardness measured as caco3 similarly two more traditional gqi maps were prepared for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons using only the parameters whose concentration values exceed their permissible limits henceforth called concerned critical parameters in this study and are denoted as gqi 7 models using seven concerned critical parameters namely total dissolved solids tds nitrate nitrogen no3 n sodium na chloride cl potassium k fluoride f and hardness the computed index values in each case were categorized into suitable classes to generate four traditional gqi maps based on the classification scheme proposed by babiker et al 2007 2 2 3 fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index fgqi model since its inception by zadeh 1965 fuzzy logic fl has helped researchers to induce human knowledge and experience to deal with the uncertainty and vagueness involved while assessing natural systems fuzzy logic maps input to output using fuzzy inference system fis that combines fl and experts knowledge via four main components viz fuzzification fuzzy inference rules aggregation and defuzzification two most important fuzzy inference systems are mamdani fis mamdani 1976 and sugeno fis sugeno 1985 mamdani fis is most widely used for environmental applications due to its simplicity and practical application icaga 2007 scannapieco et al 2012 and it has been employed in this study for the development of fgqi 2 2 3 1 fuzzification the fuzzification of the input and output is done by constructing membership functions mfs membership function mf is a curve which shows the degree of belongingness membership value of the data to a particular class the membership value was determined using experts knowledge and drinking water quality standards of who who 2004 and bis bis 2012 as shown in table 1 and s3 fig 4 a h show the chosen mfs for the input and output variables trapezoidal mfs were adopted in this study as they are the most commonly used functions in many studies kosko 1993 the inputs to the fis were the concentration maps of the concerned parameters similar to the traditional gqi 7 map so as to reduce the uncertainty the trapezoidal membership functions of all the seven groundwater quality parameters and fgqi were constructed using following equation hosseini moghari et al 2015 5 f x a b c d 0 x a o r d x a x a b a x b 1 b x c d x d c c x d where x is the parameter to be fuzzified and a b c and d are the linguistic variables used to divide the parameters into different classes table s4 the input parameters were divided into three classes desirable concentration value less than or equal to the desirable limit acceptable concentration value between desirable and permissible limits and unacceptable concentration value more than the permissible limit based on the who and bis standards for drinking water fig 4 a g and table s4 the outputs values of fgqi were classified into five classes namely unacceptable poor moderate good and excellent fig 4 h and table s5 2 2 3 2 fuzzy inference rules the fuzzy inference rules are in the form of if then format they map the input class categories to the output class categories the if part is called an antecedent and the then part is called a consequent for example if the concentration of a parameter e g tds is desirable then the water quality fgqi is excellent fuzzy rules for the study area were designed by using experts knowledge and carefully considering the parameters having potential health risk i e no3 n cl and na an outline showing the design of fuzzy inference rules is depicted in fig 5 the main premise while designing the fuzzy inference rules was even if one water quality parameter exceeds the permissible limit for drinking water then the water is not suitable for direct consumption by the people all the fuzzy inference rules were designed keeping this main premise in mind moreover while designing the fuzzy inference rules three potential health risk parameters no3 n cl and na were also taken into special consideration this main premise ensures the practicality of the developed water quality index in judging drinking water suitability this is important to emphasize here as this knowledge helps to inculcate human understanding in the fuzzy logic assessment of groundwater quality 2 2 3 3 aggregation of fuzzy rules once the fuzzy inference rules were designed the next step was combining all the designed fuzzy inference rules the aggregation of the consequent part of the fuzzy inference rules is needed to calculate a single fuzzy output which is fgqi in this study maximum method ross 2004 was used as an aggregation procedure in this study which applies union operation on all the truncated output fuzzy sets 2 2 3 4 defuzzification finally defuzzifying the aggregated output value was carried out to convert the fuzzy sets to a numeric value the final numeric score obtained is fuzzy groundwater quality index fgqi the most commonly used centroid of area coa method ross 2004 was employed for defuzzification of the fuzzy sets the detailed description of all the fuzzy set operations and fis can be found in ross 2004 all the fl operations were carried out in matlab r2014a mathworks 2014 whereas the gis operations were carried out in arcgis 10 2 2 esri 2014 thus fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index fgqi maps of the study area were prepared for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons using seven concerned parameters 2 3 validation of the developed gqi models for the first time the validation of fgqi has been attempted in this study because it is a difficult task it is important to emphasize that fgqi is developed based on linguistic terminology in the form of fuzzy rules equations are only used to map the parameters which reduce the non linearity of the fuzzy model the best method to validate an index is to use impact factors or indicators ocampo duque et al 2006 however relating an impact factor to groundwater quality is furthermore challenging and it is not possible in some situations in this study the fgqi and traditional gqi models developed for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons were validated qualitatively using land use land cover and industry location maps fig 2 a and b as well as quantitatively using site specific groundwater quality data obtained from the analysis of groundwater samples collected from different observation wells over the study area these water quality data indicate the status of groundwater quality with minimum uncertainty since unacceptable concentration of even one parameter renders the water unsuitable for drinking and other domestic proposes the score of a given groundwater quality index was examined for the observation well with respect to its number of unsafe parameters parameters exceeding their acceptable permissible limits 3 results and discussion 3 1 variability of groundwater quality parameter concentration in the study area the concentration maps created using spatial interpolation of the point values of the concentrations of ten groundwater quality parameters for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are shown in fig 6 a and b the concentration maps are categorized into three classes on the basis of the desirable and permissible limits of who and bis for drinking water table s3 as it can be seen from fig 6 a and b that calcium magnesium and sulphate are the safe parameters as they are well within the desirable limits throughout the study area during both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons however the remaining 7 parameters i e tds no3 n na cl k f and hardness exceed their permissible limits in some parts of the study area and hence they are considered as critical concerned parameters for assessing the suitability of groundwater for drinking purpose the spatial variability of groundwater quality during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons is discussed in the subsequent sub sections 3 1 1 concentration maps of groundwater quality parameters for the pre monsoon season it is apparent from fig 6 a that in the pre monsoon season groundwater in the unconfined aquifer underlying the south western part of the study area vaiyampatti block has unacceptable concentrations of all the critical concerned groundwater quality parameters except potassium this is mainly due to the fact that vaiyampatti block lies at the downstream end of the cauvery river and a significant amount of surface pollutants from the upstream portion are deposited in this block which gradually percolate into the unconfined aquifer the concentration of tds in groundwater ranges from 157 to 3202 mg l table 1 and exceeds its permissible limit for drinking in 5 of the study area further the no3 n concentration exceeds its permissible limit in 8 of the study area which is mainly due to anthropogenic sources like chemical fertilizer application in the agricultural fields other non agricultural sources of nitrate include seepage from septic tanks and cesspools heap of cattle dung etc less than 2 of the area has unacceptable concentration of sodium in groundwater in vaiyampatti block the chloride concentration in groundwater is relatively higher in parts of lalgudi thiruverumbur thottiyam and vaiyampatti blocks the major source of chloride is the effluent molasses from paper and pulp industries fig 2 b potassium concentration in the groundwater exceeds the who prescribed limit of 12 mg l in 10 of the study area the increase in fluoride concentration is mainly due to the geogenic source i e dissolution of natural minerals like apatite biotite cryolite fluorite etc from the igneous rocks fig 6 a shows that the total hardness of groundwater is relatively high in the study area which can be attributed to considerable limestone deposits in this region 3 1 2 concentration maps of groundwater quality parameters for the post monsoon season although some similar patterns of pre monsoon can be observed in the post monsoon season the concentrations of groundwater quality parameters significantly differ in the post monsoon season fig 6 b the tds concentration in groundwater during the post monsoon season ranges from 190 to 3028 mg l the area under the desirable concentration region has considerably decreased from 24 6 in the pre monsoon season to 7 37 in the post monsoon season in case of no3 n concentration in the area unacceptable groundwater quality region has reduced to 5 7 in the post monsoon season due to the dilution of pollutant in groundwater during monsoon season fig 6 b reveals that the concentrations of calcium magnesium and sulphate are within their prescribed limits in both the seasons unacceptable concentration of sodium is found in some parts of marungapuri block in the post monsoon season in addition to vaiyampatti block which suffers from high sodium concentration in the pre monsoon season as well although only 5 of the study area shows unacceptable chloride concentration in groundwater during the post monsoon season the area under desirable groundwater quality region has reduced from 44 41 in the pre monsoon season to 27 6 in the post monsoon season the spatial distribution of potassium concentration in groundwater shows that the unacceptable concentration occurs in many blocks viz manapparai manachanallur musiri vaiyampatti lalgudi and pullambadi covering 13 of the study area furthermore the concentration of fluoride in groundwater exceeds its prescribed limit in less than 1 of the study area which is confined to the southernmost part of marungapuri block the total hardness of groundwater ranging between 95 and 880 mg l table 1 in the pre monsoon has increased drastically to 150 1500 mg l in the postmonsoon season the area under the unacceptable level of hardness increased to 7 73 in the post monsoon season compared to the pre monsoon season generally the dilution of pollutants occurs during the rainy monsoon season and hence groundwater quality is expected to improve in the post monsoon season as compared to the pre monsoon season however the spatial variability of the concentrations of different groundwater quality parameters in the study area during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons clearly reveals that the effect of pollutant dilution is very less in the study area consequently unlike common observations in many past studies on groundwater quality evaluation the groundwater quality deteriorates in the post monsoon season thereby indicating that the concentration of groundwater quality parameters in the study area is significantly increased by the recharge during the rainy monsoon season 3 2 traditional gis based gwqi maps the gqi 10 and gqi 7 maps for the pre monsoon season are shown in fig 7 a and fig 7 b respectively the values of gqi 10 vary from 65 15 to 89 58 with a mean value of 76 33 table 2 according to the values of indices obtained the gqi 10 map of the study area was classified into two classes medium quality gqi 10 60 80 and high quality gqi 10 80 for drinking water babiker et al 2007 with the northern portion of the study area belonging to the high quality groundwater fig 7 a the gqi 7 map fig 7 b significantly differs from the gqi 10 map with gqi 7 values always lower than gqi 10 values the gqi 7 values range from 52 84 to 86 73 with a mean value of 68 26 table 2 the southwest vaiyampatti block eastern lalgudi block and southeast thiruverumbur block parts of the study area have lower quality gqi 7 60 groundwater for drinking however the northwest part of the study area western portion of uppliyapuram block has high quality groundwater while the central portion of the study area has medium quality groundwater for the drinking purpose fig 7 b moreover gqi 10 and gqi 7 maps of the study area for the post monsoon season are shown in fig 7 d and e the gqi 10 values range from 61 90 to 88 48 with a mean of 73 05 table 2 the classification of gqi 10 map for the post monsoon season is similar to that of the pre monsoon season and only the northern part of the study area has high quality groundwater fig 7 d the gqi 7 map fig 7 e for the post monsoon season differs largely compared to the gqi 10 map with the gqi 7 values varying from 48 95 to 85 28 mean 63 92 table 2 it evident that the southwest vaiyampatti block southern manapparai block and southern east thiruverumbur block parts of the study area have low quality groundwater fig 7 e but the northern part uppliyapuram block has high quality groundwater based on the above discussion it is emphasized that the gqi 7 values are always lower than gqi 10 values and the gqi 7 map is more practical and reliable than the gqi 10 map the gqi 7 is able to successfully map the polluted blocks vaiyampatti lalgudi thiruverumbur and manapparai blocks under the low quality category while the gqi 10 maps them under medium quality category further as gqi 10 uses more number of water quality parameters compared to gqi 7 it introduces more uncertainty and high computation demand 3 3 fuzzy gis based gqi fgqi maps fuzzy logic was applied to the gis based concentration maps for the concerned parameters to generate fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index fgqi maps of the study area for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons fig 7 c and f the fgqi was developed bearing in mind the inherent uncertainty associated with environmental systems the fgqi values for the pre monsoon season range from 12 18 to 86 42 with a mean of 59 80 table 2 based on which fgqi map was prepared as shown in fig 7 c it is apparent from this figure that except the northern uppliyapuram block and central thuraiyur and musiri blocks parts of the study area other parts of the area has low quality fgqi 60 groundwater for drinking extremely low values of fgqi 20 can be seen in the southwest part of the study area fig 7 c on the other hand the fgqi values for the post monsoon season vary from 13 81 to 86 42 with a mean of 55 22 table 2 based on the fgqi most of the regions of the study area fall under the category of low quality fgqi 60 groundwater in the post monsoon season whereas the northern part of the study area falls under the category of high quality fgqi 80 groundwater fig 7 f a few locations scattered patches in the central and southern parts of the study area have medium quality 60 fgqi 80 groundwater for drinking 3 4 comparison of traditional and fuzzy gis based gwqi models and validation a comparative evaluation of the gqi 10 gqi 7 and fgqi models was performed to examine the relative performance of these models in predicting actual groundwater quality status during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in the study area as illustrated in fig 8 a and b it is clear from these figures that the gqi 10 values are always higher than gqi 7 values this is expected as the safe parameters increase the values of gqi further for most of the observation wells the fgqi values are much lower than gqi 10 and gqi 7 values however for the observation wells having concentrations of all the groundwater quality parameters much lower than their permissible limits the fgqi values are almost equal to or more than the values of gqi 10 and gqi 7 as evident in case of observation well numbers 6 10 15 and 20 in the pre monsoon season fig 8 a as well as observation well numbers 3 5 19 31 and 33 in the post monsoon season fig 8 b moreover the validation of traditional and fuzzy gis based gwqi models for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons is illustrated in fig 8 c and d during the pre monsoon season it is obvious from fig 8 c that the fgqi model predicts low quality gwqi 60 groundwater for drinking when the number of critical parameters is more than one whereas the gqi 10 and gqi 7 models predict medium quality 60 gwqi 80 groundwater for the same observation wells similar trend can be seen for the post monsoon season as well fig 8 d these findings along with the findings of qualitative validation using land use land cover and industry location maps clearly highlight the superiority of fgqi models and emphasize the need for using fuzzy logic in developing gis based groundwater quality models for assessing groundwater quality at larger scales the fgqi model evidently predicts groundwater drinking quality status as per the practical logic and correctly indicate the safe groundwater as high quality i e it can be directly consumed for drinking and unsafe groundwater as low quality i e no direct consumption or domestic use one of the important findings while comparing the developed groundwater quality indices is that the post monsoon groundwater quality is lower than the pre monsoon groundwater quality thereby indicating that the dilution effect in the monsoon season is not prevalent in the study area the groundwater quality of the northern part of the study area which is occupied by mostly hilly forest is almost the same during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in the remaining parts of the study area the groundwater quality deteriorates in the monsoon post monsoon season which is attributed to the improper management of effluents from industrial mining and waste dumping areas as well as leaching of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural fields during monsoon seasons there is a large decrease in fgqi and gqi values in the southwest part of the study area in the post monsoon season fig 7 d f this may be due to chemical iron and steel industries located in this part of the study area fig 2 b moreover the central and southern parts of the study area seem to have lower fgqi and gqi values in the post monsoon season because of nitrate and potassium pollution in the monsoon season due to agricultural activities this calls for proper management of solid and liquid wastes and efficient application of fertilizers and pesticides in the study area 4 conclusions in this paper a novel hybrid framework considering fuzzy logic and gis based groundwater quality index gqi is proposed to evaluate and analyze groundwater quality at larger scales the proposed hybrid approach is named fuzzy gis based groundwater quality index henceforth denoted as fgqi and it is demonstrated through a case study in an unconfined aquifer system of southern india using salient groundwater quality parameters measured at multiple sites during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons fuzzy logic was applied to deal with non linearity and uncertainty inherent in natural environmental systems traditional gis based groundwater quality index gqi models and hybrid gis based gqi models using fuzzy logic were developed for both the seasons following the drinking water guidelines of world health organization who 2004 and bureau of indian standards bis 2012 for the first time the developed gqi models were rigorously evaluated in this study through inter comparison and validation initially a geostatistical analysis was carried out to prepare concentration maps of different groundwater quality parameters and analyze their spatial and seasonal variability basic statistical analysis revealed that ca2 mg2 and so4 2 are safe parameters concentration values well within the who desirable limits for drinking water during both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons however the remaining seven parameters tds no3 n na cl k f and hardness are critical with concentration values greater than their permissible limits for drinking during both the seasons hence traditional gis based gqi models were developed for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons using all the ten groundwater quality parameters denoted as gqi 10 as well as using only seven concerned critical parameters denoted as gqi 7 in addition fgqi models for both the seasons were developed using seven concerned critical parameters experts knowledge along with the who and bis guidelines for drinking water were employed to design fuzzy inference rules a comparative evaluation of the traditional gqi models and fgqi models indicated that the fgqi models predict groundwater quality status more realistically than the traditional gqi models because the former incorporate human thinking and handle uncertainty involved in the natural system analysis efficiently it also emphasizes that only critical prominent water quality parameters should be used for developing gis based gqi models in order to ensure reliable and useful results thus the proposed fuzzy based decision making approach along with gis based gqi fgqi is more reliable for assessing groundwater quality at larger scales gqi modeling results suggest that the groundwater of eastern and southern parts of the study area is unsuitable for drinking domestic usage during both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons moreover the post monsoon water quality status in the study area is lower than that of the pre monsoon season which indicates increased influx of pollutants from industrial mining agricultural and waste dumping areas during monsoon seasons the hybrid framework proposed in this study can easily be replicated in other regions of the world for evaluating the suitability of groundwater or surface water quality for domestic and or agricultural purposes particularly it is strongly recommended for the assessment and monitoring of groundwater quality at watershed basin scales in other agro climatic regions and hydrogeologic settings of india and the world based on the findings of this study it is recommended that concerned water planners and decision makers must formulate improved and comprehensive strategies for the efficient management of effluents from different industries mining areas waste disposal sites and agricultural fields so as to avoid groundwater contamination by anthropogenic sources in the region prevention of aquifer surface water contamination is indispensable for protecting crucial groundwater and surface water resources so as to ensure sustainable utilization and management of available water resources it is worth mentioning that the protection of groundwater resources and prevention or reduction of harmful hazards is more feasible and less expensive options than the remediation of polluted groundwater resources due to physical inaccessibility complex processes and huge expenses therefore future studies should focus on the efficient assessment of groundwater contamination risk at basin regional scales for the planning decision making and policy perspectives of groundwater protection and recharge programs authors contribution madan kumar jha conceptualization methodology resources manuscript preparation review and
