14995,organophosphate esters opes are emerging contaminants of growing concern and there is limited information about the bacterial transformation of opes in this study we investigated the biotransformation of tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep a frequently detected alkyl ope by a bacterial enrichment culture under aerobic conditions the enrichment culture degraded 5 mg l tboep following the first order kinetics with a reaction rate constant of 0 314 h 1 tboep was mainly degraded via ether bond cleavage evidenced by the production of bis 2 butoxyethyl hydroxyethyl phosphate 2 butoxyethyl bis 2 hydroxyethyl phosphate and 2 butoxyethyl 2 hydroxyethyl hydrogen phosphate other transformation pathways include terminal oxidation of the butoxyethyl group and phosphoester bond hydrolysis metagenomic sequencing generated 14 metagenome assembled genomes mags showing that the enrichment culture primarily consisted of gammaproteobacteria bacteroidota myxococcota and actinobacteriota one mag assigned to rhodocuccus ruber strain c1 was the most active in the community showing upregulation of various monooxygenase dehydrogenase and phosphoesterase genes throughout the degradation process and thus was identified as the key degrader of tboep and the metabolites another mag affiliated with ottowia mainly contributed to tboep hydroxylation our results provided a comprehensive understanding of the bacterial tboep degradation at community level toc image graphical abstract keywords tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate biotransformation high resolution mass spectrometry meta omics rhodococcus ottowia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction organophosphate esters opes as the primary substitution for polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes have been increasingly used as flame retardants and plasticizers in consumer and industrial products li et al 2019 the large volume of production and wide range of application of opes resulted in their ubiquitous contamination in surface water kim and kannan 2018 sediments zeng et al 2018 ye et al 2021 soils zhang et al 2022 indoor environments tan et al 2019 and biota zhao et al 2019 which represents potential risk to public health and ecosystem blum et al 2019 li et al 2020 after being released into the environment opes are transformed into various products through chemical photochemical and biological processes hou et al 2016 su et al 2016 transformation products could be more persistent and toxic than their parent compound liu et al 2021a thus the risk of transformation products should be considered in a comprehensive risk assessment of opes most ope transformation studies focused on in vitro and in vivo metabolism based on fishes rats and human liver microsomes li et al 2021 liu et al 2021b while minimal attention has been paid to ope s microbial transformation which is of substantial significance for ope s environmental fate there remains inadequate knowledge about the diversity of ope transformation products and their environmental fate under different environmental conditions tboep a typical alkyl ope is one of the most frequently encountered and abundant opes detected in surface water sediment and wastewater treatment plants wwtps wang et al 2020 xu et al 2019 toxicity studies have confirmed the adverse effects of tboep on human health including endocrine disrupting effects and carcinogenicity matthews et al 1993 kojima et al 2013 in wwtps tboep s removal efficiency varied from 20 to 90 based on the employed wastewater treatment technologies which were mainly attributed to microbial degradation and adsorption schaider et al 2017 compared with other alkyl opes the ether bond of tboep potentially allows more transformation possibilities van den eede et al 2013 hou et al 2021 tboep metabolism has been investigated in human liver fractions and fish tissues phase i metabolites including bis 2 butoxyethyl hydroxyethyl phosphate bboehep bis 2 butoxyethyl phosphate bboep hydroxylated tboep and phase ii metabolites including glucuronide conjugate products have been identified as transformation products van den eede et al 2015 hou et al 2018 microbial tboep degradation was investigated in an enriched sludge culture which achieved 33 8 removal after 5 days incubation hou et al 2021 the dominant transformation product was bboep and other metabolites included bis 2 butoxyethyl hydroxyl 3 butoxyethyl phosphate 3 oh tboep bboehep and bis 2 butoxyethyl methyl phosphate klebsiella was significantly enriched and was considered to be associated with tboep degradation hou et al 2021 there is very limited information about the bacterial degraders and their specific roles during the degradation process which is important to understand the environmental fate of tboep the objective of this study is to investigate the bacterial transformation of tboep by an enrichment culture with tboep as the sole carbon source we elucidated the transformation pathway of tboep characterized the kinetics of tboep degradation and the transformation product accumulation we also identified the functional bacteria involved in different stages of the degradation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals tboep 94 was obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mi usa bboep 96 was purchased from

produced with a milli q synthesis water purification system 18 2 mω cm burlington ma usa 2 2 enrichment culture set up the enrichment culture was inoculated with an activated sludge sample from a wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china briefly 1 g of activated sludge after centrifugation was mixed with 100 ml minimal salt medium msm and 50 mg l tboep in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask although tboep was usually detected at μg l level in surface water and wwtps the relatively high concentrations were employed to establish enrichment culture to obtain enough biomass for microbial analyses after eight tboep additions the enrichment culture was sub cultured 5 v v in fresh medium until a stable tboep degrading culture was obtained all cultures were maintained with msm under aerobic conditions in a shaker at 120 rpm and 25 c msm contained nh4 2so4 1 g l k2hpo4 4 11 g l kh2po4 0 95 g l mgso4 0 2 g l mnso4 h2o 3 mg l znso4 7h2o 1 mg l coso4 7h2o 1 mg l nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 1 mg l feso4

kinetics was performed by batch experiments in triplicate with an initial tboep concentration of 5 mg l bottles with tboep addition and heat inactivated biomass and with only tboep addition were included as abiotic controls before instrumental analysis 0 75 ml of sample was mixed with equal volume of methanol and passed through a 0 22 μm ptfe membrane filter supelco corporation usa to identify the key tboep degrading bacteria another tboep degradation experiment was performed in triplicate by batch experiments the enrichment culture was starved for 36 h before 50 mg l tboep amendment biomass samples at the beginning of the experiment during tboep degradation and when tboep was depleted were used for rna extraction immediately after collection and stored at 80 oc before dna extraction 2 3 identification and quantification of tboep transformation products transformation products of tboep was screened by a thermo ultimate 3000 uhplc system couple to an orbitrap fusion tribrid mass spectrometer orbitrap fusion tms thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa uhplc orbitrap fusion tms transformation products were identified based on the following criteria schymanski et al

applied biosystems sciex api 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer applied biosystems foster city ca usa equipped with an agilent 1100 series liquid chromatograph agilent technologies santa clara ca usa lc ms ms p6 p10 and p11 were semi quantified with peak area because no synthesized standard was available while tboep and p12 bboep were quantified by reference standards the detailed chromatography and mass spectrometry conditions for uhplc orbitrap fusion tms and lc ms ms were described in supplemental methods 2 4 metagenomic sequencing dna from enrichment culture samples was extracted with dneasy powersoil kit qiagen germantown md sequencing libraries were constructed with nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina new england biolabs ma usa paired end sequencing was performed on an ilumina novaseq platform at guangdong magigene biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china raw reads 102 31 gb for 9 samples were quality filtered by trimmomatic v0 36 bolger et al 2014 and then de novo assembled by megahit v1 2 9 li et al 2016 contigs were binned based on read coverage coverage variance and tetranucleotide frequencies using metabat2 v2 12 1 kang et al 2019 in sensitive mode the quality of generated metagenome assembled genomes mags was assessed by checkm v1 1 3 parks et al 2015 taxonomies of the mags with 60 completeness and 10 contamination were inferred using gtdb tk v1 3 0 parks et al 2018 the open reading frames orfs of each mag were annotated using glimmer v3 02 delcher et al 2007 orfs were searched against kegg kanehisa and goto 2000 uniprot the uniprot consortium 2020 and ncbi nr databases with diamond v0 9 14 115 buchfink et al 2015 and blastp v2 5 0 altschul et al 1990 for annotation reads were mapped to mags with bbmap to calculate relative abundances 2 5 metatranscriptomic sequencing rna from enrichment culture samples was extracted with rneasy powerwater kit qiagen germantown md briefly mrna libraries were prepared with nebnext ultra nondirectional rna library prep kit for illumina new england biolabs ma usa and sequenced on an ilumina novaseq platform to produce 150 bp paired end reads at guangdong magigene biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china raw reads 106 59 gb for 9 samples were filtered and trimmed with trimmomatic v0 36 bolger et al 2014 and then mapped against mags by rsem v1 3 1 li and dewey 2011 the raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences were available in the ncbi sequence read archive under accession number prjna897252 to estimate the mrna loss during the extraction and the sequencing process luciferase control mrna 5 ng genbank accession no x65316 promega madison wi was added to biomass samples before the cell lysis step liang et al 2017 the absolute quantification of transcripts was conducted according to delogu et al 2020 with luciferase control mrna as the internal standard as described in supplemental methods table s4 2 6 statistical analyses differential gene expression analysis was conducted across metatranscriptome to determine gene expression patterns during tboep degradation using deseq2 v1 36 0 love et al 2014 in rstudio rstudio team 2015 significantly differentially expressed genes were identified with more than twofold change log2 fold change 1 or 1 and a significant p value adjusted with benjamin and hochberg method p adj 0 05 benjamini and hochberg 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of tboep transformation products in total 12 transformation products were identified 11 of which tentatively based on accurate masses and isotope patterns denoted p1 p11 table 1 fig s1 and one of which by comparing with the authentic reference standard p12 ms ms information was acquired for six transformation products with the most intense peaks and parent compound tboep p0 fig s2 s8 p1 p2 p3 had fragments with m z values of 415 2448 416 2480 and isotope patterns coinciding with the formula of c18h39o8p the ms ms spectra included feature fragments of the parent compound m z values of 299 1611 and 199 0728 and showed the common presence of fragments of m z values of 397 2342 and 315 1563 indicating an intact structure of tboep additionally the presence of fragment of m z value of 397 2342 indicated the loss of h2o from fragment of m z value of 415 2923 indicating the presence of a hydroxyl group in the structure thus p1 p2 and p3 were identified as the hydroxylation products of tboep and a total of four isomers could be possible with hydroxylation occurring at an internal or a terminal carbon of the butoxyethyl group hydroxylated tboep has been detected in sludge culture under aerobic conditions hou et al 2021 and in various tissues of common carp cyprinus carpio and chinese rare minnow gobiocypris rarus exposed to tboep hou et al 2019 tang et al 2019 p4 m z 413 2289 414 2323 corresponded to c18h37o8p which was probably aldehydes oxidized from tboep oh with the hydroxyl group on the terminal carbon p5 m z 429 2240 430 2278 was c18h37o9p which was possibly the carboxylic acid product of p4 the predicted formulae for p6 and p10 were c14h31o7p and c10h23o7p respectively the ms ms spectrum of p6 included the fragment of m z value of 299 1612 which indicated the presence of bboep in the structure and the loss of c2h4o from the fragment 343 1873 the ms ms spectrum of p10 included fragments of m z values of 243 0987 and 143 0102 which indicated the loss of c2h4o and c6h12o p6 and p10 were then identified as bis 2 butoxyethyl 2 hydroxyethyl phosphate bboehep and 2 butoxyethyl bis 2 hydroxyethyl phosphate boebhep respectively which were further products from hydroxylated tboep and bboehep with the hydroxyl group on a carbon atom adjunct to the oxygen atom 1 oh tboep 1 oh boebhep the detection of p6 and p10 evidenced the occurrence of bacterial ether cleavage of tboep similarly p7 p8 and p9 were identified as ether cleavage products from hydroxylated tboep p1 p2 and p3 or hydroxylated products of p6 without differentiating the possible four isomers and were annotated as bboehep oh ether cleavage of tboep has been observed previously based on the detection of bboehep p6 hou et al 2021 and it is the first time that boebhep p10 was detected as ether cleavage product from bboehep p6 p11 was identified as 2 butoxyethyl 2 hydroxyethyl hydrogen phosphate boehehp based on the m z values of 243 0988 244 1022 an isotope pattern similar to c8h19o6p and the ms ms profile indicating the presence of a 2 butoxyethyl acid phosphate m z 199 0725 and a c2h4o moiety in the structure p11 was likely formed via the combination of ether cleavage and phosphoester bond hydrolysis it is the first time that p11 was identified as tboep transformation products p12 was identified as bboep in comparison to the authentic reference standard which was likely formed via phosphoester bond hydrolysis 3 2 kinetics of tboep degradation and product accumulation we delineated the kinetics of tboep degradation and the accumulation of four major transformation products the degradation of 5 mg l tboep fitted the first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0 314 h 1 fig 1 tboep in abiotic and heat inactivated controls exhibited no significant decrease indicating that microbial activity was responsible for tboep degradation fig s10 p6 bboehep and p10 boebhep were two major transformation products via ether cleavage their relative high concentrations during the degradation showed that ether cleavage was the major pathway for tboep degradation by the bacterial enrichment culture in this study p6 firstly increased to peak concentration at 6 h which corresponded to the time when tboep was fully degraded p6 then dropped to below the detection limit at 16 h without any lag period the decrease of p6 probably corresponded to the increase of p10 a plausible transformation product from p6 via ether cleavage to 10 h p10 deceased a little bit from 10 to 12 h and was stable till the end of the experiment implying its persistence ether bond cleavage was identified as the major mechanism of tboep transformation by the enrichment culture in this study but was a minor pathway in sludge cultures established by hou et al which was likely as a result of different functional bacteria in different cultures hou et al 2021 p11 a plausible transformation product from p6 and p10 via phosphoester bond hydrolysis and or from p12 via ether bond cleavage increased to peak concentration at 6 h which corresponded to the time when tboep was fully degraded after 6 h p11 was stable till 12 h and then increased a little bit till the end of the experiment indicating that the further degradation of p11 may be difficult p12 s peak concentrations appeared at 6 h in accordance with the time when tboep was fully degraded p12 decreased a little bit from 6 h to 8 h and remained stable in this study only 0 21 of initial amount of tboep was transformed to p12 on a molar basis indicating that phosphoester bond hydrolysis was not a major pathway in this study which is different from the results from by hou et al 2021 who found that 21 3 43 4 conversion from tboep to bboep in a sludge culture the variety of possible transformation products of tboep indicated the possibility of multiple transformation pathways under environmental conditions and by different microbial communities thus bringing challenges to determine the primary pathway and identify the bottleneck problem of degradation resistance of transformation products to further microbial degradation was observed bboehep p6 was immediately degraded in this study but was found to accumulate in a sludge culture indicating different degradation capabilities by different bacterial communities hou et al 2021 bboep p12 and two newly identified products from ether cleavage boebhep p10 and boehehp p11 were found accumulated in this study which may continue to exert toxic effect after tboep was degraded the difficulty in completely mineralizing tboep and the persistence of the transformation products suggested continuous risk after depletion of the parent compound which requires further investigation of the occurrence toxicity and ecological risk of tboep transformation products under environmental conditions 3 3 bacterial community structure and transcriptionally active taxa we characterized the bacterial community compositions with metagenomic sequencing and tracked the activities of community members during the tboep degradation with absolute metatranscriptomic analysis fig s11 metagenomic binning yielded 14 mags of 60 completeness and 10 contamination table s5 the enrichment culture mainly consisted of gammaproteobacteria bacteroidota myxococcota and actinobacteriota the top six abundant mags were three of the phylum gammaproteobacteria including t04 dokdonella t13 rhodanobacteraceae and t20 ottawia one rhodococcus ruber t18 one flavobacteriales t07 and one labilithrix t26 the six mags composed 97 6 of the binned population the relative abundance profiles of mags remained stable during the degradation of tboep fig s12 the metatranscriptome of the enrichment culture was characterized following the addition of 50 mg l of tboep after a starvation period of 36 h higher total absolute abundances of transcripts after tboep addition were observed for all mags suggesting that all the community members were active and benefited from tboep degradation fig s12 the addition of tboep brought about the upregulation of genes associated with central metabolism including carbon metabolism biosynthesis of amino acids and citrate cycle fig s13 however only a small portion of genes were upregulated fig s14 meyer cifuentes et al 2020 at 2 h after tboep addition when 34 4 tboep was degraded 13 2 of detected genes in the metatranscriptome were upregulated and 11 0 were downregulated at the time point of 9 h when tboep was depleted and p6 bboehep was being degraded 11 0 of detected genes were upregulated while 8 2 were downregulated t18 contributed with the highest amount of upregulated transcripts at both time point 2 h and 9 h 54 9 and 60 8 of the total upregulated genes respectively although it is not the most abundant mag in metagenome fig 2 t20 the most abundant mag in metagenome showed transcript upregulation at time point 2 h 18 4 of the total upregulated genes but not at 9 h 3 19 of the total upregulated genes t18 and t20 were overall the most upregulated mags suggesting their potential participation in the tboep degradation fig 2 for each time point the downregulated transcripts were primarily attributed by members of low abundances in the community such as t03 t16 and t26 fig 2 it is noted that for some mags genes downregulated or unchanged during tboep degradation were later upregulated during the degradation of transformation products for example only 2 72 of t26 genes were upregulated at 2 h compared with 0 h while 22 6 of its genes were upregulated at 9 h compared with 2 h fig s14 the low activity during tboep degradation of t26 may suggest its disadvantage in metabolizing tboep similar phenomenon was observed for t03 t05 t07 t08 t13 t16 t21 and t25 suggesting that those community members may benefit more from the metabolism of the available transformation products than the parent compound the different gene expression dynamics of different community members may imply their distinct substrate preference and functionality in the community 3 4 genomic context and expression of putative tboep degradation genes the bacterial tboep degradation in this study involved ether bond cleavage phosphoester bond hydrolysis and the terminal oxidation of the butoxyethyl group according to the identified transformation products and kinetic analyses fig s9 the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data was analyzed with a focus on genes potentially related to those pathways including monooxygenase genes dehydrogenase genes and phosphoesterase genes fig 3 s15 monooxygenase genes are expected to catalyze the hydroxylation of the butoxyethyl group and initiate the degradation of tboep white et al 1996 woiski et al 2020 hydroxylation of the carbon atom adjacent to the ether bond leads to the ether cleavage with the formation of corresponding alcohol and aldehyde white et al 1996 which was the major tboep transformation pathway in this study fig s16 additionally the hydroxylation could occur at the terminal carbon generating products such as 4 oh tboep and 4 oh bboehep that could be further transformed by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases in this study genes coding for monooxygenases were mainly from t20 and t18 t18 as classified as rhodocuccus ruber strain c1 zhao et al 2021 was the most active mag in the community t18 contains various monooxygenase genes including alkane 1 monooxygenase genes alkb propane monooxygenase genes prma phenol 2 monooxygenase dmpp and phea flavin dependent monooxygenase genes fmo and cytochrome p450 genes cyp many of which were highly expressed throughout the whole degradation process implying their involvement in the key step of hydroxylation of tboep and its metabolites fig 4 a 4b and s17 the ability of rhodococcus strains to breakdown ether bond using p450 and flavin dependent monooxygenases has been demonstrated malandain et al 2010 moreno horn et al 2003 genes coding for cytochrome p450 flavin containing monooxygenase alkb and prma were also found present in many alkyl ether utilizing rhodocuccus strains kim et al 2007 for t18 cytochrome p450 likely played a major role in the hydroxylation of tboep and its metabolites since 10 out of 11 identified cyp genes were upregulated during the degradation process the alkb is believed to catalyze the terminal hydroxylation of alkanes and alkb gene from rhodococcus sp strain bcp1 could be induced by c6 c22 alkanes cappelletti et al 2011 kim et al 2008 the upregulation of all four identified alkb genes of t18 in the presence of tboep may suggest their involvement in the terminal hydroxylation of tboep fig s16 t20 is identified as ottowia and is another major source for monooxygenase genes in the enrichment culture two soluble di iron monooxygenase sdimo gene clusters including dmpnlmopk gene cluster encoding phenol 2 monooxygenase and tmoabcdef gene cluster encoding toluene 4 monooxygenase were identified in t20 fig 3 the dmp genes and tmo genes were found significantly upregulated in the presence of tboep but not after tboep depletion which indicated that those monooxygenases likely metabolized tboep but not the transformation products fig 4c 4d s17 toluene monooxygenase from burkholderia cepacia g4 pr1 was previously observed to oxidize diethyl ether for growth hur et al 1997 azoarcus sp strain dd4 could use toluene monooxygenase to cooxidize 1 4 dioxane a cyclic ether compound deng et al 2020 it is likely that phenol and toluene monooxygenases have the ability to oxidize ether compounds such as tboep the discovery of three sdimo gene clusters dmp genes and tmo genes from t18 prm genes from t20 in the metagenome and their upregulation during tboep degradation may imply the importance of sdimo in ether degradation woiski et al 2020 overall the diversity of monooxygenase genes cytochrome p450 monooxygenases flavin dependent monooxygenases soluble di iron monoxoygenases and alkane monooxygenases possessed by t18 and t20 could possibly explain the formation of various isomers of hydroxylated tboep in the enrichment culture the different position of hydroxylation then led to distinct downstream pathways fig s16 the variety of monooxygenase genes also showed the genetic redundancy of t18 and t20 which implies their potential in oxidation of anthropogenic pollutants on the other hand the lack of monooxygenase genes in other mags may explain their low activity during tboep degradation dehydrogenase genes including genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenases adh methanol dehydrogenases mdh and aldehyde dehydrogenases aldh are responsible for the subsequent metabolism of alcohols and aldehydes produced from tboep degradation they were likely responsible for the production of p4 tboep cho and p5 tboep cooh and the metabolism of butanal an expected side product from ether cleavage of tboep dehydrogenase genes were widespread and expressed in all mags yet only 12 9 14 3 were found upregulated at 2 h and 9 h after tboep addition fig 3 s15 the upregulated dehydrogenase genes were mainly from t18 t20 t16 and t08 dehydrogenase genes from t18 were highly expressed throughout the degradation process while upregulation of dehydrogenase genes from t20 was primarily during the degradation of tboep t16 contained 36 dehydrogenase genes two of which were upregulated during the whole degradation process and another three were upregulated after tboep depletion two dehydrogenase genes possessed by t08 were also upregulated during the whole degradation process it is likely that most of the community members were able to utilize the transformation products from tboep to support their growth phosphoester bond hydrolysis is a typical route for the biodegradation of opes which in this study contributed to bacterial tboep transformation as a minor pathway phosphoesterase genes likely generated p11 boehehp and p12 bboep both of which are diester products phosphoesterase genes including phosphotriesterase genes pte phosphodiesterase genes pde alkaline phosphatase alp acid phosphatase acp and metallophosphoesterase mpe are identified and expressed in 13 out of the 14 mags indicating their common presence fig 3 s14 t18 contributed to 13 out of the 18 upregulated phosphoesterase genes at 2 h and 10 out of the 18 upregulated phosphoesterase genes at 9 h suggesting its major role in hydrolyzing tboep and the metabolites other upregulated phosphoesterase genes were from t02 and t25 fig s15 suggesting that they may also contribute to tboep hydrolysis 4 conclusions in summary our results provided a comprehensive understanding of tboep biotransformation and showed that the integration of high resolution mass spectrometry and meta omics is an effective approach to elucidate transformation pathways and identify the functional bacteria during different degradation stages the diversity of transformation products identified in this study indicated the necessity to determine the major transformation pathway and the corresponding functional bacteria under different environmental conditions which could be affected by the contamination level the presence of other contaminants and the availability of other carbon sources the absolute metatranscriptomic analysis allows more accurate assessment of the gene expression pattern of the microbial community it is noteworthy that the metabolic activity of different mags varied during different stages of degradation it is likely that two mags t18 and t20 were responsible for the hydroxylation of tboep while other members of the community utilized the transformation products for growth this synergistic interaction is important for the degradation of anthropogenic pollutants and the stability of the whole microbial community the advanced understanding of bacterial tboep degradation of this study provided research foundation

biotransformation of tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep a frequently detected alkyl ope by a bacterial enrichment culture under aerobic conditions the enrichment culture degraded 5 mg l tboep following the first order kinetics with a reaction rate constant of 0 314 h 1 tboep was mainly degraded via ether bond cleavage evidenced by the production of bis 2 butoxyethyl hydroxyethyl phosphate 2 butoxyethyl bis 2 hydroxyethyl phosphate and 2 butoxyethyl 2 hydroxyethyl hydrogen phosphate other transformation pathways include terminal oxidation of the butoxyethyl group and phosphoester bond hydrolysis metagenomic sequencing generated 14 metagenome assembled genomes mags showing that the enrichment culture primarily consisted of gammaproteobacteria bacteroidota myxococcota and actinobacteriota one mag assigned to rhodocuccus ruber strain c1 was the most active in the community showing upregulation of various monooxygenase dehydrogenase and phosphoesterase genes throughout the degradation process and thus was identified as the key degrader of tboep and the metabolites another mag affiliated with ottowia mainly contributed to tboep hydroxylation our results provided a

have been increasingly used as flame retardants and plasticizers in consumer and industrial products li et al 2019 the large volume of production and wide range of application of opes resulted in their ubiquitous contamination in surface water kim and kannan 2018 sediments zeng et al 2018 ye et al 2021 soils zhang et al 2022 indoor environments tan et al 2019 and biota zhao et al 2019 which represents potential risk to public health and ecosystem blum et al 2019 li et al 2020 after being released into the environment opes are transformed into various products through chemical photochemical and biological processes hou et al 2016 su et al 2016 transformation products could be more persistent and toxic than their parent compound liu et al 2021a thus the risk of transformation products should be considered in a comprehensive risk assessment of opes most ope transformation studies focused on in vitro and in vivo metabolism based on fishes rats and human liver microsomes li et al 2021 liu et al 2021b while minimal attention has been paid to ope s microbial transformation which is of substantial significance for ope s environmental fate there remains inadequate knowledge about the diversity of ope transformation products and their environmental fate under different environmental conditions tboep a typical alkyl ope is one of the most frequently encountered and abundant opes detected in surface water sediment and wastewater treatment plants wwtps wang et al 2020 xu et al 2019 toxicity studies have confirmed the adverse effects of tboep on human health including endocrine disrupting effects and carcinogenicity matthews et al 1993 kojima et al 2013 in wwtps tboep s removal efficiency varied from 20 to 90 based on the employed wastewater

van den eede et al 2015 hou et al 2018 microbial tboep degradation was investigated in an enriched sludge culture which achieved 33 8 removal after 5 days incubation hou et al 2021 the dominant transformation product was bboep and other metabolites included bis 2 butoxyethyl hydroxyl 3 butoxyethyl phosphate 3 oh tboep bboehep and bis 2 butoxyethyl methyl phosphate klebsiella was significantly enriched and was considered to be associated with tboep degradation hou et al 2021 there is very limited information about the bacterial degraders and their specific roles during the degradation process which is important to understand the environmental fate of tboep the objective of this study is to investigate the bacterial transformation of tboep by an enrichment culture with tboep as the sole carbon source we elucidated the transformation pathway of tboep characterized the kinetics of tboep degradation and the transformation product accumulation we also identified the functional bacteria involved in different stages of the degradation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals tboep 94 was obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mi usa bboep 96 was purchased from toronto research chemicals toronto ontario canada chromatographic grade methanol 99 purity was from merck darmstadt germany and formic acid was from cnw technologies gmbh düsseldorf germany water was produced with a milli q synthesis water purification system 18 2 mω cm burlington ma usa 2 2 enrichment culture set up the enrichment culture was inoculated with an activated sludge sample from a wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china briefly 1 g of activated sludge after centrifugation was mixed with 100 ml minimal salt medium msm and 50 mg l tboep in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask although tboep was usually detected at μg l level in surface water and wwtps the relatively high concentrations were employed to establish enrichment culture to obtain enough biomass for microbial analyses after eight tboep additions the enrichment culture was sub cultured 5 v v in fresh medium until a stable tboep degrading culture was obtained all cultures were maintained with msm under aerobic conditions in a shaker at 120 rpm and 25 c msm contained nh4 2so4 1 g l k2hpo4 4 11 g l kh2po4 0 95 g l mgso4 0 2 g l mnso4 h2o 3 mg l znso4 7h2o 1 mg l coso4 7h2o 1 mg l nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 1 mg l feso4

included as abiotic controls before instrumental analysis 0 75 ml of sample was mixed with equal volume of methanol and passed through a 0 22 μm ptfe membrane filter supelco corporation usa to identify the key tboep degrading bacteria another tboep degradation experiment was performed in triplicate by batch experiments the enrichment culture was starved for 36 h before 50 mg l tboep amendment biomass samples at the beginning of the experiment during tboep degradation and when tboep was depleted were used for rna extraction immediately after collection and stored at 80 oc before dna extraction 2 3 identification and quantification of tboep transformation products transformation products of tboep was screened by a thermo ultimate 3000 uhplc system couple to an orbitrap fusion tribrid mass spectrometer orbitrap fusion tms thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa uhplc orbitrap fusion tms transformation products were identified based on the following criteria schymanski et al

ca usa lc ms ms p6 p10 and p11 were semi quantified with peak area because no synthesized standard was available while tboep and p12 bboep were quantified by reference standards the detailed chromatography and mass spectrometry conditions for uhplc orbitrap fusion tms and lc ms ms were described in supplemental methods 2 4 metagenomic sequencing dna from enrichment culture samples was extracted with dneasy powersoil kit qiagen germantown md sequencing libraries were constructed with nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina new england biolabs ma usa paired end sequencing was performed on an ilumina novaseq platform at guangdong magigene biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china raw reads 102 31 gb for 9 samples were quality filtered by trimmomatic v0 36 bolger et al 2014 and then de novo assembled by megahit v1 2 9 li et al 2016 contigs were binned based on read coverage coverage variance and tetranucleotide frequencies using metabat2 v2 12 1 kang et al 2019 in sensitive mode the quality of generated metagenome assembled genomes mags was assessed by checkm v1 1 3 parks et al 2015 taxonomies of the mags with 60 completeness and 10 contamination were inferred using gtdb tk v1 3 0 parks et al 2018 the open reading frames orfs of each mag were annotated using glimmer v3 02 delcher et al 2007 orfs were searched against kegg kanehisa and goto 2000 uniprot the uniprot consortium 2020 and ncbi nr databases with diamond v0 9 14 115 buchfink et al 2015 and blastp v2 5 0 altschul et al 1990 for annotation reads were mapped to mags with bbmap to calculate relative abundances 2 5 metatranscriptomic sequencing rna from enrichment culture samples was extracted with rneasy powerwater kit qiagen germantown md briefly mrna libraries were prepared with nebnext ultra nondirectional rna library prep kit for illumina new england biolabs ma usa and sequenced on an ilumina novaseq platform to produce 150 bp paired end reads at guangdong magigene biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china raw reads 106 59 gb for 9 samples were filtered and trimmed with trimmomatic v0 36 bolger et al 2014 and then mapped against mags by rsem v1 3 1 li and dewey 2011 the raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences were available in the ncbi sequence read archive under accession number prjna897252 to estimate the mrna loss during the extraction and the sequencing process luciferase control mrna 5 ng genbank accession no x65316 promega madison wi was added to biomass samples before the cell lysis step liang et al 2017 the absolute quantification of transcripts was conducted according to delogu et al 2020 with luciferase control mrna as the internal standard as described in supplemental methods table s4 2 6 statistical analyses differential gene expression analysis was conducted across metatranscriptome to determine gene expression patterns during tboep degradation using deseq2 v1 36 0 love et al 2014 in rstudio rstudio team 2015 significantly differentially expressed genes were identified with more than twofold change log2 fold change 1 or 1 and a significant p value adjusted with benjamin and hochberg method p adj 0 05 benjamini and hochberg 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of tboep transformation products in total 12 transformation products were identified 11 of which tentatively based on accurate masses and isotope patterns denoted p1 p11 table 1 fig s1 and one of which by comparing with the authentic reference standard p12 ms ms information was acquired for six transformation products with the most intense peaks and parent compound tboep p0 fig s2 s8 p1 p2 p3 had fragments with m z values of 415 2448 416 2480 and isotope patterns coinciding with the formula of c18h39o8p the ms ms spectra included feature fragments of the parent compound m z values of 299 1611 and 199 0728 and showed the common presence of fragments of m z values of 397 2342 and 315 1563 indicating an intact structure of tboep additionally the presence of fragment of m z value of 397 2342 indicated the loss of h2o from fragment of m z value of 415 2923 indicating the presence of a hydroxyl group in the structure thus p1 p2 and p3 were identified as the hydroxylation products of tboep and a total of four isomers could be possible with hydroxylation occurring at an internal or a terminal carbon of the butoxyethyl group hydroxylated tboep has been detected in sludge culture under aerobic conditions hou et al 2021 and in various tissues of common carp cyprinus carpio and chinese rare minnow gobiocypris rarus exposed to tboep hou et al 2019 tang et al 2019 p4 m z 413 2289 414 2323 corresponded to c18h37o8p which was probably aldehydes oxidized from tboep oh with the hydroxyl group on the terminal carbon p5 m z 429 2240 430 2278 was c18h37o9p which was possibly the carboxylic acid product of p4 the predicted formulae for p6 and p10 were c14h31o7p and c10h23o7p respectively the ms ms spectrum of p6 included the fragment of m z value of 299 1612 which indicated the presence of bboep in the structure and the loss of c2h4o from the fragment 343 1873 the ms ms spectrum of p10 included fragments of m z values of 243 0987 and 143 0102 which indicated the loss of c2h4o and c6h12o p6 and p10 were then identified as bis 2 butoxyethyl 2 hydroxyethyl phosphate bboehep and 2 butoxyethyl bis 2 hydroxyethyl phosphate boebhep respectively which were further products from hydroxylated tboep and bboehep with the hydroxyl group on a carbon atom adjunct to the oxygen atom 1 oh tboep 1 oh boebhep the detection of p6 and p10 evidenced the occurrence of bacterial ether cleavage of tboep similarly p7 p8 and p9 were identified as ether cleavage products from hydroxylated tboep p1 p2 and p3 or hydroxylated products of p6 without differentiating the possible four isomers and were annotated as bboehep oh ether cleavage of tboep has been observed previously based on the detection of bboehep p6 hou et al 2021 and it is the first time that boebhep p10 was detected as ether cleavage product from bboehep p6 p11 was identified as 2 butoxyethyl 2 hydroxyethyl hydrogen phosphate boehehp based on the m z values of 243 0988 244 1022 an isotope pattern similar to c8h19o6p and the ms ms profile indicating the presence of a 2 butoxyethyl acid phosphate m z 199 0725 and a c2h4o moiety in the structure p11 was likely formed via the combination of ether cleavage and phosphoester bond hydrolysis it is the first time that p11 was identified as tboep transformation products p12 was identified as bboep in comparison to the authentic reference standard which was likely formed via phosphoester bond hydrolysis 3 2 kinetics of tboep degradation and product accumulation we delineated the kinetics of tboep degradation and the accumulation of four major transformation products the degradation of 5 mg l tboep fitted the first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0 314 h 1 fig 1 tboep in abiotic and heat inactivated controls exhibited no significant decrease indicating that microbial activity was responsible for tboep degradation fig s10 p6 bboehep and p10 boebhep were two major transformation products via ether cleavage their relative high concentrations during the degradation showed that ether cleavage was the major pathway for tboep degradation by the bacterial enrichment culture in this study p6 firstly increased to peak concentration at 6 h which corresponded to the time when tboep was fully degraded p6 then dropped to below the detection limit at 16 h without any lag period the decrease of p6 probably corresponded to the increase of p10 a plausible transformation product from p6 via ether cleavage to 10 h p10 deceased a little bit from 10 to 12 h and was stable till the end of the experiment implying its persistence ether bond cleavage was identified as the major mechanism of tboep transformation by the enrichment culture in this study but was a minor pathway in sludge cultures established by hou et al which was likely as a result of different functional bacteria in different cultures hou et al 2021 p11 a plausible transformation product from p6 and p10 via phosphoester bond hydrolysis and or from p12 via ether bond cleavage increased to peak concentration at 6 h which corresponded to the time when tboep was fully degraded after 6 h p11 was stable till 12 h and then increased a little bit till the end of the experiment indicating that the further degradation of p11 may be difficult p12 s peak concentrations appeared at 6 h in accordance with the time when tboep was fully degraded p12 decreased a little bit from 6 h to 8 h and remained stable in this study only 0 21 of initial amount of tboep was transformed to p12 on a molar basis indicating that phosphoester bond hydrolysis was not a major pathway in this study which is different from the results from by hou et al 2021 who found that 21 3 43 4 conversion from tboep to bboep in a sludge culture the variety of possible transformation products of tboep indicated the possibility of multiple transformation pathways under environmental conditions and by different microbial communities thus bringing challenges to determine the primary pathway and identify the bottleneck problem of degradation resistance of transformation products to further microbial degradation was observed bboehep p6 was immediately degraded in this study but was found to accumulate in a sludge culture indicating different degradation capabilities by different bacterial communities hou et al 2021 bboep p12 and two newly identified products from ether cleavage boebhep p10 and boehehp p11 were found accumulated in this study which may continue to exert toxic effect after tboep was degraded the difficulty in completely mineralizing tboep and the persistence of the transformation products suggested continuous risk after depletion of the parent compound which requires further investigation of the occurrence toxicity and ecological risk of tboep transformation products under environmental conditions 3 3 bacterial community structure and transcriptionally active taxa we characterized the bacterial community compositions with metagenomic sequencing and tracked the activities of community members during the tboep degradation with absolute metatranscriptomic analysis fig s11 metagenomic binning yielded 14 mags of 60 completeness and 10 contamination table s5 the enrichment culture mainly consisted of gammaproteobacteria bacteroidota myxococcota and actinobacteriota the top six abundant mags were three of the phylum gammaproteobacteria including t04 dokdonella t13 rhodanobacteraceae and t20 ottawia one rhodococcus ruber t18 one flavobacteriales t07 and one labilithrix t26 the six mags composed 97 6 of the binned population the relative abundance profiles of mags remained stable during the degradation of tboep fig s12 the metatranscriptome of the enrichment culture was characterized following the addition of 50 mg l of tboep after a starvation period of 36 h higher total absolute abundances of transcripts after tboep addition were observed for all mags suggesting that all the community members were active and benefited from tboep degradation fig s12 the addition of tboep brought about the upregulation of genes associated with central metabolism including carbon metabolism biosynthesis of amino acids and citrate cycle fig s13 however only a small portion of genes were upregulated fig s14 meyer cifuentes et al 2020 at 2 h after tboep addition when 34 4 tboep was degraded 13 2 of detected genes in the metatranscriptome were upregulated and 11 0 were downregulated at the time point of 9 h when tboep was depleted and p6 bboehep was being degraded 11 0 of detected genes were upregulated while 8 2 were downregulated t18 contributed with the highest amount of upregulated transcripts at both time point 2 h and 9 h 54 9 and 60 8 of the total upregulated genes respectively although it is not the most abundant mag in metagenome fig 2 t20 the most abundant mag in metagenome showed transcript upregulation at time point 2 h 18 4 of the total upregulated genes but not at 9 h 3 19 of the total upregulated genes t18 and t20 were overall the most upregulated mags suggesting their potential participation in the tboep degradation fig 2 for each time point the downregulated transcripts were primarily attributed by members of low abundances in the community such as t03 t16 and t26 fig 2 it is noted that for some mags genes downregulated or unchanged during tboep degradation were later upregulated during the degradation of transformation products for example only 2 72 of t26 genes were upregulated at 2 h compared with 0 h while 22 6 of its genes were upregulated at 9 h compared with 2 h fig s14 the low activity during tboep degradation of t26 may suggest its disadvantage in metabolizing tboep similar phenomenon was observed for t03 t05 t07 t08 t13 t16 t21 and t25 suggesting that those community members may benefit more from the metabolism of the available transformation products than the parent compound the different gene expression dynamics of different community members may imply their distinct substrate preference and functionality in the community 3 4 genomic context and expression of putative tboep degradation genes the bacterial tboep degradation in this study involved ether bond cleavage phosphoester bond hydrolysis and the terminal oxidation of the butoxyethyl group according to the identified transformation products and kinetic analyses fig s9 the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data was analyzed with a focus on genes potentially related to those pathways including monooxygenase genes dehydrogenase genes and phosphoesterase genes fig 3 s15 monooxygenase genes are expected to catalyze the hydroxylation of the butoxyethyl group and initiate the degradation of tboep white et al 1996 woiski et al 2020 hydroxylation of the carbon atom adjacent to the ether bond leads to the ether cleavage with the formation of corresponding alcohol and aldehyde white et al 1996 which was the major tboep transformation pathway in this study fig s16 additionally the hydroxylation could occur at the terminal carbon generating products such as 4 oh tboep and 4 oh bboehep that could be further transformed by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases in this study genes coding for monooxygenases were mainly from t20 and t18 t18 as classified as rhodocuccus ruber strain c1 zhao et al 2021 was the most active mag in the community t18 contains various monooxygenase genes including alkane 1 monooxygenase genes alkb propane monooxygenase genes prma phenol 2 monooxygenase dmpp and phea flavin dependent monooxygenase genes fmo and cytochrome p450 genes cyp many of which were highly expressed throughout the whole degradation process implying their involvement in the key step of hydroxylation of tboep and its metabolites fig 4 a 4b and s17 the ability of rhodococcus strains to breakdown ether bond using p450 and flavin dependent monooxygenases has been demonstrated malandain et al 2010 moreno horn et al 2003 genes coding for cytochrome p450 flavin containing monooxygenase alkb and prma were also found present in many alkyl ether utilizing rhodocuccus strains kim et al 2007 for t18 cytochrome p450 likely played a major role in the hydroxylation of tboep and its metabolites since 10 out of 11 identified cyp genes were upregulated during the degradation process the alkb is believed to catalyze the terminal hydroxylation of alkanes and alkb gene from rhodococcus sp strain bcp1 could be induced by c6 c22 alkanes cappelletti et al 2011 kim et al 2008 the upregulation of all four identified alkb genes of t18 in the presence of tboep may suggest their involvement in the terminal hydroxylation of tboep fig s16 t20 is identified as ottowia and is another major source for monooxygenase genes in the enrichment culture two soluble di iron monooxygenase sdimo gene clusters including dmpnlmopk gene cluster encoding phenol 2 monooxygenase and tmoabcdef gene cluster encoding toluene 4 monooxygenase were identified in t20 fig 3 the dmp genes and tmo genes were found significantly upregulated in the presence of tboep but not after tboep depletion which indicated that those monooxygenases likely metabolized tboep but not the transformation products fig 4c 4d s17 toluene monooxygenase from burkholderia cepacia g4 pr1 was previously observed to oxidize diethyl ether for growth hur et al 1997 azoarcus sp strain dd4 could use toluene monooxygenase to cooxidize 1 4 dioxane a cyclic ether compound deng et al 2020 it is likely that phenol and toluene monooxygenases have the ability to oxidize ether compounds such as tboep the discovery of three sdimo gene clusters dmp genes and tmo genes from t18 prm genes from t20 in the metagenome and their upregulation during tboep degradation may imply the importance of sdimo in ether degradation woiski et al 2020 overall the diversity of monooxygenase genes cytochrome p450 monooxygenases flavin dependent monooxygenases soluble di iron monoxoygenases and alkane monooxygenases possessed by t18 and t20 could possibly explain the formation of various isomers of hydroxylated tboep in the enrichment culture the different position of hydroxylation then led to distinct downstream pathways fig s16 the variety of monooxygenase genes also showed the genetic redundancy of t18 and t20 which implies their potential in oxidation of anthropogenic pollutants on the other hand the lack of monooxygenase genes in other mags may explain their low activity during tboep degradation dehydrogenase genes including genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenases adh methanol dehydrogenases mdh and aldehyde dehydrogenases aldh are responsible for the subsequent metabolism of alcohols and aldehydes produced from tboep degradation they were likely responsible for the production of p4 tboep cho and p5 tboep cooh and the metabolism of butanal an expected side product from ether cleavage of tboep dehydrogenase genes were widespread and expressed in all mags yet only 12 9 14 3 were found upregulated at 2 h and 9 h after tboep addition fig 3 s15 the upregulated dehydrogenase genes were mainly from t18 t20 t16 and t08 dehydrogenase genes from t18 were highly expressed throughout the degradation process while upregulation of dehydrogenase genes from t20 was primarily during the degradation of tboep t16 contained 36 dehydrogenase genes two of which were upregulated during the whole degradation process and another three were upregulated after tboep depletion two dehydrogenase genes possessed by t08 were also upregulated during the whole degradation process it is likely that most of the community members were able to utilize the transformation products from tboep to support their growth phosphoester bond hydrolysis is a typical route for the biodegradation of opes which in this study contributed to bacterial tboep transformation as a minor pathway phosphoesterase genes likely generated p11 boehehp and p12 bboep both of which are diester products phosphoesterase genes including phosphotriesterase genes pte phosphodiesterase genes pde alkaline phosphatase alp acid phosphatase acp and metallophosphoesterase mpe are identified and expressed in 13 out of the 14 mags indicating their common presence fig 3 s14 t18 contributed to 13 out of the 18 upregulated phosphoesterase genes at 2 h and 10 out of the 18 upregulated phosphoesterase genes at 9 h suggesting its major role in hydrolyzing tboep and the metabolites other upregulated phosphoesterase genes were from t02 and t25 fig s15 suggesting that they may also contribute to tboep hydrolysis 4 conclusions in summary our results provided a comprehensive understanding of tboep biotransformation and showed that the integration of high resolution mass spectrometry and meta omics is an effective approach to elucidate transformation pathways and identify the functional bacteria during different degradation stages the diversity of transformation products identified in this study indicated the necessity to determine the major transformation pathway and the corresponding functional bacteria under different environmental conditions which could be affected by the contamination level the presence of other contaminants and the availability of other carbon sources the absolute metatranscriptomic analysis allows more accurate assessment of the gene expression pattern of the microbial community it is noteworthy that the metabolic activity of different mags varied during different stages of degradation it is likely that two mags t18 and t20 were responsible for the hydroxylation of tboep while other members of the community utilized the transformation products for growth this synergistic interaction is important for the degradation of anthropogenic pollutants and the stability of the whole microbial community the advanced understanding of bacterial tboep degradation of this study provided research foundation

14996,this study evaluates for the first time the impact of a large wildfire on the hydrogeochemistry of a deeply amd affected river at the beginning of the wet season to accomplish this a high resolution water monitoring campaign was performed within the basin coinciding with the first rainfalls after summer unlike similar events recorded in amd affected areas where dramatic increases in most dissolved element concentrations and decreases in ph values are observed as a result of evaporitic salts flushing and the transport of sulfide oxidation products from mine sites a slight increase in ph values from 2 32 to 2 88 and decrease in element concentrations e g fe 443 to 205 mg l al 1805 to 1059 mg l sulfate 22 8 to 13 3 g l was observed with the first rainfalls after the fire the washout of wildfire ash deposited in the riverbanks and the drainage area constituted by alkaline mineral phases seems to have counterbalanced the usual behavior and patterns of the river hydrogeochemistry during autumn geochemical results indicate that a preferential dissolution occurs during ash washout k ca na with a quick release of k followed by an intense dissolution of ca and na on the other hand in unburnt zones parameters and concentrations vary to a lesser extent than burnt areas being the washout of evaporitic salts the dominant process with subsequent rainfalls ash plays a minor role on the river hydrochemistry elemental ratios fe so4 and ca mg and geochemical tracers in both ash k ca and na and amd s were used to prove the importance of ash washout as the dominant geochemical process during the study period geochemical and mineralogical evidences point to intense schwertmannite precipitation as the main driver of reduction in metal pollution the results of this study shed light on the response of amd polluted rivers to certain climate change effects since climate models predict an increase in the number and intensity of wildfires and torrential rain events

after intense sulfide oxidation processes nordstrom et al 2015 these processes may irreversibly worsen the conditions of the receiving watercourses for a long term even hundreds to thousands of years after the cease of the mining activity younger 1997 the odiel and tinto watersheds huelva province sw spain are globally recognized examples of amd pollution due to the low ph values and extreme metal loid s and sulfate concentrations observed in their waters as a result of the contribution of numerous discharges of acidic leachates from historically mined massive sulfide deposits cánovas et al 2021 river discharge and hydrogeochemistry vary seasonally with maximum pollutant concentrations during the first rainfalls of autumn caused by the washout of efflorescent salts that commonly precipitate during the dry season and minimum concentrations of pollutants during large flood events by runoff dilution processes e g cánovas et al 2017 olías et al 2020 however these conditions may

damages not only the terrestrial ecosystems but also affects the water bodies in a wide range wildfires may cause severe changes in physico chemical properties of soils increasing the erosion rates and run off generation capacity which may modify sediment fluxes nutrients and other water constituents smith et al 2011 bladon et al 2014 on the one hand riverflow and sediment fluxes may be altered by increased runoff generation induced by the clogging of soil pores by ash bodí et al 2014 limiting the infiltration capacity of soils and by the loss of vegetation and subsequent canopy interception increasing the net precipitation williams et al 2019 on the other hand pereira and úbeda 2010 reported the release of heavy metals from wildfire ash to soils and water bodies after a wildifire in a

is located at the cinco ojos bridge od2 an area widely affected by the fire which receives the amd inputs from the riotinto mines through the agrio creek constituting around 40 60 of the total amd pollution load of the odiel river galván et al 2016 and other minor amd inputs e g poderosa san platón and esperanza mines located in the headwaters downstream two different sampling points located outside of the fire affected area were selected fig 1 the tinto santa rosa bridge od3 and the sotiel bridge od4 which receive in addition to the abovementioned inputs the influence of other minor abandoned mines fig 1 the main mines that contribute to contamination at these points can be seen in fig 1 flood events and the influence of washout processes on the odiel river hydrochemistry has been previously studied at the sampling point od4 due to the existence of a gauge station cánovas et al 2012 the sampling was carried out during autumn 2020 16 09 2020 02 12 2020 samples were taken before during and after rainy episodes n 22 for each sampling point using pre cleaned with 10 hno3 bottles water samples were filtered with 0 22 μm cellulose nitrate filters in total 66 samples were collected acidified to ph 2 with hno3 suprapur and kept refrigerated until analysis different physicochemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured in the field using a previously calibrated crison mm40 multiparameter probe hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany calibration was conducted using standard solutions for ph 4 01 7 00 and 9 21 at 25 c and ec 147 μs cm 1413 μs cm and 12 88 ms cm at 25 c while orp was checked using 220 mv and 470 mv solutions at 25 c redox potential measurements were corrected to standard hydrogen electrode nordstrom and wilde 1998 samples were analyzed at the central research services of the university of huelva by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes jobin yvon ultima 2 for major elements the detection limits were 200 μg l for al ca fe k mg mn na si and s 50 μg l for zn and 5 μg l for cu triplicate analyses were performed to assess the analytical precision which was below 5 rsd in all samples in each analysis sequence control blanks were also analyzed being the concentration of elements below the detection limits in each blank the analytical accuracy was confirmed by the analysis of reference materials nist 1640 dissolved so 4 2 concentrations were calculated from the total s concentrations assuming that the presence of other s species was insignificant which validity was checked using the geochemical code phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 and by comparison with values obtained by ion chromatography ic analysis differences 5 particulate matter retained in cellulose nitrate filters 0 22 µm porosity and mineral assemblages formed by wildfire ash coated with precipitated efflorescent salts deposited in the river margin before the rainy events were collected for mineralogical characterization thus samples were examined using a jeol jsm it500hr field emission scanning electron microscope coupled with oxford x max 150 energy dispersive system fesem eds 2 2 data treatment rainfall data were obtained from a rain gauge station located at the odiel river basin at el campillo about 8 km from od2 and flow information was acquired from the stream gauge station at od4 sotiel coronada fig 1 all belonging to the monitoring network of the andalusian government the net acidity na in samples was determined according to kirby and cravotta 2005 which include proton concentration and hydrolysable elements such as fe al and mn modified to consider other hydrolysable elements commonly found in amd such as cu zn co and ni for comparison purposes chemical data were obtained from biomass ash table sm1 which may be analogue to the wildfire ash produced in the wildfire this material comes from the combustion of local agroforestry biomass mostly eucalyptus or mixtures to produce electricity in a close power plant even though the formation conditions of both ash types may be different since biomass ash is created in a controlled environment wang et al 2012 and wildfire conditions strongly vary in time and space bodí et al 2014 biomass ash effects on water and soil can be considered similar to those of wildfire ash hannam et al 2019 the collected ash is mainly composed of sio2 69 3 wt al2o3 11 42 wt cao 7 98 wt k2o 4 44 wt fe2o3 4 80 wt mgo 1 23 wt and to a lesser extent other elements such as na 2 45 g kg p 1 67 g kg ba 0 22 g kg s 0 20 g kg and sr 0 19 g kg among others in a ph paste test solid liquid ratio 1 2 performed to this material ph values rise up to 12 and the alkalinity generated is more than 1000 mg l of caco3 equivalent hydrochemical data prior to the wildfire are also available for the odiel river in 2015 and 2016 at od2 upstream of od2 and the agrio creek table sm2 which joins the river between both points this temporal dataset represents a range of relative contributions of the odiel river and agrio creek upon different hydrological conditions however only those corresponding to the same period before and after the first rainfalls were considered so that chemical water quality of the river before and after the wildfire could be compared saturation indices of waters with respect to some minerals commonly precipitated in amd affected systems were calculated using the phreeqc code v3 7 parkhurst and appelo 2013 with wateq4f thermodynamic database ball and nordstrom 1991 the database was expanded with thermodynamic information for some mineral phases contained in the ash mostly carbonates and oxides of ca k mg and na such as calcite lime periclase sylvite among others as well as with equilibrium constants of schwertmannite from different authors bigham et al 1996 yu et al 1999 sánchez españa et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 response of the river flow to rainfalls the number of weather stations in the odiel river watershed is limited however complete information for the study period was obtained from a gauge and a pluviometric station fig sm1 as can be seen in figure sm1 a fast response of river flow is observed upon the rainfall collected in the catchment thus four main rainy episodes can be identified the first commenced on september 18th with 9 4 mm recorded which led to a slight increase in river flow of around 0 05 m3 s fig sm1 the second episode recorded 49 8 mm on october 20th increasing the river flow to around 3 77 m3 s fig sm1 the third and fourth episodes occurred on november 5th and 25th with 17 4 and 33 6 mm leading to flow rises of up to 2 02 and 19 7 m3 s respectively fig sm1 the watercourses within the odiel river basin commonly show very rapid flow responses to rainfall events due to the low permeability of their materials olías et al 2006 cánovas et al 2007 the increase in humidity of catchment soils with persisting rainy episodes makes that the highest river flow is reached with lower amounts of rainfalls olías et al 2006 the common response of river flow may be enhanced by increased runoff generation induced by wildfire ash clogging soil pores bodí et al 2014 limiting more the infiltration capacity of these soils or by loss of vegetation in the fire and its canopy interception increasing net precipitation williams et al 2019 generally this could potentially increase the erosion of soils and ash delivered to the streams in mediterranean climate rainfalls are scarce over time and take place in short periods within a few days or hours mainly distributed along the wet season september to march however this pattern may change since climate models predict the strengthening of these cycles e g giorgi and lionello 2008 gianakopoulos et al 2009 3 2 temporal evolution of the hydrochemistry the hydrochemistry results of the sampling points od2 od3 and od4 can be seen in tables sm3 sm4 and sm5 respectively the ph values during the study period varied between 2 3 and 3 5 with occasional rises to almost 5 downstream of the burnt areas electrical conductivity values fluctuated drastically throughout the sampling period od2 maximum values reached 17 77 ms cm and minimum values came close to 1 ms cm with sharp variations along the temporal series fig 2a od3 and od4 showed ec values ranging from 2 to 4 ms cm with punctual maximums and minimums 7 02 and 5 86 ms cm of maximum respectively and 0 42 ms cm of minimum for both points fig 2 c and e the response of the parameters to the first rainfalls was unexpected for the three sites given the previously reported behavior of the odiel watershed in such events with sharp increases in dissolved elements and decrease in ph values during the first rainfalls after summer cánovas et al 2007 sarmiento et al 2009 2017 there is a significant drop in ec from 17 77 to 10 65 ms cm at od2 and from 3 74 to 1 97 ms cm at od4 due to a general decrease in dissolved metals concentrations accompanied by a small increase in ph values at the sampling points from 2 32 to 2 88 at od2 and from 3 24 to 3 36 at od4 coinciding with the first rains and their fast response in the river flow fig 2a c and e unfortunately there is missing data in od3 coinciding with the first flow increment however the trend seems to be quite similar to od4 response almost all major element concentrations underwent a drastic drop in od2 fe from 443 to 205 mg l al 1805 to 1059 mg l sulfate 22 760 to 13 296 mg l fig 2b resulting in a sharp decrease for net acidity from an initial value of 12 1 to 7 01 g l caco3 eq after the first rains table sm3 on the other hand concentrations in od3 and od4 remained relatively constant although there is a slight fall in al and sulfate concentrations in od4 fig 2f all elements behaved similarly during these rainfalls except for k and to a lesser extent ca and na potassium concentration underwent an important rise in od2 from 1 11 to 10 3 mg l while ca and na suffered a slight decrease compared to the rest of dissolved elements a few days after the rainy event the physicochemical parameters and concentrations returned to their original pre rain values fig 2 this behavior differs from the typical response of amd affected streams in semiarid catchments when a notable increase in most elements associated with amd is observed either by the washing out of soluble salts accumulated along the riverbanks during the long dry season or by a higher contribution of amd discharges to the river compared to that of runoff water e g johnson and thornton 1987 keith et al 2001 cánovas et al 2008 previous studies on the water composition of the odiel and tinto river watersheds show fast and notable increases in ec at the onset of discharge rises during the first rain events with increased concentrations for most elements related to amd e g sarmiento et al 2009 cánovas et al 2017 olías et al 2020 the influence of the alkaline ash generated by the wildfire and its subsequent washout by run off may have attenuated the typical behavior of the odiel river after the dry season causing the precipitation of mineral phases and thus decreasing the metal content in the water the second river flow increase significantly larger than the first one from 0 05 to 3 77 m3 s led to an extreme decrease in ec values at od2 from 15 15 to 1 28 ms cm concomitant with a ph rise of up to 4 fig 2a on the contrary the opposite tendency was observed in od3 and od4 exhibiting the typical response of a watercourse affected by amd fig 2c and e due to the dissolution of evaporitic salts containing high amounts of toxic elements and acidity ec increased from 3 78 in both sites to 7 02 and 5 86 ms cm respectively while ph declined slightly from 3 16 and 3 25 to 2 91 and 3 04 respectively coinciding with a maximum flow rate 3 77 m3 s at od4 this second event exhibited the largest decrease in acidity table sm3 sulfate and most metal concentrations in od2 fig 2b with decreases ranging from 96 for acidity down to 0 36 g l caco3 eq to more than 90 for major elements fe from 402 to 10 2 mg l al from 1404 to 52 7 mg l sulfate 17 599 to 863 mg l otherwise the decrease in ca and na concentrations was not so marked 26 and 31 in the first event and 83 and 62 in this second event respectively while a slight increase in k concentration was observed from 3 11 to 3 90 mg l compared to the first event as mentioned before a significant increase in concentrations was recorded in od3 and od4 fig 2d and f during these rainfalls contrasting with the upstream sampling point net acidity increased from average values of 1200 mg l to 4500 mg l at od3 table sm4 and 500 to 2900 mg l caco3 eq at od4 table sm5 probably by the intense washout of metal rich efflorescent salts which remained in the riverbanks it is striking that this pollution increase was registered in these last sampling points od3 and od4 but not at the upstream most wildfire affected one od2 this indicates a different dominant process acting along the studied river reach if the second event at od2 would be only controlled by dilution all dissolved concentrations would have undergone similar reduction percentages as stated before this is not the case for k ca and na which behavior may suggest the influence of the wildfire ash dissolution on the contrary at od3 and od4 located farther from fire affected areas no available ash may have been deposited and the predominant process may have been the washout of efflorescent salts as well as the confluence of several amd inputs in this river reach sarmiento et al 2009 moreover considering that the main pollutant load delivered to the odiel river comes from the agrio creek sánchez españa et al 2005 galván et al 2016 which confluence is located upstream of od2 fig 1 is especially significant the substantial decrease in acidity sulfate and metal concentrations observed in od2 during both rain events highlighting the powerful acidity attenuation capacity of wildfire ash there were two additional flow rises in autumn 2020 fig 2 nonetheless the remaining acidity stored in the efflorescent salts may have diminished as a consequence of intense dissolution processes in the prior rainfall events in this sense decreases in metal concentrations 277 39 1 and 64 6 mg l caco3 eq of net acidity for od2 od3 and od4 respectively tables sm3 sm4 and sm5 in all sampling points and the highest ph values 3 53 in od2 and 4 94 in both od3 and od4 were observed at the end of november 2020 fig 2a c and e 3 3 importance of efflorescent salts washout in the river hydrogeochemistry the evaporitic salts wash out process predominantly controls the odiel river hydrogeochemistry with the arrival of rainfall events after the dry season in order to properly evaluate the consequences of this process together with the exceptional occurrence of the wildfire in the area this section shows the evolution of some geochemical tracers during the sampling campaign geochemical tracers are commonly used to identify and quantify geochemical reactions in aquatic systems for example the fe so4 ratio has been used to quantify the importance of pyrite oxidation fe secondary mineral precipitation and evaporitic sulfate salts dissolution in amd affected systems e g buckby et al 2003 cánovas et al 2010 thus the fe so4 ratio in evaporitic sulfate salts or in fe secondary minerals precipitated along riverbanks is higher than in the odiel river waters since iron content in these precipitates is much higher than sulfate content cánovas et al 2007 2010 then dissolution of fe sulfate rich salts may provoke a rise in the river water ratios and this can be used to determine whether the rainy events recorded in this study may have caused the dissolution of efflorescent salts or even if other processes such as dilution or ash flushing have played a major role in water chemistry variations fig 3 a shows a decrease in fe so4 ratio at od2 during the first rainy event while the opposite trend is observed at od4 a sampling point located downstream this could be explained by the alkalinity contribution of the wildfire ash to the water at od2 which is the most fire affected location alkalinity rises the ph and contributes to the precipitation of secondary fe oxyhydroxysulfates during this discharge rise lowering the ratio as explained before the ratio rise at od4 evidenced the salts flushing which may be attenuated by alkalinity running downstream given that metal and sulfate concentrations during the first event remained relatively constant or underwent slight decreases fig 2f the increase in discharge during the second rainy event caused a strong decrease in fe so4 ratios at od2 and increasing ones in both od3 and od4 fig 3a a major ratio peak occurs during the baseflow recession curve for the three sampling points fig 3a in this event the hydrochemistry at od2 would be controlled firstly by run off dilution i e mixing with freshwaters and the relative predominance of wildfire ash over soluble salts dissolution thus the dissolution of remaining wildfire ash would provide additional alkalinity evidenced by an initial sharp decrease in the ratio caused by fe precipitation coinciding with a slight ph rise on october 21st fig 2a followed by an important increase in the ratio due to the dissolution of fe sulfate salts fig 2a both od3 and od4 may have suffered preferentially salts washout processes explained by the progressive increase in fe so4 ratios along the second event fig 3a with no apparent influence of the wildfire ash the last rainy events are initially characterized by a slight rise in the ratio within the rising limb for both od3 and od4 after the dissolution of residual amounts of efflorescent salts followed by remarkable decrease in fe so4 ratios fig 3a due to precipitation processes of fe oxyhydroxysulfates on the contrary od2 ratios decreased evidencing precipitation processes of fe probably influenced by wildfire ash this is supported by the behavior exhibited by ph and ec during these events fig 2 the plotting of ca mg ratios can also provide valuable insights into predominant geochemical processes during the study period efflorescent salts are commonly richer in mg than in ca and typically this ratio may be higher in the odiel river during the dry season due to important evaporitic sulfate precipitation processes and decreasing during the first rainfalls of autumn as a consequence of the salts flush out cánovas et al 2007 the first rise in flow rate shows an evident increase in ca mg at od2 and to a lesser extent at od4 followed by fast drop in the ratio fig 3b this response agrees well with the fe so4 ratios evolution since the effect of the efflorescent salts washout may have been neutralized in od2 and initially attenuated in od4 because of the alkalinity provided by the wildfire ash dissolution within the first rainfall event the second event hydrochemistry at od2 may be still influenced by ash dissolution while at od3 and od4 it should be fully controlled by evaporitic salts dissolution a similar behavior of ca mg to previous fe so4 ratios in the second event fig 3a supports this interpretation besides potassium concentration peaks in od2 fig 3b coinciding with precipitation neutralization evidenced by fe so4 and ca mg ratios highlight the remarkable role played by wildfire ash on the river hydrochemistry the ca mg ratio during the last rainfalls assist in evaluating whether dilution processes are the main factor or there are other factors implied in the hydrochemistry evolution constant ratios at od3 and od4 suggest dilution contrasting the second event ruled by the evaporitic salts washout however at the upstream point of od2 the ratio systematically increases as did in previous events the same case occurs for the na so4 ratio fig sm2 then it is possible that the wildfire ash have controlled the entire temporal series of od2 along with the typical processes occurring in amd waters 3 4 importance of the dissolution of wildfire ash in the river hydrogeochemistry calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na and potassium k are common elements of wildfire ash in which they usually occur as easily leachable mineral species ulery et al 1993 bodí et al 2014 pereira et al 2014 calcium concentrations decrease during the first and second rainy events in od2 as well as most major amd elements around 40 for amd elements and 25 for ca in od2 first event and around 95 and 80 respectively in od2 second event despite that it is expected that some amounts of ca may come from the dissolution of the wildfire ash given that ca is a major component of them and its decrease in concentration is attenuated compared to other amd elements in od2 this also happens for na which decreases accounts for 30 and 60 in the 1st and 2nd events respectively on the other hand k shows sudden increases in each discharge peak fig 3b in an effort to check if the concentrations of these elements in the odiel river are mainly supplied or affected by wildfire ash washout different end members are represented in fig 4 a biomass ash an analogue to wildfire ash b odiel river waters prior to the agrio creek confluence c the agrio creek and d odiel river after the confluence between odiel river and agrio creek where od2 is located cinco ojos bridge in fig 1 generally normal patterns of k concentrations in the odiel river show maximum values during summer and minimum in autumn cánovas et al 2007 coinciding with the first rainfalls after the dry season the solubility of k in amd environments is commonly controlled by jarosite precipitation accornero et al 2005 however during the rainy events in od2 there is a remarkable increase in k concentrations an evolution of k concentration during and after the first rains towards the extreme member of the biomass ash composition is observed this trend is observed not only in the plotting between k s fig 4 but also in ca k and na k fig sm3 the odiel river waters have very similar relationships between k and s contents fig 4 suggesting that dilution and mixing processes between amd affected and unaffected waters may control the solubility of both elements od2 pre rain sample in fig 4 represent concentrations of k s ca k and na k in fig sm3 before the first rainfall of the sampling period when the agrio creek discharge was the main water contributor to the odiel river during the summer od2 1st rain group shows the evolution of these elements during the first discharge rise as can be seen k in these samples moves towards the extreme member of the biomass ash fig 4 also ca k and na k fig sm3 instead of following a pattern of dilution over the shown trend of the odiel river extreme members in addition an increasing release of elements contained in wildfire ash was observed as in ash leaching experiments carried out by audry et al 2014 which reported a preferential release of elements k mg na si ca thus a quick release of k and to a lesser extent ca and na contained in the ash was observed within the first event probably due to a higher solubility of the k mineral phases moreover the major k peak also coincided with the unusual behavior of fe so4 and ca mg ratios showed in fig 3 so there are multiple lines of evidence supporting that the first event is controlled by wildfire ash washout od2 2nd rain group follows the normal trend of the odiel river extreme members nevertheless a slight influence of the biomass ash member is observed fig 4 ca and na concentrations also reveal such influence see fig sm4 given that ca fe and na fe ratios increased during the second rainfall also ca mg in fig 3b and na so4 in fig sm2 concomitant with minor decreases in concentrations compared to other major amd elements these ratios are higher than those expected upon predominance of dilution processes evidencing the probable dissolution of the less soluble phases richer in ca and na contained in the wildfire ash which could not be dissolved during the first rain ash leaching experiments reported by audry et al 2014 exhibited that na is released before ca however ca fe values are much higher than na fe ratio fig sm4 therefore there should be a more significant input of ca than na due to a high ca content in the wildfire ash table sm1 leading to a major release of ca than na see also ca na ratios in fig sm4 concurring with the elements dissolution rates calculated by audry et al 2014 johnston and maher 2022 also reported a similar order in elevated concentrations of k ca and na in summary there is a quick release of k within the first rain event contained in the most soluble phases of the wildfire ash with a lesser dissolution of ca and na phases resulting in an increase of k concentration in the odiel river the second event with a larger increment in run off causes the flush out of the less soluble phases richer in ca and na modifying the typical trend during dilution processes and changing the ratios during the second rainfall this is also demonstrated in concentration discharge hysteresis curves in fig sm5 contrasting previously published hysteresis curves for the amd context cánovas et al 2010 samples collected during the last rainy events exhibited similar relationships between k and s and other elements than those typical of the odiel river which obeys to common dilution processes in this watercourse however ca mg fig 3b and na so4 fig sm2 ratios evidence that ca and na concentrations in the river are still slightly influenced by wildfire ash dissolution although si and mg are also major components of wildfire ash there seems to have no influence on the amd hydrochemistry silicon must be likely hosted in silica phases which are very insoluble whereas in the case of mg its high content in amd may have masked the possible influence of the mg contained in the wildfire ash in order to confirm which mineral phases are precipitating dissolving in the odiel river during the rainy events the saturation indices si of phases commonly found in amd environments sánchez españa et al 2005 have been calculated by phreeqc for simplicity purposes only information in od2 the most affected area by wildfire will be discussed jarosite dissolution might be a source of potassium kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 as a result of ph increments during rainfalls since jarosite group minerals are only stable at very acid conditions das et al 1996 however si showed oversaturation for jarosite ss and k jarosite during the whole event concluding that no k is coming from the dissolution of jarosite table sm6 schwertmannite si values depends greatly on the equilibrium constant used in phreeqc calculations equilibrium constants proposed by sánchez españa et al 2011 and bigham et al 1996 for schwertmannite provided si values showing undersaturation conditions or close to equilibrium in od2 table sm6 however using the thermodynamic data from yu et al 1999 schwertmannite appears to be oversaturated in the whole temporal series table sm6 this concern is due to schwertmannite s metastable nature and its variable composition largely affected by sulfate concentration in the water schoepfer and burton 2021 in a pe ph predominance diagram for stable and metastable fe mineral phases caraballo et al 2013 all od2 samples plot within the schwertmannite field fig sm6 supporting that no jarosite may be precipitating and oversaturation values are probably due to high k concentrations mineralogical evidences support this fact since globular aggregates in samples were observed by fe sem in particulate matter retained in filters which was composed mostly by iron and sulfur suggesting the presence of schwertmannite therefore the mineral assemblage in filters was dominated by silicates and fe mineral phases with a morphology and chemical composition typical of schwertmannite without a clear jarosite identification fig 5 mineral ash portion is mainly constituted by silica carbonates and oxides bodí et al 2014 all k ca and na carbonates oxides and salts considered appear to be undersaturated in these waters table sm6 according to phreeqc calculations that is they can be easily dissolved into the odiel river waters and provide the alkalinity needed to attenuate the amd pollution besides si estimations also support the element release order k mg na si ca observed in this study and previously reported by audry et al 2014 with the k phases having the most subsaturated values expecting a quick dissolution of them followed by na and ca phases since the second rainy event is of greater magnitude than the first one the runoff generated may be enough to dissolve the remaining wildfire ash rich in ca and na that were not previously washed during the first event due to its lower solubility as expected oxides were more subsaturated than carbonates and alkaline salts and should dissolve more easily from the ash 3 5 global implications of this study potassium ca and na have been widely reported to be easily water extractable elements from ash produced in mediterranean regions generated either in wildfires or laboratory experiments ferreira et al 2005 úbeda et al 2009 pereira et al 2012 2014 sequeira et al 2020 observed increases in k ca and na concentrations during the first rainy period after multiple fires occurred in portugal in an area dominated by pinus pinaster also abundant in the study area pereira et al 2011 reported similar responses in a quercus suber forest located in the northeast of the iberian peninsula other studies in the same geographic context costa et al 2014 mansilha et al 2017 showed high values of these elements as well as slight increases in ph and alkalinity in these cases changes in water ph driven by ash leaching could be buffered at ph near neutrality limiting the capacity of ash to increase the ph and alkalinity on the contrary the high reactivity of ash in amd waters higher solubility due to low ph values could lead to a major influence in the water parameters considering that fe buffer occurs at ph 2 5 3 5 nordstrom and alpers 1999 these authors have also reported increases in other elements considered in fresh waters as trace elements but their high concentrations in amd do not allow a proper analysis for example johnston and mahor 2022 showed increases in concentrations following the order k ca so4 hco3 mg cl na in the amd context some of these changes in concentrations would be lost in the amd background because of its extreme concentrations of dissolved elements santín et al 2015 reported a similar response in an australian eucalypt forest fire comparable to the biomass ash used in this research for comparison purposes although these chemical changes in water mostly depend on the composition of the ash generated and then flushed wildfire ash driven neutralization of od2 acid waters was remarkable with decreases in acidity for each rainfall event table sm3 besides this is a striking fact considering the huge acidity load provided by the agrio creek upstream of od2 galván et al 2016 which may have been neutralized by the ash dissolution controlling the hydrogeochemistry of this portion of the odiel river during the study period despite that neutralization is only temporary given that acid conditions are quickly recovered after the rain events and may have occurred until all ashes have been dissolved the watershed is intensely polluted by amd with numerous leachates joining the main odiel watercourse cánovas et al 2021 that is why downstream od3 and od4 the influence of ash dissolution plays a minor role and the hydrogeochemistry is mainly controlled by amd and efflorescent salts washout overall the wildfire ash effects are restrained spatial and temporally by the strong load of acidity reaching the odiel river nonetheless it is expected that in smaller amd affected watercourses the same effects may be magnified even in cases of amd affected water courses with low acidity concentration e g coal mines or smaller sulfide mines lee et al 2002 cravotta 2008 the neutralizing effects of wildfire ash may be more significant and long lasting in addition a long term response of amd affected catchments to wildfire may be the increase in the amd generation rates the loss of vegetation after the wildfire induces a greater water infiltration into waste mine dumps and adits which function as anthropogenic aquifers caraballo et al 2016 promoting the generation of amd canopy interception decrease and overland flow increase after wildfires bodí et al 2014 williams et al 2019 allowing the arrival of greater amounts of water to mine areas in fact murphy et al 2020 observed remobilization of arsenic and other metals from legacy mine waste to surface water due to greater run off during post fire rainfalls 4 conclusions this is the first time that the direct consequences of a wildfire on an amd affected watercourse have been studied the washout of wildfire ash seems to counterbalance the usual behavior and patterns of the odiel river hydrogeochemistry during autumn i e dramatic increases in most elements high ec and decreases in ph values as a result of soluble salts flushing when the first rainfalls after the dry season are recorded due to the wildfire ash washout and the subsequent input of alkalinity to the water during the first rainfalls of autumn 2020 immediately after the wildfire the acidifying effect of efflorescent salts flushing was somewhat neutralized the neutralization was limited to fire affected portions of the watercourse contrary to downstream segments mainly controlled by common amd processes the utilization of different methods commonly used in amd to evaluate processes such as elemental ratios end members analysis or the drawing of hysteresis curves combined with previously published information about wildfires consequences in terrestrial and aquatic systems have shed light to the difficulty of conducting research in both amd and wildfire topics this will certainly allow to further anticipate the response of other amd affected water systems to wildfires in the global context of global warming where existent models foresee an increased expectation in the number severity and burnt area of wildfires associated to climate change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14996,this study evaluates for the first time the impact of a large wildfire on the hydrogeochemistry of a deeply amd affected river at the beginning of the wet season to accomplish this a high resolution water monitoring campaign was performed within the basin coinciding with the first rainfalls after summer unlike similar events recorded in amd affected areas where dramatic increases in most dissolved element concentrations and decreases in ph values are observed as a result of evaporitic salts flushing and the transport of sulfide oxidation products from mine sites a slight increase

washout of wildfire ash deposited in the riverbanks and the drainage area constituted by alkaline mineral phases seems to have counterbalanced the usual behavior and patterns of the river hydrogeochemistry during autumn geochemical results indicate that a preferential dissolution occurs during ash washout k ca na with a quick release of k followed by an intense dissolution of ca and na on the other hand in unburnt zones parameters and concentrations vary to a lesser extent than burnt areas being the washout of evaporitic salts the dominant process with subsequent rainfalls ash plays a minor role on the river hydrochemistry elemental ratios fe so4 and ca mg and geochemical tracers in both ash k ca and na and amd s were used to prove the importance of ash washout as the dominant geochemical process during the study period geochemical and mineralogical evidences point to intense schwertmannite precipitation as the main driver of reduction in metal pollution the results of this

after the cease of the mining activity younger 1997 the odiel and tinto watersheds huelva province sw spain are globally recognized examples of amd pollution due to the low ph values and extreme metal loid s and sulfate concentrations observed in their waters as a result of the contribution of numerous discharges of acidic leachates from historically mined massive sulfide deposits cánovas et al

that this wildfire would have a significant impact on the odiel river hydrogeochemistry a sampling campaign was performed following the first rainfalls after the wildfire to evaluate the consequences of the soluble components of ash in the odiel river therefore the main goal of this paper is evaluating the influence of the wildfire ash washout on the odiel river hydrogeochemistry with the first rainfalls after the wildfire these events will acquire growing importance as climate change predictions foresee that the expectations about the number and intensity of fires will increase worldwide in the future jolly et al 2015 kinoshita et al 2016 driving such events to other amd sites and the influence reported in this work may be replicated to our knowledge this is the first study that tries to assess the effects of a wildfire on the hydrogeochemistry of an amd affected fluvial system 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and analytical techniques in order to study the effects of the wildfire on the odiel river hydrogeochemistry following the first rainfalls after the cease of the almonaster la real wildfire a sampling campaign was performed along the main watercourse fig 1 the first point is located at the cinco ojos bridge od2 an area widely affected by the fire which receives the amd inputs from the riotinto mines through the agrio creek constituting around 40 60 of the total amd pollution load of the odiel river galván et al 2016 and other minor amd inputs e g poderosa san platón and esperanza mines located in the headwaters downstream two different sampling points located outside of the fire affected area were selected fig 1 the tinto santa rosa bridge od3 and the sotiel bridge od4 which receive in addition to the abovementioned inputs the influence of other minor abandoned mines fig 1 the main mines that contribute to contamination at these points can be seen in fig 1 flood events and the influence of washout processes on the odiel river hydrochemistry has been previously studied at the sampling point od4 due to the existence of a gauge station cánovas et al 2012 the sampling was carried out during autumn 2020 16 09 2020 02 12 2020 samples were taken before during and after rainy episodes n 22 for each sampling point using pre cleaned with 10 hno3 bottles water samples were filtered with 0 22 μm cellulose nitrate filters in total 66 samples were collected acidified to ph 2 with hno3 suprapur and kept refrigerated until analysis different physicochemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured in the field using a previously calibrated crison mm40 multiparameter probe hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany calibration was conducted using standard solutions for ph 4 01 7 00 and 9

electrode nordstrom and wilde 1998 samples were analyzed at the central research services of the university of huelva by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes jobin yvon ultima 2 for major elements the detection limits were 200 μg l for al ca fe k mg mn na si and s 50 μg l for zn and 5 μg l for cu triplicate analyses were performed to assess the analytical precision which was below 5 rsd in all samples in each analysis sequence control blanks were also analyzed being the concentration of elements below the detection limits in each blank the analytical accuracy

insignificant which validity was checked using the geochemical code phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 and by comparison with values obtained by ion chromatography ic analysis differences 5 particulate matter retained in cellulose nitrate filters 0 22 µm porosity and mineral assemblages formed by wildfire ash coated with precipitated efflorescent salts deposited in the river margin before the rainy

system fesem eds 2 2 data treatment rainfall data were obtained from a rain gauge station located at the odiel river basin at el campillo about 8 km from od2 and flow information was acquired from the stream gauge station at od4 sotiel coronada fig 1 all belonging to the monitoring network of the andalusian government the net acidity na in samples was determined according to kirby and cravotta 2005 which include proton concentration and hydrolysable elements such as fe al and mn modified to consider other hydrolysable elements commonly found in amd such as cu zn co and ni for comparison purposes chemical data were obtained from biomass ash table sm1 which may be analogue to the wildfire ash produced in the wildfire this material comes from the combustion of local agroforestry biomass mostly eucalyptus or mixtures to produce electricity in a close power plant even though the formation conditions of both ash types may be different since biomass ash is created in a controlled environment wang et al 2012 and wildfire conditions strongly vary in time and space bodí et al 2014 biomass ash effects on water and soil can be considered similar to those of wildfire ash hannam et al 2019 the collected ash is mainly composed of sio2 69 3 wt al2o3 11 42 wt cao 7 98 wt k2o 4 44 wt fe2o3 4 80 wt mgo 1 23 wt and to a lesser extent other elements such as na 2 45 g kg p 1 67 g kg ba 0 22 g kg s 0 20 g kg and sr 0 19 g kg among others in a ph paste test solid liquid ratio 1 2 performed to this material ph values rise up to 12 and the alkalinity generated is more than 1000 mg l of caco3 equivalent hydrochemical data prior to the wildfire are also available for the odiel river in 2015 and 2016 at od2 upstream of od2 and the agrio creek table sm2 which joins the river between both points this temporal dataset represents a range of relative contributions of the odiel river and agrio creek upon different hydrological conditions however only those corresponding to the same period before and after the first rainfalls were considered so that chemical water quality of the river before and after the wildfire could be compared saturation indices of waters with respect to some minerals commonly precipitated in amd affected systems were calculated using the phreeqc code v3 7 parkhurst and appelo 2013 with wateq4f thermodynamic database ball and nordstrom 1991 the database was expanded with thermodynamic information for some mineral phases contained in the ash mostly carbonates and oxides of ca k mg and na such as calcite lime periclase sylvite among others as well as with equilibrium constants of schwertmannite from different authors bigham et al 1996 yu et al 1999 sánchez españa et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 response of the river flow to rainfalls the number of weather stations in the odiel river watershed is limited however complete information for the study period was obtained from a gauge and a pluviometric station fig sm1 as can be seen in figure sm1 a fast response of river flow is observed upon the rainfall collected in the catchment thus four main rainy episodes can be identified the first commenced on september 18th with 9 4 mm recorded which led to a slight increase in river flow of around 0 05 m3 s fig sm1 the second episode recorded 49 8 mm on october 20th increasing the river flow to around 3 77 m3 s fig sm1 the third and fourth episodes occurred on november 5th and 25th with 17 4 and 33 6 mm leading to flow rises of up to 2 02 and 19 7 m3 s respectively fig sm1 the watercourses within the odiel river basin commonly show very rapid flow responses to rainfall events due to the low permeability of their materials olías et al 2006 cánovas et al 2007 the increase in humidity of catchment soils with persisting rainy episodes makes that the highest river flow is reached with lower amounts of rainfalls olías et al 2006 the common response of river flow may be enhanced by increased runoff generation induced by wildfire ash clogging soil pores bodí et al 2014 limiting more the infiltration capacity of these soils or by loss of vegetation in the fire and its canopy interception increasing net precipitation williams et al 2019 generally this could potentially increase the erosion of soils and ash delivered to the streams in mediterranean climate rainfalls are scarce over time and take place in short periods within a few days or hours mainly distributed along the wet season september to march however this pattern may change since climate models predict the strengthening of these cycles e g giorgi and lionello 2008 gianakopoulos et al 2009 3 2 temporal evolution of the hydrochemistry the hydrochemistry results of the sampling points od2 od3 and od4 can be seen in tables sm3 sm4 and sm5 respectively the ph values during the study period varied between 2 3 and 3 5 with occasional rises to almost 5 downstream of the burnt areas electrical conductivity values fluctuated drastically throughout the sampling period od2 maximum values reached 17 77 ms cm and minimum values came close to 1 ms cm with sharp variations along the temporal series fig 2a od3 and od4 showed ec values ranging from 2 to 4 ms cm with punctual maximums and minimums 7 02 and 5 86 ms cm of maximum respectively and 0 42 ms cm of minimum for both points fig 2 c and e the response of the parameters to the first rainfalls was unexpected for the three sites given the previously reported behavior of the odiel watershed in such events with sharp increases in dissolved elements and decrease in ph values during the first rainfalls after summer cánovas et al 2007 sarmiento et al 2009 2017 there is a significant drop in ec from 17 77 to 10 65 ms cm at od2 and from 3 74 to 1 97 ms cm at od4 due to a general decrease in dissolved metals concentrations accompanied by a small increase in ph values at the sampling points from 2 32 to 2 88 at od2 and from 3 24 to 3 36 at od4 coinciding with the first rains and their fast response in the river flow fig 2a c and e unfortunately there is missing data in od3 coinciding with the first flow increment however the trend seems to be quite similar to od4 response almost all major element concentrations underwent a drastic drop in od2 fe from 443 to 205 mg l al 1805 to 1059 mg l sulfate 22 760 to 13 296 mg l fig 2b resulting in a sharp decrease for net acidity from an initial value of 12 1 to 7 01 g l caco3 eq after the first rains table sm3 on the other hand concentrations in od3 and od4 remained relatively constant although there is a slight fall in al and sulfate concentrations in od4 fig 2f all elements behaved similarly during these rainfalls except for k and to a lesser extent ca and na potassium concentration underwent an important rise in od2 from 1 11 to 10 3 mg l while ca and na suffered a slight decrease compared to the rest of dissolved elements a few days after the rainy event the physicochemical parameters and concentrations returned to their original pre rain values fig 2 this behavior differs from the typical response of amd affected streams in semiarid catchments when a notable increase in most elements associated with amd is observed either by the washing out of soluble salts accumulated along the riverbanks during the long dry season or by a higher contribution of amd discharges to the river compared to that of runoff water e g johnson and thornton 1987 keith et al 2001 cánovas et al 2008 previous studies on the water composition of the odiel and tinto river watersheds show fast and notable increases in ec at the onset of discharge rises during the first rain events with increased concentrations for most elements related to amd e g sarmiento et al 2009 cánovas et al 2017 olías et al 2020 the influence of the alkaline ash generated by the wildfire and its subsequent washout by run off may have attenuated the typical behavior of the odiel river after the dry season causing the precipitation of mineral phases and thus decreasing the metal content in the water the second river flow increase significantly larger than the first one from 0 05 to 3 77 m3 s led to an extreme decrease in ec values at od2 from 15 15 to 1 28 ms cm concomitant with a ph rise of up to 4 fig 2a on the contrary the opposite tendency was observed in od3 and od4 exhibiting the typical response of a watercourse affected by amd fig 2c and e due to the dissolution of evaporitic salts containing high amounts of toxic elements and acidity ec increased from 3 78 in both sites to 7 02 and 5 86 ms cm respectively while ph declined slightly from 3 16 and 3 25 to 2 91 and 3 04 respectively coinciding with a maximum flow rate 3 77 m3 s at od4 this second event exhibited the largest decrease in acidity table sm3 sulfate and most metal concentrations in od2 fig 2b with decreases ranging from 96 for acidity down to 0 36 g l caco3 eq to more than 90 for major elements fe from 402 to 10 2 mg l al from 1404 to 52 7 mg l sulfate 17 599 to 863 mg l otherwise the decrease in ca and na concentrations was not so marked 26 and 31 in the first event and 83 and 62 in this second event respectively while a slight increase in k concentration was observed from 3 11 to 3 90 mg l compared to the first event as mentioned before a significant increase in concentrations was recorded in od3 and od4 fig 2d and f during these rainfalls contrasting with the upstream sampling point net acidity increased from average values of 1200 mg l to 4500 mg l at od3 table sm4 and 500 to 2900 mg l caco3 eq at od4 table sm5 probably by the intense washout of metal rich efflorescent salts which remained in the riverbanks it is striking that this pollution increase was registered in these last sampling points od3 and od4 but not at the upstream most wildfire affected one od2 this indicates a different dominant process acting along the studied river reach if the second event at od2 would be only controlled by dilution all dissolved concentrations would have undergone similar reduction percentages as stated before this is not the case for k ca and na which behavior may suggest the influence of the wildfire ash dissolution on the contrary at od3 and od4 located farther from fire affected areas no available ash may have been deposited and the predominant process may have been the washout of efflorescent salts as well as the confluence of several amd inputs in this river reach sarmiento et al 2009 moreover considering that the main pollutant load delivered to the odiel river comes from the agrio creek sánchez españa et al 2005 galván et al 2016 which confluence is located upstream of od2 fig 1 is especially significant the substantial decrease in acidity sulfate and metal concentrations observed in od2 during both rain events highlighting the powerful acidity attenuation capacity of wildfire ash there were two additional flow rises in autumn 2020 fig 2 nonetheless the remaining acidity stored in the efflorescent salts may have diminished as a consequence of intense dissolution processes in the prior rainfall events in this sense decreases in metal concentrations 277 39 1 and 64 6 mg l caco3 eq of net acidity for od2 od3 and od4 respectively tables sm3 sm4 and sm5 in all sampling points and the highest ph values 3 53 in od2 and 4 94 in both od3 and od4 were observed at the end of november 2020 fig 2a c and e 3 3 importance of efflorescent salts washout in the river hydrogeochemistry the evaporitic salts wash out process predominantly controls the odiel river hydrogeochemistry with the arrival of rainfall events after the dry season in order to properly evaluate the consequences of this process together with the exceptional occurrence of the wildfire in the area this section shows the evolution of some geochemical tracers during the sampling campaign geochemical tracers are commonly used to identify and quantify geochemical reactions in aquatic systems for example the fe so4 ratio has been used to quantify the importance of pyrite oxidation fe secondary mineral precipitation and evaporitic sulfate salts dissolution in amd affected systems e g buckby et al 2003 cánovas et al 2010 thus the fe so4 ratio in evaporitic sulfate salts or in fe secondary minerals precipitated along riverbanks is higher than in the odiel river waters since iron content in these precipitates is much higher than sulfate content cánovas et al 2007 2010 then dissolution of fe sulfate rich salts may provoke a rise in the river water ratios and this can be used to determine whether the rainy events recorded in this study may have caused the dissolution of efflorescent salts or even if other processes such as dilution or ash flushing have played a major role in water chemistry variations fig 3 a shows a decrease in fe so4 ratio at od2 during the first rainy event while the opposite trend is observed at od4 a sampling point located downstream this could be explained by the alkalinity contribution of the wildfire ash to the water at od2 which is the most fire affected location alkalinity rises the ph and contributes to the precipitation of secondary fe oxyhydroxysulfates during this discharge rise lowering the ratio as explained before the ratio rise at od4 evidenced the salts flushing which may be attenuated by alkalinity running downstream given that metal and sulfate concentrations during the first event remained relatively constant or underwent slight decreases fig 2f the increase in discharge during the second rainy event caused a strong decrease in fe so4 ratios at od2 and increasing ones in both od3 and od4 fig 3a a major ratio peak occurs during the baseflow recession curve for the three sampling points fig 3a in this event the hydrochemistry at od2 would be controlled firstly by run off dilution i e mixing with freshwaters and the relative predominance of wildfire ash over soluble salts dissolution thus the dissolution of remaining wildfire ash would provide additional alkalinity evidenced by an initial sharp decrease in the ratio caused by fe precipitation coinciding with a slight ph rise on october 21st fig 2a followed by an important increase in the ratio due to the dissolution of fe sulfate salts fig 2a both od3 and od4 may have suffered preferentially salts washout processes explained by the progressive increase in fe so4 ratios along the second event fig 3a with no apparent influence of the wildfire ash the last rainy events are initially characterized by a slight rise in the ratio within the rising limb for both od3 and od4 after the dissolution of residual amounts of efflorescent salts followed by remarkable decrease in fe so4 ratios fig 3a due to precipitation processes of fe oxyhydroxysulfates on the contrary od2 ratios decreased evidencing precipitation processes of fe probably influenced by wildfire ash this is supported by the behavior exhibited by ph and ec during these events fig 2 the plotting of ca mg ratios can also provide valuable insights into predominant geochemical processes during the study period efflorescent salts are commonly richer in mg than in ca and typically this ratio may be higher in the odiel river during the dry season due to important evaporitic sulfate precipitation processes and decreasing during the first rainfalls of autumn as a consequence of the salts flush out cánovas et al 2007 the first rise in flow rate shows an evident increase in ca mg at od2 and to a lesser extent at od4 followed by fast drop in the ratio fig 3b this response agrees well with the fe so4 ratios evolution since the effect of the efflorescent salts washout may have been neutralized in od2 and initially attenuated in od4 because of the alkalinity provided by the wildfire ash dissolution within the first rainfall event the second event hydrochemistry at od2 may be still influenced by ash dissolution while at od3 and od4 it should be fully controlled by evaporitic salts dissolution a similar behavior of ca mg to previous fe so4 ratios in the second event fig 3a supports this interpretation besides potassium concentration peaks in od2 fig 3b coinciding with precipitation neutralization evidenced by fe so4 and ca mg ratios highlight the remarkable role played by wildfire ash on the river hydrochemistry the ca mg ratio during the last rainfalls assist in evaluating whether dilution processes are the main factor or there are other factors implied in the hydrochemistry evolution constant ratios at od3 and od4 suggest dilution contrasting the second event ruled by the evaporitic salts washout however at the upstream point of od2 the ratio systematically increases as did in previous events the same case occurs for the na so4 ratio fig sm2 then it is possible that the wildfire ash have controlled the entire temporal series of od2 along with the typical processes occurring in amd waters 3 4 importance of the dissolution of wildfire ash in the river hydrogeochemistry calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na and potassium k are common elements of wildfire ash in which they usually occur as easily leachable mineral species ulery et al 1993 bodí et al 2014 pereira et al 2014 calcium concentrations decrease during the first and second rainy events in od2 as well as most major amd elements around 40 for amd elements and 25 for ca in od2 first event and around 95 and 80 respectively in od2 second event despite that it is expected that some amounts of ca may come from the dissolution of the wildfire ash given that ca is a major component of them and its decrease in concentration is attenuated compared to other amd elements in od2 this also happens for na which decreases accounts for 30 and 60 in the 1st and 2nd events respectively on the other hand k shows sudden increases in each discharge peak fig 3b in an effort to check if the concentrations of these elements in the odiel river are mainly supplied or affected by wildfire ash washout different end members are represented in fig 4 a biomass ash an analogue to wildfire ash b odiel river waters prior to the agrio creek confluence c the agrio creek and d odiel river after the confluence between odiel river and agrio creek where od2 is located cinco ojos bridge in fig 1 generally normal patterns of k concentrations in the odiel river show maximum values during summer and minimum in autumn cánovas et al 2007 coinciding with the first rainfalls after the dry season the solubility of k in amd environments is commonly controlled by jarosite precipitation accornero et al 2005 however during the rainy events in od2 there is a remarkable increase in k concentrations an evolution of k concentration during and after the first rains towards the extreme member of the biomass ash composition is observed this trend is observed not only in the plotting between k s fig 4 but also in ca k and na k fig sm3 the odiel river waters have very similar relationships between k and s contents fig 4 suggesting that dilution and mixing processes between amd affected and unaffected waters may control the solubility of both elements od2 pre rain sample in fig 4 represent concentrations of k s ca k and na k in fig sm3 before the first rainfall of the sampling period when the agrio creek discharge was the main water contributor to the odiel river during the summer od2 1st rain group shows the evolution of these elements during the first discharge rise as can be seen k in these samples moves towards the extreme member of the biomass ash fig 4 also ca k and na k fig sm3 instead of following a pattern of dilution over the shown trend of the odiel river extreme members in addition an increasing release of elements contained in wildfire ash was observed as in ash leaching experiments carried out by audry et al 2014 which reported a preferential release of elements k mg na si ca thus a quick release of k and to a lesser extent ca and na contained in the ash was observed within the first event probably due to a higher solubility of the k mineral phases moreover the major k peak also coincided with the unusual behavior of fe so4 and ca mg ratios showed in fig 3 so there are multiple lines of evidence supporting that the first event is controlled by wildfire ash washout od2 2nd rain group follows the normal trend of the odiel river extreme members nevertheless a slight influence of the biomass ash member is observed fig 4 ca and na concentrations also reveal such influence see fig sm4 given that ca fe and na fe ratios increased during the second rainfall also ca mg in fig 3b and na so4 in fig sm2 concomitant with minor decreases in concentrations compared to other major amd elements these ratios are higher than those expected upon predominance of dilution processes evidencing the probable dissolution of the less soluble phases richer in ca and na contained in the wildfire ash which could not be dissolved during the first rain ash leaching experiments reported by audry et al 2014 exhibited that na is released before ca however ca fe values are much higher than na fe ratio fig sm4 therefore there should be a more significant input of ca than na due to a high ca content in the wildfire ash table sm1 leading to a major release of ca than na see also ca na ratios in fig sm4 concurring with the elements dissolution rates calculated by audry et al 2014 johnston and maher 2022 also reported a similar order in elevated concentrations of k ca and na in summary there is a quick release of k within the first rain event contained in the most soluble phases of the wildfire ash with a lesser dissolution of ca and na phases resulting in an increase of k concentration in the odiel river the second event with a larger increment in run off causes the flush out of the less soluble phases richer in ca and na modifying the typical trend during dilution processes and changing the ratios during the second rainfall this is also demonstrated in concentration discharge hysteresis curves in fig sm5 contrasting previously published hysteresis curves for the amd context cánovas et al 2010 samples collected during the last rainy events exhibited similar relationships between k and s and other elements than those typical of the odiel river which obeys to common dilution processes in this watercourse however ca mg fig 3b and na so4 fig sm2 ratios evidence that ca and na concentrations in the river are still slightly influenced by wildfire ash dissolution although si and mg are also major components of wildfire ash there seems to have no influence on the amd hydrochemistry silicon must be likely hosted in silica phases which are very insoluble whereas in the case of mg its high content in amd may have masked the possible influence of the mg contained in the wildfire ash in order to confirm which mineral phases are precipitating dissolving in the odiel river during the rainy events the saturation indices si of phases commonly found in amd environments sánchez españa et al 2005 have been calculated by phreeqc for simplicity purposes only information in od2 the most affected area by wildfire will be discussed jarosite dissolution might be a source of potassium kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 as a result of ph increments during rainfalls since jarosite group minerals are only stable at very acid conditions das et al 1996 however si showed oversaturation for jarosite ss and k jarosite during the whole event concluding that no k is coming from the dissolution of jarosite table sm6 schwertmannite si values depends greatly on the equilibrium constant used in phreeqc calculations equilibrium constants proposed by sánchez españa et al 2011 and bigham et al 1996 for schwertmannite provided si values showing undersaturation conditions or close to equilibrium in od2 table sm6 however using the thermodynamic data from yu et al 1999 schwertmannite appears to be oversaturated in the whole temporal series table sm6 this concern is due to schwertmannite s metastable nature and its variable composition largely affected by sulfate concentration in the water schoepfer and burton 2021 in a pe ph predominance diagram for stable and metastable fe mineral phases caraballo et al 2013 all od2 samples plot within the schwertmannite field fig sm6 supporting that no jarosite may be precipitating and oversaturation values are probably due to high k concentrations mineralogical evidences support this fact since globular aggregates in samples were observed by fe sem in particulate matter retained in filters which was composed mostly by iron and sulfur suggesting the presence of schwertmannite therefore the mineral assemblage in filters was dominated by silicates and fe mineral phases with a morphology and chemical composition typical of schwertmannite without a clear jarosite identification fig 5 mineral ash portion is mainly constituted by silica carbonates and oxides bodí et al 2014 all k ca and na carbonates oxides and salts considered appear to be undersaturated in these waters table sm6 according to phreeqc calculations that is they can be easily dissolved into the odiel river waters and provide the alkalinity needed to attenuate the amd pollution besides si estimations also support the element release order k mg na si ca observed in this study and previously reported by audry et al 2014 with the k phases having the most subsaturated values expecting a quick dissolution of them followed by na and ca phases since the second rainy event is of greater magnitude than the first one the runoff generated may be enough to dissolve the remaining wildfire ash rich in ca and na that were not previously washed during the first event due to its lower solubility as expected oxides were more subsaturated than carbonates and alkaline salts and should dissolve more easily from the ash 3 5 global implications of this study potassium ca and na have been widely reported to be easily water extractable elements from ash produced in mediterranean regions generated either in wildfires or laboratory experiments ferreira et al 2005 úbeda et al 2009 pereira et al 2012 2014 sequeira et al 2020 observed increases in k ca and na concentrations during the first rainy period after multiple fires occurred in portugal in an area dominated by pinus pinaster also abundant in the study area pereira et al 2011 reported similar responses in a quercus suber forest located in the northeast of the iberian peninsula other studies in the same geographic context costa et al 2014 mansilha et al 2017 showed high values of these elements as well as slight increases in ph and alkalinity in these cases changes in water ph driven by ash leaching could be buffered at ph near neutrality limiting the capacity of ash to increase the ph and alkalinity on the contrary the high reactivity of ash in amd waters higher solubility due to low ph values could lead to a major influence in the water parameters considering that fe buffer occurs at ph 2 5 3 5 nordstrom and alpers 1999 these authors have also reported increases in other elements considered in fresh waters as trace elements but their high concentrations in amd do not allow a proper analysis for example johnston and mahor 2022 showed increases in concentrations following the order k ca so4 hco3 mg cl na in the amd context some of these changes in concentrations would be lost in the amd background because of its extreme concentrations of dissolved elements santín et al 2015 reported a similar response in an australian eucalypt forest fire comparable to the biomass ash used in this research for comparison purposes although these chemical changes in water mostly depend on the composition of the ash generated and then flushed wildfire ash driven neutralization of od2 acid waters was remarkable with decreases in acidity for each rainfall event table sm3 besides this is a striking fact considering the huge acidity load provided by the agrio creek upstream of od2 galván et al 2016 which may have been neutralized by the ash dissolution controlling the hydrogeochemistry of this portion of the odiel river during the study period despite that neutralization is only temporary given that acid conditions are quickly recovered after the rain events and may have occurred until all ashes have been dissolved the watershed is intensely polluted by amd with numerous leachates joining the main odiel watercourse cánovas et al 2021 that is why downstream od3 and od4 the influence of ash dissolution plays a minor role and the hydrogeochemistry is mainly controlled by amd and efflorescent salts washout overall the wildfire ash effects are restrained spatial and temporally by the strong load of acidity reaching the odiel river nonetheless it is expected that in smaller amd affected watercourses the same effects may be magnified even in cases of amd affected water courses with low acidity concentration e g coal mines or smaller sulfide mines lee et al 2002 cravotta 2008 the neutralizing effects of wildfire ash may be more significant and long lasting in addition a long term response of amd affected catchments to wildfire may be the increase in the amd generation rates the loss of vegetation after the wildfire induces a greater water infiltration into waste mine dumps and adits which function as anthropogenic aquifers caraballo et al 2016 promoting the generation of amd canopy interception decrease and overland flow increase after wildfires bodí et al 2014 williams et al 2019 allowing the arrival of greater amounts of water to mine areas in fact murphy et al 2020 observed remobilization of arsenic and other metals from legacy mine waste to surface water due to greater run off during post fire rainfalls 4 conclusions this is the first time that the direct consequences of a wildfire on an amd affected watercourse have been studied the washout of wildfire ash seems to counterbalance the usual behavior and patterns of the odiel river hydrogeochemistry during autumn i e dramatic increases in most elements high ec and decreases in ph values as a result of soluble salts flushing when the first rainfalls after the dry season are recorded due to the wildfire ash washout and the subsequent input of alkalinity to the water during the first rainfalls of autumn 2020 immediately after the wildfire the acidifying effect of efflorescent salts flushing was somewhat neutralized the neutralization was limited to fire affected portions of the watercourse contrary to downstream segments mainly controlled by common amd processes the utilization of different methods commonly used in amd to evaluate processes such as elemental ratios end members analysis or the drawing of hysteresis curves combined with previously published information about wildfires consequences in terrestrial and aquatic systems have shed light to the difficulty of conducting research in both amd and wildfire topics this will certainly allow to further anticipate the response of other amd affected water systems to wildfires in the global context of global warming where existent models

14997,global warming and sea level rise exert profound impacts on coastal mangrove ecosystems where widespread benthic crabs change sediment properties and regulate material cycles how crab bioturbation perturbs the mobilities of bioavailable arsenic as antimony sb and sulfide in sediment water systems and their variability in response to temperature and sea level rise is still unknown by combining field monitoring and laboratory experiments we found that as was mobilized under sulfidic conditions while sb was mobilized under oxic conditions in mangrove sediments crab burrowing greatly enhanced oxidizing conditions resulting in enhanced sb mobilization and release but as sequestration by iron manganese oxides in control experiments with non bioturbation the more sulfidic conditions triggered the contrasting situation of as remobilization and release but sb precipitation and burial moreover the bioturbated sediments were highly heterogeneous for spatial distributions of labile sulfide as and sb as presented by 2 d high resolution imaging and moran s index patchy at the 1 cm scale warming stimulated stronger burrowing activities which led to more oxic conditions and further sb mobilization and as sequestration whilst sea level rise did the opposite via suppressing crab burrowing activity this work highlights that global climate changes have the potential to significantly alter element cycles in coastal mangrove wetlands by regulating benthic bioturbation and redox chemistry graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic antimony bioturbation mangrove wetland biogeochemistry high resolution imaging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mangroves are highly productive ecosystems that store massive quantities of blue carbon in their belowground biomass donato et al 2011 mangroves play a key role in maintaining and protecting sub tropical marine biodiversity and crucial ecosystem services including regulating key global biogeochemical cycles and serving as buffers to the effects of climate change wang and gu 2021 mangroves thrive at interfaces between land and sea where key environmental factors such as temperature tide river runoff bioturbation and deposition rates are highly dynamic and sensitive to global change breitburg et al 2018 pan et al 2020 because mangroves are intermittently flooded they also contain sharp redox gradients that can concentrate and accumulate heavy metal loid s commonly associated with sulfides de lacerda et al 2020 de lacerda et al 2022 changes in sea level and temperature have the potential to affect estuarine mangrove ecosystems directly gilman et al 2008 or through the adaptation within mangroves in response to changing environments woodroffe et al 2016 increasing temperatures have the potential to create positive feedback in the global carbon cycle by promoting photosynthesis wang and gu 2021 in contrast sea level rise may decrease soil respiration and increase carbon storage within intertidal mangroves providing negative feedback in the carbon cycle krauss et al 2014 the potential effects of global change on the cycling of other chemicals in mangrove sediments is less clear but could significantly impact ecology and biogeochemical cycling de lacerda et al 2022 osland et al 2018 fiddler crabs are a dominant macrobenthos species and the principal bioturbating organisms in mangrove ecosystems sarker et al 2021 their burrowing activities greatly affect material cycles and energy flows lee 2008 which can stimulate mangrove growth smith et al 2009 crab burrows increase the surface area of sediment exposed to the air kristensen et al 2008 the effects of these burrows on both air and water exchange can impact of redox conditions and nutrients metals and sulfur cycling ferreira et al 2007 liu et al 2022b pan et al 2019 stahl et al 2014 xiao et al 2022 burrowing can increase oxygen penetration into sediments thereby oxidizing carbon guimond et al 2020 stieglitz et al 2013 xiao et al 2021 and other sediment constituents the effects of burrows depend on their density and morphology which vary sharply over time and space seaward areas more flooded typically have shallower and smaller burrow networks than drier areas and crab activity including burrow excavation is lowest in the winter egawa et al 2021 both water levels and temperature changes are major components of climate change and can deeply affect crab distributions and bioturbation extent wasson et al 2019 wilson et al 2022 despite these potential effects few studies have examined the effect of crab burrowing on transient sediment redox conditions and biogeochemistry arsenic as and antimony sb are highly toxic metalloids which have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on humans filella et al 2002 tighe et al 2005 and are considered priority pollutants by the european union cec 1976 and the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1979 chemical similarities between the two metalloids have prompted concerns over their enrichment both naturally and anthropogenically in many environments arsic et al 2018 johnston et al 2020 wilson et al 2010 the geochemical behavior of as and sb in sediments is highly dependent on their chemical speciation as well as sediment properties such as organic matter minerals sulfides and redox conditions which can affect retention mechanisms such as adsorption complexation and precipitation wilson et al 2010 in particular the availability of sulfide has considerable impact on as and sb behavior in sulfurized sediments via coprecipitation adsorption complexation and thiolation arsic et al 2018 bennett et al 2017 o day et al 2004 recent studies have confirmed that as is released under anoxic conditions whereas sb is mobilized under oxic conditions which is likely linked to sulfur s redox cycles arsic et al 2018 johnston et al 2020 ye et al 2020 however the interactions of sulfide with as and sb are still unclear in bioturbated mangrove sediments partially due to the lack of high resolution studies mangroves and other coastal wetlands are heterogeneous and complex environments where biogeochemical zones often vary sharply at the millimeter or smaller scales especially in dynamic surface sediments with redox transition zones pan et al 2020 widerlund and davison 2007 the structure composition and stability of these redox interfaces are of redox crucial for the health of mangrove ecosystems crab burrows impact the expression redox gradients between burrow surfaces water and air observing the effects of burrowing on geochemistry ideally should capture this heterogeneity diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is an in situ sampling technique that can image bioavailable as iii v and sb iii v and other solutes at the spatial resolutions needed to capture the effects of burrowing with minimal disturbance davison and zhang 1994 these thin films record abundance of bioavailable components in sediment porewater at a high spatial resolution arsic et al 2018 the binding layer of dgt acts like a plant root taking up the metals through diffusion zhang et al 2018 and has been proven as an effective method to assess the bioavailability of metal loid s in soil and wetland sediments guan et al 2021 pan et al 2022a zhang and davison 2015 nevertheless the research studying redox gradients in crab bioturbated sediments is scarce and little is known about how these gradients respond to changing environmental conditions this research used high resolution dgt films to examine in detail the chemical behaviors of sulfide as and sb in mangrove sediments with contrasting burrow networks for the first time we hypothesized that temperature and water level dependent crab burrowing activities change redox conditions and drive changes in mobility of sulfide as and sb in subtropical mangrove wetland sediments our experiments directly probe the effect of two critical variables on bioturbation and biogeochemical cycling 1 the integrated effects of bioturbation and flooding sea level rise on mobilities of sulfide and toxic metalloids through field studies and indoor experiments in highly bioturbated summer months and 2 the seasonal variability in bioturbation and sediment biogeochemistry as a direct measure of the effect of temperature to achieve these goals two subtropical mangrove wetlands in china fig s1 were studied in the field using two dimensional 2d dgt labile s i e free sulfide and laterally integrated one dimensional 1d depth profiles of as and sb and related sediment properties in three seasons winter spring and summer based on the field observations regarding ubiquitous crab burrows and extensive bioturbated sediments in summer indoor incubation experiments were also systematically conducted in the absence of crabs to simulate crab free non bioturbated conditions a negative control moreover redox gradients of these controls were compared to identical sediments that contained burrows using high resolution imaging of 2d dgt for s as sb and fe this work provides new insights into the control of bioturbation on redox geochemistry of s and its effect on soluble bioavailable as and sb and their response to global environmental changes in estuarine mangrove wetlands 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas the study areas are located in jiulong river estuary je and tongan bay tb surrounding xiamen bay fig s1a which are typical semi enclosed bays in southeastern china this region has suffered from severe pollution of heavy metal loid s due to dense industrial activities pan et al 2022b wang and wang 2017 this region has a regular semidiurnal tide with a tidal range of 3 6 m and a subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with annual rainfall of 1500 mm most of which occurs between april and september http en weather com cn when temperatures are also high the hydrodynamic forcing in je is relatively strong due to the large upstream runoff and frequent ship sailing and the slope of the tidal flat is steep 8 with 20 m between the low tide mark and the edge of the mangrove two sampling sites je1 and je2 were arranged in the central part and edge of the mangrove respectively fig s1b in contrast tb experiences calm wave activity and has a more gradual slope two sampling sites of tb1 and tb2 were similarly arranged in the central part and edge of the mangrove respectively fig s1c the four sites were located between the mid tide and high tide zones the higher the tidal zone the less flooding time in a tidal cycle the extents of tidal flooding increased from je1 to je2 to tb1 to tb2 fiddler crabs are common macrobenthos that widely inhabit the mangrove whose activities including burrowing showed little difference among two areas but large differences among seasons and with tidal zonation i e more burrows in summer than in autumn fig s1d e and in high tide zones lower flooding period and frequency compared to low tide zones fig s1f 2 2 field sampling the dgt probe was composed of a binding gel an agarose diffusive gel and a durapore pvdf millipore it was deoxygenated with nitrogen and stored in oxygen free nacl solution 0 03 m prior to use the zro agi dgt mixed binding gels of zr oxide and agi for adsorption of oxyanions as and sb and free sulfide respectively device provided by easy sensor ltd china was used for field deployment in january winter and dry season april spring and moist season and july summer and rainy season in addition the hr zro ca dgt within a high resolution of 10 μm fine intervals of binding particles for 2d imaging of hms ren et al 2021 device was used for 2d imaging of s as sb and fe for comparison of burrow and burrow free sediments in field study in october autumn and dry season the devices were inserted into the sediments at each site during the ebb tide period after one day a hollow pvc tube diameter of 8 cm was carefully plugged into the dgt surrounding sediment for both sediment sampling and dgt retrieval fig s1f then a ysi professional plus multiparameter meter was used to measure the temperature salinity ph and dissolved oxygen do of the overlying water 2 3 mesocosm experiment after field sampling in july two sediment cores 30 cm depth and overlying water were collected from je and tb using disassembled poly methyl methacrylate pmma tubes with an outer diameter of 8 cm and inner diameter of 7 cm and buckets 25 l respectively to eliminate the impact of crab bioturbation in the surface sediments the crabs were removed and the burrow openings approximately 2 3 cm depth in the two cores were filled with adjacent surface sediments retaining tortuous residual burrows in the deep layers then the cores were assembled in empty tubes more than 2 m length and the diurnal tide in the intertidal zone was simulated fig s2 this was realized by using a peristaltic pump drawing overlying water from a bucket to the incubator at a rate of 2 m of water head within 6 h and drawing back to the bucket at the same rate followed by 12 h exposure without overlying water more details were described in a previous study pan et al 2020 after three tidal cycles the dgt probes were inserted into the two sediment cores for the same deployment time as the field research 24 h then the highest water level was constantly maintained simulating a flooding event after three days another two dgt probes were applied in the two cores for 24 h 2 4 sample preprocessing in the lab the partial sediment samples were freeze dried at 80 c then ground and sieved 160 mesh for later analyses after cleaning with deionized water to remove the stained sediments the dgt binding gel was first scanned to obtain the 2d distribution of dgt labile s using the computer imaging densitometry cid technique ding et al 2012 teasdale et al 1999 then the gels were cut into strips at 5 mm vertical intervals the strips were eluted and processed for dgt labile as and sb according to wang et al 2016 the acidified eluates were measured by icp ms perkinelmer nexion 2000 for dgt labile as sb all plasticware items used for metalloid processing were pre cleaned by acid pickling and then deionized water washing for 2d imaging the dgt binding gel was clipped at a size of 10 cm depth 1 cm width as described previously gao et al 2015 the gel was mounted onto glass microscope slides avoiding air bubbles and uneven surfaces for further ablating then an asi resolution lr s155 laser microprobe equipped with a coherent compex pro 193 nm arf excimer laser was used for laser sampling the spot size of the laser microprobe was selected in the lattice area of 0 1 mm horizontal 0 1 mm vertical with a total of 100 000 data points per gel the vaporized material at each point was characterized by icp ms perkinelmer nexion 2000 resulting in high resolution 2d images of dgt s as sb and fe to improve the analytical precision a major element of the binding gel matrix i e 13c was used as an internal normalization standard following lehto et al 2012 all detailed operating and analyses of la icp ms were well described by gao et al 2015 and ren et al 2021 1d depth profiles of element concentrations are created by averaging the concentrations in the 2d dgt profiles at each depth with variance at each depth indicating something about the heterogeneity at each depth 2 5 chemical analyses for sediment analyses the grain size was measured by mastersizer 3000 malvern uk using fresh samples all other geochemical analyses were conducted using sieved samples the total organic carbon toc total nitrogen and total sulfur were determined by a vario el iii element analyzer elementar germany the amorphous fe mn oxides asc fe mn were extracted using a single step procedure involving the ascorbic acid rozan et al 2002 samples were completely digested by a mixture of hydrogen nitrate and hydrofluoric acid for total fe mn fe mn t a modified bcr community bureau of reference sequential extraction procedure was used to separate sediment as and sb fractions rauret et al 1999 all the eluates for fe mn as and sb were acidified and determined by icp ms for icp ms analyses procedural blanks replicates and reference materials were processed and examined internal standards 72ge 118in 209be were employed in the calibration of instrumental drift and sensitivity to evaluate the accuracy of analytical procedures reference material samples agilent p n 5183 4682 were repeatedly measured after every 10 or 20 samples with recoveries of 92 107 for as sb mn and fe triplicate analyses were performed for all samples with the relative standard deviation rsd of less than 10 for every sample and of 1 8 3 6 on average in addition reference material samples art no 15 00 0062 and triplicate analyses were performed every 10 or 20 samples for c n and s with recoveries of 99 100 and rsd of less than 1 2 6 data processing for la icp ms analyses calibration standards of targeted elements were established via plotting standardized la signals divided by signals of internal standards versus the corresponding elements mass then elements data of the laser were transformed into mass per area mla μg cm 2 based on the calibration curves gao et al 2015 liu et al 2022a ren et al 2021 the concentrations of dgt labile chemicals c dgt were then calculated based on eq 1 zhang et al 1995 1 c dgt m l a δ g d t m δ g d a t where δg refers to the thickness of the diffusive layer 0 8 mm d is the temperature dependent diffusion coefficient cm2 s 1 wang et al 2016 t is the deployment time 24 h a and m μg is the area of the one dimensional gel strip 3 mm vertically in this study and the corresponding mass of element in the eluate calculated as per eq 2 2 m c e v f where c e is the icp ms measured element concentration in the elute v is the elute volume and f is the elution efficiency wang et al 2017 the dgt as and dgt sb concentrations in the vicinity of the sediment water interface 2 cm below were used to calculate the diffusion flux between the sediment and overlying water the flux was calculated based on fick s first law considering the degree of sediment tortuosity boudreau 1996 2 7 statistical analyses measured data were plotted using origin ver 2019b software other figures were plotted using corel draw ver 2018 software the significant differences between different samples were analyzed using spss ver 20 0 software with one way anova followed by duncan s multiple range tests module the significance level was set at p 0 05 for the statistical analyses linear correlations and multiple regression analyses between different parameters were analyzed and plotted using pearson correlation and asymptotic analysis within origin ver 2019b patchiness effect or autocorrelation in 2 d dataset was explored using spatial correlograms of the moran s index i computed with r package spdep following bivand and wong 2018 and thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 scale variance analysis sva was employed to decompose the total variance of dataset to identify the contribution of each scale to the variance following thibault de chanvalon et al 2022 3 results 3 1 solid sediment properties the overlying water during the ebb tide period and sediment properties are shown in table s1 for the two field study sites from january winter to april spring and to july summer the overlying water temperature increased from 17 2 to 21 5 and to 28 5 and do decreased over the same period salinity was more consistent with a notable decline only in july 6 0 0 70 in je and 21 6 13 7 in tb when the monsoon caused riverine flooding correspondingly sediment properties such as fe mn components and toc were relatively stable but slightly higher in july due to either enhanced terrigenous input or sample variability in sediment composition total sulfur contents decreased from january to july given that sulfide minerals undergo redox cycling with dissolved sulfate in porewater sulfides are oxidized effectively in summer and accumulate from sulfidization in other seasons total nitrogen contents and grain size showed little change although sediment composition was relatively constant over time there were clear seasonal trends in the association of trace metals with different mineral phases as determined by sequential extractions the modified bcr sequential extraction procedure separates sediment as and sb fractions into carbonate and exchangeable f1 extracted by acetic acid reducible f2 extracted by hydroxylammonium chloride oxidizable f3 extracted by hydrogen peroxide and residual f4 extracted with nitric and hydrofluoric acid fusion rauret et al 1999 the sum of each fraction is an estimate of as sb t the residual f4 dominated speciation for both as and sb accounting for 86 and 65 of the total content respectively fig s3 the labile fraction of sb was highest in july when both reducible and oxidizable fraction sb concentrations were highest the distribution of major labile as fractions e g reducible followed that of fe in extractions consistent with the well known sequestration of as within asc fe mn amorphous fe mn oxides gorny et al 2015 overall most parameters except for salinity showed little differences among the four sites in the same season indicating similar depositional settings interestingly total labile as sb concentrations also increased somewhat in summer this could reflect increased burial of sediments that contain fe oxides but also could reflect scavenging from the overlying water column in summer months 3 2 spatiotemporal distributions of dgt labile species in the field in mangroves one of the most important sediment redox processes is sulfate reduction and cycling the product of this reduction sulfide accumulates in dgt films dgt s which serves as a sensitive redox indicator dgt sulfide was generally negligible in the uppermost layers and rapidly increased at a depth corresponding to the transition from the oxidized zone to the zone of sulfate reduction rozan et al 2002 the oxidizing depth decreased fig 1 and hotspot values of dgt s in anoxic layers increased fig s4 in sequence from je1 to je2 to tb1 to tb2 in each season however the distribution of dgt s was so heterogeneous that both hotspots and minima are distributed throughout the profile although redox conditions were overall reducing defined as containing measurable sulfide at most sites there was an unexpectedly extensive and deep oxidizing zone up to 10 cm depth observed in the summer july in je1 2 and tb1 2 fig 1 below which the dgt s levels were very high dgt as reflects dissolved as levels in pore water the vertical trend of dgt as was somewhat similar to that of dgt s with low values near the surface and then variably increased with depth fig 1 dgt as concentrations in july were much higher at depth in summer 10 15 μg l 1 than in all other seasons 5 μg l 1 with a sharp boundary corresponding to where dgt s levels increased sharply in contrast the dgt sb concentration in january and april was highest in more oxidized surface layers then decreased with depth in july however it remained stable in most profiles and was much higher than the levels in previous seasons 3 3 correlations and cluster analyses for sediment properties and dgt species dgt as and sb were associated with dgt s levels in each vertical profile table s2 dgt as was significantly positively correlated with dgt s while dgt sb was inversely correlated with dgt s the correlations between dgt as and dgt s were weakest in april when dgt sb and dgt s correlations were strongest the correlations and cluster analyses for sediment properties and profile averaged dgt species fig 2 revealed that significant positive correlations and close relationships existed between dgt sb sediment sb fractions toc and asc mn both of which were decoupled with total sulfur and dgt s a significant positive correlation and close relationship existed between asc fe and the predominant mobile as fraction i e reducible f2 indicating the crucial regulation of amorphous fe oxides on as sequestration 3 4 redox zonation in crab free control mesocosms field systems had extensive bioturbation due to crab burrowing an ideal control for the effect of bioturbation would be a similar field system lacking crabs however this is impractical to achieve to examine redox profiles in the absence of bioturbation a crab free control was prepared in the laboratory using intact cores of the same sediments these non bioturbated control mesocosms nb1 and nb2 in figs 3 and s5 had much higher dgt s concentrations than bioturbated field sediments jul in fig 1 particularly at shallow depths interestingly although controls were not subject to active bioturbation traces of residual crab burrows are visible at 2 cm depth in controls the infilled sediment in these burrows were still anoxic but contained lower dgt s levels than surrounding sediments fig 4 we interpret this as a clear indication that natural infilling of residual burrows effectively inhibited exposure to the air and overlying oxic water which has been verified as biogeochemical hotspots for fe and sulfide thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 2017 integrated dgt s concentrations in these controls were 3 0 fold and 6 1 fold higher than bioturbated field sites in july fig 5a d dgt as followed similar trends to dgt s with integrated dgt as levels 5 0 fold and 9 6 fold higher for the whole profile and surficial 0 2 cm layer respectively than their corresponding summer sediment inventories fig 5b e dgt sb was inversely correlated to dgt s with inventories in controls that are 6 4 fold and 4 6 fold lower in crab free controls than in the whole profile and surface 0 2 cm sediments of bioturbated sediments respectively fig 5c f flooding impedes burrow development while preventing subaerial exposure to oxygen flooding increased dgt s concentrations considerably particularly in the surface sediments 1 9 fold and 2 5 fold increase relative to even the non bioturbated controls fig 5a d these sediments also had residual burrows but these burrows did not stand out in dgt s images as prominently as in non bioturbated controls fig 3 this change translated to modest increases in median and integrated dgt as concentrations and decreases in dgt sb concentrations 1 5 fold and 2 4 fold increases for as overall and at the surface 2 1 fold and 2 6 fold decreases in integrated sb overall and at the surface respectively fig 5b c e f however in flooding and non bioturbated controls their diffusion fluxes were comparable for both as 6 5 and 7 2 μg m 1 d 1 respectively and sb 0 065 and 0 046 μg m 1 d 1 respectively fig s6 fig s7 shows moran s index correlograms and sva applied in 2 d dataset of non bioturbation nb1 and nb2 and flooding f1 and f2 controls the results of moran s index showed that the spatial organization of dgt s was always patchy at the cm 0 008 to 0 5 cm scale i 0 6 p value 0 001 for farther neighbours 1 cm the moran s index values drop tending to random organization thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 the sva results presented in fig s7 black diamonds show that most of the variance comes from the scales between 0 5 cm and 1 cm accounting for more than 60 then nearly exponential decreased from 0 5 cm to 0 008 cm sacles 3 5 effect of season on metal loid distribution profiles of bioturbated field sites in autumn when crab bioturbation begins to diminish the distribution of dgt labile species s as sb and fe changed markedly with contrasting patterns between bioturbated burrow sediment and crab free controls fig 6a b in field sediments with burrowing fig 6b the chemocline increased to 8 cm in autumn below which dgt s and as rapidly increased dgt fe concentrations pan et al 2022b were quite heterogeneous with variable but generally low values in surficial environments and in infilled sediments inside burrow traces and generally higher values at depths 5 cm in intact burrow free sediment dgt sb was essentially inversely correlated to dgt fe in both vertical and horizontal dimensions fig 6b c in addition for both burrow sediment and burrow free sediment the vertical distribution of dgt s was in accordance with dgt as while dgt fe and sb behaved contrasting as shown in fig 6c and verified by fitting relationship analyses fig s9 in crab free controls the chemocline shallowed in autumn beginning at 1 cm below which dgt s as and fe each increased to their maxima at 2 3 cm depth respectively and then fluctuated or decreased somewhat below that depth fig 6c dgt sb was relative enriched in surficial layer 0 2 cm then decreased constantly with depth inversely correlated to dgt fe limited heterogeneity laterally at constant depth is present but its scale was much smaller than in field samples and relative to variation with depth 4 discussion 4 1 as and sb mobility associated with sulfide and seasonal bioturbation in the field study from january to july the results showed that dgt as and s presented consistent distributions and significant positive correlations in nearly all vertical profiles table s2 in addition the beginning depth of elevation and high value zones e g tb2 in january je2 tb1 and tb2 in july were highly coincident fig 1 this indicates that the existence and development of dissolved sulfide in sediment cores favors as mobilization from solid phases to porewater there are three principal reasons that aqueous as and sulfide concentrations are highly correlated first sediment as is associated with fe mn oxides throughout the sediment profile under sulfidic conditions these sorbents can be reduced by dissolved sulfide resulting in as mobilization burton et al 2014 saalfield and bostick 2009 iron sulfide may precipitate arsenic sulfides are more soluble under typical conditions bostick and fendorf 2003 e g alkaline conditions in this study table s1 o day et al 2004 second dissolved as concentrations can increase due to a change in their aqueous complexation particularly through the formation of thiolated arsenate and arsenite species wang et al 2020 these complexes form most appreciably when free sulfide levels are high ye et al 2020 it may explain why s as ratios were greater in summer than in other seasons fig 1 owing to more sulfidic conditions importantly thioarsenate formation causes as concentrations even in when little of the fe oxides have been reduced third sediment bound as v could be reduced to as iii which is more stable in anaerobic environments and which is generally less strongly retained by oxide minerals dixit and hering 2003 solid speciation and or aqueous speciation would be necessary to determine which of these mechanisms is most important overall the results demonstrated that sulfidic conditions tended to favor as mobilization from solid phases but un passivate as into solid sulfides in surficial mangrove sediments antimony also adsorbs strongly to fe and mn oxides and forms sulfide minerals under sulfidic conditions filella et al 2002 despite this apparent similarity dgt sb concentrations were inversely correlated to dgt as and dgt s with dgt sb levels higher in oxic surface sediments than at depth fig 1 we interpret this difference in part to differences in how sb and as adsorb and react with dissolved sulfide first sb is mobilized at the sediment water interface through the formation of sb v antimonate arsic et al 2018 ye et al 2020 which has a weak affinity for mn fe oxides han and park 2020 this sb v forms from organic matter bound sb decomposition tella and pokrovski 2012 and the oxidation of sb iii sulfides e g sb2s3 ye et al 2020 the close relationship between sediment sb fractions with toc and mn in reactive oxides fig 2 confirms that these phases are essential to sb retention rouwane et al 2016 under sulfidic conditions sb v reduction to sb iii and its precipitation within sb iii sulfides or complexation with sulfidized organic matter strongly retards sb mobility hockmann et al 2020 leuz et al 2006 given that dgt sb and dgt s data in this study consistently show a clear negative correlation between labile s and sb table s2 the formation of sb sulfide minerals rather than dissolved sulfide complexes should exert control of sb burial rather than sb mobilization this is the first high resolution observation of s sb decoupling using dgt films confirming the previous study that sb mobility was decoupled from the fe cycle and was therefore more likely linked to sulfur and or organic carbon arsic et al 2018 because sb v is weakly retained by oxides at the surface of the mangrove soil sb may be mobilized into the water column rather than accumulated in sediments resulting in incomplete burial seasonal variations in the distribution of labile species within the sediment profile were large fig 1 and table 1 potentially even leading to changes in sediment inventories of as and sb these changes for dgt species were most apparent in july which is surprising given that higher temperatures in summer can cause faster microbial respiration and lower redox potential coincident with enhanced reduction of sulfate johnston et al 2020 these higher respiration rates presumably would lead to the development of transient profiles of dissolved metals and sulfide sullivan and aller 1996 instead these data indicate that bioturbation through extensive and active crab burrowing is a more dominant factor in controlling redox state other studies also suggest that bioturbation increases the penetration of oxygen into sediments pan et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 4 2 comparison of non bioturbation and flooding effects on s as sb mobility in mesocosm experiment a growing number of studies have reported contrasting behavior of as and sb in sediments under transient redox conditions confirming that as is released under anoxic conditions that strongly retain sb arsic et al 2018 johnston et al 2020 ye et al 2020 seasonal changes in bioturbation and temperature imparted a large effect on the redox profile in these sediments consistent with observations in saltmarsh environments guimond et al 2020 bioturbation overall lead to an increase in the depth of the chemocline increasing the zone of sb mobilization and as burial in more oxidized sediments fig 3 non bioturbated controls exhibited enhanced sulfide and as concentrations but subdued sb concentrations compared with natural bioturbated field environments in summer when crab bioturbation is most intense during the year guimond et al 2020 the chemocline depth oscillating considerably in field environments from season to season this is most significantly the effect of temperature on bioturbation and or sediment microbiota because water levels do not oscillate seasonally in this study the contrasting pattern between dgt s as and sb was also notable especially regarding the seasonal variabilities in redox conditions and bioturbation as shown in fig 3 bioturbation should prevent arsenic release to overlying water while enhancing sb release fig s6 as such crab bioturbation plays a key role in controlling the exchange fluxes of metalloids in sediment overlying water systems water level is a master variable in controlling sediment redox status because water impedes exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere as such it is perhaps expected that flooding experiments reveal the critical role of tide and flooding on redox conditions and the behavior of redox sensitive solutes pan et al 2021 2020 guimond et al 2020 the interplay of water level with seasonal sediment delivery and plant activity however is more nuanced in summer with rapid production of plant derived organic matter increased flooding of intertidal sediments can favor extremely anoxic sulfidic conditions that even approach the sediment surface pan et al 2020 these data suggested that permanent flooding enhanced as mobilization 1 5 fold and decreased sb mobility 2 1 fold relative to previous simulative intertidal environments fig 5a b c largely by suppressing atmospheric oxygen infiltration however the diffusion fluxes of both as and sb were comparable for flooding and non bioturbated controls fig s6 suggesting that flooding induced more sulfidic conditions did not cause additional as release or sb sequestration it may be explained by attenuated concentration gradients in the surficial layer 0 2 cm under more sulfidic conditions fig 3 this flooding simulates the effect of sea level rise i e turning intertidal wetland into submersed mudflat without bioturbation at least for crabs while in the wild sea level rise may increase erosion that dissociates deposited sulfides releasing metals to the water column de lacerda et al 2022 our findings highlighted the crucial role of water levels in influencing physical processes in sediment that in turn affect the fates of trace metals such as as and sb the chemocline as indicated by dgt s concentrations is often quite shallow in sediments within a few cm of the sediment water interface particularly in the absence of bioturbation fig 3 patchiness effect or autocorrelation in 2 d dataset was explored using spatial correlograms of the moran s index i which showed strong patchiness for direct neighbors in horizontal and vertical directions with a characteristic length of 1 cm the fact suggests that the impact of sampling thicknesses roughly 2 cm for dgt would not result in major bias thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 the moran s index and sva also revealed a heterogeneous distribution of dgt s at cm scale as the visual 3 d trail of residual crab burrows shown in fig 4 the results further confirmed that the residual bioturbation of crab burrowing could cause significant and local disturbance at the sub cm scale 4 3 effect of temperature on redox zonation we further compared and explored temperature dependent non bioturbation effects on s as sb mobilities in the field among different seasons as shown in fig 7 similar to above mesocosm experiment the increased oxic depths were in line with increased dgt sb and decreased dgt s as mobility in either burrow sediments or burrow free sediment nevertheless the response of these chemicals to seasonal temperature were variable between burrow and burrow free sediment as shown in fig 7d e f for burrow free sediments winter spring and autumn dgt s and as increased but dgt sb decreased with increasing temperature owing to less oxic conditions and enhanced microbial sulfate reduction which has been shown to be highly temperature dependent van bodegom and stams 1999 a recent study has also verified that as and sulfide mobility may be enhanced while sb mobility possibly attenuated by elevated temperatures due to a warming climate johnston et al 2020 whilst for burrow sediments autumn and summer dgt s and as decreased 3 1 fold and 5 9 fold but dgt sb increased 3 3 fold compared with burrow free sediment in autumn owing to bioturbation as discussed above then dgt s and as further decreased but dgt sb highly increased with increasing temperature in the summer the explanation was that highest occurrence frequency of crabs and burrow density appeared with higher temperature in summer egawa et al 2021 which exerted enhanced bioturbation and thus more oxic conditions whose effects exceeded warming fueled anoxic biogeochemical processes sulfate reduction and resultant as sb mobility this finding highlights the crucial role of warming and resultant burrow activities on promoting oxic conditions in sediment enhancing sb mobility and suppressing as mobility which was opposite that the observations in non bioturbated sediments 4 4 heterogeneity in redox status all samples exhibited significant variation in sulfide as sb and fe concentrations in dgt films with depth and significant variation at specific depths this heterogeneity in part is tied to relict burrow architecture vertical burrows infilled with new and reworked sediment that exhibits different chemical processes for redox sensitive elements e g fe and sulfide thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 2017 in addition we would expect that heterogeneous availability of organic carbon in sediments is also important the intense sulfide production fig 6a in autumn might be fueled by abundant labile organic matter in sub surficial sediments and resultant mobilization of as from fe mn bound solid phases o day et al 2004 and sequestration of sb in sulfide minerals and thiolated organic matter arsic et al 2018 lateral heterogeneity in concentrations indicates that these processes of burial and release are also heterogeneous e g dgt fe and affected by burrow structure consistent oxygenation resulted in more consistent bioturbation and thus more uniform chemical conditions decreased heterogeneity the heterogeneity observed in this study is an essential observation to understanding sediment redox processes to our knowledge this heterogeneity has not been previously observed this experiment is the first time 2d imaging of dgt sb has been conducted in field environments and one of few examining porewater as levels fang et al 2018 this visualization of the microscopic micron scale niches for redox sensitive chemicals which are nearly impossible to detect with conventional 1d methods it reminds us of the critical need for high resolution sediment studies to further understand sediment biogeochemistry at a fine scale that said this technique requires considerable equilibration time and it is not ideal to capture transient changes in concentration that result from more dynamic environmental perturbations for example due to tidal fluctuations 5 conclusions this study explored the integrated effects of bioturbation warming and sea level rise on mobilities of sulfide bioavailable as and sb in subtropical estuarine mangrove wetlands by combining non bioturbated flooding incubation experiments with seasonal field studies we confirmed the hypothesis that crab bioturbation can promote oxic conditions and further drive contrasting mobilities of sulfide as and sb in warming summer with active burrowing bioturbation the rapid aerobic mineralization was expected to enhance sb remobilization fig 8a b which may be released to overlying water via both advection and diffusion stimulated by bioirrigation in contrast as was largely scavenged and incorporated by fe mn oxides whose intense mobilization only occurred in deep anoxic sulfurized layers leading to negligible release risk to the overlying water whilst the situation of non bioturbation stimulated sulfide accumulation which favored as remobilization but sb burial inversely fig 8c moreover the bioturbation effects vary with different environmental settings with global climate change such as warming and accompanying sea level rise redox conditions are likely to become more anoxic due to increased flooding but less bioturbation fig 8d the predictable impact then was completely opposite with further enhanced as mobility but suppressed sb mobility the sea level rise may shift the intertidal zone through regulating tidal flooding and continental environments which could counteract the above complex geochemical influences more research is needed to model future climate change effects by setting different hydrological regimes bioturbation intensities and

14997,global warming and sea level rise exert profound impacts on coastal mangrove ecosystems where widespread benthic crabs change sediment properties and regulate material cycles how crab bioturbation perturbs the mobilities of bioavailable arsenic as antimony sb and sulfide in sediment water systems and their variability in response to temperature and sea level rise is still unknown by combining field monitoring and laboratory experiments we found that as was mobilized under sulfidic conditions while sb was mobilized under oxic conditions in mangrove sediments crab burrowing greatly enhanced oxidizing conditions resulting in enhanced sb mobilization and release but as sequestration by iron manganese oxides in control experiments with non bioturbation the more sulfidic conditions triggered the contrasting situation of as remobilization and release but sb precipitation and burial moreover the bioturbated sediments were highly heterogeneous for spatial distributions of labile sulfide as and sb as presented by 2 d high resolution imaging and moran s index patchy at the 1 cm scale warming stimulated stronger burrowing activities which led to more oxic conditions and further sb mobilization and as sequestration whilst sea level rise did the opposite via suppressing crab burrowing activity this work highlights that global climate changes have the potential to significantly alter element cycles in coastal mangrove wetlands by regulating benthic bioturbation and redox chemistry graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic antimony

massive quantities of blue carbon in their belowground biomass donato et al 2011 mangroves play a key role in maintaining and protecting sub tropical marine biodiversity and crucial ecosystem services including regulating key global biogeochemical cycles and serving as buffers to the effects of climate change wang and gu 2021 mangroves thrive at interfaces between land and sea where key environmental factors such as temperature tide river runoff bioturbation and deposition rates are highly dynamic and sensitive to global change breitburg et al 2018 pan et al 2020 because mangroves are intermittently flooded they also contain sharp redox gradients that can concentrate and accumulate heavy metal loid s commonly associated with sulfides de lacerda et al 2020 de lacerda et al 2022 changes in sea level and temperature have the potential to affect estuarine mangrove ecosystems directly gilman et al 2008 or through the adaptation within mangroves in response to changing environments woodroffe et al 2016 increasing temperatures have the potential to create positive feedback in the global carbon cycle by promoting photosynthesis wang and gu 2021 in contrast sea level rise may decrease soil respiration and increase carbon storage within intertidal mangroves providing negative feedback in the carbon cycle krauss et al 2014 the potential effects of global change on the cycling of other chemicals in mangrove sediments is less clear but could significantly impact ecology and biogeochemical cycling de lacerda et al 2022 osland et al 2018 fiddler crabs are a dominant macrobenthos species and the principal bioturbating organisms in mangrove ecosystems sarker et al 2021 their burrowing activities greatly affect material cycles and energy flows lee 2008 which can stimulate mangrove growth smith et al 2009 crab burrows increase the surface area of sediment exposed to the air kristensen et al 2008 the effects of these burrows on both air and water exchange can impact of redox conditions and nutrients metals and sulfur cycling ferreira et al 2007 liu et al 2022b pan et al 2019 stahl et al 2014 xiao et al 2022 burrowing can increase oxygen penetration into sediments thereby oxidizing carbon guimond et al 2020 stieglitz et al 2013 xiao et al 2021 and other sediment constituents the effects of burrows depend on their density and morphology which vary sharply over time and space seaward areas more flooded typically have shallower and smaller burrow networks than drier areas and crab activity including burrow excavation is lowest in the winter egawa et al 2021 both water levels and temperature changes are major components of climate change and can deeply affect crab distributions and bioturbation extent wasson et al 2019 wilson et al 2022 despite these potential effects few studies have examined the effect of crab burrowing on transient sediment redox conditions and biogeochemistry arsenic as and antimony sb are highly toxic metalloids which have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on humans filella et al 2002 tighe et al 2005 and are considered priority pollutants by the european union cec 1976 and the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1979 chemical similarities between the two metalloids have prompted concerns over their enrichment both naturally and anthropogenically in many environments arsic et al 2018 johnston et al 2020 wilson et al 2010 the geochemical behavior of as and sb in sediments is highly dependent on their chemical speciation as well as sediment properties such as organic matter minerals sulfides and redox conditions which can affect retention mechanisms such as adsorption complexation and precipitation wilson et al 2010 in particular the availability of sulfide has considerable impact on as and sb behavior in sulfurized sediments via coprecipitation adsorption complexation and thiolation arsic et al 2018 bennett et al 2017 o day et al 2004 recent studies have confirmed that as is released under anoxic conditions whereas sb is mobilized under oxic conditions which is likely linked to sulfur s redox cycles arsic et al 2018 johnston et al 2020 ye et al 2020 however the interactions of sulfide with as and sb are still unclear in bioturbated mangrove sediments partially due to the lack of high resolution studies mangroves and other coastal wetlands are heterogeneous and complex environments where biogeochemical zones often vary sharply at the millimeter or smaller scales especially in dynamic surface sediments with redox transition zones pan et al 2020 widerlund and davison 2007 the structure composition and stability of these redox interfaces are of redox crucial for the health of mangrove ecosystems crab burrows impact the expression redox gradients between burrow surfaces water and air observing the effects of burrowing on geochemistry ideally should capture this heterogeneity diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is an in situ sampling technique that can image bioavailable as iii v and sb iii v and other solutes at the spatial resolutions needed to capture the effects of burrowing with minimal disturbance davison and zhang 1994 these thin films record abundance of bioavailable components in sediment porewater at a high spatial resolution arsic et al 2018 the binding layer of dgt acts like a plant root taking up the metals through diffusion zhang et al 2018 and has been proven as an effective method to assess the bioavailability of metal loid s in soil and wetland sediments guan et al 2021 pan et al 2022a zhang and davison 2015 nevertheless the research studying redox gradients in crab bioturbated sediments is scarce and little is known about how these gradients respond to changing environmental conditions this research used high resolution dgt films to examine in detail the chemical behaviors of sulfide as and sb in mangrove sediments with contrasting burrow networks for the first time we hypothesized that temperature and water level dependent crab burrowing activities change redox conditions and drive changes in mobility of sulfide as and sb in subtropical mangrove wetland sediments our experiments directly probe the effect of two critical variables on bioturbation and biogeochemical cycling 1 the integrated effects of bioturbation and flooding sea level rise on mobilities of sulfide and toxic metalloids through field studies and indoor experiments in highly bioturbated summer months and 2 the seasonal variability in bioturbation and sediment biogeochemistry as a direct measure of the effect of temperature to achieve these goals two subtropical mangrove wetlands in china fig s1 were studied in the field using two dimensional 2d dgt labile s i e free sulfide and laterally integrated one dimensional 1d depth profiles of as and sb and related sediment properties in three seasons winter spring and summer based on the field observations regarding ubiquitous crab burrows and extensive bioturbated sediments in summer indoor incubation experiments were also systematically conducted in the absence of crabs to simulate crab free non bioturbated conditions a negative control moreover redox gradients of these controls were compared to identical sediments that contained burrows using high resolution imaging of 2d dgt for s as sb and fe this work provides new insights into the control of bioturbation on redox geochemistry of s and its effect on soluble bioavailable as and sb and their response to global environmental changes in estuarine mangrove wetlands 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas the study areas are located in jiulong river estuary je and tongan bay tb surrounding xiamen bay fig s1a which are typical semi enclosed bays in southeastern china this region has suffered from severe pollution of heavy metal loid s due to dense industrial activities pan et al 2022b wang and wang 2017 this region has a regular semidiurnal tide with a tidal range of 3 6 m and a subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with annual rainfall of 1500 mm most of which occurs between april and september http en weather com cn when temperatures are also high the hydrodynamic forcing in je is relatively strong due to the large upstream runoff and frequent ship sailing and the slope of the tidal flat is steep 8 with 20 m between the low tide mark and the edge of the mangrove two sampling sites je1 and je2 were arranged in the central part and edge of the mangrove respectively fig s1b in contrast tb experiences calm wave activity and has a more gradual slope two sampling sites of tb1 and tb2 were similarly arranged in the central part and edge of the mangrove respectively fig s1c the four sites were located between the mid tide and high tide zones the higher the tidal zone the less flooding time in a tidal cycle the extents of tidal flooding increased from je1 to je2 to tb1 to tb2 fiddler crabs are common macrobenthos that widely inhabit the mangrove whose activities including burrowing showed little difference among two areas but large differences among seasons and with tidal zonation i e more burrows in summer than in autumn fig s1d e and in high tide zones lower flooding period and frequency compared to low tide zones fig s1f 2 2 field sampling the dgt probe was composed of a binding gel an agarose diffusive gel and a durapore pvdf millipore it was deoxygenated with nitrogen and stored in oxygen free nacl solution 0 03 m prior to use the zro agi dgt mixed binding gels of zr oxide and agi for adsorption of oxyanions as and sb and free sulfide respectively device provided by easy sensor ltd china was used for field deployment in january winter and dry season april spring and moist season and july summer and rainy season in addition the hr zro ca dgt within a high resolution of 10 μm fine intervals of binding particles for 2d imaging of hms ren et al 2021 device was used for 2d imaging of s as sb and fe for comparison of burrow and burrow free sediments in field study in october autumn and dry season the devices were inserted into the sediments at each site during the ebb tide period after one day a hollow pvc tube diameter of 8 cm was carefully plugged into the dgt surrounding sediment for both sediment sampling and dgt retrieval fig s1f then a ysi professional plus multiparameter meter was used to measure the temperature salinity ph and dissolved oxygen do of the overlying water 2 3 mesocosm experiment after field sampling in july two sediment cores 30 cm depth and overlying water were collected from je and tb using disassembled poly methyl methacrylate pmma tubes with an outer diameter of 8 cm and inner diameter of 7 cm and buckets 25 l respectively to eliminate the impact of crab bioturbation in the surface sediments the crabs were removed and the burrow openings approximately 2 3 cm depth in the two cores were filled with adjacent surface sediments retaining tortuous residual burrows in the deep layers then the cores were assembled in empty tubes more than 2 m length and the diurnal tide in the intertidal zone was simulated fig s2 this was realized by using a peristaltic pump drawing overlying water from a bucket to the incubator at a rate of 2 m of water head within 6 h and drawing back to the bucket at the same rate followed by 12 h exposure without overlying water more details were described in a previous study pan et al 2020 after three tidal cycles the dgt probes were inserted into the two sediment cores for the same deployment time as the field research 24 h then the highest water level was constantly maintained simulating a flooding event after three days another two dgt probes were applied in the two cores for 24 h 2 4 sample preprocessing in the lab the partial sediment samples were freeze dried at 80 c then ground and sieved 160 mesh for later analyses after cleaning with deionized water to remove the stained sediments the dgt binding gel was first scanned to obtain the 2d distribution of dgt labile s using the computer imaging densitometry cid technique ding et al 2012 teasdale et al 1999 then the gels were cut into strips at 5 mm vertical intervals the strips were eluted and processed for dgt labile as and sb according to wang et al 2016 the acidified eluates were measured by icp ms perkinelmer nexion 2000 for dgt labile as sb all plasticware items used for metalloid processing were pre cleaned by acid pickling and then deionized water washing for 2d imaging the dgt binding gel was clipped at a size of 10 cm depth 1 cm width as described previously gao et al 2015 the gel was mounted onto glass microscope slides avoiding air bubbles and uneven surfaces for further ablating then an asi resolution lr s155 laser microprobe equipped with a coherent compex pro 193 nm arf excimer laser was used for laser sampling the spot size of the laser microprobe was selected in the lattice area of 0 1 mm horizontal 0 1 mm vertical with a total of 100 000 data points per gel the vaporized material at each point was characterized by icp ms perkinelmer nexion 2000 resulting in high resolution 2d images of dgt s as sb and fe to improve the analytical precision a major element of the binding gel matrix i e 13c was used as an internal normalization standard following lehto et al 2012 all detailed operating and analyses of la icp ms were well described by gao et al 2015 and ren et al 2021 1d depth profiles of element concentrations are created by averaging the concentrations in the 2d dgt profiles at each depth with variance at each depth indicating something about the heterogeneity at each depth 2 5 chemical analyses for sediment analyses the grain size was measured by mastersizer 3000 malvern uk using fresh samples all other geochemical analyses were conducted using sieved samples the total organic carbon toc total nitrogen and total sulfur were determined by a vario el iii element analyzer elementar germany the amorphous fe mn oxides asc fe mn were extracted using a single step procedure involving the ascorbic acid rozan et al 2002 samples were completely digested by a mixture of hydrogen nitrate and hydrofluoric acid for total fe mn fe mn t a modified bcr community bureau of reference sequential extraction procedure was used to separate sediment as and sb fractions rauret et al 1999 all the eluates for fe mn as and sb were acidified and determined by icp ms for icp ms analyses procedural blanks replicates and reference materials were processed and examined internal standards 72ge 118in 209be were employed in the calibration of instrumental drift and sensitivity to evaluate the accuracy of analytical procedures reference material samples agilent p n 5183 4682 were repeatedly measured after every 10 or 20 samples with recoveries of 92 107 for as sb mn and fe triplicate analyses were performed for all samples with the relative standard deviation rsd of less than 10 for every sample and of 1 8 3 6 on average in addition reference material samples art no 15 00 0062 and triplicate analyses were performed every 10 or 20 samples for c n and s with recoveries of 99 100 and rsd of less than 1 2 6 data processing for la icp ms analyses calibration standards of targeted elements were established via plotting standardized la signals divided by signals of internal standards versus the corresponding elements mass then elements data of the laser were transformed into mass per area mla μg cm 2 based on the calibration curves gao et al 2015 liu et al 2022a ren et al 2021 the concentrations of dgt labile chemicals c dgt were then calculated based on eq 1 zhang et al 1995 1 c dgt m l a δ g d t m δ g d a t where δg refers to the thickness of the diffusive layer 0 8 mm d is the temperature

the dgt as and dgt sb concentrations in the vicinity of the sediment water interface 2 cm below were used to calculate the diffusion flux between the sediment and overlying water the flux was calculated based on fick s first law considering the degree of sediment tortuosity boudreau 1996 2 7 statistical analyses measured data were plotted using origin ver 2019b software other figures were plotted using corel draw ver 2018 software the significant differences between different samples were analyzed using spss ver 20 0 software with one way anova followed by duncan s multiple range tests module the significance level was set at p 0 05 for the statistical analyses linear correlations and multiple regression analyses between different parameters were analyzed and plotted using pearson correlation and asymptotic analysis within origin ver 2019b patchiness effect or autocorrelation in 2 d dataset was explored using spatial correlograms of the moran s index i computed with r package spdep following bivand and wong 2018 and thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 scale variance analysis sva was employed to decompose the total variance of dataset to identify the contribution of each scale to the variance following thibault de chanvalon et al 2022 3 results 3 1 solid sediment properties the overlying water during the ebb tide period and sediment properties are shown in table s1 for the two field study sites from january winter to april spring and to july summer the overlying water temperature increased from 17 2 to 21 5 and to 28 5 and do decreased over the same period salinity was more consistent with a notable decline only in july 6 0 0 70 in je and 21 6 13 7 in tb when the monsoon caused riverine flooding correspondingly sediment properties such as fe mn components and toc were relatively stable but slightly higher in july due to either enhanced terrigenous input or sample variability in sediment composition total sulfur contents decreased from january to july given that sulfide minerals undergo redox cycling with dissolved sulfate in porewater sulfides are oxidized effectively in summer and accumulate from sulfidization in other seasons total nitrogen contents and grain size showed little change although sediment composition was relatively constant over time there were clear seasonal trends in the association of trace metals with different mineral phases as determined by sequential extractions the modified bcr sequential extraction procedure separates sediment as and sb fractions into carbonate and exchangeable f1 extracted by acetic acid reducible f2 extracted by hydroxylammonium chloride oxidizable f3 extracted by hydrogen peroxide and residual f4 extracted with nitric and hydrofluoric acid fusion rauret et al 1999 the sum of each fraction is an estimate of as sb t the residual f4 dominated speciation for both as and sb accounting for 86 and 65 of the total content respectively fig s3 the labile fraction of sb was highest in july when both reducible and oxidizable fraction sb concentrations were highest the distribution of major labile as fractions e g reducible followed that of fe in extractions consistent with the well known sequestration of as within asc fe mn amorphous fe mn oxides gorny et al 2015 overall most parameters except for salinity showed little differences among the four sites in the same season indicating similar depositional settings interestingly total labile as sb concentrations also increased somewhat in summer this could reflect increased burial of sediments that contain fe oxides but also could reflect scavenging from the overlying water column in summer months 3 2 spatiotemporal distributions of dgt labile species in the field in mangroves one of the most important sediment redox processes is sulfate reduction and cycling the product of this reduction sulfide accumulates in dgt films dgt s which serves as a sensitive redox indicator dgt sulfide was generally negligible in the uppermost layers and rapidly increased at a depth corresponding to the transition from the oxidized zone to the zone of sulfate reduction rozan et al 2002 the oxidizing depth decreased fig 1 and hotspot values of dgt s in anoxic layers increased fig s4 in sequence from je1 to je2 to tb1 to tb2 in each season however the distribution of dgt s was so heterogeneous that both hotspots and minima are distributed throughout the profile although redox conditions were overall reducing defined as containing measurable sulfide at most sites there was an unexpectedly extensive and deep oxidizing zone up to 10 cm depth observed in the summer july in je1 2 and tb1 2 fig 1 below which the dgt s levels were very high dgt as reflects dissolved as levels in pore water the vertical trend of dgt as was somewhat similar to that of dgt s with low values near the surface and then variably increased with depth fig 1 dgt as concentrations in july were much higher at depth in summer 10 15 μg l 1 than in all other seasons 5 μg l 1 with a sharp boundary corresponding to where dgt s levels increased sharply in contrast the dgt sb concentration in january and april was highest in more oxidized surface layers then decreased with depth in july however it remained stable in most profiles and was much higher than the levels in previous seasons 3 3 correlations and cluster analyses for sediment properties and dgt species dgt as and sb were associated with dgt s levels in each vertical profile table s2 dgt as was significantly positively correlated with dgt s while dgt sb was inversely correlated with dgt s the correlations between dgt as and dgt s were weakest in april when dgt sb and dgt s correlations were strongest the correlations and cluster analyses for sediment properties and profile averaged dgt species fig 2 revealed that significant positive correlations and close relationships existed between dgt sb sediment sb fractions toc and asc mn both of which were decoupled with total sulfur and dgt s a significant positive correlation and close relationship existed between asc fe and the predominant mobile as fraction i e reducible f2 indicating the crucial regulation of amorphous fe oxides on as sequestration 3 4 redox zonation in crab free control mesocosms field systems had extensive bioturbation due to crab burrowing an ideal control for the effect of bioturbation would be a similar field system lacking crabs however this is impractical to achieve to examine redox profiles in the absence of bioturbation a crab free control was prepared in the laboratory using intact cores of the same sediments these non bioturbated control mesocosms nb1 and nb2 in figs 3 and s5 had much higher dgt s concentrations than bioturbated field sediments jul in fig 1 particularly at shallow depths interestingly although controls were not subject to active bioturbation traces of residual crab burrows are visible at 2 cm depth in controls the infilled sediment in these burrows were still anoxic but contained lower dgt s levels than surrounding sediments fig 4 we interpret this as a clear indication that natural infilling of residual burrows effectively inhibited exposure to the air and overlying oxic water which has been verified as biogeochemical hotspots for fe and sulfide thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 2017 integrated dgt s concentrations in these controls were 3 0 fold and 6 1 fold higher than bioturbated field sites in july fig 5a d dgt as followed similar trends to dgt s with integrated dgt as levels 5 0 fold and 9 6 fold higher for the whole profile and surficial 0 2 cm layer respectively than their corresponding summer sediment inventories fig 5b e dgt sb was inversely correlated to dgt s with inventories in controls that are 6 4 fold and 4 6 fold lower in crab free controls than in the whole profile and surface 0 2 cm sediments of bioturbated sediments respectively fig 5c f flooding impedes burrow development while preventing subaerial exposure to oxygen flooding increased dgt s concentrations considerably particularly in the surface sediments 1 9 fold and 2 5 fold increase relative to even the non bioturbated controls fig 5a d these sediments also had residual burrows but these burrows did not stand out in dgt s images as prominently as in non bioturbated controls fig 3 this change translated to modest increases in median and integrated dgt as concentrations and decreases in dgt sb concentrations 1 5 fold and 2 4 fold increases for as overall and at the surface 2 1 fold and 2 6 fold decreases in integrated sb overall and at the surface respectively fig 5b c e f however in flooding and non bioturbated controls their diffusion fluxes were comparable for both as 6 5 and 7 2 μg m 1 d 1 respectively and sb 0 065 and 0 046 μg m 1 d 1 respectively fig s6 fig s7 shows moran s index correlograms and sva applied in 2 d dataset of non bioturbation nb1 and nb2 and flooding f1 and f2 controls the results of moran s index showed that the spatial organization of dgt s was always patchy at the cm 0 008 to 0 5 cm scale i 0 6 p value 0 001 for farther neighbours 1 cm the moran s index values drop tending to random organization thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 the sva results presented in fig s7 black diamonds show that most of the variance comes from the scales between 0 5 cm and 1 cm accounting for more than 60 then nearly exponential decreased from 0 5 cm to 0 008 cm sacles 3 5 effect of season on metal loid distribution profiles of bioturbated field sites in autumn when crab bioturbation begins to diminish the distribution of dgt labile species s as sb and fe changed markedly with contrasting patterns between bioturbated burrow sediment and crab free controls fig 6a b in field sediments with burrowing fig 6b the chemocline increased to 8 cm in autumn below which dgt s and as rapidly increased dgt fe concentrations pan et al 2022b were quite heterogeneous with variable but generally low values in surficial environments and in infilled sediments inside burrow traces and generally higher values at depths 5 cm in intact burrow free sediment dgt sb was essentially inversely correlated to dgt fe in both vertical and horizontal dimensions fig 6b c in addition for both burrow sediment and burrow free sediment the vertical distribution of dgt s was in accordance with dgt as while dgt fe and sb behaved contrasting as shown in fig 6c and verified by fitting relationship analyses fig s9 in crab free controls the chemocline shallowed in autumn beginning at 1 cm below which dgt s as and fe each increased to their maxima at 2 3 cm depth respectively and then fluctuated or decreased somewhat below that depth fig 6c dgt sb was relative enriched in surficial layer 0 2 cm then decreased constantly with depth inversely correlated to dgt fe limited heterogeneity laterally at constant depth is present but its scale was much smaller than in field samples and relative to variation with depth 4 discussion 4 1 as and sb mobility associated with sulfide and seasonal bioturbation in the field study from january to july the results showed that dgt as and s presented consistent distributions and significant positive correlations in nearly all vertical profiles table s2 in addition the beginning depth of elevation and high value zones e g tb2 in january je2 tb1 and tb2 in july were highly coincident fig 1 this indicates that the existence and development of dissolved sulfide in sediment cores favors as mobilization from solid phases to porewater there are three principal reasons that aqueous as and sulfide concentrations are highly correlated first sediment as is associated with fe mn oxides throughout the sediment profile under sulfidic conditions these sorbents can be reduced by dissolved sulfide resulting in as mobilization burton et al 2014 saalfield and bostick 2009 iron sulfide may precipitate arsenic sulfides are more soluble under typical conditions bostick and fendorf 2003 e g alkaline conditions in this study table s1 o day et al 2004 second dissolved as concentrations can increase due to a change in their aqueous complexation particularly through the formation of thiolated arsenate and arsenite species wang et al 2020 these complexes form most appreciably when free sulfide levels are high ye et al 2020 it may explain why s as ratios were greater in summer than in other seasons fig 1 owing to more sulfidic conditions importantly thioarsenate formation causes as concentrations even in when little of the fe oxides have been reduced third sediment bound as v could be reduced to as iii which is more stable in anaerobic environments and which is generally less strongly retained by oxide minerals dixit and hering 2003 solid speciation and or aqueous speciation would be necessary to determine which of these mechanisms is most important overall the results demonstrated that sulfidic conditions tended to favor as mobilization from solid phases but un passivate as into solid sulfides in surficial mangrove sediments antimony also adsorbs strongly to fe and mn oxides and forms sulfide minerals under sulfidic conditions filella et al 2002 despite this apparent similarity dgt sb concentrations were inversely correlated to dgt as and dgt s with dgt sb levels higher in oxic surface sediments than at depth fig 1 we interpret this difference in part to differences in how sb and as adsorb and react with dissolved sulfide first sb is mobilized at the sediment water interface through the formation of sb v antimonate arsic et al 2018 ye et al 2020 which has a weak affinity for mn fe oxides han and park 2020 this sb v forms from organic matter bound sb decomposition tella and pokrovski 2012 and the oxidation of sb iii sulfides e g sb2s3 ye et al 2020 the close relationship between sediment sb fractions with toc and mn in reactive oxides fig 2 confirms that these phases are essential to sb retention rouwane et al 2016 under sulfidic conditions sb v reduction to sb iii and its precipitation within sb iii sulfides or complexation with sulfidized organic matter strongly retards sb mobility hockmann et al 2020 leuz et al 2006 given that dgt sb and dgt s data in this study consistently show a clear negative correlation between labile s and sb table s2 the formation of sb sulfide minerals rather than dissolved sulfide complexes should exert control of sb burial rather than sb mobilization this is the first high resolution observation of s sb decoupling using dgt films confirming the previous study that sb mobility was decoupled from the fe cycle and was therefore more likely linked to sulfur and or organic carbon arsic et al 2018 because sb v is weakly retained by oxides at the surface of the mangrove soil sb may be mobilized into the water column rather than accumulated in sediments resulting in incomplete burial seasonal variations in the distribution of labile species within the sediment profile were large fig 1 and table 1 potentially even leading to changes in sediment inventories of as and sb these changes for dgt species were most apparent in july which is surprising given that higher temperatures in summer can cause faster microbial respiration and lower redox potential coincident with enhanced reduction of sulfate johnston et al 2020 these higher respiration rates presumably would lead to the development of transient profiles of dissolved metals and sulfide sullivan and aller 1996 instead these data indicate that bioturbation through extensive and active crab burrowing is a more dominant factor in controlling redox state other studies also suggest that bioturbation increases the penetration of oxygen into sediments pan et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 4 2 comparison of non bioturbation and flooding effects on s as sb mobility in mesocosm experiment a growing number of studies have reported contrasting behavior of as and sb in sediments under transient redox conditions confirming that as is released under anoxic conditions that strongly retain sb arsic et al 2018 johnston et al 2020 ye et al 2020 seasonal changes in bioturbation and temperature imparted a large effect on the redox profile in these sediments consistent with observations in saltmarsh environments guimond et al 2020 bioturbation overall lead to an increase in the depth of the chemocline increasing the zone of sb mobilization and as burial in more oxidized sediments fig 3 non bioturbated controls exhibited enhanced sulfide and as concentrations but subdued sb concentrations compared with natural bioturbated field environments in summer when crab bioturbation is most intense during the year guimond et al 2020 the chemocline depth oscillating considerably in field environments from season to season this is most significantly the effect of temperature on bioturbation and or sediment microbiota because water levels do not oscillate seasonally in this study the contrasting pattern between dgt s as and sb was also notable especially regarding the seasonal variabilities in redox conditions and bioturbation as shown in fig 3 bioturbation should prevent arsenic release to overlying water while enhancing sb release fig s6 as such crab bioturbation plays a key role in controlling the exchange fluxes of metalloids in sediment overlying water systems water level is a master variable in controlling sediment redox status because water impedes exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere as such it is perhaps expected that flooding experiments reveal the critical role of tide and flooding on redox conditions and the behavior of redox sensitive solutes pan et al 2021 2020 guimond et al 2020 the interplay of water level with seasonal sediment delivery and plant activity however is more nuanced in summer with rapid production of plant derived organic matter increased flooding of intertidal sediments can favor extremely anoxic sulfidic conditions that even approach the sediment surface pan et al 2020 these data suggested that permanent flooding enhanced as mobilization 1 5 fold and decreased sb mobility 2 1 fold relative to previous simulative intertidal environments fig 5a b c largely by suppressing atmospheric oxygen infiltration however the diffusion fluxes of both as and sb were comparable for flooding and non bioturbated controls fig s6 suggesting that flooding induced more sulfidic conditions did not cause additional as release or sb sequestration it may be explained by attenuated concentration gradients in the surficial layer 0 2 cm under more sulfidic conditions fig 3 this flooding simulates the effect of sea level rise i e turning intertidal wetland into submersed mudflat without bioturbation at least for crabs while in the wild sea level rise may increase erosion that dissociates deposited sulfides releasing metals to the water column de lacerda et al 2022 our findings highlighted the crucial role of water levels in influencing physical processes in sediment that in turn affect the fates of trace metals such as as and sb the chemocline as indicated by dgt s concentrations is often quite shallow in sediments within a few cm of the sediment water interface particularly in the absence of bioturbation fig 3 patchiness effect or autocorrelation in 2 d dataset was explored using spatial correlograms of the moran s index i which showed strong patchiness for direct neighbors in horizontal and vertical directions with a characteristic length of 1 cm the fact suggests that the impact of sampling thicknesses roughly 2 cm for dgt would not result in major bias thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 the moran s index and sva also revealed a heterogeneous distribution of dgt s at cm scale as the visual 3 d trail of residual crab burrows shown in fig 4 the results further confirmed that the residual bioturbation of crab burrowing could cause significant and local disturbance at the sub cm scale 4 3 effect of temperature on redox zonation we further compared and explored temperature dependent non bioturbation effects on s as sb mobilities in the field among different seasons as shown in fig 7 similar to above mesocosm experiment the increased oxic depths were in line with increased dgt sb and decreased dgt s as mobility in either burrow sediments or burrow free sediment nevertheless the response of these chemicals to seasonal temperature were variable between burrow and burrow free sediment as shown in fig 7d e f for burrow free sediments winter spring and autumn dgt s and as increased but dgt sb decreased with increasing temperature owing to less oxic conditions and enhanced microbial sulfate reduction which has been shown to be highly temperature dependent van bodegom and stams 1999 a recent study has also verified that as and sulfide mobility may be enhanced while sb mobility possibly attenuated by elevated temperatures due to a warming climate johnston et al 2020 whilst for burrow sediments autumn and summer dgt s and as decreased 3 1 fold and 5 9 fold but dgt sb increased 3 3 fold compared with burrow free sediment in autumn owing to bioturbation as discussed above then dgt s and as further decreased but dgt sb highly increased with increasing temperature in the summer the explanation was that highest occurrence frequency of crabs and burrow density appeared with higher temperature in summer egawa et al 2021 which exerted enhanced bioturbation and thus more oxic conditions whose effects exceeded warming fueled anoxic biogeochemical processes sulfate reduction and resultant as sb mobility this finding highlights the crucial role of warming and resultant burrow activities on promoting oxic conditions in sediment enhancing sb mobility and suppressing as mobility which was opposite that the observations in non bioturbated sediments 4 4 heterogeneity in redox status all samples exhibited significant variation in sulfide as sb and fe concentrations in dgt films with depth and significant variation at specific depths this heterogeneity in part is tied to relict burrow architecture vertical burrows infilled with new and reworked sediment that exhibits different chemical processes for redox sensitive elements e g fe and sulfide thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 2017 in addition we would expect that heterogeneous availability of organic carbon in sediments is also important the intense sulfide production fig 6a in autumn might be fueled by abundant labile organic matter in sub surficial sediments and resultant mobilization of as from fe mn bound solid phases o day et al 2004 and sequestration of sb in sulfide minerals and thiolated organic matter arsic et al 2018 lateral heterogeneity in concentrations indicates that these processes of burial and release are also heterogeneous e g dgt fe and affected by burrow structure consistent oxygenation resulted in more consistent bioturbation and thus more uniform chemical conditions decreased heterogeneity the heterogeneity observed in this study is an essential observation to understanding sediment redox processes to our knowledge this heterogeneity has not been previously observed this experiment is the first time 2d imaging of dgt sb has been conducted in field environments and one of few examining porewater as levels fang et al 2018 this visualization of the microscopic micron scale niches for redox sensitive chemicals which are nearly impossible to detect with conventional 1d methods it reminds us of the critical need for high resolution sediment studies to further understand sediment biogeochemistry at a fine scale that said this technique requires considerable equilibration time and it is not ideal to capture transient changes in concentration that result from more dynamic environmental perturbations for example due to tidal fluctuations 5 conclusions this study explored the integrated effects of bioturbation warming and sea level rise on mobilities of sulfide bioavailable as and sb in subtropical estuarine mangrove wetlands by combining non bioturbated flooding incubation experiments with seasonal field studies we confirmed the hypothesis that crab bioturbation can promote oxic conditions and further drive contrasting mobilities of sulfide as and sb in warming summer with active burrowing bioturbation the rapid aerobic mineralization was expected to enhance sb remobilization fig 8a b which may be released to overlying water via both advection and diffusion stimulated by bioirrigation in contrast as was largely scavenged and incorporated by fe mn oxides whose intense mobilization only occurred in deep anoxic sulfurized layers leading to negligible release risk to the overlying water whilst the situation of non bioturbation stimulated sulfide accumulation which favored as remobilization but sb burial inversely fig 8c moreover the bioturbation effects vary with different environmental settings with global climate change such as warming and accompanying sea level rise redox conditions are likely to become more anoxic due to increased flooding but less bioturbation fig 8d the predictable impact then was completely opposite with further enhanced as mobility but suppressed sb mobility the sea level rise may shift the intertidal zone through regulating tidal flooding and continental environments which could counteract the above complex geochemical influences more research is needed to model future climate change effects by setting different hydrological regimes bioturbation intensities and

14998,as an essential source of the natural dissolved organic matter dom dissolved black carbon dbc plays a vital role in the photodegradation of organics however there is rare information about the dbc induced photodegradation mechanism of clindamycin clm one of the widely used antibiotics herein we discovered dbc generated reactive oxygen species ros stimulated clm photodegradation hydroxy radical oh could directly attack clm by oh addition reaction the singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide o2 contributed to the clm degradation by transforming to oh in addition the binding between clm and dbcs inhibited the photodegradation of clm by decreasing the concentration of freely dissolved clm binding process inhibited clm photodegradation by 0 25 1 98 at ph 7 0 and 6 1 41 77 at ph 8 5 these findings suggest that the photodegradation of clm by dbc is simultaneously regulated by the ros production and binding effect between clm and dbc benefiting the exact evaluation of the environmental impact of dbcs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords clindamycin dissolved black carbon binding photodegradation inhibition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the combustion of biomass and fossil fuels releases vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere leading to global climate change bowman et al 2009 coppola et al 2018 foster et al 2017 up to 27 of these released carbon is retained as black carbon bc rather than emitted as greenhouse gasses coppola et al 2019 it is estimated that 114 383 tg bc was produced worldwide every year wan et al 2021 once entering the soil or water environment bc participates in various geochemical cycles santín nuno et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 meanwhile bc releases large amounts of dissolved black carbon dbc in the surface water or soil environment zhang et al 2020a which are deemed an essential source of the natural dom pool wan et al 2021 yang et al 2021a dbc accounts for approximately 10 of the global riverine flux of dom to oceans 5 7 of coastal oceanic dom and more than 2 of marine dom dittmar and paeng 2009 fu et al 2016 jaffé et al 2013 mannino and rodger harvey 2004 therefore it is of great importance to understand the role of dom in the geochemical cycles in recent years the photoreactivity of dbc has attracted the great attention of researchers under sunlight the chromophoric components in dbc can generate transient reactive oxygen species ros which could participate in the degradation of antibiotics pesticides and endocrine disruptors chang et al 2019 fang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a photodegradation has been identified as one of the efficient elimination ways for the degradation of organic contaminants in aquatic environments remucal 2014 ren et al 2021 zuo et al 2013 dbcs exhibit a stronger photoreactivity than other well studied dom and have a significantly high yield of ros such as oh wan et al 2021 wang et al 2020 and 1o2 fu et al 2016 hence dbcs is regarded as the major source of ros under light irradiation yang et al 2021b zhang et al 2020a in addition to stimulating the photodegradation through ros generation dom can simultaneously interact with organics akkanen and kukkonen 2003 chen et al 2017 in aquatic environment organic pollutants could bind to dom through various interaction mechanisms such as hydrogen bond aromatic stacking hydrophobic force and electrostatic interaction gan et al 2019 zhu et al 2012 the interaction between organic pollutants and dom leads to electron density shift and energy transfer guo et al 2019 zhou et al 2013 thus the availability of the bound organic pollutants for photodegradation may be different from the freely dissolved organic pollutants however the effect of the binding between organic pollutants and dbcs on the photodegradation of organic pollutants has rarely been considered before incorporating this binding influence into the photodegradation by dbcs can improve the prediction of biogeochemistry effect of dbcs due to effective antibacterial and bactericidal effect the antibiotics are widely used to treat bacteria induced disease in both human beings and animals douafer et al 2019 ghauch et al 2017 the overuse and uncontrolled release of antibiotics have resulted in increased bacterial resistance and dispersion of antibiotic resistance genes zhang et al 2018 2020b and emerged as a global crisis during the past decade wright 2011 yang et al 2021b lincosamides are one of the most common antibacterial agents that have a wide clinical application against a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms clindamycin clm is a lincosamide antibiotic farzadkia et al 2014 and effectively sterilizes pathogens and microbes for serious infections treatment of the respiratory tract skin and soft tissue gholami et al 2019 2016 liu et al 1997 clm is released into the environment through human excretion and the destruction of expired drugs batt et al 2006 gholami et al 2019 ooi et al 2017 and threatens the health of humans and animals munir et al 2011 while being stable in aqueous solutions clm can be degradable by a combination of zerovalent iron h2o2 and ultrasonication in engineering application daija et al 2016 oesterling 1970 reis et al 2020 however the photodegradation mechanism of clm by dbcs is still largely unknown limiting the accurate analysis of the environmental behavior and impact of clm dbcs regulated photodegradation is crucial to removal of clm in aquatic environments especially the participation of ros generated from the photolysis of dbcs needs further investigation the objectives of this work are i to investigate the photodegradation of clm by dbc ii to identify the role of ros 1o2 oh and o2 using the ros quenching experiment iii to determine the clm degradation pathways through ultra high performance liquid chromatography linear ion trap orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry uplc lto orbitrap ms iv to study the effect of binding between clm and dbc on the photodegradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of dbcs and ros monitoring the chemicals used in this study are described in the supporting information si text s1 and the preparation detail of dbc samples is provided in the si text s2 briefly dbcs were extracted from different biochar samples which were pyrolyzed at 200 c or

photodegradation of clm by dbcs the photodegradation kinetics of clm 10 mg l in the presence or absence of dbc 25 mg c l were conducted with 120 min uv irradiation at ph 8 5 and 7 0 the kinetics of clm removal were studied in batch experiments using 50 ml quartz colorimetric tubes with magnetic stirring and the reaction temperature was 20 c tubes were placed in a photochemical reactor xpa 7 nanjing xujiang electromechanical plant china and rotated at 400 rpm a 300 w high pressure mercury lamp with a light filter was placed in a quartz cooling pipe positioned vertically in the center of the photochemical reactor the light source wavelength ranged from 350 to 450 nm and centered at 365 nm the light intensity at 365 nm in the quartz colorimetric tube was 54 5 mw cm2 control experiments without dbcs were conducted under the same reaction conditions and the dark control experiments were performed by covering tubes with aluminum foil the concentration of clm was detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 usa with a reversed phase c8 column 5 mm 4 6 150 mm and a uv detector 205 nm the mobile phase was the mixture of acetonitrile and deionized water volume ratio of 70 30 0 05 acetic acid with a flow rate of 1 ml min and the retention time for clm was 2 5 min the ph of all the reaction systems was adjusted by 0 1 m hcl or 0 01 m naoh solutions phosphate buffer solution pbs ph 7 0 or 8 5 10 mm was used to maintain the degradation solution at the target ph 2 4 analysis of degradation products of clm the degradation products of clm were analyzed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography linear ion trap orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry uplc lto orbitrap ms including an hplc ultimate 3000 dionex usa and a ltq orbitrap xl mass spectrometer thermo scientific germany which equipped with a c18 column agilent poroshell 120 hypersil gold 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 9 μm the mobile phase was methanol and deionized water volume ratio of 99 1 0 1 formic acid and the flow rate was 0 3 ml min the mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode using heated electrospray ionization esi at 300 c and a spray voltage of 3 5 kv fourier transform mass spectrometry ftms scan mode had a mass resolution of 60 000 and an m z detection range of 100 800 2 5 the interaction between dbcs and clm in dialysis equilibrium systems the influence of dbcs clm interaction on clm photodegradation was investigated by the dialysis equilibrium system the dialysis membrane was pretreated in a mixture of 2 w v nahco3 and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta ph 8 0 for 30 min then washed continuously with running distilled water 30 min to avoid the uncertainties brought by the diffusion of small dom molecules through dialysis membrane small molecules 500 da were discarded preliminarily four dbc solutions were enclosed separately in dialysis membranes with both ends sealed washed with deionized water and ultrapure water three times sequentially and finally soaked in ultrapure water the soaked ultrapure water was refreshed three times a day until no organic carbon was detected after adjusting ph to 7 0 or 8 5 the pretreated dbc solutions were stored in a 4 c refrigerator for further total organic carbon toc quantification in the dialysis equilibrium system the dialysis membranes were tied at one end and put in 40 ml vials with teflon lined screw caps ten mg l clm in pbs buffer solution ph 7 0 10 mm were added outside the dialysis bag and 20 ml dbcs 25 mg c l were injected inside the dialysis bag then the dialysis bags were finally pressed under the caps to seal the bags all the vials were continuously shaken in the dark on an air bath shaker at 25 c for 7 d according to our preliminary study 7 days were long enough for apparent equilibrium clm concentrations inside and outside the dialysis bag were quantified using hplc 3 results 3 1 photodegradation of clm by dbcs the clm photodegradation by four dbcs under uv light irradiation was investigated at ph 8 5 and 7 0 fig 1 in pure clm system no obvious photodegradation of clm was observed indicating clm was less photosensitive under uv light irradiation with the addition of dbcs the significant photodegradation of clm was observed at both ph 7 0 and 8 5 the degradation kinetics of clm were fitted with the pseudo first order model table 1 the first order degradation rate constant k r of clm at ph 7 0 ranged from 0 0141 h 1 to 0 0417 h 1 comparatively clm was degraded more quickly at ph 8 5 with the k r values ranging from 0 066 h 1 to 0 615 h 1 at ph 8 5 more clm was degraded with c400 and p400 than 200 c dbcs table 1 compared to ph 7 0 the higher degradation rate of clm with c400 0 0417 h 1 than 200 c dbcs 0 0193 0 0277h 1 was also observed but it was notable that the degradation rate of clm with p400 was suppressed at ph 7 0 which evidenced by the lower degradation rate 0 0141 h 1 than that with other dbcs 0 0193 0 0417 h 1 according to ros quenching studies the stimulation of dbcs generated ros to clm photodegradation was certified fig 2 the addition of the scavengers significantly inhibited the photodegradation of clm under uv dbcs system due to the quenching of oh 1o2 and o2 the removal efficiency of clm decreased from 12 20 to 56 85 to 0 0 85 1 57 10 06 and 2 08 7 16 respectively table s4 these results confirmed that the photodegradation of clm by dbcs was mainly attributed to the ros generated from dbcs the quenching of oh resulted in the highest inhibition on clm removal indicated the oh played a relatively vital role in clm photodegradation than 1o2 and o2 according to the analysis of ros production c400 and p400 generated more 1o2 and oh than c200 and p200 at ph 8 5 p400 generated the lower 1o2 and o2 but the higher oh than the other three dbcs at ph 7 0 figs s1 and s2 table s3 to further analyze the ros stimulated photodegradation mechanism of clm in uv dbcs system the analysis of photodegradation products and pathways of clm were analyzed through uplc lto orbitrap ms 3 2 analysis of photodegradation pathways of clm with dbc the intermediates of clm photodegradation in the presence of dbcs are presented in fig 3 the parent compound of clm had the pseudo molecular ion m na with m z of 447 169 yielding two major fragments with m z of 411 193 and 126 128 at a retention time of 0 85 min fig 3 a the fragment with m z of 411 193 was formed due to the loss of hcl and the fragment with m z of 126 128 corresponded to 3 propyl n methylpyrrolidine ion abbreviated as a the hcl elimination reaction and the form of a ion during clm degradation were also observed in the reaction with manganese oxide in aqueous solution chen et al 2010 in addition the intermediate ions with m z of 426 830 408 820 and 390 809 at a retention time of 1 00 min fig 3b also derived from the loss of hcl by elimination reaction wang et al 2009 zhou et al 2006 moreover the inter mediate ions with m z of 306 871 288 861 and 266 879 were formed due to the loss of both hcl and a ion the intermediate ions with m z of 164 930 and 142 948 were formed with the addition of hydroxyl on a ion which derived from the attacking of oh the detected and calculated masses of proposed neutral loss of the ion at m z 447 169 of clm were listed in table s5 based on ros and intermediates analysis a proposed pathway for clm photodegradation with dbc was presented in fig 4 the m hcl product was preliminarily formed in the dbc uv system and then broken with the formation of m hcl a and a subsequently the product of a oh was formed by the attack of oh on a although the degradation productions were identified fig 4 the toxicity assessment over a life cycle is critical to the accurate prediction of environmental impact of clm the detected degradation products and pathway of clm certified that oh generated from dbcs could directly degrade clm by oh addition reaction and played a pivotal role in clm degradation thus owing to the higher oh yield of 400 c dbcs it was reasonable that more clm was degraded with c400 and p400 than 200 c dbcs at ph 8 5 while no degradation products that formed by the direct attack of o2 or and 1o2 were detected in this study or previous studies farzadkia et al 2014 gholami et al 2019 keen and linden 2013 the 1o2 is in a quantum state

an important precursor of oh chen et al 2015 ikai et al 2010 herein combined with the ros quenching results the 1o2 and o2 generated from dbc should contribute to clm degradation by transforming to oh

environment besides degrading organic pollutants through generating ros dbcs can frequently interact with organics via various interaction mechanisms gan et al 2019 zheng et al 2007 zhu et al 2012 to better understand the degradation mechanisms as affected by dbcs the kinetics of clm photodegradation after apparent binding equilibrium was conducted to investigate the effect of the binding on the degradation 3 3 the binding between clm and dbcs inhibited the photodegradation the photodegradation experiments of clm with dbcs after apparent binding equilibrium were conducted to investigate the effect of the binding process on photodegradation the photodegradation kinetics at ph 8 5 and 7 0 are shown in fig 5 a and b after apparent binding equilibrium the removal efficiencies of clm photodegradation decreased to 2 72 7 31 at ph 7 0 and 6 10 15 08 at ph 8 5 the reduced removal efficiency of clm certified the inhibition of the interaction of clm dbcs to photodegradation due to the binding process the bound clm may show lower availability for photodegradation than freely dissolved clm which could explain that although more ros was generated at ph 7 0 the clm photodegradation was much lower than ph 8 5 the interactions between clm and four dbcs were further investigated by a dialysis equilibrium system the binding affinities of clm to dbcs at both ph 7 0 and 8 5 were described by carbon normalized sorption coefficients k oc fig 6 table s6 with the increase of ph from 7 0 to 8 5 the k oc values of all the dbc samples decreased specifically the k oc value of p400 decreased from 0 00225 ph 7 0 to 0 000554 ph 8 5 the lower k oc values suggested the binding affinity between dbcs and clm at ph 8 5 was lower than that at ph 7 0 on the one hand more dissociation of the acidic groups oh and cooh at ph 8 5 than ph 7 0 can increase the negative charge of dbcs gan et al 2019 on the other hand at ph 8 5 clm existed mainly as an ionic form with the negative charge dissociation degree of 7 72 frkova et al 2020 the electrostatic repulsion between the negative charged dbcs and clm at ph 8 5 was higher than that at ph 7 0 which could weaken their binding affinity and impede the binding process gan et al 2019 4 discussion our work proved that the clm photodegradation with dbcs was mainly attributed to the ros including oh 1o2 and o2 the oh played a critical role in clm photodegradation and could directly react with clm while 1o2 and o2 might participate in photodegradation process by transforming to oh in addition the clm photodegradation could be hampered by the binding between clm and dbcs which can be regulated by the dissociation state of clm compared with clm in molecular form clm in dissociated state an electron rich radical anions produced by deprotonation of hydroxyl structures are more susceptible toward electrophilic attack torres et al 2003 including the attack of ros yang et al 2017 clm photodegradation at ph 8 5 was dominated by the oh yield of dbcs whereas the interaction of clm dbcs at ph 7 0 explained a unique portion of the clm photodegradation due to the weak electrostatic repulsion the strong binding between clm and dbcs at ph 7 0 played a more important role in the photodegradation the possible inhibition mechanisms of binding on the clm photodegradation may involve 1 binding process protected the clm molecular from the ros attack during the photodegradation 2 the binding between clm and dbcs decreased the electronic density of clm which was less likely to be attacked by ros yang et al 2017 the result demonstrated bdoms in natural environment can not only stimulate clm photodegradation by producing ros to attack clm but also inhibit the removal of clm through their binding process dom can interact with organics with functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl through the hydrogen bonds which was one of the main binding mechanisms between organic molecules gan et al 2019 zhu et al 2012 clm has three hydroxyl groups in its sugar moiety and is hydrophilic solubility 92 mg ml in water 25 c compared to 200 c dbcs p400 and c400 contained more hydroxyl and carbonyl groups tables s1 and s2 which can form hydrogen bond with clm during binding process kulczycka mierzejewska et al 2018 schlünzen et al 2001 therefore for the same biomass 400 c dbcs exhibited stronger interaction with clm than 200 c dbcs at both ph 8 5 and 7 0 fig 6 herein even though it was proved that the degradation of clm was triggered by the direct attack of oh at ph 7 0 the higher production of oh with p400 table s3 than p200 did not cause higher clm degradation during the photodegradation of clm the inhibition induced by the strong binding of clm to p400 at ph 7 0 overwhelmed the attack of oh at the same pyrolysis temperature and ph the clm photodegradation with dbcs derived from corn straw was more severe than that with dbcs derived from peanut shell at ph 8 5 dbcs derived from corn straw could generate more oh than dbcs derived from peanut shell similarly c200 could generate more oh than p200 at ph 7 0 table s3 however at ph 7 0 although c400 generated less oh than p400 the clm photodegradation with c400 was higher than p400 p400 contained more hydroxyl and carbonyl groups than c400 tables s1 and s2 leading to more hydrogen bond formation and higher binding effect fig 6 this lower clm photodegradation of p400 than c400 at ph 7 0 could be explained by the higher binding between clm and p400 as a significant part of the natural dom pool dbcs are involved in various environmental processes including contaminant transportation and transformation ye et al 2022 the photoreactivity of dbcs has attracted increasing attention and is proven to play an essential role in contaminant degradation due to the generation of ros wan et al 2021 in addition the organic contaminants are readily affected by dbcs in nature through the binding effect including hydrogen bonds hydrophobic force electrostatic interaction aromatic stacking and others cheng et al 2022 li et al 2021 in this study we found that the photodegradation of organic contaminants was simultaneously manipulated by the ros generation and binding effect the binding process between dbcs and organic pollutants could prevent the photodegradation process the overall outcome of photodegradation is determined by the photochemical activities of dbcs ros production and aqueous chemistry such as ph in reaction systems such a dual role of dbcs in the photodegradation of clm occurs in natural waters and sewage water dbc mediated photodegradation can substantially regulate the degradation and persistence of antimicrobial agents the complex role of dbcs in regulating the degradation of antimicrobial agents needs to be considered for evaluating the ecologic risk and effects of these compounds concomitant binding and photodegradation by dbcs may also play an essential role in the degradation of other emerging contaminants the reaction mechanisms of clm photodegradation by dbcs revealed in this study opened a new avenue for investigating the role of dbcs in the transformation of contaminants with implications on their engineering treatment and environmental risk regulation further and systematic studies on the inhibition mechanisms of the interaction between dbcs and organics on photodegradation need to be investigated 5 conclusion in this study the kinetics and mechanism of clm photodegradation in the presence of four kinds of dbcs were investigated dbc played a dual role in regulating the photolytic degradation of clm the photodegradation of clm by dbc was attributed to the ros generated from dbcs oh was identified as the pivotal ros that could directly attack clm molecular structure in addition the binding of clm dbcs restricted the photodegradation of clm compared with at ph 8 5 the stronger binding between clm molecular and dbcs at ph 7 0 significantly inhibited clm photodegradation the removal efficiency of clm at ph 7 0 was apparently lower than that at ph 8 5 due to the wide existence of dbc in the environment this work could provide more

14998,as an essential source of the natural dissolved organic matter dom dissolved black carbon dbc plays a vital role in the photodegradation of organics however there is rare information about the dbc induced photodegradation mechanism of clindamycin clm one of the widely used antibiotics herein we discovered dbc generated reactive oxygen species ros stimulated clm photodegradation hydroxy radical oh could directly attack clm by oh addition reaction the singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide o2 contributed to the clm degradation by transforming to oh in addition the binding between clm and dbcs inhibited the photodegradation of clm by decreasing the concentration of freely dissolved clm binding process inhibited clm photodegradation by 0 25 1 98 at ph 7 0 and 6 1 41 77 at ph 8 5 these findings suggest that the photodegradation of clm by dbc is simultaneously regulated by the ros production and binding effect between clm and dbc benefiting the exact evaluation of the environmental impact of dbcs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords clindamycin dissolved black carbon binding photodegradation inhibition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the combustion of biomass and fossil fuels releases vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere leading to global climate change bowman et al 2009 coppola et al 2018 foster et al 2017 up to 27 of these released carbon is retained as black carbon bc rather than emitted as greenhouse gasses coppola et al 2019 it is estimated that 114 383 tg bc was produced worldwide every year wan et al 2021 once entering the soil or water environment bc participates in various geochemical cycles santín nuno et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 meanwhile bc releases large amounts of dissolved black carbon dbc in the surface water or soil environment zhang et al 2020a which are deemed an essential source of the natural dom pool wan et al 2021 yang et al 2021a dbc accounts for approximately 10 of the global riverine flux of dom to oceans 5 7 of coastal oceanic dom and more than 2 of marine dom dittmar and paeng 2009 fu et al 2016 jaffé et al 2013 mannino and rodger harvey 2004 therefore it is of great importance to understand the role of dom in the geochemical cycles in recent years the photoreactivity of dbc has attracted the great attention of researchers under sunlight the chromophoric components in dbc can generate transient reactive oxygen species ros which could participate in the degradation of antibiotics pesticides and endocrine disruptors chang et al 2019 fang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a photodegradation has been identified as one of the efficient elimination ways for the degradation of organic contaminants in aquatic environments remucal 2014 ren et al 2021 zuo et al 2013 dbcs exhibit a stronger photoreactivity than other well studied dom and have a significantly high yield of ros such as oh wan et al 2021 wang et al 2020 and 1o2 fu et al 2016 hence dbcs is regarded as the major source of ros under light irradiation yang et al 2021b zhang et al 2020a in addition to stimulating the photodegradation through ros generation dom can simultaneously interact with organics akkanen and kukkonen 2003 chen et al 2017 in aquatic environment organic pollutants could bind to dom through various interaction mechanisms such as hydrogen bond aromatic stacking hydrophobic force and electrostatic interaction gan et al 2019 zhu et al 2012 the interaction between organic pollutants and dom leads to electron density shift and energy transfer guo et al 2019 zhou et al 2013 thus the availability of the bound organic pollutants for photodegradation may be different from the freely dissolved organic pollutants however the effect of the binding between organic pollutants and dbcs on the photodegradation of organic pollutants has rarely been considered before incorporating this binding influence into the photodegradation by dbcs can improve the prediction of biogeochemistry effect of dbcs due to effective antibacterial and bactericidal effect the antibiotics are widely used to treat bacteria induced disease in both human beings and animals douafer et al 2019 ghauch et al 2017 the overuse and uncontrolled release of antibiotics have resulted in increased bacterial resistance and dispersion of antibiotic resistance genes zhang et al 2018 2020b and emerged as a global crisis during the past decade wright 2011 yang et al 2021b lincosamides are one of the most common antibacterial agents that have a wide clinical application against a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms clindamycin clm is a lincosamide antibiotic farzadkia et al 2014 and effectively sterilizes pathogens and microbes for serious infections treatment of the respiratory tract skin and soft tissue gholami et al 2019 2016 liu et al 1997 clm is released into the environment through human excretion and the destruction of expired drugs batt et al 2006 gholami et al 2019 ooi et al 2017 and threatens the health of humans and animals munir et al 2011 while being stable in aqueous solutions clm can be degradable by a combination of zerovalent iron h2o2 and ultrasonication in engineering application daija et al 2016 oesterling 1970 reis et al 2020 however the photodegradation mechanism of clm by dbcs is still largely unknown limiting the accurate analysis of the environmental behavior and impact of clm dbcs regulated photodegradation is crucial to removal of clm in aquatic environments especially the participation of ros generated from the photolysis of dbcs needs further investigation the objectives of this work are i to investigate the photodegradation of clm by dbc ii to identify the role of ros 1o2 oh and o2 using the ros quenching

clm removal were studied in batch experiments using 50 ml quartz colorimetric tubes with magnetic stirring and the reaction temperature was 20 c tubes were placed in a photochemical reactor xpa 7 nanjing xujiang electromechanical plant china and rotated at 400 rpm a 300 w high pressure mercury lamp with a light filter was placed in a quartz cooling pipe positioned vertically in the center of the photochemical reactor the light source wavelength ranged from 350 to 450 nm and centered at 365 nm the light intensity at 365 nm in the quartz colorimetric tube was 54 5 mw cm2 control experiments without dbcs were conducted under the same reaction conditions and the dark control experiments were performed by covering tubes with aluminum foil the concentration of clm was detected by high

orbitrap xl mass spectrometer thermo scientific germany which equipped with a c18 column agilent poroshell 120 hypersil gold 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 9 μm the mobile phase was methanol and deionized water volume ratio of 99 1 0 1 formic acid and the flow rate was 0 3 ml min the mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode using heated electrospray ionization esi at 300 c and a spray voltage

systems the influence of dbcs clm interaction on clm photodegradation was investigated by the dialysis equilibrium system the dialysis membrane was pretreated in a mixture of 2 w v nahco3 and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta ph 8 0 for 30 min then washed continuously with running distilled water 30 min to avoid the uncertainties brought by the diffusion of small dom molecules through dialysis membrane small molecules 500 da were discarded preliminarily four dbc solutions were enclosed separately in dialysis membranes with both ends sealed washed with deionized water and ultrapure water three times sequentially and finally soaked in ultrapure water the soaked ultrapure water was refreshed three times a day until no organic carbon was detected after adjusting ph to 7 0 or 8 5 the pretreated dbc solutions were stored in a 4 c refrigerator for further total organic carbon toc quantification in the dialysis equilibrium system the dialysis membranes were tied at one end and put in 40 ml vials with teflon lined screw caps ten mg l clm in pbs buffer solution ph 7 0 10 mm were added outside the dialysis bag and 20 ml dbcs 25 mg c l were injected inside the dialysis bag then the dialysis bags were finally pressed under the caps to seal the bags all the vials were continuously shaken in the dark on an air bath shaker at 25 c for 7 d according to our preliminary study 7 days were long enough for apparent equilibrium clm concentrations inside and outside the dialysis bag were quantified using hplc 3 results 3 1 photodegradation of clm by dbcs the clm photodegradation by four dbcs under uv light irradiation was investigated at ph 8 5 and 7 0 fig 1 in pure clm system no obvious photodegradation of clm was observed indicating clm was less photosensitive under uv light irradiation with the addition of dbcs the significant photodegradation of clm was observed at both ph 7 0 and 8 5 the degradation kinetics of clm were fitted with the pseudo first order model table 1 the first order degradation rate constant k r of clm at ph 7 0 ranged from 0 0141 h 1 to 0 0417 h 1 comparatively clm was degraded more quickly at ph 8 5 with the k r values ranging from 0 066 h 1 to 0 615 h 1 at ph 8 5 more clm was degraded with c400 and p400 than 200 c dbcs table 1 compared to ph 7 0 the higher degradation rate of clm with c400 0 0417 h 1 than 200 c dbcs 0 0193 0 0277h 1 was also observed but it was notable that the degradation rate of clm with p400 was suppressed at ph 7 0 which evidenced by the lower degradation rate 0 0141 h 1 than that with other dbcs 0 0193 0 0417 h 1 according to ros quenching studies the stimulation of dbcs generated ros to clm photodegradation was certified fig 2 the addition of the scavengers significantly inhibited the photodegradation of clm under uv dbcs system due to the quenching of oh 1o2 and o2 the removal efficiency of clm decreased from 12 20 to 56 85 to 0 0 85 1 57 10 06 and 2 08 7 16 respectively table s4 these results confirmed that the photodegradation of clm by dbcs was mainly attributed to the ros generated from dbcs the quenching of oh resulted in the highest inhibition on clm removal indicated the oh played a relatively vital role in clm photodegradation than 1o2 and o2 according to the analysis of ros production c400 and p400 generated more 1o2 and oh than c200 and p200 at ph 8 5 p400 generated the lower 1o2 and o2 but the higher oh than the other three dbcs at ph 7 0 figs s1 and s2 table s3 to further analyze the ros stimulated photodegradation mechanism of clm in uv dbcs system the analysis of photodegradation products and pathways of clm were analyzed through uplc lto orbitrap ms 3 2 analysis of photodegradation pathways of clm with dbc the intermediates of clm photodegradation in the presence of dbcs are presented in fig 3 the parent compound of clm had the pseudo molecular ion m na with m z of 447 169 yielding two major fragments with m z of 411 193 and 126 128 at a retention time of 0 85 min fig 3 a the fragment with m z of 411 193 was formed due to the loss of hcl and the fragment with m z of 126 128 corresponded to 3 propyl n methylpyrrolidine ion abbreviated as a the hcl elimination reaction and the form of a ion during clm degradation were also observed in the reaction with manganese oxide in aqueous solution chen et al 2010 in addition the intermediate ions with m z of 426 830 408 820 and 390 809 at a retention time of 1 00 min fig 3b also derived from the loss of hcl by elimination reaction wang et al 2009 zhou et al 2006 moreover the inter mediate ions with m z of 306 871 288 861 and 266 879 were formed due to the loss of both hcl and a ion the intermediate ions with m z of 164 930 and 142 948 were formed with the addition of hydroxyl on a ion which derived from the attacking of oh the detected and calculated masses of proposed neutral loss of the ion at m z 447 169 of clm were listed in table s5 based on ros and intermediates analysis a proposed pathway for clm photodegradation with dbc was presented in fig 4 the m hcl product was preliminarily formed in the dbc uv system and then broken with the formation of m hcl a and a subsequently the product of a oh was formed by the attack of oh on a although the degradation productions were identified fig 4 the toxicity assessment over a life cycle is critical to the accurate prediction of environmental impact of clm the detected degradation products and pathway of clm certified that oh generated from dbcs could directly degrade clm by oh addition reaction and played a pivotal role in clm degradation thus owing to the higher oh yield of 400 c dbcs it was reasonable that more clm was degraded with c400 and p400 than 200 c dbcs at ph 8 5 while no degradation products that formed by the direct attack of o2 or and 1o2 were detected in this study or previous studies farzadkia et al 2014 gholami et al 2019 keen and linden 2013 the 1o2 is in a quantum state

waterhouse and laurie 2006 to form o2 waterhouse and laurie 2006 meanwhile it was proposed that the disproportionation of the o2 result in h2o2 formation micinski et al 1993 zhang et al 2014 which is an important precursor of oh chen et al 2015 ikai et al 2010 herein combined with the ros quenching results the 1o2 and o2 generated from dbc should contribute to clm degradation by transforming to oh however although more oh was generated at ph 7 0 table s3 the clm photodegradation at ph 7 0 3 42 8 23 table 1 was remarkably lower than that at ph 8 5 12 20 56 85 table 1 with ph value decreasing

was higher than p400 p400 contained more hydroxyl and carbonyl groups than c400 tables s1 and s2 leading to more hydrogen bond formation and higher binding effect fig 6 this lower clm photodegradation of p400 than c400 at ph 7 0 could be explained by the higher binding between clm and p400 as a significant part of the natural dom pool dbcs are involved in various environmental processes including contaminant transportation and transformation ye et al 2022 the photoreactivity of dbcs has attracted increasing attention and is proven to play an essential role in contaminant degradation due to the generation of ros wan et al 2021 in addition the organic contaminants are readily affected by dbcs in nature through the binding effect including hydrogen bonds hydrophobic force electrostatic interaction aromatic stacking and others cheng et al 2022 li et al 2021 in this study we found that the photodegradation of organic contaminants was simultaneously manipulated by the ros generation and binding effect the binding process between dbcs and organic pollutants could prevent the photodegradation process the overall outcome of photodegradation is determined by the photochemical activities of dbcs ros production and aqueous chemistry such as ph in reaction systems such a dual role of dbcs in the photodegradation of clm occurs in natural waters and sewage water dbc mediated photodegradation can substantially regulate the degradation and persistence of antimicrobial agents the complex role of dbcs in regulating the degradation of antimicrobial agents needs to be considered for evaluating the ecologic risk and effects of these compounds concomitant binding and photodegradation by dbcs may also play an essential role in the degradation of other emerging contaminants the reaction mechanisms of clm photodegradation by dbcs revealed in this study opened a new avenue for investigating the role of dbcs in the transformation of contaminants with implications on their engineering treatment and environmental risk regulation further and systematic studies on the inhibition mechanisms of the interaction between dbcs and organics on photodegradation need to be investigated 5 conclusion in this study the kinetics and mechanism of clm photodegradation in the presence of four kinds of dbcs were investigated dbc played a dual role in regulating the photolytic degradation of clm the photodegradation of clm by dbc was attributed to the ros generated from dbcs oh was identified as the pivotal ros that could directly attack clm molecular structure in addition the binding of clm dbcs restricted the photodegradation of clm compared with at ph 8 5 the stronger binding between clm molecular and dbcs at ph 7 0 significantly inhibited clm photodegradation the removal efficiency of clm at ph 7 0 was apparently lower than that at ph 8 5 due to the wide existence of dbc in the environment this work could provide more

14999,by maintaining the cell integrity of waste activated sludge was structural extracellular polymeric substances st eps resist was anaerobic fermentation this study investigates the occurrence of polygalacturonate in was st eps by combining chemical and metagenomic analyses that identify 22 of the bacteria including ferruginibacter and zoogloea that are associated with polygalacturonate production using the key enzyme ec 5 1 3 6 a highly active polygalacturonate degrading consortium gdc was enriched and the potential of this gdc for degrading st eps and promoting methane production from was was investigated the percentage of st eps degradation increased from 47 6 to 85 2 after inoculation with the gdc methane production was also increased by up to 2 3 times over a control group with was destruction increasing from 11 5 to 28 4 zeta potential and rheological behavior confirmed the positive effect which gdc has on was fermentation the major genus in the gdc was identified as clostridium 17 1 extracellular pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 and 4 2 2 9 excluding polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 were observed in the metagenome of the gdc and most likely play a core role in st eps hydrolysis dosing with gdc provides a good biological method for st eps degradation and thereby enhances the conversion of was to methane graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion structural extracellular polymeric substances polygalacturonate degrading consortium clostridium pectate lyases data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction waste activated sludge was represents a huge amount of unwanted product from wastewater treatment plants wwtps for example the amount of produced was with a water content of 80 exceeded 60 million tons in china in 2019 wu et al 2020 anaerobic digestion ad or fermentation is an effective method to produce high value products in the form of methane and volatile fatty acids vfas including acetate and propionate from organic wastes liu et al 2021a toutian et al 2020b however it suffers from low methane production and poor cod conversion from was in many models of was structure the extracellular polymeric substances eps especially gel forming polysaccharides are used to act as a gel matrix to maintain the structural integrity of microbial aggregates and thereby resist microbial degradation ding et al 2015 wilén et al 2003 yu 2020 these gel forming polysaccharides have been subsequently named structural eps st eps felz et al 2016 to improve methane and vfa production pretreatments using thermal mechanical chemical and biological methods have been proposed which release organics from the dispersed was toutian et al 2020a but these methods have not been purposefully developed to convert st eps lin et al initially isolated a typical gel forming polysaccharide of alginate like exopolysaccharides ale a typical uronic acid from was flocs 72 6 mg gvss lin et al 2013 zhang et al enriched a freshwater alginate degrading consortium adc that demonstrated methane enhancing performance up to 185 and vfa production 35 from was hu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 guo et al demonstrate that after 44 days of operation in mesophilic anaerobic batch reactors the amount of st eps was reduced by 26 in granular sludge and by 41 in was guo et al 2020 thus degrading st eps is seen as essential to break the structure of was and to promote methane production felz et al recently detected other typical uronic acid monomers of galacturonate and glucuronate in hydrolyzed st eps and reported that the contents of uronic acids in st eps 7 2 using galacturonate as standard were comparable to neutral sugars 13 8 using glucose as standard felz et al 2019 hence a hypothesis is proposed in this study that the polygalacturonate degrading consortium gdc can degrade st eps and thereby promote methane production from was the occurrence of polygalacturonate in was is first identified as it is often ignored in similar studies when considering the degradation of complex organics such as polygalacturonate and st eps in was hydrolysis can be the limiting step for anaerobic fermentation geng et al 2021 teo and wong 2014 galacturonate the monomer of polygalacturonate has been studied as a substrate for anaerobic fermentation for example valk et al enriched a lachnospiraceae species dominated consortium in mesophilic anaerobic chemostats using galacturonate as the substrate and the main metabolites were acetate 0 53 mol mol galacturonate and formate 0 16 mol mol galacturonate valk et al 2018 however the hydrolysis of polygalacturonate is seldom reported especially in was fermentation for polygalacturonate hydrolysis extracellular enzymes can be divided into polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 and pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 ec 4 2 2 9 and ec 4 2 2 10 richard and hilditch 2009 interestingly compared with conventional cellulase ec 3 2 1 4 α amylase ec 3 2 1 1 and protease ec 3 4 22 2 lü et al found dosing polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 unexpectedly increased the release of total eps polysaccharides by 7 times lü et al 2016 moreover alginate lyase ec 4 2 2 3 was identified as the core extracellular enzyme for alginate degradation geng et al 2021 while the impact of pectate lyase on was hydrolysis remains unclear finally besides enriching gdc the mechanisms whereby gdc influences st eps degradation and was fermentation are not well documented these mechanisms may include the action of extracellular enzymes intracellular metabolic pathways and the change of st eps and gel strength the combination of high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses is often used to reveal the diversity and metabolic functions of enriched microbial consortia in anaerobic batch reactors especially for the minor and ignored microbes for example the genus bacteroides was identified as the core bacteria for the degradation of alginate using extracellular alginate lyase ec 4 2 2 3 though its percentage was lower than 0 1 in an enriched mixed culture zhang et al 2019 these methods may also provide solid evidence of polygalacturonate occurrence in was besides methane production st eps degradation may change the gel strength of was which can be revealed using rheological analysis li et al 2020 thus in this study the occurrence of polygalacturonate in was st eps is first identified by combining chemical and metagenomic analysis in order to evaluate biological methods for better was conversion we then develop an enrichment culture for gdc in batch reactors using polygalacturonate as the substrate the role of st eps on methane production and change of gel strength in was by this enriched gdc is then investigated the metabolic functioning of gdc is also analysed by combining high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis finally we investigate the effectiveness of gdc for enhanced was fermentation it is hoped that the outcomes of this study may improve the understanding of the effects of st eps degradation on was fermentation and subsequently help develop a microbial method to enhance was fermentation 2 materials and methods 2 1 inocula and enrichment of gdc in mesophilic fed batch reactors was was collected from the jinshan wastewater treatment plant fuzhou city china the typical characteristics of this was are summarized in table s1 two inocula were collected from a mixture of was 10 ml vss 10 7 g l and the effluent of a chemostat fed with alginate 30 ml vss 1 2 g l hu et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 the mixture was diluted with 20 ml of inorganic medium to reach 60 ml the composition of the inorganic medium was the same as that described in a previous work hu et al 2022 the enrichment process can be divided into three stages in stage 1 days 1 50 the inoculum 60 ml and inorganic medium 120 ml were added to 3 serum bottles 120 ml working volume of 60 ml each bottle was sparged with n2 99 99 for 20 min and was then cultured in a shaker at 35 c 5 g l of polygalacturonate was added on days 0 10 18 26 34 and 42 during each cycle the polygalacturonate concentration and metabolites were measured in stage 2 days 51 90 the enriched gdc in three serum bottles was combined in a 1 l reactor with a working volume of 500 ml and 5 g l polygalacturonate was added on days 51 61 and 76 days in the last stage days 90 96 the growth profile was investigated by adding 1 ml of enriched gdc 59 ml of inorganic medium and 5 g l of polygalacturonate in three serum bottles 120 ml 2 2 st eps extraction and degradation by dosing with enriched gdc to demonstrate the role of enriched gdc on st eps degradation st eps was extracted from 200 ml of was via the heated na2co3 method felz et al 2016 150 ml of the extracted st eps and 30 ml of enriched gdc obtained from a 1 l reactor were then mixed and added into three 120 ml serum bottles working volume 60 ml n 3 10 mm of 2 bromoethanesulfonic sodium bes was added to prevent ch4 production three serum bottles were also sparged with n2 and cultured for 13 days in a shaker at 120 rpm and 35 c the change of typical compounds in the st eps i e uronic acid polysaccharide protein and humic acid and metabolites were all determined meanwhile ft ir spectra and synchronous correlation spectra in 2d ir were obtained 2 3 was fermentation and changing parameters after dosing with enriched gdc to demonstrate the role of enriched gdc on was fermentation three groups gdc 0 gdc 10 and gdc 20 n 3 for each group were prepared in 120 ml working volume of 60 ml serum bottles with both was 50 ml and gdc of 0 10 and 20 ml respectively the supernatant of the gdc was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm and added to 10 ml of inorganic medium before using consequently the ratio of the gdc 1 4 0 2 gvss l to was 10 7 1 6 gvss l was 0 0 03 and 0 06 gvss gvss respectively these serum bottles were also sparged with n2 and cultured for 30 days the accumulation of metabolites changes to the st eps was destruction i e vssdestruction zeta potential and rheological behavior were then determined 2 4 activities of extracellular enzymes excreted by enriched gdc to demonstrate the activities of the extracellular enzymes excreted by enriched gdc the enzymes in the supernatant from the serum bottles were harvested on day 96 by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 5 min inorganic medium 50 ml polygalacturonate 5 g l and enzymatic solution 10 ml were added into a 120 ml serum bottle n 3 under a ph of 7 0 0 2 and a temperature of 35 c the activity of lyase and hydrolase and the change in molecular weight mw of the hydrolysate were all determined 2 5 analysis st eps was extracted from dried was following the method of felz et al felz et al 2016 and was characterized using a ft ir is 50 thermo scientific nicolet and synchronous correlation spectra from 2d ir were then analyzed monomers in the st eps were analysed using a hpaec pad in a dionex ics5000 system dionex usa the absorbance change of polygalacturonate at 254 nm and 540 nm were all determined using a uv visible spectrophotometer a560 aoe instruments cn the hydrolysates of polygalacturonate after dosing with enzymes were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography system waters 1525 waters usa at 254 nm geng et al 2021 the concentrations of polygalacturonate and uronic acids in the st eps were measured using the carbazole sulfuric acid method felz et al 2019 the protein and humic acids concentrations were determined using the lowry method felz et al 2019 the polysaccharide concentration was determined using the anthrone sulfuric acid method felz et al 2019 the ch4 and h2 contents in the headspace of the reactors were determined using a gas chromatograph sp7890 lunan cn concentrations of ethanol and vfas were measured using another gas chromatograph 7890 agilent ca vssdestruction was calculated according to the change of vss during was fermentation liu et al 2021b the final cod balance calculation was based on the cod of each metabolite concentration zhang et al 2019 the zeta potential of the was supernatant was analysed using a nanosizer zs instrument malvern co uk the rheological behavior of the was was characterized using a physica rheometer mcr 301 anton par austria under both steady shear tests and dynamic measurements to obtain measurements of structural properties and viscous and viscoplastic properties wang et al 2017 2 6 illumina miseq high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis the bacterial diversities associated with the was and enriched gdc were analysed using high throughput sequencing majorbio corporation shanghai china six dna samples were extracted from two inocula activated sludge and chemostat sludge and four enriched gdc on days 26 50 90 and 96 these samples were termed as the was gdc1 gdc2 gdc3 gdc4 and gdc5 respectively amplification primers of 341f 806r zhang et al 2019 was carried out using abi geneamp 9700 sequencing was then performed using an illumina miseq pe 300 sequencer raw sequencing reads were quality filtered and operational taxonomical units otu 97 were picked for further analysis of the microbial diversities using silva v132 database a confidence threshold of 0 7 following the standard protocols of the majorbio cloud platform ren et al 2022 metabolic pathways in the was sample and the enriched gdc5 sample were further identified using metagenomic analysis in a novaseq 6000 platform majorbio china pair end sequence reads were then merged and metagenomics data were assembled using megahit version 1 1 2 kegg annotation was finally conducted using diamond software version 0 8 35 with an e value of 1e 5 the metabolic pathway and encoded enzymes were finally identified following the standard protocols of the majorbio cloud platform ren et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying the occurrence of polygalacturonate in st eps the content of st eps in the was sample was 114 5 13 9 mg gvss which was comparable to the results of lin 72 mg g vss and qian 101 mg gvss lin et al 2013 qian et al 2021 a comparison of ft ir spectra from the st eps polygalacturonate and alginate fig 1 a identified several typical absorption peaks including wide absorption peaks near 3280 cm 1 associated with oh stretching vibrations an antisymmetric stretching vibration absorption peak of methylene at 2931 cm 1 a vibration peak of c o near 1652 cm 1 and a vibration peak of the co group near 1246 cm 1 zhang et al 2021 the absorption peak at 1029 cm 1 reflects the bending vibration of the co c group in the polysaccharide lin et al 2013 synchronous correlation spectra obtained using two dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy 2d ir figure s1 were further used to identify the similarity between st eps and polygalacturonate within the range of 1000 1800 cm 1 huang et al 2021 the positive results of cross related peaks including 1029 cm 1 1247 cm 1 and 1652 cm 1 also showed that their band intensities were changed in the same direction which verified the similarity of identified functional groups interestingly uronic acid components of galacturonate and glucuronate were also identified in the st eps using hpaec pad this observation is similar to that of felz et al who noted that both galacturonate and glucuronate were detected in eps from aerobic granular sludge fig 1b felz et al 2019 these results suggest good similarity between the functional groups of st eps polygalacturonate and alginate genera of mycobacterium 4 6 ferruginibacter 4 3 terrimonas 4 0 and thermomonas 3 9 were the main bacteria in the was sample identified using high throughput sequencing fig 1c the genus zoogloea 1 5 was especially illustrated as a key contributor to the formation of activated sludge flocs by producing excessive amounts of viscous eps an et al 2016 udp galacturonate is known as the precursor of polygalacturonate in anabolism which is converted from udp glucuronate by udp glucuronate 4 epimerase ec 5 1 3 6 zhao et al 2018 udp glucuronate is initially produced from glucose 1p via udp glucose pyrophosphorylase ec 2 7 7 9 and uridine 5 diphosphoglucose dehydrogenase ec 1 1 1 22 zhao et al 2018 these three enzymes were all encoded by sequenced bacteria in the was sample via the metagenomic analysis figures s2 and s3 approximately 22 of the bacteria including ferruginibacter and zoogloea were identified according to the key enzyme of ec 5 1 3 6 using metagenomic analysis fig 1d these results demonstrate that polygalacturonate did exist in the st eps and was produced by the dominant bacteria in the was 3 2 gdc enrichment and degradation of st eps gdc was enriched in three serum bottles for 50 days stage 1 by adding 5 g l polygalacturonate on days 0 10 18 26 34 and 42 the final concentrations of polygalacturonate at the end of each cycle were below 0 05 g l figure s4a adc in the inocula was observed to utilize polygalacturonate using metagenomic analysis geng et al 2021 which may initially consume polygalacturonate in this study methane was detected after dosing with polygalacturonate and the final volume was between 113 and 142 ml fig 2 a the h2 content was always below 0 01 the detection limit of gc intermediates of acetate 0 9 0 2 g l and propionate 0 2 0 05 g l were detected and were completely consumed by methanogens figure s4b the average cod balance was 110 1 10 6 the enriched gdc was then transferred into a 1 l bottle on day 51 stage 2 and 5 g l polygalacturonate was added on days 51 61 and 76 the average ch4 production was 373 7 6 9 ml fig 2a and cod balance was 101 3 11 9 n 3 the od600 in the growth curve figure s4c also increased from 0 05 0 01 day 90 to 0 96 0 05 day 95 these results all supported a good activity of enriched gdc using polygalacturonate as the sole carbon source extracted st eps could not be degraded under abiotic conditions after adding gdc to the st eps extracted from the was sample uronic acid polygalacturonate equivalent fig 2b polysaccharide glucose equivalent fig 2c and protein bsa equivalent fig 2d were all degraded within 13 days the final concentration of these three compounds on day 13 was 0 0 and 42 5 7 5 mg l respectively the concentration of humic acid did not change much and was around 150 mg l figure s4d the main metabolites of the st eps were acetate and propionate with final concentrations of 144 5 54 7 and 48 7 6 5 mg l respectively fig 2e since bes was added in these tests there was no ch4 accumulation in the headspace and h2 may have been utilized by homoacetogenesis to produce acetate figure s4e guo et al recently demonstrated that st eps could decrease the anaerobic biodegradability and structural decomposition of was guo et al 2020 lü et al showed that dosing with polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 increased the release of total eps polysaccharides by 7 times lü et al 2016 indicating that enriched gdc may promote st eps degradation and methane production from was 3 3 ch4 production from was by dosing with enriched gdc as expected dosing the was digestion batch reactor with enriched gdc promoted methane production over 30 days of operation fig 3 a shows that the final ch4 production in the gdc 20 group 129 7 2 1 ml was much higher than that in the control group 39 5 1 7 ml and in the gdc 10 group 85 8 0 9 ml thus methane production was increased by up to 2 3 times no hydrogen was accumulated figure s5a in the headspace and the acetate and propionate vfas were all consumed within 15 days figures s5b s5c and s5d though st eps can be degraded by native bacteria in was dosing with gdc further promoted st eps conversion fig 3b for example the final st eps content was 60 0 6 6 mg gvss in the control group and was just 17 0 0 8 mg gvss in the gdc 20 group indicating a higher degradation efficiency 47 6 vs 85 2 this was much higher than that found by guo et al 41 in mesophilic anaerobic batch reactors without enriching st eps degrading bacteria guo et al 2020 fig 3b further shows that the vssdestruction of the was sample after 31 days of fermentation notably increased from 11 5 1 7 in gdc 0 to 17 8 2 0 in gdc 10 and 28 4 0 9 in gdc 20 was fermentation also changed the zeta potential of the was sample fig 3c which decreased from 35 2 4 to 73 5 1 4 mv this is consistent with previous research results that have shown that zeta potential decreases after anaerobic fermentation liu et al 2021c furthermore both the original sludge and the sludge after anaerobic fermentation showed a shear thinning behavior in which dosing with gdc lowered both apparent viscosity and shear stress indicating a degradation of polymers fig 3d results of the creep test fig 3e show that creep compliance was positively correlated with the gdc dosing level indicating that the addition of gdc promoted the degradation of st eps and led to the destruction of was which further made the sludge easier to deform wang et al have demonstrated that the ratio of loss modulus to storage modulus can reflect the proportion of sludge viscosity and elasticity wang et al 2017 the dynamic strain sweep curve fig 3f shows that the maximum value of the angle tangent in the was sample was 7 4 which decreased to 1 76 in the gdc 20 sample indicating that the network strength and cohesive force of was flocs decreased with the increasing amount of inoculant these results support our hypothesis that st eps degradation can promote was destruction by dosing with enriched gdc providing a promising microbial way to enhance was fermentation 3 4 microbial diversity of enriched gdc to reveal the core bacteria in the enriched gdc the microbial diversity of two inocula the was and gdc1 samples in section 3 1 the four enriched consortia of gdc2 gdc3 gdc4 and gdc5 were analyzed using 16s rrna gene illumina high throughput sequencing the shannon index curve figure s6a rarefaction curve figure s6b and main sequencing indices table s2 all indicated that the sequencing results covered the whole enriched consortia at the domain level figure s6c the bacterial percentage in the final gdc5 was 99 5 fig 4 a shows that bacteroidota 60 3 and firmicutes 33 8 were the main phyla in gdc1 in gdc5 the main phyla changed to proteobacteria 64 5 firmicutes 25 0 and bacteroidota 9 8 the percentages of the top enriched bacteria 1 at the genus level are summarized in fig 4b according to the rank abundance curves figure s6d and heatmap figure s6e bacteroides 47 7 and oscillibacter 20 9 were the main genera in gdc1 while these changed to genera of clostridium sensu stricto 8 37 5 methanobacterium 15 4 and alistipes 14 3 in gdc4 and unclassified f enterobacteriaceae 46 5 and clostridium sensu stricto 8 15 4 in gdc5 the identified polygalacturonate producers of ferruginibacter and zoogloea in was were not detected in gdc5 it should be noted that bacteroides was enriched in a previous study as the novel genus which degrades uronic acids of alginate and polygalacturonate in a mesophilic chemostat geng et al 2021 in the current study after long term operation the percentage of the genus bacteroides decreased notably from 47 7 gdc1 to 0 5 gdc5 which indicates that a different potentially novel genus maybe two genera of unclassified f enterobacteriaceae and clostridium sensu stricto 8 performed polygalacturonate degradation this might be better revealed via a metagenomic analysis lastly two genera of methanobacterium hydrogenotrophic methanogens 15 4 in gdc5 and methanosaeta acetoclastic methanogens 0 8 in gdc5 zabranska and pokorna 2018 were identified to convert the intermediates of h2 and acetate to methane which is consistent with the results presented in fig 2 3 5 extracellular enzymes and intracellular metabolic pathway of enriched gdc the extracellular enzymes for polygalacturonate hydrolysis include lyases of pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 exo pectate lyase 4 2 2 9 and pectin lyase 4 2 2 10 and hydrolyase of polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 garron and cygler 2014 enzymatic activity tests for lyases in the gdc5 sample fig 5 a showed an obvious activity over the control sample indicating good activity of polygalacturonate lyase and hydrolyase the apparent mw of initial polygalacturonate was above 100 000 and after dosing with enzymatic solution the mw profiles of final hydrolysate decreased to a mw of 266 da fig 5b however due to the complexity of these enzymes it was hard to analyze the specific intermediates such as mw 45 000 which would be revealed in the future with respect to hydrolyase the absorbance at 540 nm fig 5a did not increase by much thus the extracellular lyases rather than polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 might work on polygalacturonate degradation in enriched gdc the majority of identified sequenced reads in enriched gdc was in the metabolism section according to metagenomic analysis figure s7 the full metabolic pathway of carbon flow to methane was constructed by metagenomic analysis figure s8 in which the well known glycolysis of entner doudoroff ed pathway figure s9 and embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway figure s10 were encoded fig 5c demonstrates the identified pathways for polygalacturonate degradation by enriched gdc the extracellular lyases of pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 and exo pectate lyase 4 2 2 9 were identified figure s11 and other lyases of pectin lyases 4 2 2 10 and extracellular hydrolyase of polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 figure s11 were missing this meant that polygalacturonate was first converted to unsaturated digalacturonates via pectate lyases of ec 4 2 2 2 and ec 4 2 2 9 which is consistent with the extracellular enzymatic activities seen in figs 5a and 5b the intracellular unsaturated digalacturonate was further degraded into 5 dehydro 4 deoxy d glucuronate ddg by ec 4 2 2 6 which subsequently entered into the ed pathway via cascading reactions by intracellular enzymes of ec 5 3 17 ec 1 1 1 127 figure s11 ec 2 7 1 45 figure s11 the enzymes for other uronic acids of glucuronate ec 5 3 1 12 ec 1 1 1 57 and ec 4 2 1 8 in figure s11 and alginate ec 4 2 2 3 in figure s12 were also encoded to enter into the polygalacturonate degrading pathway additionally the produced kdpg was converted to d glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate gap and pyruvate by a kdpg aldolase ec 4 1 2 14 in figure s9 and finally converted into the metabolites detected in fig 2 the typical enzymes of pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 and ec 4 2 2 9 and intracellular enzymes of ec 4 2 2 6 ec 5 3 17 and ec 1 1 1 127 are summarized in table s3 and the identified bacteria are summarized in table s4 the genus clostridium 17 1 including closed genera of clostridium sensu stricto 8 15 4 and clostridium sensu stricto 12 1 2 was the main identified bacterium that can excrete extracellular lyase of both ec 4 2 2 2 and ec 4 2 2 9 another genus of bacteroides a former enriched bacteria for alginate conversion geng et al 2021 may also excrete these two enzymes but the percentage of this genus was just 0 5 indicating that the genus clostridium outcompeted bacteroides for polygalacturonate degradation during the 100 days enrichment it should be noted that for the intracellular metabolic pathway ec 5 3 17 and ec 1 1 1 127 were identified in the clostridium genus but ec 4 2 2 6 was not it is known that for alginate degradation the conversion of unsaturated monomers is generally considered as a non enzymatic reaction geng et al 2021 thus the conversion of unsaturated galacutronate to ddg may also occur in a similar way moreover the genus clostridium was also the main bacterium for glucuronate degradation according to the enzyme of ec 5 3 1 12 however the role of unclassified f enterobacteriaceae on polygalacturonate degradation was still unclear due to the poor identification of enzymes summarized in table s3 thus the genus clostridium could be considered a core bacterium for the degradation of polygalacturonate and other uronic acids which is consistent with the microbial diversity seen in fig 4b 3 6 implication and perspective of st eps degradation and was fermentation via dosing with enriched gdc hydrolysis via extracellular enzymes is known as the first step in was utilization teo and wong 2014 zhang et al 2021 lü et al found that dosing polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 in was increased the release of total eps polysaccharides by up to 7 times lü et al 2016 but the associated mechanism was not well documented in this work the occurrence of polygalacturonate was revealed by combining chemical and metagenomic analyses fig 1 supporting the positive role of polygalacturonase on polysaccharide release however two extracellular lyases pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 and exo pectate lyase 4 2 2 9 were unexpectedly identified in this work when using polygalacturonate as the substrate and unsaturated galacturonate was subsequently produced fig 5 thus the pectate lyases extracted by the clostridium genus 17 1 in the enriched gdc were the likely key extracellular enzymes to promote st eps destruction as shown in fig 6 this was analogous to alginate degradation where the alginate lyase ec 4 2 2 3 was the key extracellular enzyme in enriched genus bacteroides zhang et al 2019 thus the mechanism is proposed in fig 6 that the hydrolysate of was was utilized by the genus clostridium and other acidogens to produce fatty acids such as acetate propionate and butyrate which were finally converted to methane by methanogens represented by the genera methanobacterium and methanosaeta this work demonstrates that integrating high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses can help clarify the core bacterium and metabolic pathways of enriched microbial cultures till now physical chemical and mechanical treatments have been proposed to promote was fermentation but toxic and refractory by products are also unwantedly released by these methods toutian et al 2020a 2021 wang et al 2022 for example cao et al reported that excess nitrate and nitrite remained in the effluent of wwtps due to the complex composition and toxicity of released cod from alkaline fermentation broth cao et al 2019 thus biological methods are deemed to offer the benefits of low operating cost and high selectivity zhang et al 2021 st eps with typical components of polygalacturonate and ale can strengthen the stability of the structure of was felz et al 2019 guo et al 2020 the enriched gdc improved the methane production by up to 2 3 times in this work which was supported by the observed st eps reduction was destruction and the rheological behaviors of both apparent viscosity and shear stress fig 3 as excreted from bacteria in was eps is generally considered to be a complex organic composed of proteins polysaccharides and humic acids yu 2020 besides polygalacturonate degradation clostridium is a well known gram positive genus which can produce hydrogen and fatty acids from carbohydrates such as carbohydrates and protein as substrates batstone et al 2019 dai et al 2020 in our recent work a gram negative alginate degrading consortium of genus bacteroides was enriched and demonstrated enhancement of methane production from was 115 185 zhang et al 2021 2019 these results demonstrate that st eps plays a significant role in was fermentation destruction of the eps network by combining these enriched bacteria may further enhance was fermentation by degrading st eps a better focus on the mechanisms behind sludge hydrolysis will also help in maximizing the methane yield from was as a polymer polysaccharide commonly found in the cell wall polygalacturonate is also abundant in fruits and vegetables and frequently applied as a gelling agent in the food industry bui et al 2019 perpelea et al 2022 valk et al 2018 approximately 35 million tons of citrus peel 28 million tons of sugar beet pulp and 2 million tons of apple pomace were produced in 2016 containing 15 polygalacturonate valk et al 2018 thus the co fermentation of organic wastes including was fruits and vegetables may further increase the activity of extracellular enzymes and promote methane production which will be investigated in future studies hereinafter the st eps degradation via enrichment with gdc can provide a good paradigm for was fermentation via biological methods 4 conclusions the occurrence of polygalacturonate in the st eps of was was investigated in this work by combining chemical and metagenomic analyses for the first time the positive role of st eps in was fermentation was subsequently documented using enriched gdc consequently this work provided an elegant method for promoting was fermentation by identifying the key component in eps the main findings were as follows about 22 of bacteria in collected was including ferruginibacter and zoogloea were identified as being associated with polygalacturonate production according to the key enzyme ec 5 1 3 6 10 g l of polygalacturonate was wholly consumed by enriched gdc with a cod recovery balance around 100 the percentage of st eps degradation increased from 47 6 to 85 2 via dosing with gdc and the methane production subsequently increased up to 2 3 times over a control group the percentage of was destruction increased from 11 5 to 28 4 after dosing gdc which was supported by the change of rheological behaviors of the sludge the genus clostridium 17 1 was finally identified as the key bacterium in the gdc using high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses extracellular pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 and 4 2 2 9 not typical polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1

14999,by maintaining the cell integrity of waste activated sludge was structural extracellular polymeric substances st eps resist was anaerobic fermentation this study investigates the occurrence of polygalacturonate in was st eps by combining chemical and metagenomic analyses that identify 22 of the bacteria including ferruginibacter and zoogloea that are associated with polygalacturonate production using the key enzyme ec 5 1 3 6 a highly active polygalacturonate degrading consortium gdc was enriched and the potential of this gdc for degrading st eps and promoting methane production from was was investigated the percentage of st eps degradation increased from 47 6 to 85 2 after inoculation with the gdc methane production was also increased by up to 2 3 times over a control group with was destruction increasing from 11 5 to 28 4 zeta potential and rheological behavior confirmed the positive effect which gdc has on was fermentation the major genus in the gdc was identified as clostridium 17 1 extracellular pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 and 4 2 2 9 excluding polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 were observed in the metagenome of the gdc and most likely play a core role in st eps hydrolysis dosing with gdc provides a good biological method for st eps degradation and thereby enhances the conversion of was to methane graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion structural extracellular polymeric substances polygalacturonate degrading consortium clostridium pectate lyases data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction waste activated sludge was represents a huge amount of unwanted product from wastewater treatment plants wwtps for example the amount of produced was with a water content of 80 exceeded 60 million tons in china in 2019 wu et al 2020 anaerobic digestion ad or fermentation is an effective method to produce high value products in the form of methane and volatile fatty acids vfas including acetate and propionate from organic wastes liu et al 2021a toutian et al 2020b however it suffers from low methane production and poor cod conversion from was in many models of was structure the extracellular polymeric substances eps especially gel forming polysaccharides are used to act as a gel matrix to maintain the structural integrity of microbial aggregates and thereby resist microbial degradation ding et al 2015 wilén et al 2003 yu 2020 these gel forming polysaccharides have been subsequently named structural eps st eps felz et al 2016 to improve methane and vfa production pretreatments using thermal mechanical chemical and biological methods have been proposed which release organics from the dispersed was toutian et al 2020a but these methods have not been purposefully developed to convert st eps lin et al initially isolated a typical gel forming polysaccharide of alginate like exopolysaccharides ale a typical uronic acid from was flocs 72 6 mg gvss lin et al 2013 zhang et al enriched a freshwater alginate degrading consortium adc that demonstrated methane enhancing performance up to 185 and vfa production 35 from was hu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 guo et al demonstrate that after 44 days of operation in mesophilic anaerobic batch reactors the amount of st eps was reduced by 26 in granular sludge and by 41 in was guo et al 2020 thus degrading st eps is seen as essential to break the structure of was and to promote methane production felz et al recently detected other typical uronic acid monomers of galacturonate and glucuronate in hydrolyzed st eps and reported that the contents of uronic acids in st eps 7 2 using galacturonate as standard were comparable to neutral sugars 13 8 using glucose as standard felz et al 2019 hence a hypothesis is proposed in this study that the polygalacturonate degrading consortium gdc can degrade st eps and thereby promote methane production from was the occurrence of polygalacturonate in was is first identified as it is often ignored in similar studies when considering the degradation of complex organics such as polygalacturonate and st eps in was hydrolysis can be the limiting step for anaerobic fermentation geng et al 2021 teo and wong 2014 galacturonate the monomer of polygalacturonate has been studied as a substrate for anaerobic fermentation for example valk et al enriched a lachnospiraceae species dominated consortium in mesophilic anaerobic chemostats using galacturonate as the substrate and the main metabolites were acetate 0 53 mol mol galacturonate and formate 0 16 mol mol galacturonate valk et al 2018 however the hydrolysis of polygalacturonate is seldom reported especially in was fermentation for polygalacturonate hydrolysis extracellular enzymes can be divided into polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 and pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 ec 4 2 2 9 and ec 4 2 2 10 richard and hilditch 2009 interestingly compared with conventional cellulase ec 3 2 1 4 α amylase ec 3 2 1 1 and protease ec 3 4 22 2 lü et al found dosing polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 unexpectedly increased the release of total eps polysaccharides by 7 times lü et al 2016 moreover alginate lyase ec 4 2 2 3 was identified as the core extracellular enzyme for alginate degradation geng et al 2021 while the impact of pectate lyase on was hydrolysis remains unclear finally besides enriching gdc the mechanisms whereby gdc influences st eps degradation and was fermentation are not well documented these mechanisms may include the action of extracellular enzymes intracellular metabolic pathways and the change of st eps and gel strength the combination of high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses is often used to reveal the diversity and metabolic functions of enriched microbial consortia in anaerobic batch reactors especially for the minor and ignored microbes for example the genus bacteroides was identified as the core bacteria for the degradation of alginate using extracellular alginate lyase ec 4 2 2 3 though its percentage was lower than 0 1 in an enriched mixed culture zhang et al 2019 these methods may also provide solid evidence of polygalacturonate occurrence in was besides methane production st eps degradation may change the gel strength of was which can be revealed using rheological analysis li et al 2020 thus in this study the occurrence of polygalacturonate in was st eps is first identified by combining chemical and metagenomic analysis in order to evaluate biological methods for better was conversion we then develop an enrichment culture for gdc in batch reactors using polygalacturonate as the substrate the role of st eps on methane production and change of gel strength in was by this enriched gdc is then investigated the metabolic functioning of gdc is also analysed by combining high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis finally we investigate the effectiveness of gdc for enhanced was fermentation it is hoped that the outcomes of this study may improve the understanding of the effects of st eps degradation on was fermentation and subsequently help develop a microbial method to enhance was fermentation 2 materials and methods 2 1 inocula and enrichment of gdc in mesophilic fed batch reactors was was collected from the jinshan wastewater treatment plant fuzhou city china the typical characteristics of this was are summarized in table s1 two inocula were collected from a mixture of was 10 ml vss 10 7 g l and the effluent of a chemostat fed with alginate 30 ml vss 1 2 g l hu et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 the mixture was diluted with 20 ml of inorganic medium to reach 60 ml the composition of the inorganic medium was the same as that described in a previous work hu et al 2022 the enrichment process can be divided into three stages in stage 1 days 1 50 the inoculum 60 ml and inorganic medium 120 ml were added to 3 serum bottles 120 ml working volume of 60 ml each bottle was sparged with n2 99 99 for 20 min and was then cultured in a shaker at 35 c 5 g l of polygalacturonate was added on days 0 10 18 26 34 and 42 during each cycle the polygalacturonate concentration and metabolites were measured in stage 2 days 51 90 the enriched gdc in three serum bottles was combined in a 1 l reactor with a working volume of 500 ml and 5 g l polygalacturonate was added on days 51 61 and 76 days in the last stage days 90 96 the growth profile was investigated by adding 1 ml of enriched gdc 59 ml of inorganic medium and 5 g l of polygalacturonate in three serum bottles 120 ml 2 2 st eps extraction and degradation by dosing with enriched gdc to demonstrate the role of enriched gdc on st eps degradation st eps was extracted from 200 ml of was via the heated na2co3 method felz et al 2016 150 ml of the extracted st eps and 30 ml of enriched gdc obtained from a 1 l reactor were then mixed and added into three 120 ml serum bottles working volume 60 ml n 3 10 mm of 2 bromoethanesulfonic sodium bes was added to prevent ch4 production three serum bottles were also sparged with n2 and cultured for 13 days in a shaker at 120 rpm and 35 c the change of typical compounds in the st eps i e uronic acid polysaccharide protein and humic acid and metabolites were all determined meanwhile ft ir spectra and synchronous correlation spectra in 2d ir were obtained 2 3 was fermentation and changing parameters after dosing with enriched gdc to demonstrate the role of enriched gdc on was fermentation three groups gdc 0 gdc 10 and gdc 20 n 3 for each group were prepared in 120 ml working volume of 60 ml serum bottles with both was 50 ml and gdc of 0 10 and 20 ml respectively the supernatant of the gdc was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm and added to 10 ml of inorganic medium before using consequently the ratio of the gdc 1 4 0 2 gvss l to was 10 7 1 6 gvss l was 0 0 03 and 0 06 gvss gvss respectively these serum bottles were also sparged with n2 and cultured for 30 days the accumulation of metabolites changes to the st eps was destruction i e vssdestruction zeta potential and rheological behavior were then determined 2 4 activities of extracellular enzymes excreted by enriched gdc to demonstrate the activities of the extracellular enzymes excreted by enriched gdc the enzymes in the supernatant from the serum bottles were harvested on day 96 by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 5 min inorganic medium 50 ml polygalacturonate 5 g l and enzymatic solution 10 ml were added into a 120 ml serum bottle n 3 under a ph of 7 0 0 2 and a temperature of 35 c the activity of lyase and hydrolase and the change in molecular weight mw of the hydrolysate were all determined 2 5 analysis st eps was extracted from dried was following the method of felz et al felz et al 2016 and was characterized using a ft ir is 50 thermo scientific nicolet and synchronous correlation spectra from 2d ir were then analyzed monomers in the st eps were analysed using a hpaec pad in a dionex ics5000 system dionex usa the absorbance change of polygalacturonate at 254 nm and 540 nm were all determined using a uv visible spectrophotometer a560 aoe instruments cn the hydrolysates of polygalacturonate after dosing with enzymes were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography system waters 1525 waters usa at 254 nm geng et al 2021 the concentrations of polygalacturonate and uronic acids in the st eps were measured using the carbazole sulfuric acid method felz et al 2019 the protein and humic acids concentrations were determined using the lowry method felz et al 2019 the polysaccharide concentration was determined using the anthrone sulfuric acid method felz et al 2019 the ch4 and h2 contents in the headspace of the reactors were determined using a gas chromatograph sp7890 lunan cn concentrations of ethanol and vfas were measured using another gas chromatograph 7890 agilent ca vssdestruction was calculated according to the change of vss during was fermentation liu et al 2021b the final cod balance calculation was based on the cod of each metabolite concentration zhang et al 2019 the zeta potential of the was supernatant was analysed using a nanosizer zs instrument malvern co uk the rheological behavior of the was was characterized using a physica rheometer mcr 301 anton par austria under both steady shear tests and dynamic measurements to obtain measurements of structural properties and viscous and viscoplastic properties wang et al 2017 2 6 illumina miseq high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis the bacterial diversities associated with the was and enriched gdc were analysed using high throughput sequencing majorbio corporation shanghai china six dna samples were extracted from two inocula activated sludge and chemostat sludge and four enriched gdc on days 26 50 90 and 96 these samples were termed as the was gdc1 gdc2 gdc3 gdc4 and gdc5 respectively amplification primers of 341f 806r zhang et al 2019 was carried out using abi geneamp 9700 sequencing was then performed using an illumina miseq pe 300 sequencer raw sequencing reads were quality filtered and operational taxonomical units otu 97 were picked for further analysis of the microbial diversities using silva v132 database a confidence threshold of 0 7 following the standard protocols of the majorbio cloud platform ren et al 2022 metabolic pathways in the was sample and the enriched gdc5 sample were further identified using metagenomic analysis in a novaseq 6000 platform majorbio china pair end sequence reads were then merged and metagenomics data were assembled using megahit version 1 1 2 kegg annotation was finally conducted using diamond software version 0 8 35 with an e value of 1e 5 the metabolic pathway and encoded enzymes were finally identified following the standard protocols of the majorbio cloud platform ren et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying the occurrence of polygalacturonate in st eps the content of st eps in the was sample was 114 5 13 9 mg gvss which was comparable to the results of lin 72 mg g vss and qian 101 mg gvss lin et al 2013 qian et al 2021 a comparison of ft ir spectra from the st eps polygalacturonate and alginate fig 1 a identified several typical absorption peaks including wide absorption peaks near 3280 cm 1 associated with oh stretching vibrations an antisymmetric stretching vibration absorption peak of methylene at 2931 cm 1 a vibration peak of c o near 1652 cm 1 and a vibration peak of the co group near 1246 cm 1 zhang et al 2021 the absorption peak at 1029 cm 1 reflects the bending vibration of the co c group in the polysaccharide lin et al 2013 synchronous correlation spectra obtained using two dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy 2d ir figure s1 were further used to identify the similarity between st eps and polygalacturonate within the range of 1000 1800 cm 1 huang et al 2021 the positive results of cross related peaks including 1029 cm 1 1247 cm 1 and 1652 cm 1 also showed that their band intensities were changed in the same direction which verified the similarity of identified functional groups interestingly uronic acid components of galacturonate and glucuronate were also identified in the st eps using hpaec pad this observation is similar to that of felz et al who noted that both galacturonate and glucuronate were detected in eps from aerobic granular sludge fig 1b felz et al 2019 these results suggest good similarity between the functional groups of st eps polygalacturonate and alginate genera of mycobacterium 4 6 ferruginibacter 4 3 terrimonas 4 0 and thermomonas 3 9 were the main bacteria in the was sample identified using high throughput sequencing fig 1c the genus zoogloea 1 5 was especially illustrated as a key contributor to the formation of activated sludge flocs by producing excessive amounts of viscous eps an et al 2016 udp galacturonate is known as the precursor of polygalacturonate in anabolism which is converted from udp glucuronate by udp glucuronate 4 epimerase ec 5 1 3 6 zhao et al 2018 udp glucuronate is initially produced from glucose 1p via udp glucose pyrophosphorylase ec 2 7 7 9 and uridine 5 diphosphoglucose dehydrogenase ec 1 1 1 22 zhao et al 2018 these three enzymes were all encoded by sequenced bacteria in the was sample via the metagenomic analysis figures s2 and s3 approximately 22 of the bacteria including ferruginibacter and zoogloea were identified according to the key enzyme of ec 5 1 3 6 using metagenomic analysis fig 1d these results demonstrate that polygalacturonate did exist in the st eps and was produced by the dominant bacteria in the was 3 2 gdc enrichment and degradation of st eps gdc was enriched in three serum bottles for 50 days stage 1 by adding 5 g l polygalacturonate on days 0 10 18 26 34 and 42 the final concentrations of polygalacturonate at the end of each cycle were below 0 05 g l figure s4a adc in the inocula was observed to utilize polygalacturonate using metagenomic analysis geng et al 2021 which may initially consume polygalacturonate in this study methane was detected after dosing with polygalacturonate and the final volume was between 113 and 142 ml fig 2 a the h2 content was always below 0 01 the detection limit of gc intermediates of acetate 0 9 0 2 g l and propionate 0 2 0 05 g l were detected and were completely consumed by methanogens figure s4b the average cod balance was 110 1 10 6 the enriched gdc was then transferred into a 1 l bottle on day 51 stage 2 and 5 g l polygalacturonate was added on days 51 61 and 76 the average ch4 production was 373 7 6 9 ml fig 2a and cod balance was 101 3 11 9 n 3 the od600 in the growth curve figure s4c also increased from 0 05 0 01 day 90 to 0 96 0 05 day 95 these results all supported a good activity of enriched gdc using polygalacturonate as the sole carbon source extracted st eps could not be degraded under abiotic conditions after adding gdc to the st eps extracted from the was sample uronic acid polygalacturonate equivalent fig 2b polysaccharide glucose equivalent fig 2c and protein bsa equivalent fig 2d were all degraded within 13 days the final concentration of these three compounds on day 13 was 0 0 and 42 5 7 5 mg l respectively the concentration of humic acid did not change much and was around 150 mg l figure s4d the main metabolites of the st eps were acetate and propionate with final concentrations of 144 5 54 7 and 48 7 6 5 mg l respectively fig 2e since bes was added in these tests there was no ch4 accumulation in the headspace and h2 may have been utilized by homoacetogenesis to produce acetate figure s4e guo et al recently demonstrated that st eps could decrease the anaerobic biodegradability and structural decomposition of was guo et al 2020 lü et al showed that dosing with polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 increased the release of total eps polysaccharides by 7 times lü et al 2016 indicating that enriched gdc may promote st eps degradation and methane production from was 3 3 ch4 production from was by dosing with enriched gdc as expected dosing the was digestion batch reactor with enriched gdc promoted methane production over 30 days of operation fig 3 a shows that the final ch4 production in the gdc 20 group 129 7 2 1 ml was much higher than that in the control group 39 5 1 7 ml and in the gdc 10 group 85 8 0 9 ml thus methane production was increased by up to 2 3 times no hydrogen was accumulated figure s5a in the headspace and the acetate and propionate vfas were all consumed within 15 days figures s5b s5c and s5d though st eps can be degraded by native bacteria in was dosing with gdc further promoted st eps conversion fig 3b for example the final st eps content was 60 0 6 6 mg gvss in the control group and was just 17 0 0 8 mg gvss in the gdc 20 group indicating a higher degradation efficiency 47 6 vs 85 2 this was much higher than that found by guo et al 41 in mesophilic anaerobic batch reactors without enriching st eps degrading bacteria guo et al 2020 fig 3b further shows that the vssdestruction of the was sample after 31 days of fermentation notably increased from 11 5 1 7 in gdc 0 to 17 8 2 0 in gdc 10 and 28 4 0 9 in gdc 20 was fermentation also changed the zeta potential of the was sample fig 3c which decreased from 35 2 4 to 73 5 1 4 mv this is consistent with previous research results that have shown that zeta potential decreases after anaerobic fermentation liu et al 2021c furthermore both the original sludge and the sludge after anaerobic fermentation showed a shear thinning behavior in which dosing with gdc lowered both apparent viscosity and shear stress indicating a degradation of polymers fig 3d results of the creep test fig 3e show that creep compliance was positively correlated with the gdc dosing level indicating that the addition of gdc promoted the degradation of st eps and led to the destruction of was which further made the sludge easier to deform wang et al have demonstrated that the ratio of loss modulus to storage modulus can reflect the proportion of sludge viscosity and elasticity wang et al 2017 the dynamic strain sweep curve fig 3f shows that the maximum value of the angle tangent in the was sample was 7 4 which decreased to 1 76 in the gdc 20 sample indicating that the network strength and cohesive force of was flocs decreased with the increasing amount of inoculant these results support our hypothesis that st eps degradation can promote was destruction by dosing with enriched gdc providing a promising microbial way to enhance was fermentation 3 4 microbial diversity of enriched gdc to reveal the core bacteria in the enriched gdc the microbial diversity of two inocula the was and gdc1 samples in section 3 1 the four enriched consortia of gdc2 gdc3 gdc4 and gdc5 were analyzed using 16s rrna gene illumina high throughput sequencing the shannon index curve figure s6a rarefaction curve figure s6b and main sequencing indices table s2 all indicated that the sequencing results covered the whole enriched consortia at the domain level figure s6c the bacterial percentage in the final gdc5 was 99 5 fig 4 a shows that bacteroidota 60 3 and firmicutes 33 8 were the main phyla in gdc1 in gdc5 the main phyla changed to proteobacteria 64 5 firmicutes 25 0 and bacteroidota 9 8 the percentages of the top enriched bacteria 1 at the genus level are summarized in fig 4b according to the rank abundance curves figure s6d and heatmap figure s6e bacteroides 47 7 and oscillibacter 20 9 were the main genera in gdc1 while these changed to genera of clostridium sensu stricto 8 37 5 methanobacterium 15 4 and alistipes 14 3 in gdc4 and unclassified f enterobacteriaceae 46 5 and clostridium sensu stricto 8 15 4 in gdc5 the identified polygalacturonate producers of ferruginibacter and zoogloea in was were not detected in gdc5 it should be noted that bacteroides was enriched in a previous study as the novel genus which degrades uronic acids of alginate and polygalacturonate in a mesophilic chemostat geng et al 2021 in the current study after long term operation the percentage of the genus bacteroides decreased notably from 47 7 gdc1 to 0 5 gdc5 which indicates that a different potentially novel genus maybe two genera of unclassified f enterobacteriaceae and clostridium sensu stricto 8 performed polygalacturonate degradation this might be better revealed via a metagenomic analysis lastly two genera of methanobacterium hydrogenotrophic methanogens 15 4 in gdc5 and methanosaeta acetoclastic methanogens 0 8 in gdc5 zabranska and pokorna 2018 were identified to convert the intermediates of h2 and acetate to methane which is consistent with the results presented in fig 2 3 5 extracellular enzymes and intracellular metabolic pathway of enriched gdc the extracellular enzymes for polygalacturonate hydrolysis include lyases of pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 exo pectate lyase 4 2 2 9 and pectin lyase 4 2 2 10 and hydrolyase of polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 garron and cygler 2014 enzymatic activity tests for lyases in the gdc5 sample fig 5 a showed an obvious activity over the control sample indicating good activity of polygalacturonate lyase and hydrolyase the apparent mw of initial polygalacturonate was above 100 000 and after dosing with enzymatic solution the mw profiles of final hydrolysate decreased to a mw of 266 da fig 5b however due to the complexity of these enzymes it was hard to analyze the specific intermediates such as mw 45 000 which would be revealed in the future with respect to hydrolyase the absorbance at 540 nm fig 5a did not increase by much thus the extracellular lyases rather than polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 might work on polygalacturonate degradation in enriched gdc the majority of identified sequenced reads in enriched gdc was in the metabolism section according to metagenomic analysis figure s7 the full metabolic pathway of carbon flow to methane was constructed by metagenomic analysis figure s8 in which the well known glycolysis of entner doudoroff ed pathway figure s9 and embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway figure s10 were encoded fig 5c demonstrates the identified pathways for polygalacturonate degradation by enriched gdc the extracellular lyases of pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 and exo pectate lyase 4 2 2 9 were identified figure s11 and other lyases of pectin lyases 4 2 2 10 and extracellular hydrolyase of polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 figure s11 were missing this meant that polygalacturonate was first converted to unsaturated digalacturonates via pectate lyases of ec 4 2 2 2 and ec 4 2 2 9 which is consistent with the extracellular enzymatic activities seen in figs 5a and 5b the intracellular unsaturated digalacturonate was further degraded into 5 dehydro 4 deoxy d glucuronate ddg by ec 4 2 2 6 which subsequently entered into the ed pathway via cascading reactions by intracellular enzymes of ec 5 3 17 ec 1 1 1 127 figure s11 ec 2 7 1 45 figure s11 the enzymes for other uronic acids of glucuronate ec 5 3 1 12 ec 1 1 1 57 and ec 4 2 1 8 in figure s11 and alginate ec 4 2 2 3 in figure s12 were also encoded to enter into the polygalacturonate degrading pathway additionally the produced kdpg was converted to d glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate gap and pyruvate by a kdpg aldolase ec 4 1 2 14 in figure s9 and finally converted into the metabolites detected in fig 2 the typical enzymes of pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 and ec 4 2 2 9 and intracellular enzymes of ec 4 2 2 6 ec 5 3 17 and ec 1 1 1 127 are summarized in table s3 and the identified bacteria are summarized in table s4 the genus clostridium 17 1 including closed genera of clostridium sensu stricto 8 15 4 and clostridium sensu stricto 12 1 2 was the main identified bacterium that can excrete extracellular lyase of both ec 4 2 2 2 and ec 4 2 2 9 another genus of bacteroides a former enriched bacteria for alginate conversion geng et al 2021 may also excrete these two enzymes but the percentage of this genus was just 0 5 indicating that the genus clostridium outcompeted bacteroides for polygalacturonate degradation during the 100 days enrichment it should be noted that for the intracellular metabolic pathway ec 5 3 17 and ec 1 1 1 127 were identified in the clostridium genus but ec 4 2 2 6 was not it is known that for alginate degradation the conversion of unsaturated monomers is generally considered as a non enzymatic reaction geng et al 2021 thus the conversion of unsaturated galacutronate to ddg may also occur in a similar way moreover the genus clostridium was also the main bacterium for glucuronate degradation according to the enzyme of ec 5 3 1 12 however the role of unclassified f enterobacteriaceae on polygalacturonate degradation was still unclear due to the poor identification of enzymes summarized in table s3 thus the genus clostridium could be considered a core bacterium for the degradation of polygalacturonate and other uronic acids which is consistent with the microbial diversity seen in fig 4b 3 6 implication and perspective of st eps degradation and was fermentation via dosing with enriched gdc hydrolysis via extracellular enzymes is known as the first step in was utilization teo and wong 2014 zhang et al 2021 lü et al found that dosing polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1 15 in was increased the release of total eps polysaccharides by up to 7 times lü et al 2016 but the associated mechanism was not well documented in this work the occurrence of polygalacturonate was revealed by combining chemical and metagenomic analyses fig 1 supporting the positive role of polygalacturonase on polysaccharide release however two extracellular lyases pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 and exo pectate lyase 4 2 2 9 were unexpectedly identified in this work when using polygalacturonate as the substrate and unsaturated galacturonate was subsequently produced fig 5 thus the pectate lyases extracted by the clostridium genus 17 1 in the enriched gdc were the likely key extracellular enzymes to promote st eps destruction as shown in fig 6 this was analogous to alginate degradation where the alginate lyase ec 4 2 2 3 was the key extracellular enzyme in enriched genus bacteroides zhang et al 2019 thus the mechanism is proposed in fig 6 that the hydrolysate of was was utilized by the genus clostridium and other acidogens to produce fatty acids such as acetate propionate and butyrate which were finally converted to methane by methanogens represented by the genera methanobacterium and methanosaeta this work demonstrates that integrating high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses can help clarify the core bacterium and metabolic pathways of enriched microbial cultures till now physical chemical and mechanical treatments have been proposed to promote was fermentation but toxic and refractory by products are also unwantedly released by these methods toutian et al 2020a 2021 wang et al 2022 for example cao et al reported that excess nitrate and nitrite remained in the effluent of wwtps due to the complex composition and toxicity of released cod from alkaline fermentation broth cao et al 2019 thus biological methods are deemed to offer the benefits of low operating cost and high selectivity zhang et al 2021 st eps with typical components of polygalacturonate and ale can strengthen the stability of the structure of was felz et al 2019 guo et al 2020 the enriched gdc improved the methane production by up to 2 3 times in this work which was supported by the observed st eps reduction was destruction and the rheological behaviors of both apparent viscosity and shear stress fig 3 as excreted from bacteria in was eps is generally considered to be a complex organic composed of proteins polysaccharides and humic acids yu 2020 besides polygalacturonate degradation clostridium is a well known gram positive genus which can produce hydrogen and fatty acids from carbohydrates such as carbohydrates and protein as substrates batstone et al 2019 dai et al 2020 in our recent work a gram negative alginate degrading consortium of genus bacteroides was enriched and demonstrated enhancement of methane production from was 115 185 zhang et al 2021 2019 these results demonstrate that st eps plays a significant role in was fermentation destruction of the eps network by combining these enriched bacteria may further enhance was fermentation by degrading st eps a better focus on the mechanisms behind sludge hydrolysis will also help in maximizing the methane yield from was as a polymer polysaccharide commonly found in the cell wall polygalacturonate is also abundant in fruits and vegetables and frequently applied as a gelling agent in the food industry bui et al 2019 perpelea et al 2022 valk et al 2018 approximately 35 million tons of citrus peel 28 million tons of sugar beet pulp and 2 million tons of apple pomace were produced in 2016 containing 15 polygalacturonate valk et al 2018 thus the co fermentation of organic wastes including was fruits and vegetables may further increase the activity of extracellular enzymes and promote methane production which will be investigated in future studies hereinafter the st eps degradation via enrichment with gdc can provide a good paradigm for was fermentation via biological methods 4 conclusions the occurrence of polygalacturonate in the st eps of was was investigated in this work by combining chemical and metagenomic analyses for the first time the positive role of st eps in was fermentation was subsequently documented using enriched gdc consequently this work provided an elegant method for promoting was fermentation by identifying the key component in eps the main findings were as follows about 22 of bacteria in collected was including ferruginibacter and zoogloea were identified as being associated with polygalacturonate production according to the key enzyme ec 5 1 3 6 10 g l of polygalacturonate was wholly consumed by enriched gdc with a cod recovery balance around 100 the percentage of st eps degradation increased from 47 6 to 85 2 via dosing with gdc and the methane production subsequently increased up to 2 3 times over a control group the percentage of was destruction increased from 11 5 to 28 4 after dosing gdc which was supported by the change of rheological behaviors of the sludge the genus clostridium 17 1 was finally identified as the key bacterium in the gdc using high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses extracellular pectate lyases ec 4 2 2 2 and 4 2 2 9 not typical polygalacturonase ec 3 2 1
