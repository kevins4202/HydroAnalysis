24545,flow cytometry is often employed in ecology to measure traits and population size of bacteria and phytoplankton this technique allows measuring millions of particles in a relatively small amount of time however distinguishing between different populations is not a straightforward task gating is a process in the identification of particles measured in flow cytometry gates can either be created manually using known characteristics of these particles or by using automated clustering techniques available automated techniques implemented in statistical packages for flow cytometry are primarily developed for medicinal applications while only two exist for phytoplankton cyanofilter is an r package built to identify phytoplankton populations from flow cytometry data the package also integrates gating functions from two other automated algorithms it also provides a gating accuracy test function that can be used to determine the accuracy of a desired gating function if monoculture flowcytometry data is available the central algorithm in the package exploits observed pigmentation and granularity of phytoplankton cells we demonstrate how its performance depends on strain similarity using a model system of six cyanobacteria strains using the same system we compare the performance of the central gating function in the package to similar functions in other packages

repository 1 introduction phytoplankton are primary producers responsible for about 50 of global primary production studies seeking a better understanding of the ecology of phytoplankton have relied on flow cytometry fcm to measure phytoplankton abundance and traits pomati et al 2013 stomp et al 2007 fontana et al 2018 although there are earlier applications of fcm in microbial ecology trask et al 1982 berglund and eversman 1988 the possibility of obtaining individual level data through fcm to enhance the understanding of community assembly and biodiversity is increasingly exploited fontana et al 2014 pereira et al 2019 dunker et al 2018 fcm is a technique which involves the suspension of cells or particles within a fluid stream which is made to pass through one or more laser beams o neill et al 2013 a crucial step in fcm application is to separate signal from noise e g phytoplankton cells from other particles gating a process of using fluorescence intensity to sequentially separate histograms or scatter plots obtained from plotting fcm data into regions is the classical approach to meet this challenge measured particles are classified based on their properties most notably scatter and fluorescence signals this process can be done manually termed manual gating or with automated algorithms termed automated gating o neill et al 2013 gating is typically done manually with software such as fcs express software 2021 flomax sysmex 2021 flowjo becton and company 2021 incyte luminex corporation 2021 or using model based tools such as flowclust lo et al 2009 flowmeans aghaeepour et al 2010 and flowemmi ludwig et al 2019 or machine learning fontana et al 2018 or tree based algorithm commenges et al 2018 or deep learning combined with image based cytometry dunker et al 2018 while manual gating is often not fully reproducible model based tools machine and deep learning often require tuning of global parameters that are not related to the biological properties of the measured cells and cannot readily integrate experts knowledge malek et al 2015 moreover most of these packages were developed and optimized for medical fcm data currently there are two known software packages that offer automated gating for phytoplankton flowphyto ribalet et al 2011 and flowemmi ludwig et al 2019 flowphyto which uses flowclust lo et al 2009 for gating phytoplankton communities contained in geo referenced seawater is primarily built for seaflow swalwell et al 2009 a flow cytometer that is different from traditional flow cytometers flowemmi uses the expectation maximization em algorithm on two channels to gate microbial communities contained in flow cytometry data ludwig et al 2019 the package requires that manual pre processing be carried out to remove debris prior to applying the gating functions provided by flowemmi moreover the authors of the package assume that the samples are treated with a fluorescent dye to separate the cells from noise and debris this assumption does not hold for phytoplankton since these cells are photosynthetic and they absorb and reflect light naturally kirk 1994 stomp et al 2004 we therefore introduce a new r package cyanofilter for semi automated gating of phytoplankton fcm data the central gating function in the package phytofilter uses pigment and granularity information to identify phytoplankton populations contained in a sample aside from identifying phytoplankton populations cyanofilter can also assist in the identification of previously unknown fluorescence and scatter channels useful for differentiating phytoplankton cells it also imports gating functions from two other r packages flowclust and cytometree the package also contains functions for pre processing steps that might be needed before the gating we demonstrate the performance of the package when compared with two other packages flowclust and cytometree using six strains of the cyanobacteria genus synechococcus which represents a common component of phytoplankton communities worldwide petr et al 2004 and is one of the oldest life forms known to perform photosynthesis kirk 1994 in addition the strains from this genus harbor a rich diversity of pigmentation phenotypes stomp et al 2007 2004 haverkamp et al 2008 allowing us to manipulate pigmentation similarity and evaluate the resulting performance of our package doing so is important as distinguishing populations becomes increasingly difficult as pigmentation becomes more similar among populations 2 materials and methods the purpose of cyanofilter is to provide a user friendly toolbox that uses pigmentation and or cell granularity reflecting the structure of internal organelles to identify phytoplankton populations contained in a sample we categorize each particle measured by fcm into one of four outcomes debris margin events multiplets and singlets debris are non living particles and therefore often not of interest margin events are particles with widths outside the range that is measurable by the flow cytometer as the dimensions of these particles are not known these are also typically excluded from analyses multiplets are two or more cells clustered together which result in disproportionate readings of the height width relationship if the cells being measured are not of doublet morphology meeks and elhai 2002 then doublets or multiplets can be avoided during the acquisition phase of fcm finally singlets are those particles that are often the focus of interest and these are further categorized into different populations the process of properly identifying these outcomes requires the knowledge of both the flow cytometer light scatter channels and properties of the measured cells the cyanofilter framework consists of a pipeline of analyses that start from pre processing the raw fcm output from the flow cytometer to the last stage of producing flowframes r object name for fcm data with labels for each population of phytoplankton identified in the fcm data fig 1 the central algorithm in cyanofilter identifies peaks along all the supplied channels it does so by fitting one dimensional kernel densities to each channel the procedure defines specific channel values that separate the identified peaks also the procedure disregards peaks with a height below a user defined cut off more details about this approach to gating can be found in malek et al 2015 the entire gating algorithm is carried out in the following steps 1 search for peaks along each light channel measuring cell pigmentation and granularity 2 per channel identify the separation point between the peaks observed in step 1 3 per channel divide particles into clusters based on the separation point identified in 2 and label each cluster 4 consider each channel as a factor and all cluster labels as factor levels generate all possible factorial combinations 5 count the number of particles in each of these combinations 6 rank clusters in descending order according to proportions of particles they represent and retain clusters with decreasing rank until a user defined minimum proportion is achieved we set this to a default of 80 which implies that clusters containing 80 of the measured particles are returned steps four and five allow grouping cells with similar scattered light profiles across the channels considered for example cells with low scattered light across all pigment channels will be clustered together thereby ending up in the same cluster this algorithm makes up most of the last three steps in the analysis pipeline described in fig 1 2 1 implementation cyanofilter is written entirely in r r core team 2021 and offers functions to process standard flow cytometer data files often referred to as fcs files but they are called flowframes within r flowframes contain matrices of channels containing data about light scatter measurement from each cell rows in the matrices represent particles while columns are detection channels cyanofilter also contains functions to visualize cluster phytoplankton populations contained in a fcs file 1 all clustering functions have summary and plot methods that can be accessed with the usual plot and summary functions in r 2 1 1 installation the cyanofilter r package is available on bioconductor huber et al 2015a and its latest development version on github at

workflow to illustrate the use of the package we applied fcm to six strains of synechococcus cyanobacteria wh8101 rs9906 bl 10 a15 46 10cr4 3 ros8604 obtained from the roscoff culture collection rcc roscoff culture collection org and grown in 12h 12h day night cycles at 20 c the strains were chosen to represent a variety of pigmentation types six et al 2007 pigment classification is based on the phycobiliprotein forms type 1 strains have only phycocyanin pc type 2 strains have pc and phycoerythrin i pei and type 3 have pc pei and phycoerythrin ii peii two strains of each pigment type were used wh8101 and rs9906 are type 1 bl 10 and a15 46 are type 2 and 10cr4 3 and ros8604 are type 3 see appendix b each strain was characterized in monoculture using fcm measuring the presence of chlorophyll a 488 nm excitation 695 nm flourescence phycoerythrin 488 nm excitation 583 nm flourescence and phycocyanin 642 excitation 664 nm flourescence as well as cell size forward scatter and cell granularity side scatter all strains were cultured under light intensity 20 microeinsteins μ e ms 2 s 1 using pcr s 11 red sea medium rippka et al 2000 we employed a guavava easycyte 3l flowcytometer https www luminexcorp com guava easycyte flow cytometers overview to measure these cyanobacteria samples it uses two lasers one red 642 nm and one blue 488 nm we measured 5000 objects per sample with flourescence detection 642 nm excitation 664 nm emission 2 3 gating accuracy to evaluate the performance of cyanofilter we compare how it correctly identifies six strains of cyanobacteria to the three other automated gating packages cytometree flowclust and flowmeans we choose these three packages because they allow for gating with multiple channels and do not involve the tuning of global parameters we employed the following scheme first we gate each of the monoculture flowframes using the four softwares to label every particle to the correct strain i e population second we formulate all possible unique pairs of the cyanobacteria strains by joining the flowframes of each pair together we rerun each function on the joined flowframes optimal performance of cytometree flowclust flowmeans and phytofilter would lead to correct grouping of the two populations based on the joined flowframes more specifically if these packages group two cells as similar in the monoculture they should also identify those cells as similar when analyzing the joined monoculture flowframes and vice versa we tested this by randomly sampling pairs of particles and examining if their categorization as belonging to similar or different groups was the same when based on the joined flowframes as in the monoculture flowframes if this was true then we recorded this sample as a success and a failure otherwise we repeated this random sampling and subsequent assessment ten thousand times enabling us to compute the accuracy of these gating functions we define accuracy as the number of successes per ten thousand to the best of our knowledge such comparison has not been carried out in phytoplankton flow cytometry literature the closest to this was carried out by ludwig et al 2019 who compared the number of clusters detected across different software when these softwares were applied to gate mock microbial communities 3 results 3 1 metadata pre processing the first step in the analysis pipeline fig 1 is the identification of the correct dilution level for flow cytometers without the ability to perform sample dilution before acquisition samples are measured using dilution series and each series is measured using the flow cytometer thus every sample has measurements at different dilution levels it is important to identify which of these measurements is appropriate to do this one determines the cell concentration that allows the flow cytometer to properly characterize each cell it measures manufacturers of flow cytometers provide the range of values for cell concentrations that is considered acceptable this range can be supplied to goodfcs in cyanofilter section c1 appendix to check if the sample dilution yielded an acceptable concentration in cells μ l 3 2 transformation and visualization after validating that the concentration of the samples is within the specified range we proceed to visualize the measured light scatter channels to examine the need for transformations using the ggpairsdens in cyanofilter fig d 1 appendix the choice of a good transformation or the optimal transformation for a fcm data can be made via visual inspection or the use of the flowtrans r package finak et al 2021 the package comes bundled with a function for natural logarithm transformation but others such archsinh linear and double exponential transformations are made available in the flowcore r package here the transformation does improve detection and visualization of populations in the dataset 3 3 gating margin events the next step in the pipeline is to remove margin events margin events are normally stacked up close to maximum or minimum measurable width of the flow cytometer this is visible when one plots the channel measuring cell width to identify and remove them in the flowframes we supplied the channel column measuring cell width nir r w in case of our flow cytometer to the cellmargin function this function uses the first three steps in the cyanofilter gating algorithm listed above to separate margin events from the properly measured cells the resulting object of class marginevents has a plot and a summary method which produce a two dimensional plot of the measured particles along the supplied channel basic summary statistics the estimated cut point and the number of margin and nonmargin events section c4 d2 appendix 3 4 gating debris to identify and remove debris we used the channel column which measures the presence of chlorophyll a in the debrisnc function cells with lower levels of chlorophyll a are either dead cells or non photosynthetic particles and should cluster around or close to 0 therefore we expected two peaks along the chlorophyll a channel however this might not be evident if the number of debris particles is very small fig d3 appendix in these cases we calibrated the function to use two standard deviations away from the center of the peak detected as a cut point cells with chlorophyll a levels below this cut point are categorized as debris users have the option to change this if required the debrisnc function also comes with a plot and summary method section c5 appendix 3 5 gating cyanobacteria strains to identify the cyanobacteria strains using the phytofilter function we supplied channels columns measuring the presence of chlorophyll a phycoerythrin and phycocyanin as pigment channels we consider cell size as an aspect of cell granularity thus we also supplied the channels measuring cell size and granularity section c6 appendix the resulting object also has a plot fig 2 a and summary method that produces matrix scatter plots and summary information about the gating 3 6 performance the performance of cyanofilter cytometree and flowmeans increases with increasing distance between the multivariate depths of the strains as well as increasing distance between the rgb color vectors see figs 2b and 2c the accuracy of the fore mentioned software also decreases below 60 when these strains are close in terms of color and depth flowclust has an accuracy above 70 when the strains are close in terms of the two characteristics color and multivariate depths and its performance is quite stable across the range of distance observed the performance of flowclust also increases with increasing distance between the depth and rgb color vectors of these strains while cyanofilter cytometree and flowmeans outperform flowclust at certain distances between the depths of these strains increasing distance does not always lead to increasing accuracy see figure d4 in section d of the appendix moreover flowclust is also performing quite well in these scenarios see figs 2b and 2c flowmeans only produced results for some strain combinations the package fails for about 40 of the strain combinations we considered 4 discussion summary from the accuracy test for the particular experiment we performed we observed that cyanofilter performs moderately when the strains have similar color and multivariate depths indeed we expected the accuracy of the algorithm to increase with increasing distance between the multivariate depths since it relies on the minimum intersection between peaks to be able to divide cells into groups and the multivariate depths themselves are a measure of location in a multidimensional space thus closer peaks would imply closer depths and these are harder to distinguish therefore we expect that gating strains that absorb light around similar peaks will be challenging for cyanofilter our accuracy test also shows that this is the case for cytometree and flowmeans it is important to carefully consider the possible effects of chromatic adaptation a process where levels of biliproteins responsible for absorbing specific light color are controlled by the spectral quality of the light the phytoplankton is exposed to stomp et al 2004 kehoe 2010 since cyanofilter uses pigments and cell granularity to gate phytoplankton species if chromatic adaptation leads to a change in the pigmentation of phytoplankton species such that it absorbs light along similar spectra as another species then there is a chance of reduced accuracy for cyanofilter if there are no other light scatter channels that can differentiate these species the drop in accuracy when the strains share similar color and close multivariate depth along light scatter channels supports this however this problem is not unique to cyanofilter other packages will suffer a similar reduction in accuracy if chromatic adaptation occurs such that no channel offers additional information that can help differentiate the cells cyanofilter offers a suite of functions that helps with pre processing of fcm files and identification of phytoplankton populations therein it can cluster phytoplankton in fcm experiments with the advantage of easy integration of knowledge about the cells via the light scatter channels measured for example we used information about chlorophyll a to differentiate debris from phytoplankton cells users can either base this identification on user defined channels or let the algorithm identify which channels provide the best clustering of populations in a sample while the example uses 6 cyanobacteria strains the package is applicable to fcm measurements of phytoplankton cells that scatter specific wavelengths of light since such light can be used to estimate their size and their photosynthetic pigments thus channels measuring such light scatter can be used to identify and distinguish these phytoplankton cells ribalet et al 2011 the package also incorporates gating functions from cytometree and flowclust furthermore users can use the accuracy test function provided within this package to determine which gating function is best suited for their experiment this function requires the availability of monoculture fcm experiments with this package we hope to contribute to making analyses of phytoplankton

two dimensional plot of the measured particles along the supplied channel basic summary statistics the estimated cut point and the number of margin and nonmargin events section c4 d2 appendix 3 4 gating debris to identify and remove debris we used the channel column which measures the presence of chlorophyll a in the debrisnc function cells with lower levels of chlorophyll a are either dead cells or non photosynthetic particles and should cluster around or close to 0 therefore we expected two peaks along the chlorophyll a channel however this might not be evident if the number of debris particles is very small fig d3 appendix in these cases we calibrated the function to use two standard deviations away from the center of the peak detected as a cut point cells with chlorophyll a levels below this cut point are categorized as debris users have the option to change this if required the debrisnc function also comes with a plot and summary method section c5 appendix 3 5 gating cyanobacteria strains to identify the cyanobacteria strains using the phytofilter function we supplied channels columns measuring the presence of chlorophyll a phycoerythrin and phycocyanin as pigment channels we consider cell size as an aspect of cell granularity thus we also supplied the channels measuring cell size and granularity section c6 appendix the resulting object also has a plot fig 2 a and summary method that produces matrix scatter plots and summary information about the gating 3 6 performance the performance of cyanofilter cytometree and flowmeans increases with increasing distance between the multivariate depths of the strains as well as increasing distance between the rgb color vectors see figs 2b and 2c the accuracy of the fore mentioned software also decreases below 60 when these strains are close in terms of color and depth flowclust has an accuracy above 70 when the strains are close in terms of the two characteristics color and multivariate depths and its performance is quite stable across the range of distance observed the performance of flowclust also increases with increasing distance between the depth and rgb color vectors of these strains while cyanofilter cytometree and flowmeans outperform flowclust at certain distances between the depths of these strains increasing distance does not always lead to increasing accuracy see figure d4 in section d of the appendix moreover flowclust is also performing quite well in these scenarios see figs 2b and 2c flowmeans only produced results for some strain combinations the package fails for about 40 of the strain combinations we considered 4 discussion summary from the accuracy test for the particular experiment we performed we observed that cyanofilter performs moderately when the strains have similar color and multivariate depths indeed we expected the accuracy of the algorithm to increase with increasing distance between the multivariate depths since it relies on the minimum intersection between peaks to be able to divide cells into groups and the multivariate depths themselves are a measure of location in a multidimensional space thus closer peaks would imply closer depths and these are harder to distinguish therefore we expect that gating strains that absorb light around similar peaks will be challenging for cyanofilter our accuracy test also shows that this is the case for cytometree and flowmeans it is important to carefully consider the possible effects of chromatic adaptation a process where levels of biliproteins responsible for absorbing specific light color are controlled by the spectral quality of the light the phytoplankton is exposed to stomp et al 2004 kehoe 2010 since cyanofilter uses pigments and cell granularity to gate phytoplankton species if chromatic adaptation leads to a change in the pigmentation of phytoplankton species such that it absorbs light along similar spectra as another species then there is a chance of reduced accuracy for cyanofilter if there are no other light scatter channels that can differentiate these species the drop in accuracy when the strains share similar color and close multivariate depth along light scatter channels supports this however this problem is not unique to cyanofilter other packages will suffer a similar reduction in accuracy if chromatic adaptation occurs such that no channel offers additional information that can help differentiate the cells cyanofilter offers a suite of functions that helps with pre processing of fcm files and identification of phytoplankton populations therein it can cluster phytoplankton in fcm experiments with the advantage of easy integration of knowledge about the cells via the light scatter channels measured for example we used information about chlorophyll a to differentiate debris from phytoplankton cells users can either base this identification on user defined channels or let the algorithm identify which channels provide the best clustering of populations in a sample while the example uses 6 cyanobacteria strains the package is applicable to fcm measurements of phytoplankton cells that scatter specific wavelengths of light since such light can be used to estimate their size and their photosynthetic pigments thus channels measuring such light scatter can be used to identify and distinguish these phytoplankton cells ribalet et al 2011 the package also incorporates gating functions from cytometree and flowclust furthermore users can use the accuracy test function provided within this package to determine which gating function is best suited for their experiment this function requires the availability of monoculture fcm experiments with this package we hope to contribute to making analyses of phytoplankton

24546,how species organize spatially is one of ecology s most motivating questions multiple theories have been advanced and various models developed to account for the environment interactions among species and spatial drivers however relative importance comparisons of explanatory phenomena generally are neglected in these analyses we developed a spatially explicit community occupancy model based on markov random fields that accounts for spatial auto correlation and interspecific interactions in occupancy while also accounting for interspecific interaction in detection simulations demonstrated that the model can distinguish different mechanisms of environmental sorting such as competition and spatial autocorrelation we applied our model to camera trap data from a fisher pekania pennanti marten martes americana and coyote canis latrans fox vulpes vulpes system in apostle island national lakeshore wisconsin usa model results indicated that the observed partitioning pattern between marten and fisher distributions could be explained best by a flipped mainland island source sink pattern rather than by competition for the coyote fox system we determined that in addition to a mainland island source sink pattern there was a positive association between fox and coyote that deserved further study our model could be readily applied to other landscapes island and non island systems enhancing our understanding of species coexistence patterns keywords species coexistence occupancy model markov random field fisher marten coyote red fox 1 introduction drivers of species distributions and community structures are among the most important questions in ecology classical theories include niche theory hutchinson 1957 and lotka volterra models lotka 1910 volterra 1928 these theories concentrated on interactions between species and their environments hereafter environment sorting where environmental filters select for species with certain characteristics and allow them to coexist and interaction among species hereafter interspecies interactions e g competition while generally ignoring the spatial arrangement of habitat patches in contrast macarthur and wilson 2001 emphasized the importance of random patch level colonization and extinction probabilities in forming species richness patterns this idea was further developed by hubbell s neutral theory on community assemblage hubbell 2001 see volkov et al 2003 for a review meta population modeling is another example of spatially explicit theory which emphasized the importance of dispersal hanski 1983 this paradigm emphasized the importance of geographic arrangement of habitat patches spatial processes e g spatial auto correlations in determining the distributions of species however recent research suggested that communities reflect both species and patch level drivers leibold et al 2004 extended meta population models to examine community assembly while accounting for spatial and natural history processes concurrently yet the relative importance of natural history processes environmental sorting and species interactions and spatial processes remained unclear in most communities and unaddressed in most analyses researchers have examined plant communities e g lasky et al 2017 marine systems e g shurin et al 2009 göthe et al 2013 meyer 2017 and microbial systems using separate spatial environmental and interspecific interactions in both experimental and natural communities see logue et al 2011 for a review these studies suggested that a gradient from almost fully spatial driven to almost fully environment interaction driven patterns in community assemblage it is a challenge to distinguish different drivers and evaluating the relative contribution of different drivers partially due to the lack of a statistical modeling framework that accounts for these processes in a unified and comparable manner markov random field model mrf defines joint distributions of sets of random variables linked by non directed graphics vanmarcke 2010 cressie 1992 mrf has long been used to model spatial correlations in ecology and agriculture e g in spatial ecology hughes et al 2011 hepler et al 2018 as well as temporal analysis zhu et al 2005 and interspecific interactions harris 2016 mrf was also widely used for modeling other types of networks west et al 2014 wei and li 2007 harris 2016 thus mrf based models could be used as the core framework for joint modeling of environmental interspecific interaction and spatial drivers in a unified way so that one could examine the effect of different drivers due to recent advancements in camera trap technology ecologists can deploy infra red triggered cameras taking photographs or videos of passing animals that generate vast quantities of detection non detection data to infer presence absence p a of moderate to large sized animals burton et al 2015 that can be analyzed using mrf models however imperfect detection i e false absence due to imperfect sampling remains a challenge kéry and schmidt 2008 occupancy modeling mackenzie et al 2003 addresses imperfect detection by modeling a detection process explicitly and estimating detection rates from repeated sampling following a basic framework of modeling occupancy and detection hierarchically one can build various occupancy like models based on the idea that observations are samples taken from detection distributions conditioned on unobserved latent true patterns that follow other characteristic distributions mrf models with imperfect observations were also explored in image reconstruction contexts chalmond 1989 ibáñez and simó 2003 to understand both environmental sorting and interspecific interactions researchers proposed the use of two kinds of multispecies occupancy models the occupancy model developed by rota et al 2016 used a multinomial logistic regression which estimated different predictors for different coexistence patterns while kéry and royle 2008 used a hierarchical structure to model species interactions that can be viewed as a bayes network koller and friedman 2009 these techniques facilitated research on the assembly of animal communities in island systems and other landscapes however neither kéry and royle 2008 nor koller and friedman 2009 can model interactions of species and spatial processes simultaneously and explicitly in order to understand their relative importance cottenie 2005 dray et al 2006 too many possible patterns make multi logistic modeling intractable as in rota et al 2016 and spatial autocorrelation cannot be represented using directed graphs as in kéry and royle 2008 while there might not exist a clear root or dominate species as required in kéry and schmidt 2008 our objective was to develop a model to capture spatial auto correlation and interspecific interactions while controlling for environmental predictors as a case study we applied this new model to identify the drivers of species distributions for pairs of closely competing carnivore species in the apostle islands national lakeshore apis wisconsin usa since the case study is an island system we also tested whether the distribution patterns followed a mainland island pattern or a stepping stone pattern notably island systems are a special case where spatial processes might play an outsize role despite this we intend for our model to be applicable to the island and non island systems we anticipate this method could be applied in any situation where researchers would like their models to explicitly account for predictors spatial auto correlation and interspecific interactions in a unified framework for instance a camera trap survey where the grid is small enough to impose spatial auto correlation 2 methods 2 1 study area apostle island national lake shore apis is located on the southwest shore of lake superior usa and lies in the transition zone between temperate and boreal forest regions apis is distinct from tropical islands where much research on community assembly has occurred because of severe winters 84 6 days for maximum and 185 4 days for minimum temperature below 0 c while 29 4 days minimum temperature below 17 8 c arguez et al 2010 and relatively low primary productivity average net primary productivity of 2015 is 8 23 1 0 3 kgc m 2 year running and zhao 2018 ten species of native carnivores were detected during 2014 2017 allen et al 2017 how these species coexist and how richness differs among islands is a fundamental question for understanding community dynamics in temperate island systems 2 2 camera trapping surveys during 2014 2017 apis staff and collaborators conducted camera trap surveys to determine distributions and relative abundances of mammals within the national lakeshore allen et al 2017 twenty one of 22 islands that make up the archipelago were surveyed using a 1 km 2 lattice grid sampling frame within each grid cell there was one camera trap scent lures were placed at half of the camera stations at deployment and rotated to the remaining stations during mid deployment camera checks since all islands could not be monitored at the same time though substantial overlap did occur we assume the underlying distribution of species did not change during the 3 year survey period we divided surveys into 60 day blocks to create repeat observations the model allowed us to incorporate predictors to account for differences in detection during periods however we were not able to obtain useful predictors for all periods and sites because of incomplete environmental data 2 3 hypothesis we focus on two pairs of plausibly competing species fisher pekania pennanti marten martes americana fisher marten system and coyote canis latrans red fox vulpes vulpes coyote fox system in apis 30 of sites had fisher detections also had marten detections and 15 of sites that had marten detections also had fisher detections 2014 2017 in contrast 64 of sites that had red fox detections also had coyote detections and 28 of sites that had coyote detections also had red fox detections fig 1 in niche based theories a partition pattern like fisher and marten could be understood as spatial niche partitioning due to competition while coexistence could be achieved by partitioning other niche dimensions such as time in these theories competition was a factor promoting the partition pattern in dispersal related theories species were more likely to exist close to the source of dispersing individuals which is usually a stable mainland population if species were independent they would coexist on islands closer to the mainland with a higher probability subject to dispersal capability since we observe a spatially partitioned pattern for fisher marten it may be explained by competition or different source sink dynamics spatial processes importantly we observed that marten tended to occur on more distant islands that might indicate a flipped mainland island pattern opposite the prediction of the mainland as the source for coyote and fox coexistence at islands closer to the mainland could be explained by dispersal from the mainland yet after accounting for such potential spatial processes we are interested also in determining if these two species associate or compete dominant competitor excludes sub dominant the environment across the islands is rather homogeneous thus we were unable to obtain useful environmental predictors hence the only environmental predictor considered here was the distance to the mainland negative exponential transformed which should be considered as part of a spatial process for the fisher marten system we pose two working hypotheses for the observed pattern 1 distribution of both species among the islands reflects similar mainland distance dependencies spatial effects while separation at the site level within the island is due to competition interaction effects 2 distribution of both species among the islands reflects differing mainland distance dependencies but shows minor within island competition at the site level for the coyote fox system we pose two working hypotheses for the observed pattern 1 distribution of both species in the islands reflects spatial drivers coexistence is facilitated by separation in time 2 trophic position and life history drives distribution foxes avoid coyotes at the site level while spatial effects at the island level are minor besides comparing strengths of different drivers we also sought to test whether the spatial auto correlation followed a mainland island model where there are no spatial auto correlations between sites on different islands while the distance to mainland played an important role or a stepping stone model where there are spatial auto correlations between sites on different islands that are close and mainland mainly affects the closest islands 2 4 spatial explicit community occupancy analysis using binary markov random field model the analysis was implemented in r r core team 2019 while the core algorithm to fit the proposed model was partially implemented in c with r interfaces using rcpp and rcpparmadillo eddelbuettel and sanderson 2014 eddelbuettel and françois 2011 implementations can be found on the author s github repository yunyishen isingoccu core we used an ising model ising 1925 a kind of markov random field mrf model whose responses are all binary to model the distribution of competing species in a spatially explicit manner coding of latent true occupancy status followed the convention in network science i e 1 for presence and 1 for absence this symmetric coding was more conventional in physics but less so in ecology models with a centering term mostly used in ecology enabled modeling of the large scale response due to environmental predictors centered auto logistic models hughes et al 2011 which tried to detect auto correlation in the residuals of a large scale response due to environmental drivers however theoretical studies with this model by wolters 2017 suggested better performance of a symmetrically coded model compare to a centered model when associations e g competition spatial autocorrelations were expected additionally centered models predicted non linear relationships between the strength of association and log odds of two species coexisting or co absenting while symmetrical coding did not have this problem further symmetrical coding avoided the cross product between different terms i e environment and species interactions in the negative potential function log probability mass function pmf up to a constant difference of this model koller and friedman 2009 which helped us evaluate relative contributions of different mechanisms most importantly parameters of a symmetrical coding model had better conditional interpretation e g regression coefficient β s interaction terms γ s and auto correlation strength parameters η s which are the conditional log odds of presence given all other sites and species while other multi species spatial explicit frameworks e g rota et al 2016 hughes et al 2011 do not have this clear interpretation this property was important in understanding the strength of different mechanisms since interactions should be conditioning on environments while the reaction to the environment should also be conditioning on interactions e g blanchet et al 2020 argument 2 for instance to make comparisons between environmental sorting spatial processes and interspecific interactions as drivers of species spatial distributions three components were considered simultaneously but separately in the graph associated with the joint distribution 1 a linear predictor calculated from environmental covariates 2 a nearest neighborhood spatial autocorrelation at camera site level site level hereafter hepler et al 2018 within and among islands and 3 local species associations at the site level we assume that partial associations reflect interactions similar to harris 2016 we denote the design matrix for environmental covariates as x assumed fully known and of full column rank and responses of certain species k k 1 2 w to environment x as β k further in this case study due to the different nature of site linkages within and across islands inter island and intra island correlations were modeled separately we denote the strength parameters of these two correlations as η e x and η i n and known adjacency matrix d e x d i n eq 1 mainland island with linkage matrix d m l shares the same strength of inter island spatial autocorrelation in this study we denote the presence and absence vector of species k on the landscape as z k we denote the transpose of z k as z k t thus the joint distribution of all species at all sites has the form 1 p z 1 z w θ exp k 1 w x β k t z k η k e x z k t d m l 1 2 η k i n z k t d i n z k 1 2 η k e x z k t d e x z k l k γ l k z k t z l for the detailed meaning of parameters see table 1 we use θ as an abbreviation of all parameters in a conditional probability note that the first term accounts for an environment response mainland island effect the second account for mainland island processes as a special environment predictor mainland island spatial effect the third term accounts for intra island spatial auto correlations spatial effect the fourth term accounts for inter island spatial auto correlations and can be other types of auto correlations and the last term accounts for all inter specific interactions between species k and species l while γ l k is the strength of association between the two species in the mainland island setting we assumed that there was no inter island spatial autocorrelation so d e x has all 0 as its entries 2 5 accounting for imperfect detection and short term interactions following the logic of occupancy like modeling mackenzie et al 2003 we modeled observed detection non detection as repeated samples from a detection process associations in short term detection can also be informative about species interaction we further assumed that the interspecific interactions are local i e no spatial autocorrelations considered in the detection process we used another binary mrf ising model conditioned on the occupancy status of a species to model the detection process in total there were two binary mrf models 1 latent occupancy and 2 detection conditioned on occupancy only species occupying a certain site were included in the detection mrf and species not occupying had a probability of non detection of 1 formally we denote y k i j as species k s detection status at site i during period j the detection model also included environmental predictors of each site for a detection period with the design matrix denoted by x i j d e t assumed fully known and of full column rank with the regression coefficient of species k in detection part β k d e t the likelihood function at site i and detection repeat j is given by eq 2 2 p y 1 i j y 2 i j z 1 i z 2 i θ e x p k 1 w x i j d e t β k d e t y k i j i z k i 1 l k γ l k d e t y k i j y l i j i z k i 1 i z l i 1 we used θ as an abbreviation of all other parameters in the conditional probability i is the indicator function and i z l i 1 1 only if z l i 1 and i z l i 1 0 otherwise the indicator function knocks out the species from detection interaction if it was not occupying that site the reasoning behind this knocking out was that we assumed that non detection was caused by the absence of a species and thus should be understood as a do calculus pearl 1995 rather than conditioning unlike the occupancy part this conditional likelihood function is tractable for a reasonable number of species e g 10 because of the relatively small size of the underlying graph the joint likelihood function of the whole detection history conditioned on occupancy was the product of each site and detection period the joint unnormalized likelihood function of observed detection data then could be calculated by multiplying eqs 1 and 2 the latent z s could be estimated similarly with unknown parameters priors were set to be vague normal distributions due to the relatively small number of repeats and lack of environmental variation in our apis case study we put a normal prior with variance 0 1 on intercept of detection 0 95 hdr for detection rate 0 22 0 78 as part of our assumptions again this was not necessary for the model per se as seen in simulation but part of the case study sensitivity analysis on this part was also conducted posterior distributions were simulated through a markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm hastings 1970 that is often used in complex ecologically modeling rempel 2011 boulange et al 2017 to overcome the double intractable nature of the posterior murray et al 2012 møller et al 2006 we followed the single parameter change method proposed by murray et al 2012 we calculated a p value level that credible interval ci spans 0 a full description of the algorithm used is in appendix s2 diagnostic evaluation of mcmc results were done using r package coda plummer et al 2006 see fig 2 2 6 selection between stepping stone and mainland island model we compared two general models for spatial auto correlation between islands in this study 1 a stepping stone model assumed that sites at the edge of an island can be neighbors to sites on another island in a mrf sense we assign this linkage using delaunay triangulation okabe et al 2009 fig s1 the strength of correlation was assumed to decay exponentially through the normalized distance shurin et al 2009 sites on the closest islands have linkage to the mainland and the log odds of having species occupying such sites decay exponentially through the normalized distance to the mainland shurin et al 2009 2 a mainland island model assumed that sites on different islands were conditionally independent given their distance to the mainland the log odds of having species occupying a site decayed exponentially through the normalized distance to the mainland shurin et al 2009 bayes factor bf a bayesian generalization of a likelihood ratio test was used for model selection gelman et al 2013 we assumed the two models were equally plausible and thus the bayes factor can be understood as the ratio between the posterior probabilities of the two models we can calculate the posterior predictive distribution of data following raftery et al 2006 one obstacle to using bf in this analysis is the intractable likelihood function preventing us from directly calculating the predictive probability of each model by calculating the likelihood function during the posterior sampling however we could follow descombes et al 1999 in calculating the likelihood function by sampling augmentation variables appendix s2 since the ratio is also estimated robustness diagnostics followed descombes et al 1999 2 7 evaluating contribution of different drivers different processes can drive the degree of spatial partitioning among species e g environmental sorting can promote coexistence when species need similar resources grinnell 1917 saporetti junior et al 2012 while competition promotes partitioning tilman 1985 gastauer and meira neto 2014 compared with the strength and direction of each process a different question was which driver makes the observed pattern likely for instance is it possible that while species a and b compete we observe that they still coexist because of environmental sorting in this case we may argue that environmental sorting had a larger contribution to the observed coexistence pattern we used negative potential functions a k a hamiltonian functions in our specific setting from cipra 1987 eqn 1 1 osogami 2017 pfeuty 1970 as statistics to evaluate the contributions of each driver on the observed pattern since drivers were modeled explicitly in the proposed model in our setting the hamiltonian function was the log of the right hand side of eq 1 these types of statistics were used to quantify fitness landscapes of amino acid interactions in protein systems levy et al 2017 shekhar et al 2013 ferguson et al 2013 morcos et al 2014 with many other applications in quantifying the stability of interactions ezaki et al 2017 becker and karplus 1997 cipra 1987 statistically a negative potential function can be viewed as a fitness score defined by log probability mass function pmf up to a constant difference patterns with higher scores had higher probabilities of occurrence levy et al 2017 in model specifications we used several distinct terms to account for different ecological processes and we used the score of each of the terms to evaluate the relative contribution of each process to the observed pattern for instance γ l k z k t z l is the score for interspecific interaction between species l and k where γ l k is the strength of the interaction and z k is the vector of the occupancy of species k the score is an accumulated strength through occupancy note the score assesses the probability mass of the observed pattern i e a high positive contribution to the negative potential function means the corresponding term made the probability mass on the observed pattern high the question to be answered here is whether a certain process e g spatial had a large contribution to the observed pattern as we argued above the strength of a process is different from its contribution to the observed pattern a different aspect of the hypothesis posterior distributions for different terms of negative potential functions were calculated using posterior samples of latent occupancy status and model parameters 2 8 simulations we conducted simulations using the same spatial arrangement of apis camera trapping grids as well as regular 10 10 i e 10 rows and 10 columns of sites 15 15 20 20 and 25 25 grids on apis camera grids we tested three mechanisms 1 competition 2 non interaction and 3 sorting in competition simulations two species had the same reaction to the environment or distance to the mainland for apis and a negative association in no interaction simulations two species had opposing reactions to the environment or distance to the mainland represent niche difference flipped source sink and no association in sorting simulation two species had the same but relatively weak reaction to the environment or mainland distance and a positive association there were spatial auto correlations on all mechanisms on regular grids we tested two species on a random draw landscape with one environmental predictor note that we did not randomize this environment while on apis we used distance to the mainland as the predictor since there was a lack of environmental variation for detailed simulation settings see table s1 and table s2 in simulations all parameters had vague priors 2 9 posterior predictive checks to check for systematic discrepancies between data and model predictions we performed posterior predictive checks gelman et al 1996 lynch and western 2004 gelman et al 2013 using 6 metrics for the apis case study they were 1 frequency of detection for fisher and marten and 2 frequency of detection for coyote and fox this represented how often we see the species 3 proportion of sites that had at least one detection for fisher and marten or 4 for coyote and fox this represented the naive occupancy rate of 4 species 5 correlations between naive occupancy in each system fisher marten or coyote fox in which naive occupancy was 1 if species were ever seen at that site and 1 otherwise 6 count of sites that had both species from either of our species systems detected in total 2000 posterior predictive detection histories with the same time frame as the original apis data were sampled and posterior predictive p values for each statistic were calculated small p values indicated variations the model failed to capture 3 results 3 1 simulations we evaluated differences between posterior median estimates and true parameter values in 100 simulated datasets fig 3 in all cases the middle 50 quantile contained 0 suggesting that we generally could recover parameter values using regression models however we were conservative regarding spatial auto correlations posterior medians were less than true parameter values in some cases due to relatively a small number of grids as also shown in hughes et al 2011 when there are no repeats i e we have only one occupancy sample we could reduce the uncertainty on spatial auto correlation strength by having larger grids 3 2 fisher marten system a total of 3 1 0 6 samples were drawn after 5 1 0 4 burn in and thinned by 300 diagnostics of mcmc showed sufficient mixing of the chains fig s2 suggesting that the mcmc algorithm can approximate the posterior distribution of parameters log10 bayes factors for mainland island models and stepping stone models were estimated to be 4 26 i e the posterior probability of mainland island model was 1 0 4 higher than the posterior probability of stepping stone model hence data decisively supports mainland island rather than the stepping stone model following the recommended cutoff of 2 kass and raftery 1995 this result suggested that the spatial pattern of the system can be explained better by a mainland island model rather than a stepping stone model further analysis was based on the mainland island model table 2 shows posterior estimates of model parameters of interest for the mainland island model of the fisher marten system we detected a significant positive distance dependency positive means a higher chance of occupying a closer island here because the distance is negative exponentially transformed in fisher η e x 2 479 c i 0 976 4 744 and a negative distance dependency in marten occupancy η e x 0 789 c i 1 907 0 0558 however we did not detect a significant association between these species in either occupancy or detection c i 0 215 0 393 0 326 0 322 marten showed an intra island spatial auto correlation 0 260 c i 0 0551 0 444 this result supported the second hypothesis that fisher and marten had a flipped mainland island pattern whereby fisher had a higher chance of occupying closer islands while martens had a higher probability of occupying more remote islands independently of possible competition as discussed in our methods the strength of a certain factor is a different question compared to the contribution of the factor posterior distributions of negative potential functions in the fisher marten system suggested that association is weak and had no significant contribution to the observed distribution pattern of fisher and marten the fisher marten system seemed to be dispersal environment driven for fisher while both dispersal environment and intra island spatial auto correlation had similar levels of contribution for marten fig 4 hence competition is weak and had a minor contribution to the observed marten pattern which indicated a flipped mainland island hypothesis where the mainland functions as a sink rather than a source posterior predictive checking showed all 6 p values were greater than 0 05 indicating no systematic discrepancies between data and model predictions which suggested fitness of the fitted model fig 5 3 3 coyote fox system log10 bayes factors log posterior odds of two models for mainland island and stepping stone models were estimated to be 18 3 i e the posterior probability of mainland island model was 1 0 18 higher than the posterior probability of stepping stone model hence data decisively supported the mainland island rather than the stepping stone model following the recommended cutoff of 2 kass and raftery 1995 this result suggested that the spatial pattern of the system can be explained better by a mainland island model rather than a stepping stone model further analysis was based on the mainland island model posterior estimates of model parameters table 3 indicated a significant positive distance dependency in fox but not coyote coyote η e x 0 552 c i 0 378 1 69 fox η e x 2 41 c i 0 428 6 30 table 3 meanwhile posterior association in occupancy was estimated as positive but only weakly significant γ o c 0 234 c i 0 041 0 53 the posterior probability of this parameter being positive was p γ o c 0 d a t a 0 95 suggesting that despite dispersal environment drivers there may be evidence of a positive association between two species at grid level that needs further evaluation these findings supported the hypothesis that the coyote fox system might not be fully explained by spatial factors and require further evaluation notably we detected a significant positive association in detections γ d e t 0 427 c i 0 211 0 646 which might suggest a behavioral association similar to the fisher marten system dispersal environment also had the largest contribution to the observed pattern in the coyote fox system fig 6 however in contrast with fisher marten both spatial auto correlation and interspecific interaction seemed to have some importance fig 6 as also suggested by the hypothesis that associations exist that are additive to spatial drivers posterior predictive checking showed all 6 p values were greater than 0 05 thus no systematic discrepancies between data and model predictions which suggested the fitness of the fitted model fig 7 4 discussion we developed and tested a mrf based multispecies spatially explicit occupancy model which allowed the evaluation of relative contributions of spatial auto correlations and life history mechanisms in influencing the coexistence pattern of species our model enables ecologists who conduct research on community structure to consider spatial and life history drivers jointly and explicitly though the model assumed patterns remain constant through time single season extending it to a multiseason analysis is straightforward for instance within our proposed model framework one could define sites as spatial sites at a certain time then by applying an adequate adjacency matrix e g d e x so that only the individual spatial sites at adjacent season were connected by doing this one can incorporate temporal auto correlations similar to spatial auto correlations given we can have two or more sources of auto correlation in the proposed framework similar comparisons of the strength and contribution can carry through in a multiseason analysis another way of viewing this is by viewing season as temporal islands and we can have a stepping stone model on time to incorporate extinction and colonization one could use the dynamic ising model as the core nguyen et al 2017 in the place of the static ising model used here compared with bayesian network based multispecies frameworks proposed by kéry and royle 2008 our method did not ask for a species to be the root of the network and allowed cycles in the network moreover analysts can condition occupancy on another species to accommodate a single dominant competitor compared with rota et al 2016 our method had a better interpretation especially when a species network was large since in our method the interaction between species was modeled explicitly by auto regression terms neither kéry and royle 2008 nor rota et al 2016 were spatially explicit partly because the graph represented the spatial correlation it had no natural direction and could not be represented by a directed graph like kéry and royle 2008 did for species also when the number of potential outcomes was too large one cannot assign unique linear predictors for each pattern as in rota et al 2016 markov random field modeling was used in quantifying interspecific interactions in harris 2016 and can help identify interactions between species when controlling for the environment and other confounding interactions e g apparent competition where a b both interact with c while no interaction occurs between a and b blanchet et al 2020 again though our case study is an island system the model is not specific to island systems and the case study did not demonstrate the full potential of the model and software we built e g our method also allows for the inclusion of predictors in detection since the explicit terms of environmental predictors spatial auto correlations of different types and interspecific interactions can all be realized with this method one could apply this model to any system where these drivers should be considered and compared in a unified way for instance habitat patches or camera trap survey grids our results on two pairs of plausibly competing species as components of the meso carnivore community also showed that community structure reflected drivers associated with two broad theoretical paradigms first we detected positive intra island spatial autocorrelation for 2 species out of 4 this spatial autocorrelation term makes sites no longer exchangeable even when the distance to the mainland was controlled spatial autocorrelation also had different strengths for the four species considered which means species were not exchangeable even when considering spatial processes coyotes and foxes had different strengths of dependence on mainland distance likely due to different dispersal ability i e coyotes which are larger likely can disperse farther than foxes and thus have weaker distance dependency we detected an unexpected opposite direction of mainland distance dependency on the occupancy of marten the fisher marten system provides a possible example where the mainland serves as a sink rather than a source for a species from a metapopulation point of view this spatial pattern was recently identified independently for martens using genetic analysis smith et al 2021 a more general meta community framework should be used when considering island or island like systems if two species follow similar dispersal patterns but need to partition spatially we should expect closer islands to be more likely occupied by one of the species than the further islands and partitioning should happen on islands with similar nearby distances to the mainland i e perpendicular to the mainland island dispersion direction however we observed similar levels of co absence on islands regardless of their distances to the mainland i e martens were not occupying nearby islands regardless of fisher presence meanwhile the partitioning of fisher and marten happened in parallel distance dependency rather than independently of distance i e competition to the mainland island dispersal direction which was different from what we would expect based on hypothesis 1 i e distance dependency with competition we did not observe fisher and marten occupying sites closer to the mainland or partitioning at the site level the fisher marten system appeared to better conform to hypothesis 2 because fisher dispersal direction appeared to be from the mainland to the islands while marten dispersal appeared to be from the islands to the mainland however these results were solely from distribution data and additional evidence from genetics e g smith et al 2021 movement data or behavior etc would be needed to further support this argument for the coyote fox system we observed that spatial auto correlation had a strong influence on coyote distribution this may be due to the relatively small size of the islands compared to coyote home ranges typical coyote home ranges were 10 km 2 mills and knowlton 1991 hibler 1977 which is approximately the size of the largest islands in apis home range size reported for red fox was smaller and in 1 10 km 2 scale ables 1969 dekker et al 2001 trewhella et al 1988 and was smaller in size than some individual islands in apis together with mainland distance dependency spatial correlation patterns of coyote and fox were consistent with our knowledge of their movement ability i e coyotes have stronger dispersal ability and larger home ranges thus weaker distance dependency and stronger intra island spatial autocorrelation compared with foxes patterns of coyotes and foxes demonstrate that species are not interchangeable island biogeography theory and that distance dependency is modified by life history characteristics the fisher marten system also had a spatial auto correlation effect furnas et al 2017 reported a meta analysis on home range sizes in california usa their results showed that home ranges of female fishers varied and were approximately 6 km 2 within 20 km of the coast while approximately 13 km 2 at 120 km from the coast male fishers had home range sizes that varied from 12 km 2 at 20 km to approximately 27 km 2 at 120 km to the coast we did not detect strong intra island spatial autocorrelation in fishers which may indicate a relatively small home range for these animals on islands compared to other studies which was consistent with prior knowledge that fisher home ranges decline when close to coasts powell 1982 yaeger 2005 studies of marten home ranges in canada indicated their home ranges can vary from 10 100 km 2 smith and schaefer 2002 we also detected spatial auto correlation for martens further home range and movement studies may be needed to confirm our findings based on their distribution in these islands coyote and fox showed different patterns compare with studies on the mainland studies in canada on the interaction between coyotes and foxes showed that they typically partition through habitat use but this pattern depended heavily on prey abundance theberge and wedeles 1989 evidence also showed coyotes may aggressively kill red foxes gese et al 1996 the positive correlation between foxes and coyotes may suggest that foxes trade off predation risk for prey availability in a prey limited system mallinger et al 2021 given the relatively small scale of this island system the environment was rather homogeneous and the only environmental variation we were able to obtain was the distance to the mainland which is itself spatial the model has the ability to incorporate additional environmental variation but measurements were unavailable in the case study e g prey abundance habitat structure etc to better understand the system with the proposed model detailed environmental variables like prey biomass should be measured to further explain the positive correlation pattern further study should be conducted to further evaluate these spatial distributions 5 conclusion we implemented a mrf based multi specific occupancy model that can account for both spatial auto correlations and inter specific interactions simultaneously our model explicitly incorporates interaction terms between different species together with environmental predictors and spatial auto correlations our model parameters have clear interpretations as log odds of presence of one species at a site change when holding all other species sites occupancy constant which is not clear in some other types of multi species occupancy models for instance the centering term used in hepler et al 2018 made the coefficient of environment confounded by interactions while multinomial regression in rota et al 2016 had no explicit interaction term our model requires similar data as other types of occupancy models i e repeat detection history and a pre defined adjacency matrix of spatial autocorrelation our simulation showed the model should work well in a study from 10 10 100 sites to 25 25 625 sites for smaller grids we may lose some ability to identify spatial auto correlation by formulation the model can incorporate more species and a larger site number at the cost of computing time we demonstrate our technique in a case study on two pairs of presumably competing species of carnivores in the apostle island national lakeshore wisconsin usa we detected a partitioning pattern of fisher and marten occupancy which can be explained by a flipped source sink pattern in the islands however additional evidence from movement data or genetics might be needed to further confirm this observation we detected a positive association between coyote and fox which is different from studies on mainland systems and deserves further study credit authorship

24546,how species organize spatially is one of ecology s most motivating questions multiple theories have been advanced and various models developed to account for the environment interactions among species and spatial drivers however relative importance comparisons of explanatory phenomena generally are neglected in these analyses we developed a spatially explicit community occupancy model based on markov random fields that accounts for spatial auto correlation and interspecific interactions in occupancy while also accounting for interspecific interaction in detection simulations demonstrated that the model can distinguish different mechanisms of environmental sorting such as competition and spatial autocorrelation we applied our model to camera trap data from a fisher pekania pennanti marten martes americana and coyote canis latrans fox vulpes vulpes system in apostle island national lakeshore wisconsin usa model results indicated that the observed partitioning pattern between marten and fisher distributions could be explained best by a flipped mainland island source sink pattern rather than by competition for the coyote fox system we determined that in addition to a mainland island source sink pattern there was a positive association between fox and coyote that deserved further study our model could be readily applied to other landscapes island and non island systems enhancing our understanding of species coexistence patterns keywords species coexistence occupancy model markov random field fisher marten coyote red fox 1 introduction drivers of species distributions and community structures are among the most important questions in ecology classical theories include niche theory hutchinson 1957 and lotka volterra models lotka 1910 volterra 1928 these theories concentrated on interactions between species and their environments hereafter environment sorting where environmental filters select for species with certain characteristics and allow them to coexist and interaction among species hereafter interspecies interactions e g competition while generally ignoring the spatial arrangement of habitat patches in contrast macarthur and wilson 2001 emphasized the importance of random patch level colonization and extinction probabilities in forming species richness patterns this idea was further developed by hubbell s neutral theory on community assemblage hubbell 2001 see volkov et al 2003 for a review meta population modeling is another example of spatially explicit theory which emphasized the importance of dispersal hanski 1983 this paradigm emphasized the importance of geographic arrangement of habitat patches spatial processes e g spatial auto correlations in determining the distributions of species however recent research suggested that communities reflect both species and patch level drivers leibold et al 2004 extended meta population models to examine community assembly while accounting for spatial and natural history processes concurrently yet the relative importance of natural history processes environmental sorting and species interactions and spatial processes remained unclear in most communities and unaddressed in most analyses researchers have examined plant communities e g lasky et al 2017 marine systems e g shurin et al 2009 göthe et al 2013 meyer 2017 and microbial systems using separate spatial environmental and interspecific interactions in both experimental and natural communities see logue et al 2011 for a review these studies suggested that a gradient from almost fully spatial driven to almost fully environment interaction driven patterns in community assemblage it is a challenge to distinguish different drivers and evaluating the relative contribution of different drivers partially due to the lack of a statistical modeling framework that accounts for these processes in a unified and comparable manner markov random field model mrf defines joint distributions of sets of random variables linked by non directed graphics vanmarcke 2010 cressie 1992 mrf has long been used to model spatial correlations in ecology and agriculture e g in spatial ecology hughes et al 2011 hepler et al 2018 as well as temporal analysis zhu et al 2005 and interspecific interactions harris 2016 mrf was also widely used for modeling other types of networks west et al 2014 wei and li 2007 harris 2016 thus mrf based models could be used as the core framework for joint modeling of environmental interspecific interaction and spatial drivers in a unified way so that one could examine the effect of different drivers due to recent advancements in camera trap technology ecologists can deploy infra red triggered cameras taking photographs or videos of passing animals that generate vast quantities of detection non detection data to infer presence absence p a of moderate to large sized animals burton et al 2015 that can be analyzed using mrf models however imperfect detection i e false absence due to imperfect sampling remains a challenge kéry and schmidt 2008 occupancy modeling mackenzie et al 2003 addresses imperfect detection by modeling a detection process explicitly and estimating detection rates from repeated sampling following a basic framework of modeling occupancy and detection hierarchically one can build various occupancy like models based on the idea that observations are samples taken from detection distributions conditioned on unobserved latent true patterns that follow other characteristic distributions mrf models with imperfect observations were also explored in image reconstruction contexts chalmond 1989 ibáñez and simó 2003 to understand both environmental sorting and interspecific interactions researchers proposed the use of two kinds of multispecies occupancy models the occupancy model developed by rota et al 2016 used a multinomial logistic regression which estimated different predictors for different coexistence patterns while kéry and royle 2008 used a hierarchical structure to model species interactions that can be viewed as a bayes network koller and friedman 2009 these techniques facilitated research on the assembly of animal communities in island systems and other landscapes however neither kéry and royle 2008 nor koller and friedman 2009 can model interactions of species and spatial processes simultaneously and explicitly in order to understand their relative importance cottenie 2005 dray et al 2006 too many possible patterns make multi logistic modeling intractable as in rota et al 2016 and spatial autocorrelation cannot be represented using directed graphs as in kéry and royle 2008 while there might not exist a clear root or dominate species as required in kéry and schmidt 2008 our objective was to develop a model to capture spatial auto correlation and interspecific interactions while controlling for environmental predictors as a case study we applied this new model to identify the drivers of species distributions for pairs of closely competing carnivore species in the apostle islands national lakeshore apis wisconsin usa since the case study is an island system we also tested whether the distribution patterns followed a mainland island pattern or a stepping stone pattern notably island systems are a special case where spatial processes might play an outsize role despite this we intend for our model to be applicable to the island and non island systems we anticipate this method could be applied in any situation where researchers would like their models to explicitly account for predictors spatial auto correlation and interspecific interactions in a unified framework for instance a camera trap survey where the grid is small enough to impose spatial auto correlation 2 methods 2 1 study area apostle island national lake shore apis is located on the southwest shore of lake superior usa and lies in the transition zone between temperate and boreal forest regions apis is distinct from tropical islands where much research on community assembly has occurred because of severe winters 84 6 days for maximum and 185 4 days for minimum temperature below 0 c while 29 4 days minimum temperature below 17 8 c arguez et al 2010 and relatively low primary productivity average net primary productivity of 2015 is 8 23 1 0 3 kgc m 2 year running and zhao 2018 ten species of native carnivores were detected during 2014 2017 allen et al 2017 how these species coexist and how richness differs among islands is a fundamental question for understanding community dynamics in temperate island systems 2 2 camera trapping surveys during 2014 2017 apis staff and collaborators conducted camera trap surveys to determine distributions and relative abundances of mammals within the national lakeshore allen et al 2017 twenty one of 22 islands that make up the archipelago were surveyed using a 1 km 2 lattice grid sampling frame within each grid cell there was one camera trap scent lures were placed at half of the camera stations at deployment and rotated to the remaining stations during mid deployment camera checks since all islands could not be monitored at the same time though substantial overlap did occur we assume the underlying distribution of species did not change during the 3 year survey period we divided surveys into 60 day blocks to create repeat observations the model allowed us to incorporate predictors to account for differences in detection during periods however we were not able to obtain useful predictors for all periods and sites because of incomplete environmental data 2 3 hypothesis we focus on two pairs of plausibly competing species fisher pekania pennanti marten martes americana fisher marten system and coyote canis latrans red fox vulpes vulpes coyote fox system in apis 30 of sites had fisher detections also had marten detections and 15 of sites that had marten detections also had fisher detections 2014 2017 in contrast 64 of sites that had red fox detections also had coyote detections and 28 of sites that had coyote detections also had red fox detections fig 1 in niche based theories a partition pattern like fisher and marten could be understood as spatial niche partitioning due to competition while coexistence could be achieved by partitioning other niche dimensions such as time in these theories competition was a factor promoting the partition pattern in dispersal related theories species were more likely to exist close to the source of dispersing individuals which is usually a stable mainland population if species were independent they would coexist on islands closer to the mainland with a higher probability subject to dispersal capability since we observe a spatially partitioned pattern for fisher marten it may be explained by competition or different source sink dynamics spatial processes importantly we observed that marten tended to occur on more distant islands that might indicate a flipped mainland island pattern opposite the prediction of the mainland as the source for coyote and fox coexistence at islands closer to the mainland could be explained by dispersal from the mainland yet after accounting for such potential spatial processes we are interested also in determining if these two species associate or compete dominant competitor excludes sub dominant the environment across the islands is rather homogeneous thus we were unable to obtain useful environmental predictors hence the only environmental predictor considered here was the distance to the mainland negative exponential transformed which should be considered as part of a spatial process for the fisher marten system we pose two working hypotheses for the observed pattern 1 distribution of both species among the islands reflects similar mainland distance dependencies spatial effects while separation at the site level within the island is due to competition interaction effects 2 distribution of both species among the islands reflects differing mainland distance dependencies but shows minor within island competition at the site level for the coyote fox system we pose two working hypotheses for the observed pattern 1 distribution of both species in the islands reflects spatial drivers coexistence is facilitated by separation in time 2 trophic position and life history drives distribution foxes avoid coyotes at the site level while spatial effects at the island level are minor besides comparing strengths of different drivers we also sought to test whether the spatial auto correlation followed a mainland island model where there are no spatial auto correlations between sites on different islands while the distance to mainland played an important role or a stepping stone model where there are spatial auto correlations between sites on different islands that are close and mainland mainly affects the closest islands 2 4 spatial explicit community occupancy analysis using binary markov random field model the analysis was implemented in r r core team 2019 while the core algorithm to fit the proposed model was partially implemented in c with r interfaces using rcpp and rcpparmadillo eddelbuettel and sanderson 2014 eddelbuettel and françois 2011 implementations can be found on the author s github repository yunyishen isingoccu core we used an ising model ising 1925 a kind of markov random field mrf model whose responses are all binary to model the distribution of competing species in a spatially explicit manner coding of latent true occupancy status followed the convention in network science i e 1 for presence and 1 for absence this symmetric coding was more conventional in physics but less so in ecology models with a centering term mostly used in ecology enabled modeling of the large scale response due to environmental predictors centered auto logistic models hughes et al 2011 which tried to detect auto correlation in the residuals of a large scale response due to environmental drivers however theoretical studies with this model by wolters 2017 suggested better performance of a symmetrically coded model compare to a centered model when associations e g competition spatial autocorrelations were expected additionally centered models predicted non linear relationships between the strength of association and log odds of two species coexisting or co absenting while symmetrical coding did not have this problem further symmetrical coding avoided the cross product between different terms i e environment and species interactions in the negative potential function log probability mass function pmf up to a constant difference of this model koller and friedman 2009 which helped us evaluate relative contributions of different mechanisms most importantly parameters of a symmetrical coding model had better conditional interpretation e g regression coefficient β s interaction terms γ s and auto correlation strength parameters η s which are the conditional log odds of presence given all other sites and species while other multi species spatial explicit frameworks e g rota et al 2016 hughes et al 2011 do not have this clear interpretation this property was important in understanding the strength of different mechanisms since interactions should be conditioning on environments while the reaction to the environment should also be conditioning on interactions e g blanchet et al 2020 argument 2 for instance to make comparisons between environmental sorting spatial processes and interspecific interactions as drivers of species spatial distributions three components were considered simultaneously but separately in the graph associated with the joint distribution 1 a linear predictor calculated from environmental covariates 2 a nearest neighborhood spatial autocorrelation at camera site level site level hereafter hepler et al 2018 within and among islands and 3 local species associations at the site level we assume that partial associations reflect interactions similar to harris 2016 we denote the design matrix for environmental covariates as x assumed fully known and of full column rank and responses of certain species k k 1 2 w to environment x as β k further in this case study due to the different nature of site linkages within and across islands inter island and intra island correlations were modeled separately we denote the strength parameters of these two correlations as η e x and η i n and known adjacency matrix d e x d i n eq 1 mainland island with linkage matrix d m l shares the same strength of inter island spatial autocorrelation in this study we denote the presence and absence vector of species k on the landscape as z k we denote the transpose of z k as z k t thus the joint distribution of all species at all sites has the form 1 p z 1 z w θ exp k 1 w x β k t z k η k e x z k t d m l 1 2 η k i n z k t d i n z k 1 2 η k e x z k t d e x z k l k γ l k z k t z l for the detailed meaning of parameters see table 1 we use θ as an abbreviation of all parameters in a conditional probability note that the first term accounts for an environment response mainland island effect the second account for mainland island processes as a special environment predictor mainland island spatial effect the third term accounts for intra island spatial auto correlations spatial effect the fourth term accounts for inter island spatial auto correlations and can be other types of auto correlations and the last term accounts for all inter specific interactions between species k and species l while γ l k is the strength of association between the two species in the mainland island setting we assumed that there was no inter island spatial autocorrelation so d e x has all 0 as its entries 2 5 accounting for imperfect detection and short term interactions following the logic of occupancy like modeling mackenzie et al 2003 we modeled observed detection non detection as repeated samples from a detection process associations in short term detection can also be informative about species interaction we further assumed that the interspecific interactions are local i e no spatial autocorrelations considered in the detection process we used another binary mrf ising model conditioned on the occupancy status of a species to model the detection process in total there were two binary mrf models 1 latent occupancy and 2 detection conditioned on occupancy only species occupying a certain site were included in the detection mrf and species not occupying had a probability of non detection of 1 formally we denote y k i j as species k s detection status at site i during period j the detection model also included environmental predictors of each site for a detection period with the design matrix denoted by x i j d e t assumed fully known and of full column rank with the regression coefficient of species k in detection part β k d e t the likelihood function at site i and detection repeat j is given by eq 2 2 p y 1 i j y 2 i j z 1 i z 2 i θ e x p k 1 w x i j d e t β k d e t y k i j i z k i 1 l k γ l k d e t y k i j y l i j i z k i 1 i z l i 1 we used θ as an abbreviation of all other parameters in the conditional probability i is the indicator function and i z l i 1 1 only if z l i 1 and i z l i 1 0 otherwise the indicator function knocks out the species from detection interaction if it was not occupying that site the reasoning behind this knocking out was that we assumed that non detection was caused by the absence of a species and thus should be understood as a do calculus pearl 1995 rather than conditioning unlike the occupancy part this conditional likelihood function is tractable for a reasonable number of species e g 10 because of the relatively small size of the underlying graph the joint likelihood function of the whole detection history conditioned on occupancy was the product of each site and detection period the joint unnormalized likelihood function of observed detection data then could be calculated by multiplying eqs 1 and 2 the latent z s could be estimated similarly with unknown parameters priors were set to be vague normal distributions due to the relatively small number of repeats and lack of environmental variation in our apis case study we put a normal prior with variance 0 1 on intercept of detection 0 95 hdr for detection rate 0 22 0 78 as part of our assumptions again this was not necessary for the model per se as seen in simulation but part of the case study sensitivity analysis on this part was also conducted posterior distributions were simulated through a markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm hastings 1970 that is often used in complex ecologically modeling rempel 2011 boulange et al 2017 to overcome the double intractable nature of the posterior murray et al 2012 møller et al 2006 we followed the single parameter change method proposed by murray et al 2012 we calculated a p value level that credible interval ci spans 0 a full description of the algorithm used is in appendix s2 diagnostic evaluation of mcmc results were done using r package coda plummer et al 2006 see fig 2 2 6 selection between stepping stone and mainland island model we compared two general models for spatial auto correlation between islands in this study 1 a stepping stone model assumed that sites at the edge of an island can be neighbors to sites on another island in a mrf sense we assign this linkage using delaunay triangulation okabe et al 2009 fig s1 the strength of correlation was assumed to decay exponentially through the normalized distance shurin et al 2009 sites on the closest islands have linkage to the mainland and the log odds of having species occupying such sites decay exponentially through the normalized distance to the mainland shurin et al 2009 2 a mainland island model assumed that sites on different islands were conditionally independent given their distance to the mainland the log odds of having species occupying a site decayed exponentially through the normalized distance to the mainland shurin et al 2009 bayes factor bf a bayesian generalization of a likelihood ratio test was used for model selection gelman et al 2013 we assumed the two models were equally plausible and thus the bayes factor can be understood as the ratio between the posterior probabilities of the two models we can calculate the posterior predictive distribution of data following raftery et al 2006 one obstacle to using bf in this analysis is the intractable likelihood function preventing us from directly calculating the predictive probability of each model by calculating the likelihood function during the posterior sampling however we could follow descombes et al 1999 in calculating the likelihood function by sampling augmentation variables appendix s2 since the ratio is also estimated robustness diagnostics followed descombes et al 1999 2 7 evaluating contribution of different drivers different processes can drive the degree of spatial partitioning among species e g environmental sorting can promote coexistence when species need similar resources grinnell 1917 saporetti junior et al 2012 while competition promotes partitioning tilman 1985 gastauer and meira neto 2014 compared with the strength and direction of each process a different question was which driver makes the observed pattern likely for instance is it possible that while species a and b compete we observe that they still coexist because of environmental sorting in this case we may argue that environmental sorting had a larger contribution to the observed coexistence pattern we used negative potential functions a k a hamiltonian functions in our specific setting from cipra 1987 eqn 1 1 osogami 2017 pfeuty 1970 as statistics to evaluate the contributions of each driver on the observed pattern since drivers were modeled explicitly in the proposed model in our setting the hamiltonian function was the log of the right hand side of eq 1 these types of statistics were used to quantify fitness landscapes of amino acid interactions in protein systems levy et al 2017 shekhar et al 2013 ferguson et al 2013 morcos et al 2014 with many other applications in quantifying the stability of interactions ezaki et al 2017 becker and karplus 1997 cipra 1987 statistically a negative potential function can be viewed as a fitness score defined by log probability mass function pmf up to a constant difference patterns with higher scores had higher probabilities of occurrence levy et al 2017 in model specifications we used several distinct terms to account for different ecological processes and we used the score of each of the terms to evaluate the relative contribution of each process to the observed pattern for instance γ l k z k t z l is the score for interspecific interaction between species l and k where γ l k is the strength of the interaction and z k is the vector of the occupancy of species k the score is an accumulated strength through occupancy note the score assesses the probability mass of the observed pattern i e a high positive contribution to the negative potential function means the corresponding term made the probability mass on the observed pattern high the question to be answered here is whether a certain process e g spatial had a large contribution to the observed pattern as we argued above the strength of a process is different from its contribution to the observed pattern a different aspect of the hypothesis posterior distributions for different terms of negative potential functions were calculated using posterior samples of latent occupancy status and model parameters 2 8 simulations we conducted simulations using the same spatial arrangement of apis camera trapping grids as well as regular 10 10 i e 10 rows and 10 columns of sites 15 15 20 20 and 25 25 grids on apis camera grids we tested three mechanisms 1 competition 2 non interaction and 3 sorting in competition simulations two species had the same reaction to the environment or distance to the mainland for apis and a negative association in no interaction simulations two species had opposing reactions to the environment or distance to the mainland represent niche difference flipped source sink and no association in sorting simulation two species had the same but relatively weak reaction to the environment or mainland distance and a positive association there were spatial auto correlations on all mechanisms on regular grids we tested two species on a random draw landscape with one environmental predictor note that we did not randomize this environment while on apis we used distance to the mainland as the predictor since there was a lack of environmental variation for detailed simulation settings see table s1 and table s2 in simulations all parameters had vague priors 2 9 posterior predictive checks to check for systematic discrepancies between data and model predictions we performed posterior predictive checks gelman et al 1996 lynch and western 2004 gelman et al 2013 using 6 metrics for the apis case study they were 1 frequency of detection for fisher and marten and 2 frequency of detection for coyote and fox this represented how often we see the species 3 proportion of sites that had at least one detection for fisher and marten or 4 for coyote and fox this represented the naive occupancy rate of 4 species 5 correlations between naive occupancy in each system fisher marten or coyote fox in which naive occupancy was 1 if species were ever seen at that site and 1 otherwise 6 count of sites that had both species from either of our species systems detected in total 2000 posterior predictive detection histories with the same time frame as the original apis data were sampled and posterior predictive p values for each statistic were calculated small p values indicated variations the model failed to capture 3 results 3 1 simulations we evaluated differences between posterior median estimates and true parameter values in 100 simulated datasets fig 3 in all cases the middle 50 quantile contained 0 suggesting that we generally could recover parameter values using regression models however we were conservative regarding spatial auto correlations posterior medians were less than true parameter values in some cases due to relatively a small number of grids as also shown in hughes et al 2011 when there are no repeats i e we have only one occupancy sample we could reduce the uncertainty on spatial auto correlation strength by having larger grids 3 2 fisher marten system a total of 3 1 0 6 samples were drawn after 5 1 0 4 burn in and thinned by 300 diagnostics of mcmc showed sufficient mixing of the chains fig s2 suggesting that the mcmc algorithm can approximate the posterior distribution of parameters log10 bayes factors for mainland island models and stepping stone models were estimated to be 4 26 i e the posterior probability of mainland island model was 1 0 4 higher than the posterior probability of stepping stone model hence data decisively supports mainland island rather than the stepping stone model following the recommended cutoff of 2 kass and raftery 1995 this result suggested that the spatial pattern of the system can be explained better by a mainland island model rather than a stepping stone model further analysis was based on the mainland island model table 2 shows posterior estimates of model parameters of interest for the mainland island model of the fisher marten system we detected a significant positive distance dependency positive means a higher chance of occupying a closer island here because the distance is negative exponentially transformed in fisher η e x 2 479 c i 0 976 4 744 and a negative distance dependency in marten occupancy η e x 0 789 c i 1 907 0 0558 however we did not detect a significant association between these species in either occupancy or detection c i 0 215 0 393 0 326 0 322 marten showed an intra island spatial auto correlation 0 260 c i 0 0551 0 444 this result supported the second hypothesis that fisher and marten had a flipped mainland island pattern whereby fisher had a higher chance of occupying closer islands while martens had a higher probability of occupying more remote islands independently of possible competition as discussed in our methods the strength of a certain factor is a different question compared to the contribution of the factor posterior distributions of negative potential functions in the fisher marten system suggested that association is weak and had no significant contribution to the observed distribution pattern of fisher and marten the fisher marten system seemed to be dispersal environment driven for fisher while both dispersal environment and intra island spatial auto correlation had similar levels of contribution for marten fig 4 hence competition is weak and had a minor contribution to the observed marten pattern which indicated a flipped mainland island hypothesis where the mainland functions as a sink rather than a source posterior predictive checking showed all 6 p values were greater than 0 05 indicating no systematic discrepancies between data and model predictions which suggested fitness of the fitted model fig 5 3 3 coyote fox system log10 bayes factors log posterior odds of two models for mainland island and stepping stone models were estimated to be 18 3 i e the posterior probability of mainland island model was 1 0 18 higher than the posterior probability of stepping stone model hence data decisively supported the mainland island rather than the stepping stone model following the recommended cutoff of 2 kass and raftery 1995 this result suggested that the spatial pattern of the system can be explained better by a mainland island model rather than a stepping stone model further analysis was based on the mainland island model posterior estimates of model parameters table 3 indicated a significant positive distance dependency in fox but not coyote coyote η e x 0 552 c i 0 378 1 69 fox η e x 2 41 c i 0 428 6 30 table 3 meanwhile posterior association in occupancy was estimated as positive but only weakly significant γ o c 0 234 c i 0 041 0 53 the posterior probability of this parameter being positive was p γ o c 0 d a t a 0 95 suggesting that despite dispersal environment drivers there may be evidence of a positive association between two species at grid level that needs further evaluation these findings supported the hypothesis that the coyote fox system might not be fully explained by spatial factors and require further evaluation notably we detected a significant positive association in detections γ d e t 0 427 c i 0 211 0 646 which might suggest a behavioral association similar to the fisher marten system dispersal environment also had the largest contribution to the observed pattern in the coyote fox system fig 6 however in contrast with fisher marten both spatial auto correlation and interspecific interaction seemed to have some importance fig 6 as also suggested by the hypothesis that associations exist that are additive to spatial drivers posterior predictive checking showed all 6 p values were greater than 0 05 thus no systematic discrepancies between data and model predictions which suggested the fitness of the fitted model fig 7 4 discussion we developed and tested a mrf based multispecies spatially explicit occupancy model which allowed the evaluation of relative contributions of spatial auto correlations and life history mechanisms in influencing the coexistence pattern of species our model enables ecologists who conduct research on community structure to consider spatial and life history drivers jointly and explicitly though the model assumed patterns remain constant through time single season extending it to a multiseason analysis is straightforward for instance within our proposed model framework one could define sites as spatial sites at a certain time then by applying an adequate adjacency matrix e g d e x so that only the individual spatial sites at adjacent season were connected by doing this one can incorporate temporal auto correlations similar to spatial auto correlations given we can have two or more sources of auto correlation in the proposed framework similar comparisons of the strength and contribution can carry through in a multiseason analysis another way of viewing this is by viewing season as temporal islands and we can have a stepping stone model on time to incorporate extinction and colonization one could use the dynamic ising model as the core nguyen et al 2017 in the place of the static ising model used here compared with bayesian network based multispecies frameworks proposed by kéry and royle 2008 our method did not ask for a species to be the root of the network and allowed cycles in the network moreover analysts can condition occupancy on another species to accommodate a single dominant competitor compared with rota et al 2016 our method had a better interpretation especially when a species network was large since in our method the interaction between species was modeled explicitly by auto regression terms neither kéry and royle 2008 nor rota et al 2016 were spatially explicit partly because the graph represented the spatial correlation it had no natural direction and could not be represented by a directed graph like kéry and royle 2008 did for species also when the number of potential outcomes was too large one cannot assign unique linear predictors for each pattern as in rota et al 2016 markov random field modeling was used in quantifying interspecific interactions in harris 2016 and can help identify interactions between species when controlling for the environment and other confounding interactions e g apparent competition where a b both interact with c while no interaction occurs between a and b blanchet et al 2020 again though our case study is an island system the model is not specific to island systems and the case study did not demonstrate the full potential of the model and software we built e g our method also allows for the inclusion of predictors in detection since the explicit terms of environmental predictors spatial auto correlations of different types and interspecific interactions can all be realized with this method one could apply this model to any system where these drivers should be considered and compared in a unified way for instance habitat patches or camera trap survey grids our results on two pairs of plausibly competing species as components of the meso carnivore community also showed that community structure reflected drivers associated with two broad theoretical paradigms first we detected positive intra island spatial autocorrelation for 2 species out of 4 this spatial autocorrelation term makes sites no longer exchangeable even when the distance to the mainland was controlled spatial autocorrelation also had different strengths for the four species considered which means species were not exchangeable even when considering spatial processes coyotes and foxes had different strengths of dependence on mainland distance likely due to different dispersal ability i e coyotes which are larger likely can disperse farther than foxes and thus have weaker distance dependency we detected an unexpected opposite direction of mainland distance dependency on the occupancy of marten the fisher marten system provides a possible example where the mainland serves as a sink rather than a source for a species from a metapopulation point of view this spatial pattern was recently identified independently for martens using genetic analysis smith et al 2021 a more general meta community framework should be used when considering island or island like systems if two species follow similar dispersal patterns but need to partition spatially we should expect closer islands to be more likely occupied by one of the species than the further islands and partitioning should happen on islands with similar nearby distances to the mainland i e perpendicular to the mainland island dispersion direction however we observed similar levels of co absence on islands regardless of their distances to the mainland i e martens were not occupying nearby islands regardless of fisher presence meanwhile the partitioning of fisher and marten happened in parallel distance dependency rather than independently of distance i e competition to the mainland island dispersal direction which was different from what we would expect based on hypothesis 1 i e distance dependency with competition we did not observe fisher and marten occupying sites closer to the mainland or partitioning at the site level the fisher marten system appeared to better conform to hypothesis 2 because fisher dispersal direction appeared to be from the mainland to the islands while marten dispersal appeared to be from the islands to the mainland however these results were solely from distribution data and additional evidence from genetics e g smith et al 2021 movement data or behavior etc would be needed to further support this argument for the coyote fox system we observed that spatial auto correlation had a strong influence on coyote distribution this may be due to the relatively small size of the islands compared to coyote home ranges typical coyote home ranges were 10 km 2 mills and knowlton 1991 hibler 1977 which is approximately the size of the largest islands in apis home range size reported for red fox was smaller and in 1 10 km 2 scale ables 1969 dekker et al 2001 trewhella et al 1988 and was smaller in size than some individual islands in apis together with mainland distance dependency spatial correlation patterns of coyote and fox were consistent with our knowledge of their movement ability i e coyotes have stronger dispersal ability and larger home ranges thus weaker distance dependency and stronger intra island spatial autocorrelation compared with foxes patterns of coyotes and foxes demonstrate that species are not interchangeable island biogeography theory and that distance dependency is modified by life history characteristics the fisher marten system also had a spatial auto correlation effect furnas et al 2017 reported a meta analysis on home range sizes in california usa their results showed that home ranges of female fishers varied and were approximately 6 km 2 within 20 km of the coast while approximately 13 km 2 at 120 km from the coast male fishers had home range sizes that varied from 12 km 2 at 20 km to approximately 27 km 2 at 120 km to the coast we did not detect strong intra island spatial autocorrelation in fishers which may indicate a relatively small home range for these animals on islands compared to other studies which was consistent with prior knowledge that fisher home ranges decline when close to coasts powell 1982 yaeger 2005 studies of marten home ranges in canada indicated their home ranges can vary from 10 100 km 2 smith and schaefer 2002 we also detected spatial auto correlation for martens further home range and movement studies may be needed to confirm our findings based on their distribution in these islands coyote and fox showed different patterns compare with studies on the mainland studies in canada on the interaction between coyotes and foxes showed that they typically partition through habitat use but this pattern depended heavily on prey abundance theberge and wedeles 1989 evidence also showed coyotes may aggressively kill red foxes gese et al 1996 the positive correlation between foxes and coyotes may suggest that foxes trade off predation risk for prey availability in a prey limited system mallinger et al 2021 given the relatively small scale of this island system the environment was rather homogeneous and the only environmental variation we were able to obtain was the distance to the mainland which is itself spatial the model has the ability to incorporate additional environmental variation but measurements were unavailable in the case study e g prey abundance habitat structure etc to better understand the system with the proposed model detailed environmental variables like prey biomass should be measured to further explain the positive correlation pattern further study should be conducted to further evaluate these spatial distributions 5 conclusion we implemented a mrf based multi specific occupancy model that can account for both spatial auto correlations and inter specific interactions simultaneously our model explicitly incorporates interaction terms between different species together with environmental predictors and spatial auto correlations our model parameters have clear interpretations as log odds of presence of one species at a site change when holding all other species sites occupancy constant which is not clear in some other types of multi species occupancy models for instance the centering term used in hepler et al 2018 made the coefficient of environment confounded by interactions while multinomial regression in rota et al 2016 had no explicit interaction term our model requires similar data as other types of occupancy models i e repeat detection history and a pre defined adjacency matrix of spatial autocorrelation our simulation showed the model should work well in a study from 10 10 100 sites to 25 25 625 sites for smaller grids we may lose some ability to identify spatial auto correlation by formulation the model can incorporate more species and a larger site number at the cost of computing time we demonstrate our technique in a case study on two pairs of presumably competing species of carnivores in the apostle island national lakeshore wisconsin usa we detected a partitioning pattern of fisher and marten occupancy which can be explained by a flipped source sink pattern in the islands however additional evidence from movement data or genetics might be needed to further confirm this observation we detected a positive association between coyote and fox which is different from studies on mainland systems and deserves further study credit authorship

24547,the ecological importance of mixoplankton within marine protist communities is slowly being recognized however most aquatic ecosystem models do not include formulations to model a complete protist community consisting of phytoplankton protozooplankton and mixoplankton we introduce protist a new module for the aquatic ecosystem modelling software delft3d waq that can model a protist community consisting of two types of phytoplankton diatoms and green algae two types of mixoplankton constitutive mixoplankton and non constitutive mixoplankton and protozooplankton we employed protist to further explore the hypothesis that the biogeochemical gradient of inorganic nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations drives the observed occurrence of constitutive mixoplankton in the dutch southern north sea to explore this hypothesis we used 11 1d vertical aquatic ecosystem models that mimic the abiotic conditions of 11 routine monitoring locations in the dutch southern north sea our models result in plausible trophic compositions across the biogeochemical gradient as compared to in situ data a sensitivity analysis showed that the dissolved inorganic phosphate and silica concentrations drive the occurrence of constitutive mixoplankton in the dutch southern north sea keywords mixoplankton trophic modes aquatic ecosystem model north sea biogeochemical gradient delft3d waq 1 introduction the trophic mode of marine protists is an important functional trait with which to characterize protists mitra et al 2016 flynn et al 2019 classified marine protists into three categories based on their trophic mode phytoplankton protozooplankton and mixoplankton phytoplankton such as diatoms and green algae phototrophic non diatoms are defined as protists that can only utilize the photo osmotrophic pathways they cover their energy requirements through the photosynthetic fixation of inorganic carbon and their nutrient requirements through the uptake of dissolved inorganic nutrients protozooplankton are defined as protists that can only utilize the phagotrophic pathways they cover their energy and nutrient requirements through the assimilation of prey in contrast to phytoplankton and protozooplankton mixoplankton can utilize the photo osmo and phagotrophic pathways simultaneously flynn et al 2019 they can be divided into constitutive mixoplankton cm and non constitutive mixoplankton ncm mitra et al 2016 cms have the constitutive ability to perform photosynthesis and they can uptake dissolved inorganic nutrients as well as assimilate prey ncms need to acquire the photosynthetic machinery from their prey they cover their nutrient requirements mainly through the assimilation of prey stoecker et al 2017 the composition and productivity of protist communities is an interplay between external resource availability such as nutrients light and prey and the protists physiologies while the importance of phytoplankton as the base of marine ecosystems and protozooplankton as trophic transfers has long been recognized the ecological relevance of mixoplankton has long been ignored flynn et al 2013 however mixoplankton contribute notably to marine protist communities worldwide leles et al 2017 2018 faure et al 2019 change the inorganic nutrient and predation dynamics hansen et al 2019 and have a non negligible impact on the carbon cycle worden et al 2015 furthermore mixoplankton are an important connector between microbial protist and mesozooplankton food webs stoecker et al 2017 and they play an important role in ecosystems governed by strong light and nutrient gradients selosse et al 2017 in a recent analysis of routine monitoring data on the protist community of the dutch southern north sea from here on referred to as the southern north sea sns schneider et al 2020 showed that cms occur mostly in inorganic nutrient depleted highly transparent stratified environments eutrophied turbid mixed environments were devoid of cms schneider et al 2020 hypothesized that the environmental factors which exhibit a biogeochemical gradient drive the trophic composition of protist communities in the sns however schneider et al 2020 were not able to elucidate which environmental factor the dissolved inorganic nutrient or the suspended sediment gradient governed the occurrence of cms while routine monitoring data allows us to gain insight on protist communities in different environments it is difficult to test causalities between separate abiotic factors and the community composition using field data aquatic ecosystem models aem provide a tool to estimate the impact of external or internal forcing on aquatic ecosystem dynamics i e janssen et al 2015 aems are able to depict various aquatic processes such as primary production secondary grazing remineralization or denitrification however most aems still do not include adequate formulations for mixoplankton flynn et al 2019 to help close this gap we implemented a new module that includes formulations to model a protist community consisting of diatoms green algae protozooplankton cms and ncms in the open source aem delft3d waq this new module is called protist and can be used to model the primary production of as well as the competition and grazing within the protist community we validated protist using 11 1d vertical 1d v models that mimic 11 routine monitoring location classes located in the estuaries coasts and offshore regions of the dutch sns schneider et al 2020 the 11 1d v models were forced with timeseries of inorganic nutrients and suspended sediments sampled at the 11 location classes thus we were able to quantitatively and qualitatively validate protist across the biogeochemical gradient of the sns using timeseries comparisons target diagrams and heatmaps using the 11 1d v models we were also able to further explore the hypothesis put forward by schneider et al 2020 that the biogeochemical gradient drives the trophic composition of protist communities we conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the inorganic nutrients or the suspended sediment concentration has more effect on the occurrence of cms especially against the background of climate change wilken et al 2013 and anthropogenic changes to marine environments burkhard et al 2011 it is important to acquire more knowledge about the abiotic drivers of protist community compositions in summary the objectives of this study are 1 to introduce the module protist 2 to quantitatively and qualitatively validate protist against routine monitoring data and 3 to further explore the hypothesis that the biogeochemical gradient drives the trophic composition of protist communities 2 material and methods 2 1 the module protist the module protist simulates the growth and mortality of the protist community while taking the trophic modes of protists into account protist can thus be used to simulate primary production in marine ecosystems the module protist combines model equations from flynn 2001 flynn and mitra 2009 and flynn 2021 these equations are based on first principles that were implemented unchanged in protist firstly the growth of protists is not only determined by the external availability of resources such as light nutrients and prey but also by the protists internal stoichiometry the internal nutrient quotas of the protists regulate the protists affinity to uptake nutrients grover 1991 synthesize chlorophyll a davey et al 2008 and assimilate prey mitra and flynn 2005 secondly the trophic modes of protists determine the interactions within protist communities flynn et al 2019 however some changes were needed for the equations to run stably and efficiently as a delft3d waq module the nutrient uptake equations were described using continuous functions instead of coupled conditional statements as in flynn 2021 the uptake of dissolved amino acids was not implemented as delft3d waq does not simulate dissolved amino acids explicitly due to the lack of validation data the assimilation of dissolved organic carbon was not implemented as all protist functional types pft can assimilate dissolved organic carbon doc stoecker et al 2017 so it is not a distinguishing pathway between the pfts protist enables multiple pfts to interact with compete against and graze on each other protist consists of five different pfts and each pft consists of state variables sv that describe carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p biomass chlorophyll a chl is an additional sv for phototrophic protists diatoms contain an additional sv to describe the silica si content this makes protist fully stoichiometrically variable the pfts require either light and or prey and or nutrients fig 1 visualizes the svs

equations are listed in appendix a 6 2 3 1 cellular status for each pft the cellular quota the maximum growth rate the mortality rate the basal respiration rate the total respiration rate the carbon specific growth rate as well as the cellular nutrient status of nitrogen phosphate and silica needs to be calculated table a 12 summarizes the description of the auxiliaries and appendix a 6 2 provides the detailed mathematical equations the cellular quotas n c p c s c describe the ratio of the respective protist nutrient svs to the protist carbon svs according to droop 1974 the maximum growth rate u m t as well as the mortality rate m r t are calculated using the q10 approach van t hoff 1884 the basal respiration rate b r is defined as a fraction of maximum growth rate geider and osborne 1989 the total respiration is the sum of the metabolic cost r e d c o of nitrate reduction u p no 3 flynn and flynn 1998 the anabolic cost a r of nitrogen utilization u p nh 4 a s s n wirtz and pahlow 2010 the foraging costs for prey s d a a s s c pahlow and prowe 2010 and the basal respiration b r geider and osborne 1989 furthermore the nutrient status for nitrogen n c u phosphate p c u and silica s c u only for diatoms is calculated the nutrient status returns values between 0 severely deprived of the respective nutrient and 1 at the optimal nutrient quota the form of the functions depends on the protist s physiology to store the respective nutrient see fig 2 as protist cells store nitrogen in a form that is not physiologically active andersen et al 1991 the nutrient status for nitrogen n c u see fig 2 a is a linear function between the minimum and maximum quota the nutrient status for phosphate p c u see fig 2 b is calculated using a sigmoidal function to mimic the storage of phosphate as polyphosphate within the cell lin et al 2016 the cellular status of silica s c u see fig 2 c is a function of the external silica availability as incorporated silica is not accessible by the cells anymore martin jézéquel et al 2003 applying liebig s law of minimum liebig 1840 the limiting nutrient n p c u or n p s i c u for diatoms is determined by the minimum nutrient status within the cell to ensure that the nitrogen carbon and phosphate carbon quotas do not exceed the maximum nutrient quota between time steps cellular nitrogen and phosphate is voided as soon as the cellular nutrient quota exceeds the maximum nutrient quota n o u t and p o u t this does not occur for silica as incorporated silica cannot be dispelled from the cell walls of diatoms martin jézéquel et al 2003 if the nitrogen carbon quota falls below the minimum nitrogen carbon quota then carbon is voided c v o i d 2 3 2 uptake in general the uptake of dissolved inorganic nutrients u p nh 4 u p no 3 u p p u p si is a combination of the external availability of the nutrients and the acquisition capability which depends on the internal nutrient status grover 1991 moreno and martiny 2018 this is achieved by enhancing or repressing the optimal nutrient uptake via sigmoidal functions see fig 3 table a 13 summarizes the description of the auxiliaries and appendix a 6 3 provides the detailed mathematical equations the nutrient uptake at the optimal nutrient quota is regulated via the michaelis menten function and scaled to the maximum growth rate and the optimal nutrient carbon quota for the uptake of nh 4 and no 3 the optimum nutrient uptake is also scaled to the relative growth feasible with the respective nutrient if the cellular nutrient quota is below the optimum nutrient quota i e nutrient stressed the nutrient uptake is enhanced until the maximum nutrient uptake is reached goldman and glibert 1982 perry 1976 if the cellular nutrient quota is above the optimum nutrient quota the nutrient uptake for nh 4 and po 4 3 are repressed wirtz and pahlow 2010 while the nutrient uptake for no 3 dugdale et al 2007 domingues et al 2011 and silica are stopped all together furthermore the uptake of nitrogen is a function of the cellular phosphate carbon quota resulting in a decrease of the cellular nitrogen carbon quota during phosphate stress pahlow and oschlies 2009 2 3 3 phototrophy the photosynthesis equations are based on the photosynthesis irradiance curve that requires three input parameters the maximum photosynthetic rate p s q m the chlorophyll a specific initial slope α c h l and photon flux density p f d jassby and platt 1976 table a 14 summarizes the description of the auxiliaries and appendix a 6 4 provides the detailed mathematical equations the maximum rate of photosynthesis covers the basal respiration b r the maximum growth rate u m t the leakage of photosynthate as doc p s d o c thornton 2014 and the costs of reducing nitrate r e d c o and a r dugdale et al 2007 which with the exception of basal respiration are all influenced by the nitrogen quota of the cell n c u droop 1974 thornton 2014 flynn and flynn 1998 furthermore the maximum rate of photosynthesis depends on the organism s physiology i e their capability to overcompensate the photosynthetic rate r e l p s geider 1993 the maximum photosynthetic rate along with the initial slope α c h l and the photon flux density p f d are used to calculate gross photosynthesis c f i x using the smith equation smith 1936 the net photosynthesis rate n e t p s is determined by subtracting the loss through leakage c l e a k primarily phototrophic organisms such as diatoms green algae and cms can regulate their chlorophyll a synthesis s y n c h l see fig 4 a geider and piatt 1986 if the cell is nutrient limited or the cell fixed too much carbon the synthesis of chlorophyll a is repressed moreno and martiny 2018 under low light the synthesis of chlorophyll a is enhanced sukenik et al 1987 chlorophyll a is also decomposed with a linear relationship to the nitrogen status d e g c h l wirtz and pahlow 2010 primarily phagotrophic organisms such as ncms cannot produce their own chloroplasts so they acquire them from prey u p c h l this acquisition is limited by a maximum chlorophyll a carbon quota via a sigmoidal function see fig 4 b those acquired chloroplasts are subsequently lost at a fixed linear rate l o s s c h l ghyoot et al 2017 2 3 4 phagotrophy the phagotrophic functions can be divided into four subsections determining the prey capture determining the prey quality determining the predator ingestion rate and determining the predator assimilation rate table a 15 summarizes the description of the auxiliaries and appendix a 6 5 provides the detailed mathematical equations the prey capture depends on the motility of predator and prey as well as the density of the prey the motility m o t is derived from a linear regression by flynn and mitra 2016 that uses the organisms equivalent spherical diameter as an input the density of the prey n r p r e y is calculated from the cellular carbon content c c e l l and the current carbon protist state variable p r o t c the motility of predator and prey as well as the density of prey are input parameters to determine the encounter rate e n c according to the empirical rothschild equation rothschild and osborn 1988 this encounter rate multiplied with the optimum capture rate o p t c r of the predator and the predator specific prey handling index p r determines the amount of specific prey the predator can capture this is summed over all prey items s u m c p as mixoplankton do not have the same capacity to ingest prey in the dark as in light skovgaard 1996 anderson et al 2018 a light dependent inhibition curve i n h l i g h t sigmoidal curve is multiplied with the encounter rate and limits the capture of prey depending on the light availability the light dependent inhibition curve takes the photon flux density as well as the parameter r e l p h a g fraction of prey that can be ingested in the dark as input the prey quality determines the assimilation efficiency o p a e of the predator a decrease in prey quality leads to a decrease in assimilation efficiency elser et al 2000 the nutrient quota of the captured prey is compared against the nutrient quota of the predator this returns a value between minimum a e o and the maximum assimilation efficiency a e m see solid black line in fig 5 the predator ingestion rate i n g c see fig 5 at very low prey densities is limited by the amount of prey s u m c p that can be captured and at very high prey densities by the predator s satiation i n g s a t flynn and mitra 2016 this satiation ingestion rate is calculated using a holling type ii curve holling 1959 scaled to its maximum ingestion rate m a x i n g the maximum ingestion covers the maximum growth rate and basal respiration rate taking the quality of the captured prey into account the ingestion of the other prey nutrients i n g n i n g p is referenced to the carbon ingestion and the prey nutrient quota the predator assimilation rate a s s c is determined by taking the carbon specific ingestion rate and limiting it to the assimilation efficiency the assimilation of the other prey nutrients a s s n a s s p is referenced to the carbon assimilation and the optimum predator nutrient quota non assimilated prey is voided as particulate organics i e p o c o u t p o n o u t and p o p o u t 2 4 aem application the module protist was implemented in the software delft3d waq delft3d waq solves the advection diffusion reaction equation on a predefined grid and is part of the open source modelling suite delft 3d maintained by deltares deltares 2020 the aem of this study employs established delft3d waq modules to simulate nutrients nh 4 no 3 po 4 3 and si organic matter i e particulate organic nitrogen pon phosphate pop and carbon poc as well as opal dissolved oxygen solar radiation and suspended sediment the modules compute the settling of organic matter the decomposition of organic matter the dissolution of silica nitrification and denitrification the extinction of light as well as the reaeration of the water column for more information on those modules the authors refer to blauw et al 2009 to simulate primary production this aem employs protist although the aim was to run the aem with all five pfts it was difficult to parameterize ncms for this aem application using literature and data based knowledge unfortunately ncms are not sampled in the routine monitoring program of the sns schneider et al 2020 so there is a lack of knowledge about the distribution of ncms in the sns furthermore there is still a lack of physiological understanding of ncms hansen et al 2019 so for this aem we were only able to simulate four pfts diatom green protozooplankton and cm however using a steady state box model we successfully demonstrated growth and competition between the five pfts in a simplified idealized environment for more details on this technical test the authors refer to appendix d 2 4 1 model domain the sns was chosen as a model domain as it is a well monitored shelf sea that covers strong abiotic gradients abiotic and biotic parameters are routinely monitored at 11 location classes by the rijkswaterstaat monitoring program dutch directorate general for public works and water management schneider et al 2020 showed that these 11 location classes can be grouped into four environmental systems based on dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations suspended sediment concentrations and water column stratification these four environmental systems are a the unstratified estuary systems es with high dissolved inorganic nutrient and high suspended sediment concentrations b the unstratified coastal systems cs with lower dissolved inorganic nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations compared to the estuary systems c the anthropogenically modified systems as that are characterized by high dissolved inorganic nutrient but low suspended sediment concentrations and d the offshore systems os that have low dissolved inorganic nutrient and low suspended sediment concentrations throughout the year fig 6 shows the geographic location of these routine monitoring location classes 2 4 2 model schematization 11 1d v models consisting of two model cells each were constructed to mimic these 11 location classes of the sns the 11 1d v models differ from each other in dissolved inorganic nutrient and suspended sediment concentration boundary conditions as well as depth and stratification salinity was not considered the dissolved inorganic nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations forced at the boundaries were derived from monthly averaged data see fig b 1 b 5 in appendix b total nitrogen was distributed in a ratio of 5 1 to the no 3 and nh 4 timeseries total phosphate and silica were used as an input for po 4 3 and sio2 respectively the depth was determined from the average depth at the location classes stratification was applied to the location classes veerse meer grevelingen offshore and doggerbank during the summer months by decreasing the diffusion parameter in the model set up fig 7 visualizes the physical attributes of the 11 1d v models the same temperature and radiation timeseries were applied to all 1d v models see fig c 1 and c 2 in appendix c as the geographical extent of the sns is small enough to allow this simplification furthermore the transport through the 1d v models was determined in such a way that the water residence time for all 1d v models was equal 30 days a very low biomass concentration of each pft was applied to the boundaries at all 11 1d v models to ensure that there is always seeding biomass available for each pft lastly the 1d v models were run with a timestep of 3 min from 2000 to 2010 and an output timestep of 2h the first year was used as a spin up 2 4 3 model parameterization for the pfts capable of nutrient uptake the minimum optimum and maximum nutrient quotas e g n c m i n n c o p t n c m a x for the different pfts were derived from leonardos and geider 2004 the minimum and optimum nitrogen carbon quotas pc m i n nc m i n and pc m i n nc m a x during phosphate limitation were calibrated using the quotas from leonardos and geider 2004 the optimum and maximum nitrogen carbon quotas for the uptake of nitrate no 3 c o p t and no 3 c m a x were set to be slightly lower than the optimum and maximum nitrogen carbon quotas for the uptake of ammonium n c o p t and n c m a x the minimum optimum and maximum nutrient quotas e g n c m i n n c o p t n c m a x for protozooplankton were set according to flynn 2021 the maximum chlorophyll a carbon quota c h l c m a x as well as the initial slope α c h l for the different pfts were set according to averages per class taken from geider et al 1997 phototrophic organisms have an overcapacity for photosynthesis in order to cover their loss rates geider et al 1998 so the dimensionless parameter r e l p s the ratio of photosynthesis rate to maximum growth rate was set to 2 for the primarily phototrophic organisms previous studies skovgaard 1996 li et al 1999 adolf et al 2006 anderson et al 2018 showed that cms ingest very little prey in the dark so ingestion of prey by cms is light dependent via the dimensionless parameter r e l p h a g jeong et al 2010 showed that cms cannot capture prey larger than themselves this was implemented by setting the prey handling index p r for each predator accordingly the sedimentation of diatoms s e d was set according to stokes law a variable density in diatoms due to vacuole was not implemented lastly the size of each pft was derived from the median size per pft from the protist dataset used in schneider et al 2020 that covers the same study area all 1d v models were initialized with the same biomass values and the same reference maximum growth rate for each pft umrt 0 81 d 1 thus no initial advantage was given to any pft a linear mortality function with a reference mortality of 0 07 d 1 blauw et al 2009 was applied to the modelled diatom green algae and cm a quadratic mortality function with a reference mortality of 0 007 d 1 was applied as a closure function to the modelled protozooplankton table a 3 summarizes pft specific parameters established through literature 2 4 4 model validation routine monitoring data on the sns provided the in situ comparison data for the 1d v model runs schneider et al 2020 a quantitative comparison of the svs was done in a target diagram a target diagram compactly visualizes standard deviations bias and correlations between model results and field observations joliff et al 2009 on target diagrams the unity circle provides a marker for the quantification of the fit between model results and observations svs that lie within the unity circle are positively correlated and perform well compared to observations svs that lie outside of the unity circle have a significant bias and difference in variance between model results and observations furthermore modelled phytoplankton biomass as well as chlorophyll a timeseries were compared visually against field data timeseries nutrients were not compared as they are forced with the transport see figures b 1 b 5 in appendix b the modelled trophic composition was compared qualitatively to the in situ trophic composition provided in schneider et al 2020 the trophic compositions were calculated as fractions per pft of the total protist biomass 2 4 5 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was completed to determine the influence of different abiotic factors on the biomass concentration of cms to verify that the abiotic factors had variations in the same order of magnitude the normalized standard deviation was calculated s d x s d x m e a n x in separate model runs the inorganic nutrient concentrations and the suspended sediment concentration were modified by 10 and the resulting cm biomass analysed 3 results 3 1 pft timeseries fig 8 displays results of the eleven 1d v models for the years 2001 to 2010 it shows the carbon biomass of each pft within each 1d v model over the whole timeframe the 1d v model results can be grouped into four categories that align with the environmental systems previously described see figs 6 and 7 this figure highlights five important aspects firstly the 1d v models were unable to capture the dynamics of estuary systems es with protist biomass near zero along the 10 year simulation in both the westerschelde and waddensea location classes through tidal mixing these systems import protist biomass produced in neighbouring coastal waters where conditions are more favourable since this transport of pfts is not included in these simple 1d v models it can be expected that the model underestimates pft values within the 1d v estuary models and thus the model results of the es must be neglected secondly the biomass order of magnitude varies between the 1d v models with the coastal systems cs oosterschelde to coastal waddensea displaying the highest peaks in biomass and the offshore systems os the lowest offshore mixed to doggerbank thirdly in each 1d v model the effect of the year to year variations of the nutrient and suspended sediment boundary conditions see figures b 1 b 5 in appendix b are visible in the spring bloom strength timing and composition fourthly the onset of the spring bloom is the earliest in the 1d v models that are stratified veerse meer grevelingen offshore and doggerbank lastly the 1d v models of the os display protists throughout the whole year while the 1d v models of the cs display stark peaks at the beginning of spring 3 2 quantitative validation figs 9 and 10 show the comparison between the model and data for chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass these two variables were chosen as they have the most reliable and complete data source the figures show that the model manages to capture the most relevant dynamics especially in the cs the model results for chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass compare well against observations in the os both the chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass tend to be overestimated by the model in the late summer months the figures also show that the model did not manage to capture the dynamics of veerse meer fig 11 displays model data comparisons for inorganic nutrients carbon biomass of the different pfts and chlorophyll a in a target diagram it should be noted that the es westerschelde and waddensea were not taken into account as the dynamics of those location classes could not be captured by the 1d v models furthermore to determine whether the 1d v models manage to capture the difference in order of magnitude between the location classes the maximum values for the protist and chlorophyll a state variables per year and location class were extracted therefore this target diagram evaluates the ability of the models to capture the variation over the whole biogeochemical gradient three important aspects can be highlighted in fig 11 firstly all nutrients except for ammonium lie within the unity circle and thus compare well to the sampled data this is not unexpected as the nutrient timeseries are transported into the column models via the boundary secondly phytoplankton cm and chlorophyll a lie on the boundary of the unity circle and thus also compare well to the observations lastly ammonium and protozooplankton lie outside the unity circle and thus show significant bias and difference in variance between the model results and the in situ data 3 3 qualitative validation of the trophic composition fig 12 displays the protist community composition of the 1d v models fig 12 a and the monitoring data fig 12 b over the whole timeframe for environmental systems except the es the es were removed because the 1d v schematization was not able to capture the dynamics of those systems the colours depict the percentage of each pft fig 12 can once again be divided according to the environmental systems and both figures display a increasing gradient of cms from the cs to the os it must be noted that there are severe shortcomings in the protozooplankton identification of the monitoring program as it is geared towards identifying phytoplankton mainly easily recognizable protozooplankton such as noctiluca scintillans were identified and thus the protozooplankton of the routine monitoring data in fig 12 b are only indicative for protozooplankton occurrence in the 1d v models the cs of the 1d v model runs are mainly dominated by diatoms but also green algae and cms until june and are succeeded by the occurrence of protozooplankton fig 12 a in the data analysis fig 12 b the cs are also dominated by a spring phytoplankton bloom followed by a very distinct bloom of protozooplankton the 1d v model run of the anthropogenically modified system as veerse meer fig 12 a is characterized by a lack of diatoms and cms compared to the measured concentrations fig 12 b the biomass is almost evenly divided among green algae and protozooplankton during the first part of the simulation period until 2007 the biomass of the 1d v model run of the as grevelingen is divided fairly even between green algae protozooplankton and diatoms after 2007 the fraction of diatoms increases in the simulated results fig 12 a in the data analysis fig 12 b the as are characterized by a lack of protozooplankton apart from an obvious dominance of green algae in veerse meer before 2004 the measured biomass is fairly evenly divided among diatoms green algae and cms the os of the 1d v model runs are characterized by a dominant diatom bloom in spring succeeded by a bloom of cms protozooplankton also occur to a lesser extent in the offshore 1d v models compared with the other systems compared to the measured concentrations the offshore mixed and doggerbank model runs perform well as they display a dominance of diatoms at the beginning of the year followed by cms however the modelled cm occurrence ends earlier in the year compared to the measured concentrations 3 4 sensitivity analysis to test cm occurrence hypothesis the normalized standard deviations of the abiotic factors verified that the variations for the abiotic factors are in the same order of magnitude see table e 1 in appendix e thus the sensitivity analyses of the different abiotic factors are comparable the sensitivity analysis results show that the cm biomass changes anti proportionally to the dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations see fig 13 a decrease of dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations leads to an increase of cm biomass and vice versa the sensitivity analyses in which each dissolved inorganic nutrient was modified independently show that a decrease of phosphate and of silica result in an increase of cm biomass while an increase of phosphate and silica result in a decrease of cm biomass however increasing or decreasing the suspended sediment ammonium or nitrate concentration by 10 does not result in similar changes of the cm biomass thus changes in phosphate and silica concentrations have a larger relative effect on the cm biomass 4 discussion in this study we introduced protist a module that calculates the primary production of and competition within protist communities the aim of this study was to estimate the ability of the module protist to simulate the growth and mortality of a protist community and to further explore the hypothesis put forward by schneider et al 2020 that the biogeochemical gradient drives the trophic composition of protist communities in the sns by applying the module protist to a group of 1d v models that mimic the biogeochemical gradient of the sns we were able to show that it responds to different biogeochemical forcings and results in different plausible trophic compositions that are in line with observed data see fig 12 cms have often been shown to occur in oligotrophic environments stoecker and lavrentyev 2018 duhamel et al 2019 using state of the art knowledge on protist physiology trophic pathways and protist parameters this modelling study shows that cms are likely to occur in environments and during months with low dissolved inorganic nutrient supply the sensitivity analysis showed that the availability of dissolved inorganic phosphate and silica strongly influenced the occurrence of mixoplankton however the availability of dissolved inorganic nitrogen had little effect on the occurrence of mixoplankton which is most likely due to the fact that dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations are rarely limiting in the north sea coastal zone philippart et al 2007 the suspended sediment gradient which affects light availability had very little impact on the occurrence of mixoplankton using experimental data li et al 2000 and smalley et al 2012 found that nutrient limitation induces phagotrophy in mixoplankton so based on the model results we can conclude that in the sns the biogeochemical gradient drives the trophic composition of the protist community primarily through the availability of dissolved inorganic nutrients such as phosphate and silica the chosen schematization and set up of the 1d v models proved useful as a first approach but also shows some caveats while the 1d v models of the cs and os perform well compared to the observations the 1d v models of the es and as perform poorly the poor performance in the es is due to three reasons firstly the lack of transport of biotic svs from coastal waters into the estuary environments and secondly the lack of tidal dynamics most of the organic carbon stems from allochthonous sources soetaert and herman 1995 and tides dominate the estuaries heip 1988 thirdly in concert with the tidal dynamics the depth distribution of the location classes is not captured in the 1d v models there are very shallow places where growth can occur but as we used the average depth over all sampling locations per location class this is not represented in the current schematization a 3d grid with hydrodynamics that include transport and stratification could improve simulations also with regard to the timing and duration of blooms the 1d v models of the as perform poorly as the anthropogenic impact on the hydrodynamics of those systems was not considered this is clearly visible in the lack of modelled cms see fig 12 in general it is difficult to capture the dynamics of those as with the limited hydrodynamics of the generic 1d v models in 2004 veerse meer was re opened to the oosterschelde thus allowing exchange of water masses between the oosterschelde and veerse meer wijnhoven et al 2010 turning the freshwater lake into a marine fjord like water body during the transition period 2002 2004 a period of high phytoplankton biomass was observed likely due to the absence of benthic grazers rikz 2007 this could not be captured by the 1d v models grevelingen was also hydrodynamically altered during the 10 year time period hoeksema 2002 furthermore the occurrence of green algae was low in all 1d v models with the exception of the as veerse meer and grevelingen the main reason for this lies in the lack of modelling a defining trait of phaeocystis a phytoplankton which commonly occurs in the dutch sns phaeocystis avoids predation by forming colonies lancelot et al 2005 a trait currently not included in protist lastly the organisms size determines competition between the organisms finkel 2007 to have a point of reference the size of the pfts was derived from routine monitoring data by taking the median size per pft however protist sizes within a community are often not normally distributed but rather bi or multimodal as there is only one size per pft and the handling rate of the prey depends mainly on the relation between predator and prey size the chosen size of the organisms impacts the model results applying multiple species per pft may give better results but will also increase calculation times at the same time with only one species per pft the model results look realistic we conclude that while these 1d v models have caveats the model results are realistic and the caveats correspond to the chosen model schematization an interesting outcome of this study was the coupling of the trophic pathways for cms within protist even though the model equations used in protist for the different trophic pathways are quite detailed in their physiological descriptions the trade off between the phototrophic and phagotrophic pathways for cms is not both the phototrophic and phagotrophic pathways are accessible to cms the efficiency of each trophic pathway per pft is set using measured physiological parameters derived from literature cms have a lower affinity to light lower α c h l and a lower chlorophyll a carbon quota compared to diatoms and green algae geider et al 1997 additionally cms have very low ingestion rates during night skovgaard 1996 li et al 1999 adolf et al 2006 anderson et al 2018 compared to protozooplankton so it can be hypothesized that cms employ their mixotrophic genes to remain competitive litchman 2007 consequently cms do well in environments and seasons in which there is an advantage of combining both trophic modes hartmann et al 2012 such environments or seasons have a low supply of dissolved inorganic nutrients and or prey mitra et al 2014 the great ocean gyres can be classified as such environments and so it is not surprising that recent research has found mixoplankton to occur notably in the world s oceans faure et al 2019 global warming and the construction of offshore windfarms may change the pelagic environment towards stronger stratification and longer nutrient limitation falkowski 1994 richardson and schoeman 2003 falkowski and oliver 2007 this could allow cms to become successful due to their mixotrophic genes as many harmful algal blooms are caused by cms burkholder et al 2008 it is important for managers to have access to adequate monitoring and modelling techniques with which to assess the probability of potentially harmful cms occurring peperzak 2003 5 conclusion this study has shown that the newly developed module protist for delft3d waq is capable of modelling different pfts that interact with compete against and graze on each other the module protist responds to biogeochemical gradients and results in different trophic compositions for the protist communities very similar to in situ observations in those simulations where comparison is useful furthermore this study used modelling results to provide a layer of evidence that the availability of dissolved inorganic phosphate and silica drives the occurrence of cms in a system with strong gradients of dissolved inorganic nutrients and suspended sediments this study demonstrates that protist can be applied in an aem setting aems provide an important tool to help understand and predict the consequence of changing pressures on the productivity of an ecosystem schuwirth et al 2019 especially against the background of future anthropogenic changes in coastal environments it is important

24547,the ecological importance of mixoplankton within marine protist communities is slowly being recognized however most aquatic ecosystem models do not include formulations to model a complete protist community consisting of phytoplankton protozooplankton and mixoplankton we introduce protist a new module for the aquatic ecosystem modelling software delft3d waq that can model a protist community consisting of two types of phytoplankton diatoms and green algae two types of mixoplankton constitutive mixoplankton and non constitutive mixoplankton and protozooplankton we employed protist to further explore the hypothesis that the biogeochemical gradient of inorganic nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations drives the observed occurrence of constitutive mixoplankton in the dutch southern north sea to explore this hypothesis we used 11 1d vertical aquatic ecosystem models that mimic the abiotic conditions of 11 routine monitoring locations in the dutch southern north sea our models result in plausible trophic compositions across the biogeochemical gradient as compared to in situ data a sensitivity analysis showed that the dissolved inorganic phosphate and silica concentrations drive the occurrence of constitutive mixoplankton in the dutch southern north sea keywords mixoplankton trophic modes aquatic ecosystem model north sea biogeochemical gradient delft3d waq 1 introduction the trophic mode of marine protists is an important functional trait with which to characterize protists mitra et al 2016 flynn et al 2019 classified marine protists into three categories based on their trophic mode phytoplankton protozooplankton and mixoplankton phytoplankton such as diatoms and green algae phototrophic non diatoms are defined as protists that can only utilize the photo osmotrophic pathways they cover their energy requirements through the photosynthetic fixation of inorganic carbon and their nutrient requirements through the uptake of dissolved inorganic nutrients protozooplankton are defined as protists that can only utilize the phagotrophic pathways they cover their energy and nutrient requirements through the assimilation of prey in contrast to phytoplankton and protozooplankton mixoplankton can utilize the photo osmo and phagotrophic pathways simultaneously flynn et al 2019 they can be divided into constitutive mixoplankton cm and non constitutive mixoplankton ncm mitra et al 2016 cms have the constitutive ability to perform photosynthesis and they can uptake dissolved inorganic nutrients as well as assimilate prey ncms need to acquire the photosynthetic machinery from their prey they cover their nutrient requirements mainly through the assimilation of prey stoecker et al 2017 the composition and productivity of protist communities is an interplay between external resource availability such as nutrients light and prey and the protists physiologies while the importance of phytoplankton as the base of marine ecosystems and protozooplankton as trophic transfers has long been recognized the ecological relevance of mixoplankton has long been ignored flynn et al 2013 however mixoplankton contribute notably to marine protist communities worldwide leles et al 2017 2018 faure et al 2019 change the inorganic nutrient and predation dynamics hansen et al 2019 and have a non negligible impact on the carbon cycle worden et al 2015 furthermore mixoplankton are an important connector between microbial protist and mesozooplankton food webs stoecker et al 2017 and they play an important role in ecosystems governed by strong light and nutrient gradients selosse et al 2017 in a recent analysis of routine monitoring data on the protist community of the dutch southern north sea from here on referred to as the southern north sea sns schneider et al 2020 showed that cms occur mostly in inorganic nutrient depleted highly transparent stratified environments eutrophied turbid mixed environments were devoid of cms schneider et al 2020 hypothesized that the environmental factors which exhibit a biogeochemical gradient drive the trophic composition of protist communities in the sns however schneider et al 2020 were not able to elucidate which environmental factor the dissolved inorganic nutrient or the suspended sediment gradient governed the occurrence of cms while routine monitoring data allows us to gain insight on protist communities in different environments it is difficult to test causalities between separate abiotic factors and the community composition using field data aquatic ecosystem models aem provide a tool to estimate the impact of external or internal forcing on aquatic ecosystem dynamics i e janssen et al 2015 aems are able to depict various aquatic processes such as primary production secondary grazing remineralization or denitrification however most aems still do not include adequate formulations for mixoplankton flynn et al 2019 to help close this gap we implemented a new module that includes formulations to model a protist community consisting of diatoms green algae protozooplankton cms and ncms in the open source aem delft3d waq this new module is called protist and can be used to model the primary production of as well as the competition and grazing within the protist community we validated protist using 11 1d vertical 1d v models that mimic 11 routine monitoring location classes located in the estuaries coasts and offshore regions of the dutch sns schneider et al 2020 the 11 1d v models were forced with timeseries of inorganic nutrients and suspended sediments sampled at the 11 location classes thus we were able to quantitatively and qualitatively validate protist across the biogeochemical gradient of the sns using timeseries comparisons target diagrams and heatmaps using the 11 1d v models we were also able to further explore the hypothesis put forward by schneider et al 2020 that the biogeochemical gradient drives the trophic composition of protist communities we conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the inorganic nutrients or the suspended sediment concentration has more effect on the occurrence of cms especially against the background of climate change wilken et al 2013 and anthropogenic changes to marine environments burkhard et al 2011 it is important to acquire more knowledge about the abiotic drivers of protist community compositions in summary the objectives of this study are 1 to introduce the module protist 2 to quantitatively and qualitatively validate protist against routine monitoring data and 3 to further explore the hypothesis that the biogeochemical gradient drives the trophic composition of protist communities 2 material and methods 2 1 the module protist the module protist simulates the growth and mortality of the protist community while taking the trophic modes of protists into account protist can thus be used to simulate primary production in marine ecosystems the module protist combines model equations from flynn 2001 flynn and mitra 2009 and flynn 2021 these equations are based on first principles that were implemented unchanged in protist firstly the growth of protists is not only determined by the external availability of resources such as light nutrients and prey but also by the protists internal stoichiometry the internal nutrient quotas of the protists regulate the protists affinity to uptake nutrients grover 1991 synthesize chlorophyll a davey et al 2008 and assimilate prey mitra and flynn 2005 secondly the trophic modes of protists determine the interactions within protist communities flynn et al 2019 however some changes were needed for the equations to run stably and efficiently as a delft3d waq module the nutrient uptake equations were described using continuous functions instead of coupled conditional statements as in flynn 2021 the uptake of dissolved amino acids was not implemented as delft3d waq does not simulate dissolved amino acids explicitly due to the lack of validation data the assimilation of dissolved organic carbon was not implemented as all protist functional types pft can assimilate dissolved organic carbon doc stoecker et al 2017 so it is not a distinguishing pathway between the pfts protist enables multiple pfts to interact with compete against and graze on each other protist consists of five different pfts and each pft consists of state variables sv that describe carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p biomass chlorophyll a chl is an additional sv for phototrophic protists diatoms contain an additional sv to describe the silica si content this makes protist fully stoichiometrically variable the pfts require either light and or prey and or nutrients fig 1 visualizes the svs required for protist and the interactions between the different svs 2 2 functional types in protist 2 2 1 diatoms the pft diatoms are defined as phytoplankton that can utilize silica diatoms are

equations are listed in appendix a 6 2 3 1 cellular status for each pft the cellular quota the maximum growth rate the mortality rate the basal respiration rate the total respiration rate the carbon specific growth rate as well as the cellular nutrient status of nitrogen phosphate and silica needs to be calculated table a 12 summarizes the description of the auxiliaries and appendix a 6 2 provides the detailed mathematical equations the cellular quotas n c p c s c describe the ratio of the respective protist nutrient svs to the protist carbon svs according to droop 1974 the maximum growth rate u m t as well as the mortality rate m r t are calculated using the q10 approach van t hoff 1884 the basal respiration rate b r is defined as a fraction of maximum growth rate geider and osborne 1989 the total respiration is the sum of the metabolic cost r e d c o of nitrate reduction u p no 3 flynn and flynn 1998 the anabolic cost a r of nitrogen utilization u p nh 4 a s s n wirtz and pahlow 2010 the foraging costs for prey s d a a s s c pahlow and prowe 2010 and the basal respiration b r geider and osborne 1989 furthermore the nutrient status for nitrogen n c u phosphate p c u and silica s c u only for diatoms is calculated the nutrient status returns values between 0 severely deprived of the respective nutrient and 1 at the optimal nutrient quota the form of the functions depends on the protist s physiology to store the respective nutrient see fig 2 as protist cells store nitrogen in a form that is not physiologically active andersen et al 1991 the nutrient status for nitrogen n c u see fig 2 a is a linear function between the minimum and maximum quota the nutrient status for phosphate p c u see fig 2 b is calculated using a sigmoidal function to mimic the storage of phosphate as polyphosphate within the cell lin et al 2016 the cellular status of silica s c u see fig 2 c is a function of the external silica availability as incorporated silica is not accessible by the cells anymore martin jézéquel et al 2003 applying liebig s law of minimum liebig 1840 the limiting nutrient n p c u or n p s i c u for diatoms is determined by the minimum nutrient status within the cell to ensure that the nitrogen carbon and phosphate carbon quotas do not exceed the maximum nutrient quota between time steps cellular nitrogen and phosphate is voided as soon as the cellular nutrient quota exceeds the maximum nutrient quota n o u t and p o u t this does not occur for silica as incorporated silica cannot be dispelled from the cell walls of diatoms martin jézéquel et al 2003 if the nitrogen carbon quota falls below the minimum nitrogen carbon quota then carbon is voided c v o i d 2 3 2 uptake in general the uptake of dissolved inorganic nutrients u p nh 4 u p no 3 u p p u p si is a combination of the external availability of the nutrients and the acquisition capability which depends on the internal nutrient status grover 1991 moreno and martiny 2018 this is achieved by enhancing or repressing the optimal nutrient uptake via sigmoidal functions see fig 3 table a 13 summarizes the description of the auxiliaries and appendix a 6 3 provides the detailed mathematical equations the nutrient uptake at the optimal nutrient quota is regulated via the michaelis menten function and scaled to the maximum growth rate and the optimal nutrient carbon quota for the uptake of nh 4 and no 3 the optimum nutrient uptake is also scaled to the relative growth feasible with the respective nutrient if the cellular nutrient quota is below the optimum nutrient quota i e nutrient stressed the nutrient uptake is enhanced until the maximum nutrient uptake is reached goldman and glibert 1982 perry 1976 if the cellular nutrient quota is above the optimum nutrient quota the nutrient uptake for nh 4 and po 4 3 are repressed wirtz and pahlow 2010 while the nutrient uptake for no 3 dugdale et al 2007 domingues et al 2011 and silica are stopped all together furthermore the uptake of nitrogen is a function of the cellular phosphate carbon quota resulting in a decrease of the cellular nitrogen carbon quota during phosphate stress pahlow and oschlies 2009 2 3 3 phototrophy the photosynthesis equations are based on the photosynthesis irradiance curve that requires three input parameters the maximum photosynthetic rate p s q m the chlorophyll a specific initial slope α c h l and photon flux density p f d jassby and platt 1976 table a 14 summarizes the description of the auxiliaries and appendix a 6 4 provides the detailed mathematical equations the maximum rate of photosynthesis covers the basal respiration b r the maximum growth rate u m t the leakage of photosynthate as doc p s d o c thornton 2014 and the costs of reducing nitrate r e d c o and a r dugdale et al 2007 which with the exception of basal respiration are all influenced by the nitrogen quota of the cell n c u droop 1974 thornton 2014 flynn and flynn 1998 furthermore the maximum rate of photosynthesis depends on the organism s physiology i e their capability to overcompensate the photosynthetic rate r e l p s geider 1993 the maximum photosynthetic rate along with the initial slope α c h l and the photon flux density p f d are used to calculate gross photosynthesis c f i x using the smith equation smith 1936 the net photosynthesis rate n e t p s is determined by subtracting the loss through leakage c l e a k primarily phototrophic organisms such as diatoms green algae and cms can regulate their chlorophyll a synthesis s y n c h l see fig 4 a geider and piatt 1986 if the cell is nutrient limited or the cell fixed too much carbon the synthesis of chlorophyll a is repressed moreno and martiny 2018 under low light the synthesis of chlorophyll a is enhanced sukenik et al 1987 chlorophyll a is also decomposed with a linear relationship to the nitrogen status d e g c h l wirtz and pahlow 2010 primarily phagotrophic organisms such as ncms cannot produce their own chloroplasts so they acquire them from prey u p c h l this acquisition is limited by a maximum chlorophyll a carbon quota via a sigmoidal function see fig 4 b those acquired chloroplasts are subsequently lost at a fixed linear rate l o s s c h l ghyoot et al 2017 2 3 4 phagotrophy the phagotrophic functions can be divided into four subsections determining the prey capture determining the prey quality determining the predator ingestion rate and determining the predator assimilation rate table a 15 summarizes the description of the auxiliaries and appendix a 6 5 provides the detailed mathematical equations the prey capture depends on the motility of predator and prey as well as the density of the prey the motility m o t is derived from a linear regression by flynn and mitra 2016 that uses the organisms equivalent spherical diameter as an input the density of the prey n r p r e y is calculated from the cellular carbon content c c e l l and the current carbon protist state variable p r o t c the motility of predator and prey as well as the density of prey are input parameters to determine the encounter rate e n c according to the empirical rothschild equation rothschild and osborn 1988 this encounter rate multiplied with the optimum capture rate o p t c r of the predator and the predator specific prey handling index p r determines the amount of specific prey the predator can capture this is summed over all prey items s u m c p as mixoplankton do not have the same capacity to ingest prey in the dark as in light skovgaard 1996 anderson et al 2018 a light dependent inhibition curve i n h l i g h t sigmoidal curve is multiplied with the encounter rate and limits the capture of prey depending on the light availability the light dependent inhibition curve takes the photon flux density as well as the parameter r e l p h a g fraction of prey that can be ingested in the dark as input the prey quality determines the assimilation efficiency o p a e of the predator a decrease in prey quality leads to a decrease in assimilation efficiency elser et al 2000 the nutrient quota of the captured prey is compared against the nutrient quota of the predator this returns a value between minimum a e o and the maximum assimilation efficiency a e m see solid black line in fig 5 the predator ingestion rate i n g c see fig 5 at very low prey densities is limited by the amount of prey s u m c p that can be captured and at very high prey densities by the predator s satiation i n g s a t flynn and mitra 2016 this satiation ingestion rate is calculated using a holling type ii curve holling 1959 scaled to its maximum ingestion rate m a x i n g the maximum ingestion covers the maximum growth rate and basal respiration rate taking the quality of the captured prey into account the ingestion of the other prey nutrients i n g n i n g p is referenced to the carbon ingestion and the prey nutrient quota the predator assimilation rate a s s c is determined by taking the carbon specific ingestion rate and limiting it to the assimilation efficiency the assimilation of the other prey nutrients a s s n a s s p is referenced to the carbon assimilation and the optimum predator nutrient quota non assimilated prey is voided as particulate organics i e p o c o u t p o n o u t and p o p o u t 2 4 aem application the module protist was implemented in the software delft3d waq delft3d waq solves the advection diffusion reaction equation on a predefined grid and is part of the open source modelling suite delft 3d maintained by deltares deltares 2020 the aem of this study employs established delft3d waq modules to simulate nutrients nh 4 no 3 po 4 3 and si organic matter i e particulate organic nitrogen pon phosphate pop and carbon poc as well as opal dissolved oxygen solar radiation and suspended sediment the modules compute the settling of organic matter the decomposition of organic matter the dissolution of silica nitrification and denitrification the extinction of light as well as the reaeration of the water column for more information on those modules the authors refer to blauw et al 2009 to simulate primary production this aem employs protist although the aim was to run the aem with all five pfts it was difficult to parameterize ncms for this aem application using literature and data based knowledge unfortunately ncms are not sampled in the routine monitoring program of the sns schneider et al 2020 so there is a lack of knowledge about the distribution of ncms in the sns furthermore there is still a lack of physiological understanding of ncms hansen et al 2019 so for this aem we were only able to simulate four pfts diatom green protozooplankton and cm however using a steady state box model we successfully demonstrated growth and competition between the five pfts in a simplified idealized environment for more details on this technical test the authors refer to appendix d 2 4 1 model domain the sns was chosen as a model domain as it is a well monitored shelf sea that covers strong abiotic gradients abiotic and biotic parameters are routinely monitored at 11 location classes by the rijkswaterstaat monitoring program dutch directorate general for public works and water management schneider et al 2020 showed that these 11 location classes can be grouped into four environmental systems based on dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations suspended sediment concentrations and water column stratification these four environmental systems are a the unstratified estuary systems es with high dissolved inorganic nutrient and high suspended sediment concentrations b the unstratified coastal systems cs with lower dissolved inorganic nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations compared to the estuary systems c the anthropogenically modified systems as that are characterized by high dissolved inorganic nutrient but low suspended sediment concentrations and d the offshore systems os that have low dissolved inorganic nutrient and low suspended sediment concentrations throughout the year fig 6 shows the geographic location of these routine monitoring location classes 2 4 2 model schematization 11 1d v models consisting of two model cells each were constructed to mimic these 11 location classes of the sns the 11 1d v models differ from each other in dissolved inorganic nutrient and suspended sediment concentration boundary conditions as well as depth and stratification salinity was not considered the dissolved inorganic nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations forced at the boundaries were derived from monthly averaged data see fig b 1 b 5 in appendix b total nitrogen was distributed in a ratio of 5 1 to the no 3 and nh 4 timeseries total phosphate and silica were used as an input for po 4 3 and sio2 respectively the depth was determined from the average depth at the location classes stratification was applied to the location classes veerse meer grevelingen offshore and doggerbank during the summer months by decreasing the diffusion parameter in the model set up fig 7 visualizes the physical attributes of the 11 1d v models the same temperature and radiation timeseries were applied to all 1d v models see fig c 1 and c 2 in appendix c as the geographical extent of the sns is small enough to allow this simplification furthermore the transport through the 1d v models was determined in such a way that the water residence time for all 1d v models was equal 30 days a very low biomass concentration of each pft was applied to the boundaries at all 11 1d v models to ensure that there is always seeding biomass available for each pft lastly the 1d v models were run with a timestep of 3 min from 2000 to 2010 and an output timestep of 2h the first year was used as a spin up 2 4 3 model parameterization for the pfts capable of nutrient uptake the minimum optimum and maximum nutrient quotas e g n c m i n n c o p t n c m a x for the different pfts were derived from leonardos and geider 2004 the minimum and optimum nitrogen carbon quotas pc m i n nc m i n and pc m i n nc m a x during phosphate limitation were calibrated using the quotas from leonardos and geider 2004 the optimum and maximum nitrogen carbon quotas for the uptake of nitrate no 3 c o p t and no 3 c m a x were set to be slightly lower than the optimum and maximum nitrogen carbon quotas for the uptake of ammonium n c o p t and n c m a x the minimum optimum and maximum nutrient quotas e g n c m i n n c o p t n c m a x for protozooplankton were set according to flynn 2021 the maximum chlorophyll a carbon quota c h l c m a x as well as the initial slope α c h l for the different pfts were set according to averages per class taken from geider et al 1997 phototrophic organisms have an overcapacity for photosynthesis in order to cover their loss rates geider et al 1998 so the dimensionless parameter r e l p s the ratio of photosynthesis rate to maximum growth rate was set to 2 for the primarily phototrophic organisms previous studies skovgaard 1996 li et al 1999 adolf et al 2006 anderson et al 2018 showed that cms ingest very little prey in the dark so ingestion of prey by cms is light dependent via the dimensionless parameter r e l p h a g jeong et al 2010 showed that cms cannot capture prey larger than themselves this was implemented by setting the prey handling index p r for each predator accordingly the sedimentation of diatoms s e d was set according to stokes law a variable density in diatoms due to vacuole was not implemented lastly the size of each pft was derived from the median size per pft from the protist dataset used in schneider et al 2020 that covers the same study area all 1d v models were initialized with the same biomass values and the same reference maximum growth rate for each pft umrt 0 81 d 1 thus no initial advantage was given to any pft a linear mortality function with a reference mortality of 0 07 d 1 blauw et al 2009 was applied to the modelled diatom green algae and cm a quadratic mortality function with a reference mortality of 0 007 d 1 was applied as a closure function to the modelled protozooplankton table a 3 summarizes pft specific parameters established through literature 2 4 4 model validation routine monitoring data on the sns provided the in situ comparison data for the 1d v model runs schneider et al 2020 a quantitative comparison of the svs was done in a target diagram a target diagram compactly visualizes standard deviations bias and correlations between model results and field observations joliff et al 2009 on target diagrams the unity circle provides a marker for the quantification of the fit between model results and observations svs that lie within the unity circle are positively correlated and perform well compared to observations svs that lie outside of the unity circle have a significant bias and difference in variance between model results and observations furthermore modelled phytoplankton biomass as well as chlorophyll a timeseries were compared visually against field data timeseries nutrients were not compared as they are forced with the transport see figures b 1 b 5 in appendix b the modelled trophic composition was compared qualitatively to the in situ trophic composition provided in schneider et al 2020 the trophic compositions were calculated as fractions per pft of the total protist biomass 2 4 5 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was completed to determine the influence of different abiotic factors on the biomass concentration of cms to verify that the abiotic factors had variations in the same order of magnitude the normalized standard deviation was calculated s d x s d x m e a n x in separate model runs the inorganic nutrient concentrations and the suspended sediment concentration were modified by 10 and the resulting cm biomass analysed 3 results 3 1 pft timeseries fig 8 displays results of the eleven 1d v models for the years 2001 to 2010 it shows the carbon biomass of each pft within each 1d v model over the whole timeframe the 1d v model results can be grouped into four categories that align with the environmental systems previously described see figs 6 and 7 this figure highlights five important aspects firstly the 1d v models were unable to capture the dynamics of estuary systems es with protist biomass near zero along the 10 year simulation in both the westerschelde and waddensea location classes through tidal mixing these systems import protist biomass produced in neighbouring coastal waters where conditions are more favourable since this transport of pfts is not included in these simple 1d v models it can be expected that the model underestimates pft values within the 1d v estuary models and thus the model results of the es must be neglected secondly the biomass order of magnitude varies between the 1d v models with the coastal systems cs oosterschelde to coastal waddensea displaying the highest peaks in biomass and the offshore systems os the lowest offshore mixed to doggerbank thirdly in each 1d v model the effect of the year to year variations of the nutrient and suspended sediment boundary conditions see figures b 1 b 5 in appendix b are visible in the spring bloom strength timing and composition fourthly the onset of the spring bloom is the earliest in the 1d v models that are stratified veerse meer grevelingen offshore and doggerbank lastly the 1d v models of the os display protists throughout the whole year while the 1d v models of the cs display stark peaks at the beginning of spring 3 2 quantitative validation figs 9 and 10 show the comparison between the model and data for chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass these two variables were chosen as they have the most reliable and complete data source the figures show that the model manages to capture the most relevant dynamics especially in the cs the model results for chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass compare well against observations in the os both the chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass tend to be overestimated by the model in the late summer months the figures also show that the model did not manage to capture the dynamics of veerse meer fig 11 displays model data comparisons for inorganic nutrients carbon biomass of the different pfts and chlorophyll a in a target diagram it should be noted that the es westerschelde and waddensea were not taken into account as the dynamics of those location classes could not be captured by the 1d v models furthermore to determine whether the 1d v models manage to capture the difference in order of magnitude between the location classes the maximum values for the protist and chlorophyll a state variables per year and location class were extracted therefore this target diagram evaluates the ability of the models to capture the variation over the whole biogeochemical gradient three important aspects can be highlighted in fig 11 firstly all nutrients except for ammonium lie within the unity circle and thus compare well to the sampled data this is not unexpected as the nutrient timeseries are transported into the column models via the boundary secondly phytoplankton cm and chlorophyll a lie on the boundary of the unity circle and thus also compare well to the observations lastly ammonium and protozooplankton lie outside the unity circle and thus show significant bias and difference in variance between the model results and the in situ data 3 3 qualitative validation of the trophic composition fig 12 displays the protist community composition of the 1d v models fig 12 a and the monitoring data fig 12 b over the whole timeframe for environmental systems except the es the es were removed because the 1d v schematization was not able to capture the dynamics of those systems the colours depict the percentage of each pft fig 12 can once again be divided according to the environmental systems and both figures display a increasing gradient of cms from the cs to the os it must be noted that there are severe shortcomings in the protozooplankton identification of the monitoring program as it is geared towards identifying phytoplankton mainly easily recognizable protozooplankton such as noctiluca scintillans were identified and thus the protozooplankton of the routine monitoring data in fig 12 b are only indicative for protozooplankton occurrence in the 1d v models the cs of the 1d v model runs are mainly dominated by diatoms but also green algae and cms until june and are succeeded by the occurrence of protozooplankton fig 12 a in the data analysis fig 12 b the cs are also dominated by a spring phytoplankton bloom followed by a very distinct bloom of protozooplankton the 1d v model run of the anthropogenically modified system as veerse meer fig 12 a is characterized by a lack of diatoms and cms compared to the measured concentrations fig 12 b the biomass is almost evenly divided among green algae and protozooplankton during the first part of the simulation period until 2007 the biomass of the 1d v model run of the as grevelingen is divided fairly even between green algae protozooplankton and diatoms after 2007 the fraction of diatoms increases in the simulated results fig 12 a in the data analysis fig 12 b the as are characterized by a lack of protozooplankton apart from an obvious dominance of green algae in veerse meer before 2004 the measured biomass is fairly evenly divided among diatoms green algae and cms the os of the 1d v model runs are characterized by a dominant diatom bloom in spring succeeded by a bloom of cms protozooplankton also occur to a lesser extent in the offshore 1d v models compared with the other systems compared to the measured concentrations the offshore mixed and doggerbank model runs perform well as they display a dominance of diatoms at the beginning of the year followed by cms however the modelled cm occurrence ends earlier in the year compared to the measured concentrations 3 4 sensitivity analysis to test cm occurrence hypothesis the normalized standard deviations of the abiotic factors verified that the variations for the abiotic factors are in the same order of magnitude see table e 1 in appendix e thus the sensitivity analyses of the different abiotic factors are comparable the sensitivity analysis results show that the cm biomass changes anti proportionally to the dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations see fig 13 a decrease of dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations leads to an increase of cm biomass and vice versa the sensitivity analyses in which each dissolved inorganic nutrient was modified independently show that a decrease of phosphate and of silica result in an increase of cm biomass while an increase of phosphate and silica result in a decrease of cm biomass however increasing or decreasing the suspended sediment ammonium or nitrate concentration by 10 does not result in similar changes of the cm biomass thus changes in phosphate and silica concentrations have a larger relative effect on the cm biomass 4 discussion in this study we introduced protist a module that calculates the primary production of and competition within protist communities the aim of this study was to estimate the ability of the module protist to simulate the growth and mortality of a protist community and to further explore the hypothesis put forward by schneider et al 2020 that the biogeochemical gradient drives the trophic composition of protist communities in the sns by applying the module protist to a group of 1d v models that mimic the biogeochemical gradient of the sns we were able to show that it responds to different biogeochemical forcings and results in different plausible trophic compositions that are in line with observed data see fig 12 cms have often been shown to occur in oligotrophic environments stoecker and lavrentyev 2018 duhamel et al 2019 using state of the art knowledge on protist physiology trophic pathways and protist parameters this modelling study shows that cms are likely to occur in environments and during months with low dissolved inorganic nutrient supply the sensitivity analysis showed that the availability of dissolved inorganic phosphate and silica strongly influenced the occurrence of mixoplankton however the availability of dissolved inorganic nitrogen had little effect on the occurrence of mixoplankton which is most likely due to the fact that dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations are rarely limiting in the north sea coastal zone philippart et al 2007 the suspended sediment gradient which affects light availability had very little impact on the occurrence of mixoplankton using experimental data li et al 2000 and smalley et al 2012 found that nutrient limitation induces phagotrophy in mixoplankton so based on the model results we can conclude that in the sns the biogeochemical gradient drives the trophic composition of the protist community primarily through the availability of dissolved inorganic nutrients such as phosphate and silica the chosen schematization and set up of the 1d v models proved useful as a first approach but also shows some caveats while the 1d v models of the cs and os perform well compared to the observations the 1d v models of the es and as perform poorly the poor performance in the es is due to three reasons firstly the lack of transport of biotic svs from coastal waters into the estuary environments and secondly the lack of tidal dynamics most of the organic carbon stems from allochthonous sources soetaert and herman 1995 and tides dominate the estuaries heip 1988 thirdly in concert with the tidal dynamics the depth distribution of the location classes is not captured in the 1d v models there are very shallow places where growth can occur but as we used the average depth over all sampling locations per location class this is not represented in the current schematization a 3d grid with hydrodynamics that include transport and stratification could improve simulations also with regard to the timing and duration of blooms the 1d v models of the as perform poorly as the anthropogenic impact on the hydrodynamics of those systems was not considered this is clearly visible in the lack of modelled cms see fig 12 in general it is difficult to capture the dynamics of those as with the limited hydrodynamics of the generic 1d v models in 2004 veerse meer was re opened to the oosterschelde thus allowing exchange of water masses between the oosterschelde and veerse meer wijnhoven et al 2010 turning the freshwater lake into a marine fjord like water body during the transition period 2002 2004 a period of high phytoplankton biomass was observed likely due to the absence of benthic grazers rikz 2007 this could not be captured by the 1d v models grevelingen was also hydrodynamically altered during the 10 year time period hoeksema 2002 furthermore the occurrence of green algae was low in all 1d v models with the exception of the as veerse meer and grevelingen the main reason for this lies in the lack of modelling a defining trait of phaeocystis a phytoplankton which commonly occurs in the dutch sns phaeocystis avoids predation by forming colonies lancelot et al 2005 a trait currently not included in protist lastly the organisms size determines competition between the organisms finkel 2007 to have a point of reference the size of the pfts was derived from routine monitoring data by taking the median size per pft however protist sizes within a community are often not normally distributed but rather bi or multimodal as there is only one size per pft and the handling rate of the prey depends mainly on the relation between predator and prey size the chosen size of the organisms impacts the model results applying multiple species per pft may give better results but will also increase calculation times at the same time with only one species per pft the model results look realistic we conclude that while these 1d v models have caveats the model results are realistic and the caveats correspond to the chosen model schematization an interesting outcome of this study was the coupling of the trophic pathways for cms within protist even though the model equations used in protist for the different trophic pathways are quite detailed in their physiological descriptions the trade off between the phototrophic and phagotrophic pathways for cms is not both the phototrophic and phagotrophic pathways are accessible to cms the efficiency of each trophic pathway per pft is set using measured physiological parameters derived from literature cms have a lower affinity to light lower α c h l and a lower chlorophyll a carbon quota compared to diatoms and green algae geider et al 1997 additionally cms have very low ingestion rates during night skovgaard 1996 li et al 1999 adolf et al 2006 anderson et al 2018 compared to protozooplankton so it can be hypothesized that cms employ their mixotrophic genes to remain competitive litchman 2007 consequently cms do well in environments and seasons in which there is an advantage of combining both trophic modes hartmann et al 2012 such environments or seasons have a low supply of dissolved inorganic nutrients and or prey mitra et al 2014 the great ocean gyres can be classified as such environments and so it is not surprising that recent research has found mixoplankton to occur notably in the world s oceans faure et al 2019 global warming and the construction of offshore windfarms may change the pelagic environment towards stronger stratification and longer nutrient limitation falkowski 1994 richardson and schoeman 2003 falkowski and oliver 2007 this could allow cms to become successful due to their mixotrophic genes as many harmful algal blooms are caused by cms burkholder et al 2008 it is important for managers to have access to adequate monitoring and modelling techniques with which to assess the probability of potentially harmful cms occurring peperzak 2003 5 conclusion this study has shown that the newly developed module protist for delft3d waq is capable of modelling different pfts that interact with compete against and graze on each other the module protist responds to biogeochemical gradients and results in different trophic compositions for the protist communities very similar to in situ observations in those simulations where comparison is useful furthermore this study used modelling results to provide a layer of evidence that the availability of dissolved inorganic phosphate and silica drives the occurrence of cms in a system with strong gradients of dissolved inorganic nutrients and suspended sediments this study demonstrates that protist can be applied in an aem setting aems provide an important tool to help understand and predict the consequence of changing pressures on the productivity of an ecosystem schuwirth et al 2019 especially against the background of future anthropogenic changes in coastal environments it is important that aems such as the one presented here can model the main trophic pathways within the protist community under dynamic conditions credit authorship contribution statement lisa k schneider undertook

continuous measurements of ψ residue are impractical thus a practical model to estimate ψ residue would be useful for models of residue decomposition to obtain data for a model of ψ residue for cereal rye secale cereale l and crimson clover trifolium incarnatum l we conducted studies that evaluated the effects of 1 residue stage of decomposition on water release curve 2 relative humidity rh on ψ residue 3 soil moisture on residue gravimetric water content θ g 4 precipitation on θ g and 5 diurnal changes in rh and temperature on ψ residue results showed that water release curves for cereal rye and crimson clover changed as decomposition progressed and that parameters for these curves could be estimated from residue lignin content both types of residues rewetted at a similar rate when exposed to high rh but when rewetted by rainfall cereal rye required a lower amount of rainfall than crimson clover to reach maximum water content results of these studies were used to develop calibrate and validate a model of ψ residue that requires inputs of initial water and lignin contents of the residue as well as hourly values of relative humidity air temperature and precipitation comparison of observed vs simulated data indicated the model simulates reasonably well the observed diurnal patterns of surface ψ residue with r2 0 84 because this model requires a small set of

tillage ct defined as any tillage and planting system that leaves a minimum of 30 of crop residues at the soil surface after planting soil science glossary terms committee 2008 is often implemented to reduce soil disturbance and is considered a key component of a soil health management system usda nrcs 2017 rotations with cover crops work synergistically with reduced tillage by contributing to crop diversity breaking disease and pest cycles and providing soil cover through live cover crops or residue mulches reicosky 2015 combined implementation of reduced tillage and cover crops is a set of best management practices that aim to improve soil water and nutrient conservation the efficacy of a surface residue in providing these benefits is dependent on decomposition processes microbial activity within the soil and residue is the most significant driver of residue decomposition douglas and rickman 1992 and is largely influenced by residue characteristics and environmental conditions in particular water availability the availability of water in residue is often expressed in terms of water potential ψ an expression of the energy required to extract water relative to pure free water water potential is central to microbial survival and activity parr and papendick 1978 and the interaction of ψ and temperature is often the primary determinant of which microbial communities will colonize the residue substrate as well as their growth and nutrient utilization magan and lynch 1986 quemada et al 1997 singh et al 2009 tolerance to low and high ψ varies widely between species though in general higher values of ψ support greater microbial growth enzymatic activity and movement bacterial tolerances range from 0 to 10 mpa while fungi can tolerate potentials in the range of 0 to 60 mpa harris 1981 water potential is also a primary determinant of water movement as differences in ψ existing between the air residue and soil drive water movement from areas of higher potential to lower potential bristow et al 1986 the ψ of surface residue ψ residue typically fluctuates due to its intermediate location between the soil and atmosphere and its continual exposure to water content fluctuations as air temperature and or solar radiation increase during the day relative humidity rh decreases and atmospheric demand for water increases drawing water from the residue bristow et al 1986 strømdahl 2000 khanchi et al 2018 thapa et al 2021b as rh increases during the evening absorption of moisture from the air increases ψ residue snow et al 1944 sain and broadbent 1975 manstretta and rossi 2015 thapa et al 2021b precipitation as rainfall or dewfall can also increase ψ residue and serve as a major catalyst for making residue substrate available for degradation kieft 1987 manzoni et al 2012 moyano et al 2013 a better understanding of water dynamics in surface residue is essential for predicting residue decomposition and for improving on farm water and nutrient management in ct systems bristow et al 1986 to this end simulation models can be utilized to describe complex mass and energy transfers and may be effective for estimating ψ of cover crop residues on the soil surface a ψ residue model that is driven by site specific and easily obtained environmental variables such as temperature and rh may be calibrated to local conditions and allow for estimation of ψ residue as a function of time several models of ψ residue have been developed bristow et al 1986 stroo et al al 1989 iq et al 2001 findeling et al 2003 but many of these models require many parameters and input data that are difficult to obtain to our knowledge a simple model that simulates ψ residue of cereal rye secale cereale l and crimson clover trifolium incarnatum l is currently unavailable therefore with the overall goal of obtaining data for the development of such a model some of the objectives of this work were to evaluate the effects of 1 residue stage of decomposition on the water release curve of cereal rye and crimson clover residues 2 rh on ψ residue 3 soil moisture on θ g 4 precipitation on θ g 5 diurnal changes in rh and temperature on ψ residue an additional objective was to use the collected data to develop calibrate and validate a model to estimate ψ residue from hourly air temperature rh and rainfall variables commonly available from weather stations 2

greater biomass yields than crimson clover after sample collection cover crops were terminated with a herbicide and both crimson clover and cereal rye strips were further divided into three blocks nine litter bags of each residue were deployed on the soil surface in respective cover crop strips with three litter bags in each block at 0 2 and 4 weeks one litter bag from each block was randomly collected and dried at 65 c for 48 h to determine residue biomass on a dry weight basis thus the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications detailed description on

analyses table 1 van soest 1963a 1963b woodruff et al 2018 water release curves were developed for the residue samples collected at different stages of decomposition for that purpose ziploc bags were filled with 10 g residue using an equal ratio of leaves and stems and varying volumes of deionized di water were added to obtain θ g values ranging from 0 1 to 3 g h2o g 1 dry matter following equilibration for 12 h at 2 c subsamples were removed in triplicate from each bag placed in sample cups and ψ residue was measured using a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter meter group inc pullman wa which

effect of air relative humidity rh on residue water potential ψ residue residues of cereal rye and crimson clover collected in georgia at 0 weeks were used for this study a constant humidity chamber was constructed using a plastic container 36 cm l 23 cm w 14 cm h placed within a precision model 815 incubator precision scientific winchester va set at 30 c vacuum regulated by a dwyer vfb 66 flowmeter dwyer michigan city in was used to draw air through the chamber at 0 2 l min 1 air temperature and rh within the chamber and within the incubator were monitored and recorded at 5 min intervals with hmp155a probes connected to a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific logan ut to study the rate of residue rewetting at high rh air delivered to the chamber was humidified to 93 rh by bubbling it through di water and wp4 c sample cups were filled with 0 5 g of air dry cereal rye 0 03 g h2o g 1 dry matter or crimson clover 0 04 g h2o g 1 dry matter residue cut into 3 cm pieces sample cups were removed in triplicate every 0 5 h for the first 2 h and every 2 h thereafter up to 24 h to measure ψ residue using a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter to study the rate of residue drying at low rh lab air at 33 rh was circulated through the chamber cereal rye and crimson clover residues were prepared by saturating them with di water and allowing them to equilibrate at 2 c for 12 h initial θ g of cereal rye and crimson clover residues were 3 56 g h2o g 1 dry matter and 4 05 g h2o g 1 dry matter respectively after determining residue θ g a wet weight equivalent of 0 5 g oven dry residue was placed in wp4 c sample cups which were then placed in the drying chamber the residues cups were removed from the chamber in triplicate every 1 to 3 h over a 24 h period and the ψ residue was measured with a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter 2 3 effect of soil water content on residue water content θ g to study changes in ψ residue when dry residue was placed on wet soil air dry soil from the georgia site was packed into aluminum moisture cans 8 cm id 5 cm h at a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 and di water was added to each can to bring the soil water content to 0 03 mpa the cans were sealed and soil moisture was allowed to equilibrate for 48 h crimson clover and cereal rye residue collected at 0 weeks from the georgia site were dried to 0 1 g h2o g 1 dry matter cut to a length of 3 5 cm and surface applied on wet soil to each can at a rate corresponding to 7 587 kg ha 1 for cereal rye and 3 684 kg ha 1 for crimson clover these rates produced a mulch layer of 2 to 3 cm on the soil surface with a lower layer in direct contact with the soil and with upper layers that did not contact the soil in addition cans containing only residue served as controls to account for the effect of rh within the incubator cans were placed within a precision model 815 incubator set at 22 c air temperature and rh within the incubator were measured and recorded at 5 min intervals with a hmp155a probe connected to a cr1000 datalogger two cans per residue type and two controls were removed from the incubator at 0 2 0 5 1 3 5 8 12 15 and 19 h residues were removed from the soil surface of each can and sealed in a ziploc bag after which ψ residue was measured in duplicate with a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter to study changes in the ψ residue of wet residues in contact with low moisture soil the procedure described above was modified in the following ways soil was air dried under laboratory conditions until reaching a target of 1 5 mpa permanent wilting point stott et al 1986 and then packed into cans at a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 a ziploc bag was filled with air dry residues of crimson clover or cereal rye and di water added to obtain a target residue water content of 2 g h2o g 1 dry matter following equilibration wetted residues 1 44 g h2o g 1dry matter for rye and 1 97 g h2o g 1 dry matter for crimson clover were applied to each can and cans were sealed with lids to exclude the effect of the atmosphere on residue drying while in the incubator two cans per residue type were removed from the incubator at 0 2 0 5 1 3 5 8 12 15 and 19 h and the ψ residue was measured in triplicate with a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter 2 4 effect of precipitation on residue water content θ g to determine the response of residue θ g to rainfall an indoor rainfall simulation study was conducted with residues collected at 0 weeks from the georgia site two simulators were installed at a height of 2 m from the ground with each simulator consisting of 256 hypodermic needles 23 gage by 25 4 mm uniformly spaced on a 0 09 m2 acrylic panel a peristaltic pump connected to plastic tubing delivered di water to each simulator at a flow rate of 50 mm h 1 which generated 10 4 mg droplets kissel et al 2004 air dry crimson clover θ g 0 03 g h2o g 1 dry matter or cereal rye residue θ g 0 05 g h2o g 1 dry matter was placed on 0 07 m2 metal sieve trays at the dry weight equivalent of 3000 or 6 000 kg ha 1 there were three replications per residue rate and two residue rates per residue species trays were placed directly on the ground below simulators and elevated 5 cm from the floor to allow water drainage from the tray simulated rain was allowed to fall on the trays in 5 min intervals corresponding to 4 17 mm of rainfall per interval between intervals trays were vigorously shaken to remove surface water on the residue and then weighed trays were subsequently placed back under the simulators and rainfall was resumed simulation continued in this manner until a stabilization in weight was obtained which was determined by a change in tray weight 1 between two consecutive rainfall intervals residue θ g was then regressed against rainfall amount mm during the course of rainfall simulations air temperature within the lab fluctuated between 21 and 22 c 2 5 effect of diurnal changes in rh and temperature on residue water potential six field studies were conducted at the georgia site to measure diurnal fluctuations in ψ residue as affected by rh and air temperature june 8 august 15 16 and september 5 2018 july 24 25 august 28 29 and september 11 12 2019 the dry weight equivalent of 0 5 g of air dry crimson clover or cereal rye residue collected at 0 weeks from the georgia site was added to wp4 c sample cups and placed on top of cereal rye or crimson clover residue cover at the georgia site strips a subset of the samples was exposed to dew and a subset was shielded from dew by using small plastic tents placed right above the samples samples of each residue species were collected in triplicate every 3 to 4 h during each study and ψ residue was measured with a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter 2 6 statistical analyses the statistical software jmp v 15 sas institute inc 2019 was used to determine parameters a and b of the nonlinear model for the water release curves subsequently stepwise regression in sas software version 9 4 sas institute inc 2015 was used to regress the parameters of the nonlinear model for both cereal rye and crimson clover against residue n carb cell and lig these variables were considered because they are continuously simulated in the decomposition model to which the model of ψ residue will be coupled and therefore could be used if found significant at any stage in the decomposition to estimate the parameters of the moisture release curve the sum of squares errors obtained when fitting the nonlinear model to the water release curves were used to perform a conditional error test to determine if the nonlinear models fitted to the water release curve for each cover crop residue at each decomposition stage were significantly different from each other milliken and debruin 1978 for that purpose we conducted pairwise comparisons of the water release curves fitted to a given crop residue at different stages of decomposition the null hypothesis ho in the conditional error test was that a single model could be used to describe two different datasets two water release curves from different decomposition stages the alternative hypothesis ha was that two different model were needed to describe the two datasets to obtain the sum of squares residual under ho ssres ho we fitted a single model to the two datasets and to obtain the sum of squares residual under ha ssres ha we fitted individual models to each of the two datasets and added the two sum of squares residuals to calculate the sum of squares residuals due to deviations from ho ssres devho we subtracted ssres ha from ssres ho similarly the degrees of freedom df for ssres devho were calculated by subtracting the degress of freedom of ssres ha from the degrees of freedom of ssres ho finally an f test was performed with ssres devho df in the numerator and ssres ha df in the denominator if the f value was greater than the table f value with corresponding degrees of freedom at p 0 05 ho was rejected and the conclusion was reached that the two models were significantly different we used proc mixed in sas v 9 4 to analyze the effect of cover crop species rye or crimson clover on ψ residue at different hours of rewetting under constant high rh or on ψ residue at different hours of drying under constant low rh the analysis considered residue type and time as fixed factors and replication as a random factor proc mixed was also used to separately analyze the effect of contact time with wet or dry soil on ψ residue time was considered a fixed factor and replication a random factor to analyze the effect of simulated rain amounts on θ g of cereal rye or crimson clover residue at two rates 3000 or 6 000 kg ha 1 we used proc mixed considering dry matter rate and rain amount as fixed factors and replication as a random factor with compound symmetry as the covariance structure the θ g measured at different amounts of rain was considered a repeated measurement a nonlinear regression model was fitted to the data of θ g versus simulated rain amount using jmp v 15 2 7 model development we developed a model simulating ψ residue of surface cover crop residues that is driven by hourly data commonly monitored by weather stations namely rh air temperature and precipitation measured at a 2 m height a stock variable in the model represents residue θ g which changes based on inward and outward flows fig s1 during simulation water moves into the residue according to differences in ψ between the residue and atmosphere and water moves out of the residue according to residue θ g rh and ambient temperature the residue can also gain water via dewfall and precipitation 2 8 model calibration model parameters were calibrated manually using data from a 41 h field study described in section 2 5 which was conducted on august 15 16 2018 statistical tools used for calibration included root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and r2 values for observed vs simulated data nash and sutcliffe 1970 addiscott and whitmore 1987 quemada and cabrera 1995b in general a statistically satisfactory model simulation results in a low rmse and an r2 value greater than 0 5 nse values between 0 and 1 are generally indicative of acceptable model performance moriasi et al 2007 2 9 model validation model performance was validated with five of the six diurnal studies described in section 2 5 june 8 and september 5 2018 july 24 25 august 28 29 and september 11 12 2019 the same statistical tools used for calibration were used for model validation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of residue decomposition on the water release curve the water potential of residues has three main components gravitational potential matric potential and osmotic potential with the latter two being the most important for surface residues the matric potential represents the capacity of the residue to retain water due to adsorption and capillary effects caused by physical characteristics such as pore sizes as well as chemical characteristics the osmotic potential represents the capacity of the residue to retain water due to the presence of solutes in the water young and sisson 2002 fitting the nonlinear model in eq 1 to ψ residue versus residue θ g for the different cover crop residues at different decomposition stages yielded r2 values ranging from 0 80 to 0 99 fig 1 with progressive decomposition residues held less water at a given ψ residue and more readily approached saturation ψ residue 0 mpa as residue θ g increased the conditional error test performed for pairwise comparisons of models indicated that within each residue type the water release models were significantly different as decomposition progressed table 2 these results are in agreement with findings of several studies coppens et al 2007 findeling et al 2007 dunlop et al 2016 khanchi et al 2018 thapa et al 2021b and are due in part to the leaching of solutes as residues decompose which decreases the osmotic potential and progressively shifts the primary component of ψ residue to the matric potential myrold et al 1981 in addition porosity of residue tissues increases as cellulose and hemicellulose are enzymatically degraded over time allowing water to be more readily gained and lost by plant tissue and altering the maximum water content possible maloney and paulpuro 1999 quemada and cabrera 2002 iqbal et al 2013 the stepwise regression of parameters a and b on residue n carb cell and lign contents showed that lign was the only significant variable that could be used to estimate both parameters of the water release curve fig 2 soluble carbohydrates are decomposed first from the residues which increases lignin concentration as decomposition progresses table 2 as lignin concentrations in the residues increased parameter a increased less negative whereas parameter b decreased more negative a single regression to estimate model parameters for all residues is convenient because it does not require the user to identify the type of cover crop residue in order to determine the regression model to be used 3 2 effect of air relative humidity rh on residue water potential ψ residue when studying the influence of high rh on residue rewetting temperature within the chamber fluctuated between 27 8 and 28 5 c and rh ranged from 88 to 94 the relationship of ψ residue vs time displayed an exponential trend with ψ residue changing most drastically within the first 5 h of rewetting and approaching equilibrium with air ψ ψ air after 15 h fig 3 a cereal rye ψ residue increased from 135 4 mpa 0 06 g h2o g 1 dry matter 11 7 mpa 0 42 g h2o g 1 dry matter crimson clover ψ residue increased from 103 5 mpa 0 08 g h2o g 1 dry matter to 11 4 mpa 0 60 g h2o g 1 dry matter fig 3a the relatively fast increase in ψ residue observed agrees with the rapid increases in ψ observed overnight by cassity duffey et al 2015 in a field study of broiler litter applied to the soil surface which suggests that rh is one of the main controlling factors in rewetting surface residues the analysis of variance showed a significant p 0 0001 residue type x time interaction effect on residue rewetting which was due to differences in ψ residue between cereal rye and crimson clover residues at 0 and 0 5 h p 0 001 these were mainly caused by slightly different initial amounts of θ g in the residues despite notable differences in residue chemistry table 1 the rewetting rates of cereal rye and crimson clover residues were similar after 0 5 h when placed under identical conditions of rh and temperature fig 3a moisture absorption by plant material in contact with air is a physical phenomenon involving van der waal forces between water molecules and hydroxyl groups of residue cell walls as rh exceeds 70 a significant amount of water uptake is not actually sorbed but held loosely within residue pores as a result of capillary condensation strømdahl 2000 when studying the influence of low rh on residue drying temperature and rh within the chamber fluctuated between 29 4 and 30 4 c and between 31 and 33 respectively cereal rye ψ residue decreased from 0 6 mpa 2 93 g h2og 1 dry matter to 153 9 mpa 0 05 g h2o g 1 dry matter crimson clover ψ residue decreased from 0 7 mpa 3 06 g h2o g 1 dry matter to 147 9 mpa 0 06 g h2o g 1 dry matter fig 3b the ψ residue displayed a logistic trend with time with ψ residue changing at a much slower rate than that observed in the rewetting study the analysis of variance showed a significant p 0 07 residue type x time interaction effect on residue drying which was due to differences in ψ residue between crimson clover and cereal rye residues at more than 15 h of drying p 0 05 fig 3b at 15 h the water potential was lower than 100 mpa at which very little to no decomposition is expected thapa et al 2021b therefore a single model was used for changes in ψ residue as residue dries also because field observations presented below indicate a much faster drying of residues these results suggest that other factors in addition to rh control residue drying under field conditions in the modeling description below temperature is used as a variable involved in residue drying 3 3 effect of soil water content on residue water content θ g when cereal rye residue at 0 1 g h2o g 1 dry matter 69 mpa was placed in contact with wet soil at 0 03 mpa 0 28 g h2o g 1 dry matter the ψ residue increased significantly from 67 mpa to 38 mpa in 3 h and from 38 mpa to a maximum of 25 mpa after 18 h p 0 05 similarly for crimson clover the ψ residue increased significantly from 68 mpa to 40 mpa in 3 h and from 40 mpa to a maximum of 28 mpa after 18 h p 0 05 this corresponds to average increases in residue θ g of only 15 for cereal rye and 25 for crimson clover according to the temperature and water potential adjustment factor developed by thapa et al 2021a the rate of residue decomposition at average conditions of 26 mpa the average water potential at which the residues equilibrated in our study and 22 c would be less than 0 1 of the maximum possible thus we can conclude that residue rewetting from soil under our conditions would have a negligible effect on residue decomposition when compared to the effects of rh sain and broadbent 1975 and rainfall consequently we decided to omit the effect of residue rewetting from soil in the ψ residue model which served to simplify the model and improve its utility for users without access to hourly soil moisture data for their site or a specific water release curve for their soil when wet residue was placed in contact with dry soil at 1 5 mpa we observed a small but significant p 0 05 increase in rye residue θ g from 1 44 to 1 56 g h2o g 1 dry matter increase in ψ residue from 2 8 to 2 1 mpa and a small but significant p 0 05 increase in crimson clover residue θ g from 1 97 to 2 08 g h2o g 1 dry matter increase in ψ residue from 2 8 to 1 6 mpa these observed small increases in residue θ g were likely because the wet residues at time 0 still had ψ lower than that of the dry soil at time 0 i e 2 8 mpa for wet residues vs 1 5 mpa for dry soil as a result we observed no drying of wet residues even when placed in contact with the dry soil 3 4 effect of precipitation on residue water content θ g the θ g of both residue species increased rapidly with the first 6 mm of rainfall after which gains in residue moisture progressively diminished as residues approached maximum water content fig 4 this trend was likewise observed by manstretta and rossi 2015 when developing a relationship between rainfall and water content of corn stalk residue cereal rye residue did not attain a θ g of 3 g h2o g 1 dry matter until receiving 25 mm of rainfall fig 4a whereas crimson clover residue θ g reached that value after only 12 mm of rainfall fig 4b this disparity is likely a result of differences in the residue morphology and chemistry crimson clover provided a larger surface area for rainfall interception due to its wider leaves and greater leaf stem ratio whereas the surface area of cereal rye was lower due to its characteristically thinner leaves and lower leaf stem ratio barnett et al 2002 such morphological and anatomical differences existing between plant residues are likely crucial for determining a residue s propensity to undergo water recharge during precipitation events shane et al 2000 iqbal et al 2013 a greater proportion of stems in the cereal rye treatments likely inhibited residue water uptake due to a greater concentration of lignin in stems than in leaves and thus a greater hydrophobicity of stem tissues quemada and cabrera 1995a horwath 2015 thapa et al 2021b in addition to lignin concentration quemada and cabrera 2002 suggested that the greater water absorption and retention properties of crimson clover residues are largely determined by a greater concentration of soluble constituents i e greater osmotic potential and thus proposed soluble carbohydrate content as a good predictor of a residue s maximum water content it should be noted that a residue s propensity to undergo water recharge also changes significantly with progressive decomposition the increased porosity of decomposed residues leads to a more rapid absorption of rainwater and attainment of saturation followed by the dripping and infiltration of water into the soil the rate of water evaporation from the residue is also increased with increased porosity coppens et al 2006 thus decomposition stage is likely to have a significant effect on a residue layer s interception and retention of rainwater for cereal rye residue we found a significant interaction p 0 05 of dry matter rate x rain amount on residue θ g which was due to small differences in θ g at large rain amounts at rain 33 mm which corresponds to θ g 3 0 g h2o g 1 dry matter the θ g of rye residue was about 0 25 g h2o g 1 dry matter greater at 3 000 kg ha 1 than at 6 000 kg ha 1 according to the water release curve for cereal rye 0 week table 1 an increase in θ g from 3 to 3 25 g h2o g 1 dry matter would increase ψ residue from 1 06 to 0 96 mpa which in turn would increase the rate of residue decomposition by less than 2 5 at 20 c as per the adjustment factor developed by thapa et al 2021a for clover residue dry matter rate and the dry matter rate x rain amount interaction had no significant effect on θ g given the lack of effect of dry matter rate on crimson clover residue θ g and the low effect of dry matter rate on cereal rye θ g a single nonlinear regression model was fit to data from both dry matter rates for each residue type fig 4 the regressions obtained were later incorporated into the ψ residue model as described below to estimate changes in θ g of surface residues due to a rain event in general our results showed similar wetting patterns at the two dry matter rates for each residue type fig 4a b this could be attributed to differences in surface area between the two dry matter rates which led to different amounts of rain interception and throughfall we measured about twice as much throughfall at 3000 kg ha 1 than at 6000 kg ha 1 data not shown and as a result a given rain amount produced about the same θ g at both dry matter rates 3 5 effect of diurnal changes in rh and temperature on residue water potential ψ residue as described above a total of six studies were conducted at the georgia site from 2018 2019 to measure fluctuations in ψ residue under field conditions and to assess the effect of diurnal changes in rh and temperature results for five of those studies are shown in figs 5 and 6 average temperature for these studies ranged from 17 to 32 c and average rh fluctuated from 39 to 97 fluctuations in ψ residue corresponding to diurnal fluctuations in rh were observed in each of these studies maximum ψ residue measurements were recorded at times of peak rh about 6 am while minimum values were recorded at times of lowest rh about 3 30 pm the average ψ residue of residue shielded from dew fluctuated diurnally from 16 3 mpa to 210 5 mpa for cereal rye and from 17 2 mpa to 190 6 mpa for crimson clover such drastic changes in ψ residue closely mirror diurnal changes in ψ air as air temperature and solar radiation increase during the day rh decreases and atmospheric demand for water increases drawing water from the residue likewise as rh increases during the night the dried residue absorbs water from the atmosphere parr and papendick 1978 bristow et al 1986 cassity duffey et al 2015 manstretta and rossi 2015 khanchi et al 2018 thapa et al 2021b in agreement with findings from our previously described lab study of rh and ψ residue the wetting and drying behavior of cereal rye and crimson clover residue was very similar when residues were exposed to the same conditions of rh and temperature in the field figs 5 and 6 a subset of residue samples was exposed to dewfall in four of the six diurnal studies and removed in triplicate at hours of peak rh an average deposition of 0 23 mm of dew was estimated across the four studies n 14 this aligns with the findings of cassity duffey et al 2015 who recorded an average of 0 2 mm of dew daily in a microlysimeter study under similar conditions dew deposition increased θ g of residues by averages of 0 49 g h2o g 1 dry matter 10 4 mpa std dev 1 4 mpa for cereal rye and 0 86 g h2o g 1 dry matter 11 4 mpa std dev 2 1 mpa for crimson clover the increase in residue θ g following dewfall was consistently greater for clover than for cereal rye across all four studies aligning with results from the rainfall simulation study large increases in θ g due to dew were recorded at rh values as low as 85 at a 2 m height 3 6 model development the developed model uses a small number of variables table s1 and a small set of inputs namely initial water and lignin contents of the residue and hourly rh air temperature and precipitation the residue lignin content is used to estimate the parameters of the water release curve for the residue as shown in fig 2 rh and temperature are used to calculate air wp ψ air using the following equation 2 ψ air r t 273 15 v l n rh 1 m p a 1 000 000 p a where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 t is the air temperature at 2 m height c v is the partial molar volume of water 1 8 10 5 m3 mol 1 and rh is the relative humidity of air at 2 m height expressed as a fraction 0 1 transfer of water from the air to the residue occurs with a positive change in rh between timesteps rht rh t 1 the transfer of water from air to surface residues i e residue rewetting usually occurs during nighttime and early morning hours when the rh of the air increases and is driven by the ψ gradient between surface residues and the air above it the rate of residue rewetting due to positive change in rh and ψ gradient is modeled using the following equations 3 δ residue θ g δ t k 1 ψ gradient where δ residue θ g δ t is the rate of residue rewetting and is expressed as per unit gain in residue θ g per unit change in time g h2o g 1 dry matter h 1 δ t is the change in time h k 1 is a rate constant g h2o g 1 dry matter h 1 mpa 1 and ψ gradient is the ψ gradient between air and surface residues mpa the rate constant k 1 described below was used as the initial value for the model based on results from the lab study on rewetting residue the value of k1 is greater for clover than for rye because of the differences in initial water content as described above 4 k 1 0 0038 δ r h 0 a n d ψ gradient 30 0 002 c l o v e r and δ r h 0 a n d ψ gradient 30 0 001 r y e and δ r h 0 a n d ψ gradient 30 0 δ r h 0 the transfer of water from surface residues to air via evaporation i e residue drying occurs during daytime hours when the rh of the air decreases δ rh 0 the rate of residue drying due to negative change in rh of the air is modeled using the following equations 5 δ residue θ g δ t k 2 δ r h 0 0 δ r h 0 6 k 2 c t residue θ g where δ residue θ g δ t is the rate of residue drying and is expressed as per unit loss in residue θ g per unit change in time g h2o g 1 dry matter h 1 δ t is the change in time h k 2 is the rate constant g h2o g 1 dry matter h 1 and c is a constant 0 to 1 transfer of water into the residue as a result of dew occurs once a day when there is no rain and the r h t exceeds 85 if the residue θ g is below 2 5 g h2o g 1 dry matter and residue biomass exceeds 1 500 kg ha 1 dew deposition increases θ g of cereal rye and crimson clover residues by 0 49 and 0 86 g h2o g 1 dry matter respectively according to average values measured during the diurnal field studies if rht decreases below 85 in the hour following dew deposition the θ g of cereal rye and crimson lover residues decreases by 0 2 and 0 4 g h2o g 1 dry matter respectively due to fast evaporation the rain effect on θ g of cereal rye and crimson clover residues was modeled as a function of rainfall amount using the following equations derived from the rainfall simulation study fig 3 7 residue θ g 0 8523 1 e x p 0 9523 r a i n 2 9558 1 e x p 0 0583 r a i n r y e 1 6414 1 e x p 0 4351 r a i n 4 3623 1 e x p 0 0324 r a i n c l o v e r where r a i n is the total rain in mm i e hourly rainfall rain amount equivalent to the initial residue θ g at the onset of rain event the increase in residue θ g due to a rain event was determined by subtracting the initial residue θ g at the onset of rain from the final residue θ g resulted from the total rain for both residue types the residue θ g is dropped by 0 7 g h2o g 1 dry matter due to drainage in the first hour following the cessation of the rain event 3 7 model calibration the model was calibrated using data from a 41 h diurnal study conducted on aug 15 16 2018 as described above throughout the course of that study air temperature and rh at a 2 m height fluctuated from 19 to 32 c and from 46 to 99 respectively the ψ residue of cereal rye residue fluctuated from a maximum of 15 1 mpa 0 33 g h2o g 1dry matter to a minimum 263 2 mpa 0 03 g h2o g 1 dry matter fluctuations in crimson clover residue ranged from 19 2 mpa 0 37 g h2o g 1 dry matter to 174 4 mpa 0 05 g h2o g 1 dry matter model simulations of ψ residue were compared with measured values and the drying and rewetting rates were calibrated to align model simulations with measured data after calibration with the field measured data the same value of k 1 was satisfactory for modeling residue rewetting for both residue species and hence eqs 3 and 4 were modified in the final calibrated model as follows 8 δ residue θ g δ t k 1 ψ gradient k 1 ψ gradient 0 01 0 02 k 1 ψ gradient 0 01 9 k 1 0 0008 δ r h 0 a n d ψ gradient 30 0 0004 δ r h 0 a n d ψ gradient 30 0 δ r h 0 the value of k 2 for evaporation is a function of residue θ g air temperature and the constant 0 01 the same rate of evaporation was applied to both residue species and evaporation was set to no longer occur if θ g falls below 0 04 g h2o g 1 dry matter hence eqs 5 and 6 were modified in the final calibrated model as follows 10 δ residue θ g δ t 0 residue θ g 0 04 and δ rh 0 0 001 residue θ g 0 04 and δ rh 2 5 0 085 residue θ g 0 04 and δ rh 2 5 and k 2 0 03 k 2 residue θ g 0 04 and δ rh 2 5 and k 2 0 03 11 k 2 0 01 t residue θ g additionally a limit of 200 mpa was placed on ψ residue to prevent excessive decreases in residue θ g considering the purpose of the model strict accuracy in this very negative range is not required due to negligible thapa et al 2021b residue decomposition at ψ residue values below 60 mpa harris 1981 regression analysis provided a good fit of modeled vs measured ψ residue data for cereal rye and crimson clover residues providing nse values of 0 90 and 0 92 respectively and r2 values of 0 96 and 0 99 respectively 3 8 model validation model performance was validated with five diurnal studies conducted from 2018 to 2019 june 8 and september 5 2018 july 24 25 august 28 29 and september 11 12 2019 yielding a total of 39 measurements per residue species fig 5 and 6 in general the model simulated relatively well the observed diurnal patterns in ψ residue the simulated ψ residue reached its maximum value during early morning hours when the peak in rh was observed fig 5 and 6 as rh decreased the simulated ψ residue also decreased and reached values as low as 200 mpa in the afternoon the rmse value was 28 6 mpa for the combined data of both residues table 3 it should be noted that this relatively high rmse value was mainly due to differences between measured and observed values at very low water potentials 60 mpa when microbial activity would be expected to be nil in contrast the rmse value was 10 2 mpa n 19 for the ψ residue range of 0 to 20 mpa which is where most microbial activity occurs in general in the higher ψ residue range of 0 to 20 mpa the model tended to underpredict ψ residue with a mean difference of 7 9 mpa and a standard deviation of 6 5 mpa with 17 simulated values being underpredictions and only two being slight overpredictions by 1 to 2 mpa we believe this underprediction would likely lead to more realistic ψ residue under field conditions because ψ residue values in this study were measured with sample cups containing a 1 cm thick layer of surface residues whereas in the field cover crop residue layers are typically thicker than 1 cm and therefore are likely to rewet to an average ψ residue that is more negative than the surface 1 cm layer separate measurements taken during four of the diurnal studies n 14 were utilized to evaluate model performance when dewfall occurred the model performed well as indicated by a rmse of 3 3 mpa as peak rh increased from 85 to 98 residues gained progressively less moisture a pattern also observed by khanchi et al 2018 there is potential to improve the simulation of dew deposition by implementing a dynamic increase in residue θ g based on peak rh or ψ residue at time of dewfall rather than using a fixed value increase additional field measurements will be necessary to further validate model performance when simulating changes in ψ residue and residue θ g immediately following dew deposition or rainfall and to determine how these events affect residue moisture throughout the remainder of the diurnal period 4 conclusions our studies showed that the water release curves for cereal rye and crimson clover changed as decomposition progressed and that parameters for the nonlinear model describing these curves could be estimated from residue lignin content we also found that both types of residues rewetted rapidly when exposed to high relative humidity and that the amount of rainfall needed to reach maximum water content was lower for crimson clover than for cereal rye residues field observations showed a wide diurnal fluctuation in ψ residue which was due to residue rewetting under high rh during night and early morning hours followed by drying during daylight hours a simple model developed with the collected data simulates ψ residue with few parameters and a small set of input variables namely initial water and lignin contents of the residue and hourly rh air temperature and precipitation validation studies indicated that the model simulates relatively well the observed diurnal patterns of ψ residue and θ g of surface cereal rye and crimson clover residues the small set of parameters and input data allows fast estimation of ψ residue which presents a practical advantage over more detailed models because ψ residue has a pronounced effect on microbial activity this simple model may be incorporated into existing process based decomposition models to estimate decomposition and n mineralization from cover crop residues remaining on the soil surface credit author statement carson e dann

24548,cover crops are usually planted between cash crops to protect the soil take up residual soil nitrate and release nitrogen n to subsequent crops following cover crop termination residues may remain on the soil surface where their decomposition is largely dependent on residue temperature and water potential ψ residue while it is possible to continuously measure residue temperature continuous measurements of ψ residue are impractical thus a practical model to estimate ψ residue would be useful for models of residue decomposition to obtain data for a model of ψ residue for cereal rye secale cereale l and crimson clover trifolium incarnatum l we conducted studies that evaluated the effects of 1 residue stage of decomposition on water release curve 2 relative humidity rh on ψ residue 3 soil moisture on residue gravimetric water content θ g 4 precipitation on θ g and 5 diurnal changes in rh and temperature on ψ residue results showed that water release curves for cereal rye and crimson clover changed as decomposition progressed and that parameters for these curves could be estimated from residue lignin content both types of residues rewetted at a similar rate when exposed to high rh but when rewetted by rainfall cereal rye required a lower amount of rainfall than crimson clover to reach maximum water content results of these studies were used to develop calibrate and validate a model of ψ residue that requires inputs of initial water and lignin contents of the residue as well as hourly values of relative humidity air temperature and precipitation comparison of observed vs simulated data indicated the model simulates reasonably well the observed diurnal patterns of surface ψ residue with r2 0 84 because this model requires a small set of parameters and input variables its use may be more practical than that of more detailed models keywords surface residue decomposition relative humidity crimson clover cereal rye abbreviations c carbon

tillage ct defined as any tillage and planting system that leaves a minimum of 30 of crop residues at the soil surface after planting soil science glossary terms committee 2008 is often implemented to reduce soil disturbance and is considered a key component of a soil health management system usda nrcs 2017 rotations with cover crops work synergistically with reduced tillage by contributing to crop diversity breaking disease and pest cycles and providing soil cover through live cover crops or residue mulches reicosky 2015 combined implementation of reduced tillage and cover crops is a set of best management practices that aim to improve soil water and nutrient conservation the efficacy of a surface residue in providing these benefits is dependent on decomposition processes microbial activity within the soil and residue is the most significant driver of residue decomposition douglas and rickman 1992 and is largely influenced by residue characteristics and environmental conditions in particular water availability the availability of water in residue is often expressed in terms of water potential ψ an expression of the energy required to extract water relative to pure free water water potential is central to microbial survival and activity parr and papendick 1978 and the interaction of ψ and temperature is often the primary determinant of which microbial communities will colonize the residue substrate as well as their growth and nutrient utilization magan and lynch 1986 quemada et al 1997 singh et al 2009 tolerance to low and high ψ varies widely between species though in general higher values of ψ support greater microbial growth enzymatic activity and movement bacterial tolerances range from 0 to 10 mpa while fungi can tolerate potentials in the range of 0 to 60 mpa harris 1981 water potential is also a primary determinant of water movement as differences in ψ existing between the air residue and soil drive water movement from areas of higher potential to lower potential bristow et al 1986 the ψ of surface residue ψ residue typically fluctuates due to its intermediate location between the soil and atmosphere and its continual exposure to water content fluctuations as air temperature and or solar radiation increase during the day relative humidity rh decreases and atmospheric demand for water increases drawing water from the residue bristow et al 1986 strømdahl 2000 khanchi et al 2018 thapa et al 2021b as rh increases during the evening absorption of moisture from the air increases ψ residue snow et al 1944 sain and broadbent 1975 manstretta and rossi 2015 thapa et al 2021b precipitation as rainfall or dewfall can also increase ψ residue and serve as a major catalyst for making residue substrate available for degradation kieft 1987 manzoni et al 2012 moyano et al 2013 a better understanding of water dynamics in surface residue is essential for predicting residue decomposition and for improving on farm water and nutrient management in ct systems bristow et al 1986 to this end simulation models can be utilized to describe complex mass and energy transfers and may be effective for estimating ψ of cover crop residues on the soil surface a ψ residue model that is driven by site specific and easily obtained environmental variables such as temperature and rh may be calibrated to local conditions and allow for estimation of ψ residue as a function of time several models of ψ residue have been developed bristow et al 1986 stroo et al al 1989 iq et al 2001 findeling et al 2003 but many of these models require many parameters and input data that are difficult to obtain to our knowledge a simple model that simulates ψ residue of cereal rye secale cereale l and crimson clover trifolium incarnatum l is currently unavailable therefore with the overall goal of obtaining data for the development of such a model some of the objectives of this work were to evaluate the effects of 1 residue stage of decomposition on the water release curve of cereal rye and crimson clover residues 2 rh on ψ residue 3 soil moisture on θ g 4 precipitation on θ g 5 diurnal changes in rh and temperature on ψ residue an additional objective was to use the collected data to develop calibrate and validate a model to estimate ψ residue from hourly air temperature rh and rainfall variables commonly available from weather stations 2 materials and methods 2 1 effect of residue decomposition stage on the water release curve the cover crop residues used for this study were collected from sites in georgia and maryland usa in georgia

heiden ch at dry mass equivalent rates of 7 587 kg ha 1 for cereal rye and 3 684 kg ha 1 for crimson clover which were the respective average yields measured in 2018 in both years cereal rye produced greater biomass yields than crimson clover after sample collection cover crops were terminated with a herbicide and both crimson clover and cereal rye strips were further divided into three blocks nine litter bags of each residue were deployed on the soil surface in respective cover crop strips with three litter bags in each block at 0 2 and 4 weeks one litter bag from each block was randomly collected and dried at 65 c for 48 h to determine residue biomass on a dry weight basis thus the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications detailed description on

analyses table 1 van soest 1963a 1963b woodruff et al 2018 water release curves were developed for the residue samples collected at different stages of decomposition for that purpose ziploc bags were filled with 10 g residue using an equal ratio of leaves and stems and varying volumes of deionized di water were added to obtain θ g values ranging from 0 1 to 3 g h2o g 1 dry matter following equilibration for 12 h at 2 c subsamples were removed in triplicate from each bag placed in sample cups and ψ residue was measured using a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter meter group inc pullman wa which

effect of air relative humidity rh on residue water potential ψ residue residues of cereal rye and crimson clover collected in georgia at 0 weeks were used for this study a constant humidity chamber was constructed using a plastic container 36 cm l 23 cm w 14 cm h placed within a precision model 815 incubator precision scientific winchester va set at 30 c vacuum regulated by a dwyer vfb 66 flowmeter dwyer michigan city in was used to draw air through the chamber at 0 2 l min 1 air temperature and rh within the chamber and within the incubator were monitored and recorded at 5 min intervals with hmp155a probes connected to a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific logan ut to study the rate of residue rewetting at high rh air delivered to the chamber was humidified to 93 rh by bubbling it through di water and wp4 c sample cups were filled with 0 5 g of air dry cereal rye 0 03 g h2o g 1 dry matter or crimson clover 0 04 g h2o g 1 dry matter residue cut into 3 cm pieces sample cups were removed in triplicate every 0 5 h for the first 2 h and every 2 h thereafter up to 24 h to measure ψ residue using a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter to study the rate of residue drying at low rh lab air at 33 rh was circulated through the chamber cereal rye and crimson clover residues were prepared by saturating them with di water and allowing them to equilibrate at 2 c for 12 h initial θ g of cereal rye and crimson clover residues were 3 56 g h2o g 1 dry matter and 4 05 g h2o g 1 dry matter respectively after determining residue θ g a wet weight equivalent of 0 5 g oven dry residue was placed in wp4 c sample cups which were then placed in the drying chamber the residues cups were removed from the chamber in triplicate every 1 to 3 h over a 24 h period and the ψ residue was measured with a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter 2 3 effect of soil water content on residue water content θ g to study changes in ψ residue when dry residue was placed on wet soil air dry soil from the georgia site was packed into aluminum moisture cans 8 cm id 5 cm h at a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 and di water was added to each can to bring the soil water content to 0 03 mpa the cans were sealed and soil moisture was allowed to equilibrate for 48 h crimson clover and cereal rye residue collected at 0 weeks from the georgia site were dried to 0 1 g h2o g 1 dry matter cut to a length of 3 5 cm and surface applied on wet soil to each can at a rate corresponding to 7 587 kg ha 1 for cereal rye and 3 684 kg ha 1 for crimson clover these rates produced a mulch layer of 2 to 3 cm on the soil surface with a lower layer in direct contact with the soil and with upper layers that did not contact the soil in addition cans containing only residue served as controls to account for the effect of rh within the incubator cans were placed within a precision model 815 incubator set at 22 c air temperature and rh within the incubator were measured and recorded at 5 min intervals with a hmp155a probe connected to a cr1000 datalogger two cans per residue type and two controls were removed from the incubator at 0 2 0 5 1 3 5 8 12 15 and 19 h residues were removed from the soil surface of each can and sealed in a ziploc bag after which ψ residue was measured in duplicate with a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter to study changes in the ψ residue of wet residues in contact with low moisture soil the procedure described above was modified in the following ways soil was air dried under laboratory conditions until reaching a target of 1 5 mpa permanent wilting point stott et al 1986 and then packed into cans at a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 a ziploc bag was filled with air dry residues of crimson clover or cereal rye and di water added to obtain a target residue water content of 2 g h2o g 1 dry matter following equilibration wetted residues 1 44 g h2o g 1dry matter for rye and 1 97 g h2o g 1 dry matter for crimson clover were applied to each can and cans were sealed with lids to exclude the effect of the atmosphere on residue drying while in the incubator two cans per residue type were removed from the incubator at 0 2 0 5 1 3 5 8 12 15 and 19 h and the ψ residue was measured in triplicate with a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter 2 4 effect of precipitation on residue water content θ g to determine the response of residue θ g to rainfall an indoor rainfall simulation study was conducted with residues collected at 0 weeks from the georgia site two simulators were installed at a height of 2 m from the ground with each simulator consisting of 256 hypodermic needles 23 gage by 25 4 mm uniformly spaced on a 0 09 m2 acrylic panel a peristaltic pump connected to plastic tubing delivered di water to each simulator at a flow rate of 50 mm h 1 which generated 10 4 mg droplets kissel et al 2004 air dry crimson clover θ g 0 03 g h2o g 1 dry matter or cereal rye residue θ g 0 05 g h2o g 1 dry matter was placed on 0 07 m2 metal sieve trays at the dry weight equivalent of 3000 or 6 000 kg ha 1 there were three replications per residue rate and two residue rates per residue species trays were placed directly on the ground below simulators and elevated 5 cm from the floor to allow water drainage from the tray simulated rain was allowed to fall on the trays in 5 min intervals corresponding to 4 17 mm of rainfall per interval between intervals trays were vigorously shaken to remove surface water on the residue and then weighed trays were subsequently placed back under the simulators and rainfall was resumed simulation continued in this manner until a stabilization in weight was obtained which was determined by a change in tray weight 1 between two consecutive rainfall intervals residue θ g was then regressed against rainfall amount mm during the course of rainfall simulations air temperature within the lab fluctuated between 21 and 22 c 2 5 effect of diurnal changes in rh and temperature on residue water potential six field studies were conducted at the georgia site to measure diurnal fluctuations in ψ residue as affected by rh and air temperature june 8 august 15 16 and september 5 2018 july 24 25 august 28 29 and september 11 12 2019 the dry weight equivalent of 0 5 g of air dry crimson clover or cereal rye residue collected at 0 weeks from the georgia site was added to wp4 c sample cups and placed on top of cereal rye or crimson clover residue cover at the georgia site strips a subset of the samples was exposed to dew and a subset was shielded from dew by using small plastic tents placed right above the samples samples of each residue species were collected in triplicate every 3 to 4 h during each study and ψ residue was measured with a wp4 c dewpoint potentiameter 2 6 statistical analyses the statistical software jmp v 15 sas institute inc 2019 was used to determine parameters a and b of the nonlinear model for the water release curves subsequently stepwise regression in sas software version 9 4 sas institute inc 2015 was used to regress the parameters of the nonlinear model for both cereal rye and crimson clover against residue n carb cell and lig these variables were considered because they are continuously simulated in the decomposition model to which the model of ψ residue will be coupled and therefore could be used if found significant at any stage in the decomposition to estimate the parameters of the moisture release curve the sum of squares errors obtained when fitting the nonlinear model to the water release curves were used to perform a conditional error test to determine if the nonlinear models fitted to the water release curve for each cover crop residue at each decomposition stage were significantly different from each other milliken and debruin 1978 for that purpose we conducted pairwise comparisons of the water release curves fitted to a given crop residue at different stages of decomposition the null hypothesis ho in the conditional error test was that a single model could be used to describe two different datasets two water release curves from different decomposition stages the alternative hypothesis ha was that two different model were needed to describe the two datasets to obtain the sum of squares residual under ho ssres ho we fitted a single model to the two datasets and to obtain the sum of squares residual under ha ssres ha we fitted individual models to each of the two datasets and added the two sum of squares residuals to calculate the sum of squares residuals due to deviations from ho ssres devho we subtracted ssres ha from ssres ho similarly the degrees of freedom df for ssres devho were calculated by subtracting the degress of freedom of ssres ha from the degrees of freedom of ssres ho finally an f test was performed with ssres devho df in the numerator and ssres ha df in the denominator if the f value was greater than the table f value with corresponding degrees of freedom at p 0 05 ho was rejected and the conclusion was reached that the two models were significantly different we used proc mixed in sas v 9 4 to analyze the effect of cover crop species rye or crimson clover on ψ residue at different hours of rewetting under constant high rh or on ψ residue at different hours of drying under constant low rh the analysis considered residue type and time as fixed factors and replication as a random factor proc mixed was also used to separately analyze the effect of contact time with wet or dry soil on ψ residue time was considered a fixed factor and replication a random factor to analyze the effect of simulated rain amounts on θ g of cereal rye or crimson clover residue at two rates 3000 or 6 000 kg ha 1 we used proc mixed considering dry matter rate and rain amount as fixed factors and replication as a random factor with compound symmetry as the covariance structure the θ g measured at different amounts of rain was considered a repeated measurement a nonlinear regression model was fitted to the data of θ g versus simulated rain amount using jmp v 15 2 7 model development we developed a model simulating ψ residue of surface cover crop residues that is driven by hourly data commonly monitored by weather stations namely rh air temperature and precipitation measured at a 2 m height a stock variable in the model represents residue θ g which changes based on inward and outward flows fig s1 during simulation water moves into the residue according to differences in ψ between the residue and atmosphere and water moves out of the residue according to residue θ g rh and ambient temperature the residue can also gain water via dewfall and precipitation 2 8 model calibration model parameters were calibrated manually using data from a 41 h field study described in section 2 5 which was conducted on august 15 16 2018 statistical tools used for calibration included root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and r2 values for observed vs simulated data nash and sutcliffe 1970 addiscott and whitmore 1987 quemada and cabrera 1995b in general a statistically satisfactory model simulation results in a low rmse and an r2 value greater than 0 5 nse values between 0 and 1 are generally indicative of acceptable model performance moriasi et al 2007 2 9 model validation model performance was validated with five of the six diurnal studies described in section 2 5 june 8 and september 5 2018 july 24 25 august 28 29 and september 11 12 2019 the same statistical tools used for calibration were used for model validation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of residue decomposition on the water release curve the water potential of residues has three main components gravitational potential matric potential and osmotic potential with the latter two being the most important for surface residues the matric potential represents the capacity of the residue to retain water due to adsorption and capillary effects caused by physical characteristics such as pore sizes as well as chemical characteristics the osmotic potential represents the capacity of the residue to retain water due to the presence of solutes in the water young and sisson 2002 fitting the nonlinear model in eq 1 to ψ residue versus residue θ g for the different cover crop residues at different decomposition stages yielded r2 values ranging from 0 80 to 0 99 fig 1 with progressive decomposition residues held less water at a given ψ residue and more readily approached saturation ψ residue 0 mpa as residue θ g increased the conditional error test performed for pairwise comparisons of models indicated that within each residue type the water release models were significantly different as decomposition progressed table 2 these results are in agreement with findings of several studies coppens et al 2007 findeling et al 2007 dunlop et al 2016 khanchi et al 2018 thapa et al 2021b and are due in part to the leaching of solutes as residues decompose which decreases the osmotic potential and progressively shifts the primary component of ψ residue to the matric potential myrold et al 1981 in addition porosity of residue tissues increases as cellulose and hemicellulose are enzymatically degraded over time allowing water to be more readily gained and lost by plant tissue and altering the maximum water content possible maloney and paulpuro 1999 quemada and cabrera 2002 iqbal et al 2013 the stepwise regression of parameters a and b on residue n carb cell and lign contents showed that lign was the only significant variable that could be used to estimate both parameters of the water release curve fig 2 soluble carbohydrates are decomposed first from the residues which increases lignin concentration as decomposition progresses table 2 as lignin concentrations in the residues increased parameter a increased less negative whereas parameter b decreased more negative a single regression to estimate model parameters for all residues is convenient because it does not require the user to identify the type of cover crop residue in order to determine the regression model to be used 3 2 effect of air relative humidity rh on residue water potential ψ residue when studying the influence of high rh on residue rewetting temperature within the chamber fluctuated between 27 8 and 28 5 c and rh ranged from 88 to 94 the relationship of ψ residue vs time displayed an exponential trend with ψ residue changing most drastically within the first 5 h of rewetting and approaching equilibrium with air ψ ψ air after 15 h fig 3 a cereal rye ψ residue increased from 135 4 mpa 0 06 g h2o g 1 dry matter 11 7 mpa 0 42 g h2o g 1 dry matter crimson clover ψ residue increased from 103 5 mpa 0 08 g h2o g 1 dry matter to 11 4 mpa 0 60 g h2o g 1 dry matter fig 3a the relatively fast increase in ψ residue observed agrees with the rapid increases in ψ observed overnight by cassity duffey et al 2015 in a field study of broiler litter applied to the soil surface which suggests that rh is one of the main controlling factors in rewetting surface residues the analysis of variance showed a significant p 0 0001 residue type x time interaction effect on residue rewetting which was due to differences in ψ residue between cereal rye and crimson clover residues at 0 and 0 5 h p 0 001 these were mainly caused by slightly different initial amounts of θ g in the residues despite notable differences in residue chemistry table 1 the rewetting rates of cereal rye and crimson clover residues were similar after 0 5 h when placed under identical conditions of rh and temperature fig 3a moisture absorption by plant material in contact with air is a physical phenomenon involving van der waal forces between water molecules and hydroxyl groups of residue cell walls as rh exceeds 70 a significant amount of water uptake is not actually sorbed but held loosely within residue pores as a result of capillary condensation strømdahl 2000 when studying the influence of low rh on residue drying temperature and rh within the chamber fluctuated between 29 4 and 30 4 c and between 31 and 33 respectively cereal rye ψ residue decreased from 0 6 mpa 2 93 g h2og 1 dry matter to 153 9 mpa 0 05 g h2o g 1 dry matter crimson clover ψ residue decreased from 0 7 mpa 3 06 g h2o g 1 dry matter to 147 9 mpa 0 06 g h2o g 1 dry matter fig 3b the ψ residue displayed a logistic trend with time with ψ residue changing at a much slower rate than that observed in the rewetting study the analysis of variance showed a significant p 0 07 residue type x time interaction effect on residue drying which was due to differences in ψ residue between crimson clover and cereal rye residues at more than 15 h of drying p 0 05 fig 3b at 15 h the water potential was lower than 100 mpa at which very little to no decomposition is expected thapa et al 2021b therefore a single model was used for changes in ψ residue as residue dries also because field observations presented below indicate a much faster drying of residues these results suggest that other factors in addition to rh control residue drying under field conditions in the modeling description below temperature is used as a variable involved in residue drying 3 3 effect of soil water content on residue water content θ g when cereal rye residue at 0 1 g h2o g 1 dry matter 69 mpa was placed in contact with wet soil at 0 03 mpa 0 28 g h2o g 1 dry matter the ψ residue increased significantly from 67 mpa to 38 mpa in 3 h and from 38 mpa to a maximum of 25 mpa after 18 h p 0 05 similarly for crimson clover the ψ residue increased significantly from 68 mpa to 40 mpa in 3 h and from 40 mpa to a maximum of 28 mpa after 18 h p 0 05 this corresponds to average increases in residue θ g of only 15 for cereal rye and 25 for crimson clover according to the temperature and water potential adjustment factor developed by thapa et al 2021a the rate of residue decomposition at average conditions of 26 mpa the average water potential at which the residues equilibrated in our study and 22 c would be less than 0 1 of the maximum possible thus we can conclude that residue rewetting from soil under our conditions would have a negligible effect on residue decomposition when compared to the effects of rh sain and broadbent 1975 and rainfall consequently we decided to omit the effect of residue rewetting from soil in the ψ residue model which served to simplify the model and improve its utility for users without access to hourly soil moisture data for their site or a specific water release curve for their soil when wet residue was placed in contact with dry soil at 1 5 mpa we observed a small but significant p 0 05 increase in rye residue θ g from 1 44 to 1 56 g h2o g 1 dry matter increase in ψ residue from 2 8 to 2 1 mpa and a small but significant p 0 05 increase in crimson clover residue θ g from 1 97 to 2 08 g h2o g 1 dry matter increase in ψ residue from 2 8 to 1 6 mpa these observed small increases in residue θ g were likely because the wet residues at time 0 still had ψ lower than that of the dry soil at time 0 i e 2 8 mpa for wet residues vs 1 5 mpa for dry soil as a result we observed no drying of wet residues even when placed in contact with the dry soil 3 4 effect of precipitation on residue water content θ g the θ g of both residue species increased rapidly with the first 6 mm of rainfall after which gains in residue moisture progressively diminished as residues approached maximum water content fig 4 this trend was likewise observed by manstretta and rossi 2015 when developing a relationship between rainfall and water content of corn stalk residue cereal rye residue did not attain a θ g of 3 g h2o g 1 dry matter until receiving 25 mm of rainfall fig 4a whereas crimson clover residue θ g reached that value after only 12 mm of rainfall fig 4b this disparity is likely a result of differences in the residue morphology and chemistry crimson clover provided a larger surface area for rainfall interception due to its wider leaves and greater leaf stem ratio whereas the surface area of cereal rye was lower due to its characteristically thinner leaves and lower leaf stem ratio barnett et al 2002 such morphological and anatomical differences existing between plant residues are likely crucial for determining a residue s propensity to undergo water recharge during precipitation events shane et al 2000 iqbal et al 2013 a greater proportion of stems in the cereal rye treatments likely inhibited residue water uptake due to a greater concentration of lignin in stems than in leaves and thus a greater hydrophobicity of stem tissues quemada and cabrera 1995a horwath 2015 thapa et al 2021b in addition to lignin concentration quemada and cabrera 2002 suggested that the greater water absorption and retention properties of crimson clover residues are largely determined by a greater concentration of soluble constituents i e greater osmotic potential and thus proposed soluble carbohydrate content as a good predictor of a residue s maximum water content it should be noted that a residue s propensity to undergo water recharge also changes significantly with progressive decomposition the increased porosity of decomposed residues leads to a more rapid absorption of rainwater and attainment of saturation followed by the dripping and infiltration of water into the soil the rate of water evaporation from the residue is also increased with increased porosity coppens et al 2006 thus decomposition stage is likely to have a significant effect on a residue layer s interception and retention of rainwater for cereal rye residue we found a significant interaction p 0 05 of dry matter rate x rain amount on residue θ g which was due to small differences in θ g at large rain amounts at rain 33 mm which corresponds to θ g 3 0 g h2o g 1 dry matter the θ g of rye residue was about 0 25 g h2o g 1 dry matter greater at 3 000 kg ha 1 than at 6 000 kg ha 1 according to the water release curve for cereal rye 0 week table 1 an increase in θ g from 3 to 3 25 g h2o g 1 dry matter would increase ψ residue from 1 06 to 0 96 mpa which in turn would increase the rate of residue decomposition by less than 2 5 at 20 c as per the adjustment factor developed by thapa et al 2021a for clover residue dry matter rate and the dry matter rate x rain amount interaction had no significant effect on θ g given the lack of effect of dry matter rate on crimson clover residue θ g and the low effect of dry matter rate on cereal rye θ g a single nonlinear regression model was fit to data from both dry matter rates for each residue type fig 4 the regressions obtained were later incorporated into the ψ residue model as described below to estimate changes in θ g of surface residues due to a rain event in general our results showed similar wetting patterns at the two dry matter rates for each residue type fig 4a b this could be attributed to differences in surface area between the two dry matter rates which led to different amounts of rain interception and throughfall we measured about twice as much throughfall at 3000 kg ha 1 than at 6000 kg ha 1 data not shown and as a result a given rain amount produced about the same θ g at both dry matter rates 3 5 effect of diurnal changes in rh and temperature on residue water potential ψ residue as described above a total of six studies were conducted at the georgia site from 2018 2019 to measure fluctuations in ψ residue under field conditions and to assess the effect of diurnal changes in rh and temperature results for five of those studies are shown in figs 5 and 6 average temperature for these studies ranged from 17 to 32 c and average rh fluctuated from 39 to 97 fluctuations in ψ residue corresponding to diurnal fluctuations in rh were observed in each of these studies maximum ψ residue measurements were recorded at times of peak rh about 6 am while minimum values were recorded at times of lowest rh about 3 30 pm the average ψ residue of residue shielded from dew fluctuated diurnally from 16 3 mpa to 210 5 mpa for cereal rye and from 17 2 mpa to 190 6 mpa for crimson clover such drastic changes in ψ residue closely mirror diurnal changes in ψ air as air temperature and solar radiation increase during the day rh decreases and atmospheric demand for water increases drawing water from the residue likewise as rh increases during the night the dried residue absorbs water from the atmosphere parr and papendick 1978 bristow et al 1986 cassity duffey et al 2015 manstretta and rossi 2015 khanchi et al 2018 thapa et al 2021b in agreement with findings from our previously described lab study of rh and ψ residue the wetting and drying behavior of cereal rye and crimson clover residue was very similar when residues were exposed to the same conditions of rh and temperature in the field figs 5 and 6 a subset of residue samples was exposed to dewfall in four of the six diurnal studies and removed in triplicate at hours of peak rh an average deposition of 0 23 mm of dew was estimated across the four studies n 14 this aligns with the findings of cassity duffey et al 2015 who recorded an average of 0 2 mm of dew daily in a microlysimeter study under similar conditions dew deposition increased θ g of residues by averages of 0 49 g h2o g 1 dry matter 10 4 mpa std dev 1 4 mpa for cereal rye and 0 86 g h2o g 1 dry matter 11 4 mpa std dev 2 1 mpa for crimson clover the increase in residue θ g following dewfall was consistently greater for clover than for cereal rye across all four studies aligning with results from the rainfall simulation study large increases in θ g due to dew were recorded at rh values as low as 85 at a 2 m height 3 6 model development the developed model uses a small number of variables table s1 and a small set of inputs namely initial water and lignin contents of the residue and hourly rh air temperature and precipitation the residue lignin content is used to estimate the parameters of the water release curve for the residue as shown in fig 2 rh and temperature are used to calculate air wp ψ air using the following equation 2 ψ air r t 273 15 v l n rh 1 m p a 1 000 000 p a where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 t is the air temperature at 2 m height c v is the partial molar volume of water 1 8 10 5 m3 mol 1 and rh is the relative humidity of air at 2 m height expressed as a fraction 0 1 transfer of water from the air to the residue occurs with a positive change in rh between timesteps rht rh t 1 the transfer of water from air to surface residues i e residue rewetting usually occurs during nighttime and early morning hours when the rh of the air increases and is driven by the ψ gradient between surface residues and the air above it the rate of residue rewetting due to positive change in rh and ψ gradient is modeled using the following equations 3 δ residue θ g δ t k 1 ψ gradient where δ residue θ g δ t is the rate of residue rewetting and is expressed as per unit gain in residue θ g per unit change in time g h2o g 1 dry matter h 1 δ t is the change in time h k 1 is a rate constant g h2o g 1 dry matter h 1 mpa 1 and ψ gradient is the ψ gradient between air and surface residues mpa the rate constant k 1 described below was used as the initial value for the model based on results from the lab study on rewetting residue the value of k1 is greater for clover than for rye because of the differences in initial water content as described above 4 k 1 0 0038 δ r h 0 a n d ψ gradient 30 0 002 c l o v e r and δ r h 0 a n d ψ gradient 30 0 001 r y e and δ r h 0 a n d ψ gradient 30 0 δ r h 0 the transfer of water from surface residues to air via evaporation i e residue drying occurs during daytime hours when the rh of the air decreases δ rh 0 the rate of residue drying due to negative change in rh of the air is modeled using the following equations 5 δ residue θ g δ t k 2 δ r h 0 0 δ r h 0 6 k 2 c t residue θ g where δ residue θ g δ t is the rate of residue drying and is expressed as per unit loss in residue θ g per unit change in time g h2o g 1 dry matter h 1 δ t is the change in time h k 2 is the rate constant g h2o g 1 dry matter h 1 and c is a constant 0 to 1 transfer of water into the residue as a result of dew occurs once a day when there is no rain and the r h t exceeds 85 if the residue θ g is below 2 5 g h2o g 1 dry matter and residue biomass exceeds 1 500 kg ha 1 dew deposition increases θ g of cereal rye and crimson clover residues by 0 49 and 0 86 g h2o g 1 dry matter respectively according to average values measured during the diurnal field studies if rht decreases below 85 in the hour following dew deposition the θ g of cereal rye and crimson lover residues decreases by 0 2 and 0 4 g h2o g 1 dry matter respectively due to fast evaporation the rain effect on θ g of cereal rye and crimson clover residues was modeled as a function of rainfall amount using the following equations derived from the rainfall simulation study fig 3 7 residue θ g 0 8523 1 e x p 0 9523 r a i n 2 9558 1 e x p 0 0583 r a i n r y e 1 6414 1 e x p 0 4351 r a i n 4 3623 1 e x p 0 0324 r a i n c l o v e r where r a i n is the total rain in mm i e hourly rainfall rain amount equivalent to the initial residue θ g at the onset of rain event the increase in residue θ g due to a rain event was determined by subtracting the initial residue θ g at the onset of rain from the final residue θ g resulted from the total rain for both residue types the residue θ g is dropped by 0 7 g h2o g 1 dry matter due to drainage in the first hour following the cessation of the rain event 3 7 model calibration the model was calibrated using data from a 41 h diurnal study conducted on aug 15 16 2018 as described above throughout the course of that study air temperature and rh at a 2 m height fluctuated from 19 to 32 c and from 46 to 99 respectively the ψ residue of cereal rye residue fluctuated from a maximum of 15 1 mpa 0 33 g h2o g 1dry matter to a minimum 263 2 mpa 0 03 g h2o g 1 dry matter fluctuations in crimson clover residue ranged from 19 2 mpa 0 37 g h2o g 1 dry matter to 174 4 mpa 0 05 g h2o g 1 dry matter model simulations of ψ residue were compared with measured values and the drying and rewetting rates were calibrated to align model simulations with measured data after calibration with the field measured data the same value of k 1 was satisfactory for modeling residue rewetting for both residue species and hence eqs 3 and 4 were modified in the final calibrated model as follows 8 δ residue θ g δ t k 1 ψ gradient k 1 ψ gradient 0 01 0 02 k 1 ψ gradient 0 01 9 k 1 0 0008 δ r h 0 a n d ψ gradient 30 0 0004 δ r h 0 a n d ψ gradient 30 0 δ r h 0 the value of k 2 for evaporation is a function of residue θ g air temperature and the constant 0 01 the same rate of evaporation was applied to both residue species and evaporation was set to no longer occur if θ g falls below 0 04 g h2o g 1 dry matter hence eqs 5 and 6 were modified in the final calibrated model as follows 10 δ residue θ g δ t 0 residue θ g 0 04 and δ rh 0 0 001 residue θ g 0 04 and δ rh 2 5 0 085 residue θ g 0 04 and δ rh 2 5 and k 2 0 03 k 2 residue θ g 0 04 and δ rh 2 5 and k 2 0 03 11 k 2 0 01 t residue θ g additionally a limit of 200 mpa was placed on ψ residue to prevent excessive decreases in residue θ g considering the purpose of the model strict accuracy in this very negative range is not required due to negligible thapa et al 2021b residue decomposition at ψ residue values below 60 mpa harris 1981 regression analysis provided a good fit of modeled vs measured ψ residue data for cereal rye and crimson clover residues providing nse values of 0 90 and 0 92 respectively and r2 values of 0 96 and 0 99 respectively 3 8 model validation model performance was validated with five diurnal studies conducted from 2018 to 2019 june 8 and september 5 2018 july 24 25 august 28 29 and september 11 12 2019 yielding a total of 39 measurements per residue species fig 5 and 6 in general the model simulated relatively well the observed diurnal patterns in ψ residue the simulated ψ residue reached its maximum value during early morning hours when the peak in rh was observed fig 5 and 6 as rh decreased the simulated ψ residue also decreased and reached values as low as 200 mpa in the afternoon the rmse value was 28 6 mpa for the combined data of both residues table 3 it should be noted that this relatively high rmse value was mainly due to differences between measured and observed values at very low water potentials 60 mpa when microbial activity would be expected to be nil in contrast the rmse value was 10 2 mpa n 19 for the ψ residue range of 0 to 20 mpa which is where most microbial activity occurs in general in the higher ψ residue range of 0 to 20 mpa the model tended to underpredict ψ residue with a mean difference of 7 9 mpa and a standard deviation of 6 5 mpa with 17 simulated values being underpredictions and only two being slight overpredictions by 1 to 2 mpa we believe this underprediction would likely lead to more realistic ψ residue under field conditions because ψ residue values in this study were measured with sample cups containing a 1 cm thick layer of surface residues whereas in the field cover crop residue layers are typically thicker than 1 cm and therefore are likely to rewet to an average ψ residue that is more negative than the surface 1 cm layer separate measurements taken during four of the diurnal studies n 14 were utilized to evaluate model performance when dewfall occurred the model performed well as indicated by a rmse of 3 3 mpa as peak rh increased from 85 to 98 residues gained progressively less moisture a pattern also observed by khanchi et al 2018 there is potential to improve the simulation of dew deposition by implementing a dynamic increase in residue θ g based on peak rh or ψ residue at time of dewfall rather than using a fixed value increase additional field measurements will be necessary to further validate model performance when simulating changes in ψ residue and residue θ g immediately following dew deposition or rainfall and to determine how these events affect residue moisture throughout the remainder of the diurnal period 4 conclusions our studies showed that the water release curves for cereal rye and crimson clover changed as decomposition progressed and that parameters for the nonlinear model describing these curves could be estimated from residue lignin content we also found that both types of residues rewetted rapidly when exposed to high relative humidity and that the amount of rainfall needed to reach maximum water content was lower for crimson clover than for cereal rye residues field observations showed a wide diurnal fluctuation in ψ residue which was due to residue rewetting under high rh during night and early morning hours followed by drying during daylight hours a simple model developed with the collected data simulates ψ residue with few parameters and a small set of input variables namely initial water and lignin contents of the residue and hourly rh air temperature and precipitation validation studies indicated that the model simulates relatively well the observed diurnal patterns of ψ residue and θ g of surface cereal rye and crimson clover residues the small set of parameters and input data allows fast estimation of ψ residue which presents a practical advantage over more detailed models because ψ residue has a pronounced effect on microbial activity this simple model may be incorporated into existing process based decomposition models to estimate decomposition and n mineralization from cover crop residues remaining on the soil surface credit author statement carson e dann

24549,nutrient pollution is considered as a primary factor of water quality deterioration in urban dominated watersheds in which an informed decision on the management strategies are required to improve the water quality condition the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model is used to evaluate the impacts of pollution by these nutrients using the skudai river watershed in malaysia as a case study a developed land use land cover lu lc scenarios were used to evaluate these impacts statistical methods were employed to assess the extent of these impacts and their significance in shifting the trophic state of the rivers in the watershed the study shows that when urban development increases from 18 2 to 49 2 the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp loads increase from 3 08 to 4 56 10 3 kg yr and from 0 13 to 0 27 103 kg yr respectively streamflow and stream concentrations nh3 n no3 n and po4 p produce varying responses as the watershed land use changes from 1989 to 2039 as the rivers in the watershed shift their trophic state with respect to the level of anthropogenic disturbance within their catchments the tn and tp concentrations at the estuaries are likely to change from oligotrophic to eutrophic state this is an indication that the johor strait and the coastal rivers will be exposed to eutrophication subsequently resulting in harmful algal bloom this condition can be prevented by integrating water quality management alongside urban development because it is observed that a control of non point source nps pollutants from 1 of the urban development will decrease tn and tp concentration in skudai river by 0 023 mg l and 0 004 mg l respectively keywords urban development skudai river watershed hspf model nutrients pollution non point sources 1 introduction the level of nutrient pollution produced from the urban areas is among the leading causes of stream impairment in most urbanized watersheds duan et al 2012 edwards 2016 li et al 2017 for example the conversion of vegetative and wetland areas to impervious surfaces buildings roads etc changes the hydrologic regimes ecosystem distribution and nutrient dynamics hogan et al 2014 bhaskar et al 2016 the impervious surface amplifies runoff volumes and increases transport of nutrient pollutants from areas of non point sources npss these changes adversely affect the water quality and aquatic habitat their functions in stream ecosystems rafferty et al 2013 urban development affects the environment netusil et al 2014 gashi et al 2016 and therefore evaluating its influence on the nutrient dynamics will provide useful information on how to protect the environment and ensure human safety shen et al 2015 there are relatively few studies on effects of urbanization in humid tropical regions humid tropic regions are characterised with extreme weather conditions more rainfall and high temperatures as compared to temperate climates ghaffarianhoseini et al 2019 ayoub et al 2020 depending on the land use type the tendency for excessive sediment and nutrient pollution entering the rivers will be more severe abd wahaba et al 2019 land use is a driver of nutrient pollutants and thus important to be considered in urban planning and watershed management and hence the amount of nutrient pollutants produced due to sudden or gradual urban expansion can be readily determined and applied to support the management of water quality in urbanized settings bello et al 2019 therefore understanding the impact of urban development on nutrient pollutants at watershed scale in a tropical region like malaysia is very important according to sala 2000 the effects of land use changes on the water cycle may outweigh those associated with climate change and this assertion was supported by a study conducted in puget sound basin sun et al 2016 the result shows that urbanization has a much larger effect than climate change on both the magnitude and the seasonal variability in the studied area as observed by tang et al 2011 and lee et al 2017 rapid urbanization is directly associated with an increase in excess nutrients in malaysia and hence changes in characteristics of the watersheds over a period due to human activities should be considered for water quality improvement this will help in determining the impact of the potential anthropogenic activities and mitigation actions alongside the future development häder et al 2020 other water quality studies at watershed scale explore the effects of historical land use changes on surface runoff and nps pollution loading wu et al 2012 wang et al 2016 but their integration into future perspectives are often ignored therefore in some cases the effect of excess nutrients in a potential urban development remains unknown due to the inadequacy of information and restricted urban planning alberti et al 2007 even though unique information and an outlook with regard to the water quality conditions can be derived lee et al 2009 nutrients in themselves are important for the function of aquatic ecosystems but their availability in excess will result in distortion of the ecosystem baron et al 2013 in this study a water quantity and quality model of a tropical river watershed is developed using the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model hspf has been used in modelling several watersheds considering various response parameters that includes the hydrology biru and kumar 2018 lee et al 2020 sediments sarkar et al 2019 and nutrients roostaee and deng 2019 most of the studies have shown the robustness of the hspf model in determining the effects of various best management practices at a watershed scale risal et al 2021 also hspf model have the ability to detect a small change in the land use as input data and provides the likely responses of the watershed alukwe et al 2014 this study will provide information on the variation of tn and tp from nps areas in a tropical watershed system under rapid urbanization settings that will act as a basis for management support and mitigation actions to curtail future water quality problems recently malaysia planned its future economic development corridors out of which johor bahru athe capital of johor state part of the skudai river watershed is one of them the aim was to modernize the economic infrastructures and urban development areas that will attract investors as a result a rapid transformation is taking place in most part of the district the skudai river watershed represents the general characteristics of a tropical

nitrate nitrogen within the pervious and impervious land segments for the pervious land segment pqual nutrient loads are computed by summation of the total loads simulated from the land surface interflow and groundwater as for the impervious areas the nutrient simulation is comparable to that of pqual but without considering the subsurface processes interflow and groundwater and falls under the iqual module all the nutrient fluxes derived from the pervious and impervious lands are channelled to the streams as an additional simulation of the stream nutrient flow li et al 2017 it utilizes the concept of first order die off rate relationship which varies with the time of concentration and the nature of the surface the control of nutrients on the surface runoff known as wash off potential is determined using the estimated accumulation rate wsqop parameter that is needed to wash off significant percent of the nutrients on the land surface the concentration of nutrients in baseflow and interflow can also be assumed as a constant or a monthly variable in hspf lee et al 2020 nutrient die off on the land surface is mainly controlled indirectly by adjusting the maximum nutrient storage at the pervious surface sqolim perlnd the modeler defines the limit value of the nutrient storage for both pervious perlnd and impervious implnd land surface in stream die off at the reaches rchre is modeled using a do and water temperature relationship under anaerobic and aerobic conditions hspf requires information on several hydrologic and water quality parameters in which a lot of literatures capture these parameters as described by usepa 2000 with their typical values yi et al 2020 2 2 study area the skudai river watershed is in the south eastern part of the malaysian peninsula and spans between longitudes of 102 59 54 19 e and 104 11 8 54 e and latitudes of 1 56 31 67 n and 1 22 41 16 n it is a coastal watershed that measures 33 54 km in length by 16 29 km in width with a total catchment area of 287 44 km2 the main river skudai river is 42 8 km in length and discharges directly into the western johor strait as indicated in fig 1 the skudai river watershed

climate dataset suhaila and jemain 2012 spatial variation in rainfall across the study area can be substantial as the annual totals differ by an average of 240 mm and by as much as 460 mm among five precipitation gauge stations in the study area the soils in the watershed are derived from the fine grained soil of the alluvium on the mid and high terrace to acid sulfate soils on undulating plains paramananthan 2000 for the most part the soil had a depth of more than 100 cm and was gently to moderately sloping the soil texture was mostly sand silty clay 81 2 and loamy sand 18 8 based on land use data derived from satellite imagery glovis usgs gov from 2013 and ground truthing 36 9 of skudai watershed was urbanized of which 53 was residential area 0 9 small industries 8 institutions 18 1

commercial 2 6 industrial and 8 4 roads and utilities based on the future development plan drafted by the iskandar regional development authority irda 2011 2 3 the hspf model application basin arcview version 4 1 was used to process the spatial data land use elevation and soil data and interlinked meteorological data using the watershed data management utility from the basin platform the hspf user control input uci file which is the non calibrated model of the study area was produced fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the nps nutrient prediction using hspf model 2 4 input data the data used

obtained from the mmd malaysia meteorological department and did department of irrigation and drainage of malaysia additional meteorological data were also obtained from noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration under the us department of commerce http www noaa gov these data were used to build an input database for model runs via the watershed data management utility subprogram wdmutil both hourly and monthly streamflow records of the watershed were obtained from the did and stream monthly water quality data were collected from the department of the environment of malaysia doe we collected dry and wet atmospheric deposition and point sources data from the doe mmd and indah water konsotium iwk respectively with a monthly time step the soil map of the study area was obtained from the department of agriculture and fisheries doa the elevation data used in this study were acquired from the global data explorer https gdex cr usgs gov gdex and used for the watershed delineation and development of hydrological response units the land use data were developed from remote sensing data retrieved from the united states geological survey usgs eros data centre via the usgs global visualization viewer the imageries were captured by landsat 4 5 thematic mapper and landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapping and operational land imager sensors respectively and were used to produce historical land use land cover lu lc data of the skudai river watershed 2 5 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated using measured hydrological and water quality data by a manual parameter adjustment method and visualized via the hspexp sub program package mishra et al 2017 due to data limitation and variation of the time steps series of the available data for both streamflow and water quality the period considered for hydrological calibration and validation varies with that of water quality some studies have shown the possibility of using data of varied time step or series in modelling process alamanos et al 2019 for the water quality modelling ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ortho phosphate as phosphate po4 p were the only concentrations applied this agrees with several literatures which consider nh3 n and no3 n as the major sources of total nitrogen tn and po4 p as the major source of total phosphorous tp in stormwater chow and yusop 2014 qi et al 2018 the selection of the concentrations also took into account the availability of the data use in the calibration and validation of the model and the ability of the model to compute the tn and tp loads based on the type of concentrations used in model calibration and parameters adjustment li et al 2011 therefore the simulated streamflow nh3 n no3 n and po4 p were compared with their observed values at monthly time steps during the calibration and validation periods two tests were used to assess the performance of the monthly runoff and associated stream concentration simulated by the hspf model the first test was a graphical comparison between the simulated and observed values whereas the second was a quantitative statistical test for the latter the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and percentage bias pbias were implemented the outlined conditions suggested by moriasi et al 2007 were used to evaluate the model performance based on the values obtained for r2 eq 1 nse eq 2 and pbias eq 3 1 r 2 o i o i s i s i s i s i 2 o i o i 2 2 2 n s 1 s i o i 2 o i o i 2 3 p b i a s o i s i o i 100 where o i and s i are the measured and simulated values respectively o i and s i are the means of the measured and simulated values respectively and n is the total amount of data 2 6 land use land cover scenarios the remote sensing data table 2 were used to produce lu lc classes for each corresponding year of the imagery arcgis v 10 3 software was applied for the geometric correction lu lc classification and accuracy assessment using the methodology adopted by ioannis and meliadis 2011 and zhao et al 2012 the historical and current base maps of the study area coupled with field data were used in the classification of the targeted five lu lc classes and lu lc classification accuracy was measured using a confusion matrix and the kappa index then the historical lu lc scenarios of the study area was produced l1 l2 and l3 and the lu lc of 2013 refer as l4 was used as baseline in the calibration and validation of the model however the remote sensing imagery used in this study were selected based on image clarity low percent of cloud cover and the resolutions fiorucci et al 2018 lechner et al 2019 the years selected for the lu lc scenarios are defined on the basis of the above mentioned criteria the methodology utilized by mishra et al 2014 was used to develop a model to project future lu lc changes using a land change model lcm through the idris selva arc view program package three types of input data were created for the lu lc projection the basic lu lc images 1989 and 2009 lu lc the transition potential areas file transitional probability matrix and map and the developed suitability image collection that is used for the transition sub model structure land use for the years 2029 and 2039 were generated and selected to represent future developments of the watershed 20 and 30 years respectively after the historical land use of the year 2009 which was used in the lcm modeller a total of five lu lc scenarios were selected based on the historical and projected urban development of the watershed from 1989 to 2013 and from 2029 to 2039 respectively bello et al 2019 these scenarios were used to assess the impact of lu lc changes on the nutrient dynamics of the skudai river watershed because prior studies have shown that lu lc changes determine the magnitude of nutrient transport to the receiving water rankinen et al 2016 2 7 sensitivity of lu lc composition to total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp loads the sensitivity of the lu lc classes to the nitrogen and phosphorus loads was determined using the method applied by zhang et al 2016 in which the relative sensitivity of two or more related elements can be computed from the relationship defined by eq 4 the objective of the sensitivity analysis was to identify the impact of a single lu lc composition forest land agriculture urban wetland or barren land on the nutrient load from nps areas furthermore this analysis will indicate how lu lc changes alter the influence of a given lu lc class on the nutrient flux over time 4 y i x i x a x a where y is the sensitivity coefficient relative change of yield contributed by the lu lc class to the watershed system for the chosen lu lc scenario x is the yield contributed by the lu lc class in a given year i is the considered lu lc of a given scenario used to generate the yields nutrients and a is the earliest lu lc generated yield e g scenario l1 2 8 evaluation of scenarios five simulation scenarios were developed by application of three historical 1989 1999 2009 and two projected lu lc 2029 and 2039 data sets of skudai river watershed lu lc of the year 2013 is considered as the baseline because it represents the current lu lc status of the watershed and the calibration parameters used in the initial calibration were maintained for the simulation of each scenario the output results of the nps loads of tn and tp in all the scenarios were evaluated and the corresponding simulated stream concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and orthophosphate po4 p at the watershed outlets over the simulation period from 2002 to 2014 were analysed a spatial map of the nps loads of tn and tp for each scenario was generated using arcgis v 10 2 utilizing the natural neighbour interpolation technique vizcaíno et al 2016 and jenks natural breaks classification method was utilized to determine the best arrangement of values of tn and tp loads into different classes within the watershed jiang 2013 the variability in the stream flows and stream concentrations nh3 n no3 n and po4 p was evaluated using non parametric test statistics and taylor diagram which represent three different statistics on the same graph i e the normalized standard deviation the pearson correlation and root mean square difference this diagram taylor 2001 provides a summarized graphical solution on how the simulated outputs of each scenario l1 l2 l3 l5 l6 differs or matches the baseline l4 output results four rivers sengkang senai melana and skudai rivers were selected based on their locations and catchment characteristics to determine their tn and tp concentrations under each simulated lu lc scenario using the method described in the basin technical note 7 usepa 2005 the computed tn and tp concentrations in the runoff were used to characterize the trophic states of the rivers using the criteria proposed by dodds et al 1998 and li et al 2021 this is as shown in table 3 several studies have attempted to determine the trophic conditions of rivers lakes and reservoirs in the region such as by sharip et al 2014 soo et al 2017 umi et al 2020 the intentions of these attempts were to measure how lu lc changes that are derived from urban development affect the water quality conditions of the receiving rivers and also to estimate the likely effects of urbanization on the potential stream eutrophication apart from that the variability of tn and tp can be linked to lu lc changes because it has been observed that changes in the tn and tp concentrations can be attributed to a decreased inflow of nutrients from freshwater yan et al 2016 in the current study the relationship between percentage urban development annual nutrient loads and stream nutrient concentrations under the lu lc scenarios was developed using multiple linear regression the aim was to estimate how increases or decreases in nutrient loads under urbanization settings can affect the stream nutrient concentrations in the watershed which can be used to set the pollutants removal target under varied urban development conditions 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of hspf model the hydrological component of the skudai river watershed was calibrated by adjustment of parameters using observed streamflow data from 2002 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2014 with monthly time steps fig 4 a b the model performance was good with 11 overestimation of the flow for the seven year simulation period the validation results show a satisfactory performance with captured variability of 83 and overestimation of 17 table 4 the nh3 n no3 n and po4 p concentrations were calibrated with a monthly time step from 2002 to 2008 and validated from 2009 to 2014 fig 4c h based on the model performance evaluation the model produced a good simulation output for both the calibration and the validation period for all the modelled stream concentrations table 4 the coefficients of the determinants r2 fall within the range of 0 56 to 0 81 for the calibration period and within the range of 0 62 to 0 77 for the validation period the pbias values for all the calibration and validation results for the stream concentrations show good performances based on the benchmark outlined by moriasi et al 2007 3 2 sensitivity of lu lc classes to tn and tp loads the sensitivity of the tn and tp loads to lu lc classes from nps areas as they varied over time is shown in fig 5 a b and indicates that barren land is more sensitive to both tn and tp loads followed by urban areas and wetland agricultural and forest lands show the lowest sensitivity to tn and tp loads the low sensitivity shown by the forest and agricultural lands was due to the distribution of the lu lc classes in the watershed agricultural and forest lands dominate the upstream part of the watershed while the mid section and downstream parts are dominated by urban areas therefore the response of the watershed to nutrient pollutants will be higher in urban areas as the lu lc changes compared to forest and agricultural lands 3 3 spatial distribution of tn and tp loads under lu lc changes measurement of a watershed response under different lu lc scenarios historical and future changes is crucial for better management of water resources the six lu lc scenarios indicate an increase in the average annual tn load from the nps areas for skudai river watershed most significantly in the urban areas fig 6 a it shows an increase in the tn load as the urban area increases for instance the nps load of tn is expected to double under the l6 scenario fig 6a compared with the l1 scenario it is observed that between the lu lc scenarios of l1 and l2 the tn load in the watershed increases by 10 2 2990 132 to 3295 593 kg yr but between l3 and l4 the tn load increases by only 2 3572 515 to 3653 08 kg yr these results demonstrate that the response of the watershed to tn loads from nps areas depends on the rate of disturbance of the lu lc urban development between l1 and l2 is higher than that between scenarios l3 and l4 see fig 6 also it was observed that between the l4 and l6 scenarios there was a 24 73 increase in the tn load 3653 08 to 4556 605 kg yr from nps areas the reason for the high increase in tn load was that the nps areas were predominantly urban in the l6 scenario unlike scenarios l1 l2 l3 and l4 which the lu lc classes were consolidated and contribute to tn load based on their spatial composition and nutrient accumulation in each sub catchment in the l6 scenario urban areas are expected to cover 49 2 of the watershed unlike the l1 l2 l3 and l4 scenarios where urban areas covered 18 2 30 5 36 and 37 of the watershed respectively the tp distribution under different lu lc scenarios fig 6b shows that the nps load increases with increasing urban development and follows a trend similar to that of tn as discussed earlier annual tp loads are expected to increase by 31 3 in the future considering the average tp loads between the l4 and l6 scenarios 203 82 to 267 76 kg yr on comparing the l1 scenario with the l4 scenario it can be seen that the tp load in the watershed was redistributed as the nps areas changed the l1 scenario fig 6b produced a high tp load at the upstream and downstream parts of the watershed which were dominated by agricultural and urban areas but between the l3 and l6 scenarios the high tp load changes toward the downstream section of the watershed and for sub catchments that are predominantly urban areas this means that urban areas produce higher tn and tp loads than agricultural and forest lands fig 7 shows that the tn and tp loads have a linear relationship with urban development this indicates that tp and tn loads in the watershed will continue to increase as urban development increases the regression equation from these relationships shows that an 1 increase in the urban area in the watershed produces estimated tn and tp loads of 1963 90 and 41 63 kg ha yr respectively it indicates a high tendency toward excess nitrogen and phosphorus in the watershed river system over time 3 4 the variability of stream concentrations under lu lc changes simulated results of the streamflows alongside the nh3 n no3 n and po4 p concentrations at the watershed outlet under different lu lc scenarios were analysed using the jonckheere terpstra non parametric test the test result shows in table 5 the alternative hypothesis of the median values of the simulated streamflows nh3 n no3 n and po4 p concentrations increases with increasing urban development can be accepted and this trend is statistically significant p 0 05 to evaluate the impact of urbanization and its significant on nutrient influx in the watershed a plot of taylor diagram was produced fig 8 a shows the variability of the nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentrations under the lu lc scenarios the ranges of normalized standard deviation nse correlation r and the root mean square difference rmse shows that they are similar in terms of standard deviation their correlation is high and their rmse varies between the baseline l4 and the scenario l1 l2 l3 l5 l6 for the simulated no3 n concentrations it was observed that all scenarios have a rmse values that ranges from 0 15 to 0 4 indicating a significant change in the concentration among the scenarios coupled with the high nse values an evident that no3 n concentrations are spread out over a large range of values and tend to be very far to the mean of the baseline for ammonia nitrogen nh3 n fig 8b they have varied rmse ranges from 0 2 to 0 6 and nse ranges from 0 77 to 0 95 indicating no perfect fit between baseline and the scenarios l1 l2 l3 l5 and l6 respectively also for po4 p concentrations fig 8c and streamflow fig 8d they exhibit similar response as the rmse and nse values fluctuate along the varied ranges the r values shows a direct correlation among the scenarios but all the scenarios showed a significant change when compared with the baseline in terms of nse and rmse values it means that both the nutrients concentration and streamflow spread out over a large range and tend to be far from the mean values for these reasons the results show that urbanization at watershed scale affects the streamflow nh3 n no3 n and po4 p concentrations significantly 3 5 impact of urbanization on the river system in the watershed in order to investigate the effect of urbanization on the watershed river system the changes in tn and tp in the runoff of the sengkang senai melana and skudai rivers were evaluated the rivers produced different trophic classes based on the simulated mean runoff of tn and tp concentrations over the simulated period of 2002 to 2014 under different lu lc scenarios table 6 summarizes the nutrient runoff characteristics n and p of the four selected rivers and the results show that sengkang river produced low total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in all the scenarios indicating low concentration of n and p in the stream the river s lu lc changes only slightly over the six lu lc scenarios as it remains predominately a mixture of forest and agricultural land this maintains the nutrient level of the river for the period of five decades however senai and melana rivers show different trophic conditions over the six scenarios for senai river the l1 and l2 scenarios produced a low nutrient level but in the l3 to the l5 scenario the nutrient level changes from low to intermediate while the l6 scenario shows a high nutrient level in the river runoff the nutrient level remains unchanged from scenario l1 to l2 but it changes from scenario l3 to l5 because urban areas increase from 14 3 in l2 to 25 8 in the l5 scenario with forest land decreasing due to continuous conversion to either urban or agricultural land the same trend was observed in melana river although the river indicates a high nutrient level between the l3 and l6 scenarios as the urban area increased from 53 1 under l3 to 80 2 under the l6 scenario this is not surprising as the melana river catchment is the most urbanized among all the rivers in the watershed however the nutrient level of skudai river at the watershed outlet and confluence between skudai river and johor strait is persistently high over the six lu lc scenarios some of the reasons for this eutrophic state of the river are the low flow conditions towards the outlets due to tidal effects low gradients and steady nutrient inflow due to frequent rainfall which continuously washes up nutrients from the nps areas towards the downstream part of the watershed 3 6 estimating stream concentrations from changes in nutrient loads under urban development stream concentrations were estimated by multiple linear regression using the simulated results of tn and tp loads and the corresponding percentage urban development in the watershed under the six scenarios as noted in table 7 the best predictive equations for estimation of tn and tp concentrations based on tn tp loads and percentage increase in urban development are models m1 and m4 r2 0 98 and 0 96 respectively based on this relationship the nutrient concentrations in runoff can be determined if the nutrient discharges per hectare from the urban areas are known already determined in fig 5 combining the two models table 7 and fig 5 the changes in the tn and tp concentrations can be determined if the tn and tp loads from nps are reduced in the watershed for example if the tn load is decreased by 1963 90 kg ha yr due to control of nps pollutants from 1 of the urban development the tn concentration will decrease by 0 023 mg l while decreasing the tp load by 41 63 kg ha yr will decrease the tp stream concentration by 0 004 mg l considering the same urban development conditions this implies that we can use the relationship to determine the desired amount by which to reduce the tn and tp loads due to urban development to maintain the minimum ecosystem sustainability level via targeted best management practices bmps 4 discussion 4 1 impact of land use on the nutrient s pollutant prior studies have shown the impact of historical lu lc on nutrient load from nps areas garnier et al 2013 however this study presents the effects of lu lc changes on the excess nutrient flow in a tropical watershed system using combined historical and future lu lc according to wang et al 2009 lu lc change has been considered as a common occurrence that plays a significant role in regulating nutrient levels in the ecosystem this study demonstrates how nutrient load from nps areas varies over a period of 50 years and its relationship to urban development it was observed that the rates of change in the nutrient loads fig 6 depend on the scale of disturbance of the lu lc in the watershed and this corresponds to the finding of shrestha et al 2017 that changes in lu lc influence the nutrient load significantly independently of the climate condition it is noted that the response of the skudai river watershed to the lu lc changes is high when the percentage of urban areas is greater than in previous lu lc categories the findings by bu et al 2014 show that areas dominated by agricultural and urban lu lc tend to have higher nutrient inflow when compared to other areas however nutrient inflow from agricultural land did not outweigh that from the urban areas the reason is that the agricultural practices in the watershed mostly oil palm plantations do not promote much soil nutrient export but rather excess harvesting might deplete the soil nutrients himes et al 2014 this means that smaller amounts of nutrients can be transported from agricultural areas urban areas tend to accumulate and export more nutrients from solid waste zabaleta and rodic 2015 leaf litter bratt et al 2017 and atmospheric deposition carey et al 2013 pinto et al 2013 suggested that lu lc categories have a varying influence on nutrient export in a catchment this means that the sensitivity of lu lc classes is determined by the influence of a class in contributing to the export of nutrients to the water body fig 6 in skudai river watershed barren and urban areas are found to be the most sensitive to tn and tp export atmospheric depositions in the urban areas are mostly due to the vehicular exhausts which influence the nutrient inflow from surface runoff making it difficult to prevent pollution of the river by these depositions yang and toor 2017 barren land mostly vacant lands promotes nutrient pollution through sand and gravel mining of construction sites bayram and önsoy 2015 therefore allowing excess nutrient flow as anthropogenic activities continue due to urban development 4 2 benefits of nutrients assessment under varied land use conditions the relationship between urban development and nutrient export in the watershed fig 6 shows that excess nutrients are likely to be transported based on the tn and tp loads produced per percentage point of urban growth but it is difficult to determine whether nutrient loads from nps areas are in excess without identifying the corresponding tn and tp concentrations under various urban developments in the watershed the flow of nutrients due to lu lc changes alters the tn and tp concentrations in the selected rivers table 5 and results in excess nutrient flow from nps areas into the river system subsequently their trophic state changes from normal to mesotrophic or eutrophic conditions dodds 2006 because any shift in the nutrient concentration has the potential to trigger eutrophication and harmful algal blooms dodds and smith 2016 studies have shown that nutrient concentrations are correlated with algal biomass dong et al 2018 and they are used to characterize reference distributions of stream autotrophic state segatto et al 2020 this study not only identified the likely consequences of lu lc changes controlled by rapid urban development for the production of excess nutrients in the river system but also provided information on the extent of these effects management decisions on urban development should be attached to water quality improvement strategies and prevention measures saraswat et al 2016 such management strategies will ensure resilience to the effects of proposed lu lc changes within the watershed system relating urban development to nutrient pollutants by estimating the amount of nutrients that will be exported due to a certain percentage increase in urban development will provide a basis for deciding on the management steps that need to be taken alongside the proposed urban development prior studies have outlined some water quality management proposals under similar conditions santhi et al 2006 estimating future tn and tp loads from npss and the stream concentration in an urbanizing area requires the integration of bmps to reduce the amount of estimated nutrients prior to urban development according to schoumans et al 2014 it is easier to prevent the impairment of water quality than to restore the water quality after it has been degraded the advantages of this approach are a reduction in the cost of bmp implementation prevention of ecosystem degradation and creation of awareness among urban developers in addition it maintains the natural ecological system and function of the receiving water bodies roy et al 2008 however to reduced nutrient pollutants through bmps a target nutrient reduction level must be defined panagopoulos et al 2011 in order to do so a relationship between annual nps loads tn and tp and the corresponding stream nutrient concentrations table 5 was developed it can be used to estimate the amount by which nutrient concentrations in runoff can be reduced if nutrient discharge per hectare from urban areas is decreased by a certain amount yee et al 2021 this implies that it can be used to define the desired amount by which tn and tp loads should be reduced in other to maintain the minimum water quality standard via targeted bmps in addition a flexible regulatory framework can be developed in which a suitable water quality status is maintained in various urbanization settings 4 3 nutrient pollutants enrichment its ecological resilience and threats on tropical estuary the flow of nutrients pollutants from coastal rivers significantly affects the ecological resilience of the tropical estuaries the study conducted by lee et al 2020a shows that the tropics do have an increase in the river flow during the wet season which results in turbidity surges and nutrient concentrations although tidal influence the principle of dilution and subsequent eutrophication responses as a result of nitrogen and phosphorous export rate might elevate or reduce the estuary bottom hypoxia however the constant flow of nutrient pollutants overcomes the ecological resilience of the estuaries and subsequent eutrophication associated with macroalgal blooms as illustrated in this study the rivers that are closer to the estuary tend to change their trophic conditions due to rapid urban development see table 6 and fig 1 and thus amplified the nutrients pollutant flowing into the strait of johor the impact of this pollutant s flows manifested on the persistent fish kills in the strait of johor hii et al 2021 scientific evidence shows that excess nutrient flow from the coastal rivers triggers eutrophication bottom water hypoxia and stratification of the water column mohd din et al 2020 although a lot of physical and biogeochemical processes regulate the amount of do concentrations in the estuary which makes it difficult to understand coastal hypoxia yang et al 2021 the linkage between nutrient flows from urban watersheds and the estuaries are identified in many parts of the world oelsner and stets 2019 but utilizing the historical trends and changes in the trophic states of the rivers via modelling approach will help in identifying the rivers that trigger eutrophication of the coastal waters for example the linkage between johor strait and the skudai river watershed can be well established based on the information provided in this study and other previous studies kok and leong 2019 it will also help in the management of nutrient pollutants from nps that could curtail future ecosystem degradation in the tropical region 4 4 development of flexible water quality management options since no single water quality management process has been identified as the optimum so an adaptive management approach can be developed as suggested by bouwes et al 2016 moreover watersheds have different sources of pollutants yang et al 2013 in some watersheds point sources ps pollution outweigh nps pollution and vice versa areas with abundant rainfall conditions such as the skudai river watershed tend to have nps as the primary sources of pollutants rather than ps this is because ps are strictly controlled by environmental agencies coupled with the low loadings from the treatment plants muyibi et al 2008 therefore bmps are the most effective management tools in this category of watersheds and these bmps depend on the site soil condition target pollutant removal level climate and available budget bosch et al 2014 randhir et al 2017 the proposed management solutions can provide a more flexible plan regarding the tradeoff between urban development and water quality protection recent studies have shown that design and placement of bmps can be integrated with planned urban development bello et al 2019 dong et al 2020 huang et al 2020 therefore allowing a better control of nps with urban development and ensured reduction of nutrient pollutants at watershed scale however ps pollution loads cannot be ignored either considering that ps pollution would likely increase as urban development and population increase hence effective management and treatment of domestic and industrial effluent should be another important approach to avoid impairment of the water quality as in most cases urban development plans tend to be lopsided if they do not estimate the environmental impacts of the proposed development in the watershed river system or receiving water body since future developments are difficult to control landscape design framework for biodiversity conservation that was proposed by gagné et al 2015 can serve as a guide for urban planners to prevent the negative impacts of urban development on the ecosystem and water quality in the watershed it is important to note that the values presented in this study are considered as estimated results that can be used by water managers to make decisions and proposals to prevent water quality deterioration in a tropical watershed in each phase of urban development 5 conclusion this study evaluates the effect of increasing urbanization on nitrogen and phosphorus pollution from nps areas it provides insightful information on how urban development changes the watershed response to nutrient flows under different lu lc variations in a region of abundant rainfall the hspf model was used to evaluate these impacts in an urbanized watershed in malaysia as shown in the results obtained in this study tn and tp load increases from 3 08 103 to 4 56 103 kg yr and 0 13 103 to 0 27 103 kg yr respectively with increasing urban area from 18 2 to 49 2 stream concentrations in the watershed produce varying responses as the watershed lu lc changes the rmse and nse values indicate increased in concentrations which also leads to changes in the stream s trophic conditions from oligotropic 1 to mesotropic 2 then to eutrophic 3 state in depth analysis have shown that rivers which do not experience much disturbance maintain their trophic state while rivers affected by urbanization activities continue to change their trophic state towards the eutrophication stage due to the changes in tn and tp concentrations however this condition can be prevented by integrating water quality management alongside urban development particularly if the excess nutrient pollutant sources are quantified at different levels of lu lc changes this will go a long way in controlling possible harmful algal blooms in the receiving water body furthermore implementation of recommended bmps as a control strategy to curtail the export of excess nutrients into the river systems as a result of urban growth will ensure ecosystem safety provision of bmps along with urban planning will ensure a sustainable natural ecosystem and maintenance of water quality standard as nutrient pollutant increases due urban development credit authorship contribution

24549,nutrient pollution is considered as a primary factor of water quality deterioration in urban dominated watersheds in which an informed decision on the management strategies are required to improve the water quality condition the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model is used to evaluate the impacts of pollution by these nutrients using the skudai river watershed in malaysia as a case study a developed land use land cover lu lc scenarios were used to evaluate these impacts statistical methods were employed to assess the extent of these impacts and their significance in shifting the trophic state of the rivers in the watershed the study shows that when urban development increases from 18 2 to 49 2 the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp loads increase from 3 08 to 4 56 10 3 kg yr and from 0 13 to 0 27 103 kg yr respectively streamflow and stream concentrations nh3 n no3 n and po4 p produce varying responses as the watershed land use changes from 1989 to 2039 as the rivers in the watershed shift their trophic state with respect to the level of anthropogenic disturbance within their catchments the tn and tp concentrations at the estuaries are likely to change from oligotrophic to eutrophic state this is an indication that the johor strait and the coastal rivers will be exposed to eutrophication subsequently resulting in harmful algal bloom this condition can be prevented by integrating water quality management alongside urban development because it is observed that a control of non point source nps pollutants from 1 of the urban development will decrease tn and tp concentration in skudai river by 0 023 mg l and 0 004 mg l respectively keywords urban development skudai river watershed hspf model nutrients pollution non point sources 1 introduction the level of nutrient pollution produced from the urban areas is among the leading causes of stream impairment in most urbanized watersheds duan et al 2012 edwards 2016 li et al 2017 for example the conversion of vegetative and wetland areas to impervious surfaces buildings roads etc changes the hydrologic regimes ecosystem distribution and nutrient dynamics hogan et al 2014 bhaskar et al 2016 the impervious surface amplifies runoff volumes and increases transport of nutrient pollutants from areas of non point sources npss these changes adversely affect the water quality and aquatic habitat their functions in stream ecosystems rafferty et al 2013 urban development affects the environment netusil et al 2014 gashi et al 2016 and therefore evaluating its influence on the nutrient dynamics will provide useful information on how to protect the environment and ensure human safety shen et al 2015 there are relatively few studies on effects of urbanization in humid tropical regions humid tropic regions are characterised with extreme weather conditions more rainfall and high temperatures as compared to temperate climates ghaffarianhoseini et al 2019 ayoub et al 2020 depending on the land use type the tendency for excessive sediment and nutrient pollution entering the rivers will be more severe abd wahaba et al 2019 land use is a driver of nutrient pollutants and thus important to be considered in urban planning and watershed management and hence the amount of nutrient pollutants produced due to sudden or gradual urban expansion can be readily determined and applied to support the management of water quality in urbanized settings bello et al 2019 therefore understanding the impact of urban development on nutrient pollutants at watershed scale in a tropical region like malaysia is very important according to sala 2000 the effects of land use changes on the water cycle may outweigh those associated with climate change and this assertion was supported by a study conducted in puget sound basin sun et al 2016 the result shows that urbanization has a much larger effect than climate change on both the magnitude and the seasonal variability in the studied area as observed by tang et al 2011 and lee et al 2017 rapid urbanization is directly associated with an increase in excess nutrients in malaysia and hence changes in characteristics of the watersheds over a period due to human activities should be considered for water quality improvement this will help in determining the impact of the potential anthropogenic activities and mitigation actions alongside the future development häder et al 2020 other water quality studies at watershed scale explore the effects of historical land use changes on surface runoff and nps pollution loading wu et al 2012 wang et al 2016 but their integration into future perspectives are often ignored therefore in some cases the effect of excess nutrients in a potential urban development remains unknown due to the inadequacy of information and restricted urban planning alberti et al 2007 even though unique information and an outlook with regard to the water quality conditions can be derived lee et al 2009 nutrients in themselves are important for the function of aquatic ecosystems but their availability in excess will result in distortion of the ecosystem baron et al 2013 in this study a water quantity and quality model of a tropical river watershed is developed using the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model hspf has been used in modelling several watersheds considering various response parameters that includes the hydrology biru and kumar 2018 lee et al 2020 sediments sarkar et al 2019 and nutrients roostaee and deng 2019 most of the studies have shown the robustness of the hspf model in determining the effects of various best management practices at a watershed scale risal et al 2021 also hspf model have the ability to detect a small change in the land use as input data and provides the likely responses of the watershed alukwe et al 2014 this study will provide information on the variation of tn and tp from nps areas in a tropical watershed system under rapid urbanization settings that will act as a basis for management support and mitigation actions to curtail future water quality problems recently malaysia planned its future economic development corridors out of which johor bahru athe capital of johor state part of the skudai river watershed is one of them the aim was to modernize the economic infrastructures and urban development areas that will attract investors as a result a rapid transformation is taking place in most part of the district the skudai river watershed represents the general characteristics of a tropical watershed considering its historical and planned urban development over the span of 5 decades part of johor bahru township falls within the watershed and its district is considered as one of the major urban area in malaysia and most urbanized in johor state rizzo 2021 but the impacts of the rapid urban development and other anthropogenic activities that may lead to water quality deteriorations are not yet determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 nutrient transport process of hspf model hspf version 12 4 epa 2015 was used in this study the model have a set of modules arranged in a hierarchical structure that performs a continuous simulation of a comprehensive range of hydrologic and water quality processes shenk et al 2012 it uses the concepts of a top down structure and uniform data structures as well as programming conventions common in large scale modelling efforts in this study the qual algorithm is applied to simulate three nutrient forms orthophosphate ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen within the pervious and impervious land segments for the pervious land segment pqual nutrient loads are computed by summation of the total loads simulated from the land surface interflow and groundwater as for the impervious areas the nutrient simulation is comparable to that of pqual but without considering the subsurface processes interflow and groundwater and falls under the iqual module all the nutrient fluxes derived from the pervious and impervious lands are channelled to the streams as an additional simulation of the stream nutrient flow li et al 2017 it utilizes the concept of first order die off rate relationship which varies with the time of concentration and the nature of the surface the control of nutrients on the surface runoff known as wash off potential is determined using the estimated accumulation rate wsqop parameter that is needed to wash off significant percent of the nutrients on the land surface the concentration of nutrients in baseflow and interflow can also be assumed as a constant or a monthly variable in hspf lee et al 2020 nutrient die off on the land surface is mainly controlled indirectly by adjusting the maximum nutrient storage at the pervious surface sqolim perlnd the modeler defines the limit value of the nutrient storage for both pervious perlnd and impervious implnd land surface in stream die off at the reaches rchre is modeled using a do and water temperature relationship under anaerobic and aerobic conditions hspf requires information on several hydrologic and water quality parameters in which a lot of literatures capture these parameters as described by usepa 2000 with their typical values yi et al 2020 2 2 study area the skudai river watershed is in the south eastern part of the malaysian peninsula and spans between longitudes of 102 59 54 19 e and 104 11 8 54 e and latitudes of 1 56 31 67 n and 1 22 41 16 n it is a coastal watershed that measures 33 54 km in length by 16 29 km in width with a total catchment area of 287 44 km2 the main river skudai river is 42 8 km in length and discharges directly into the western johor strait as indicated in fig 1 the skudai river watershed includes five main rivers consisting of the skudai river the main river and the sengkang senai melana and danga rivers average annual precipitation in the watershed is 2396 mm for 30 years observed climate dataset suhaila and jemain 2012 spatial variation in rainfall across the study area can be substantial as the annual totals differ by an average of 240 mm and by as much as 460 mm among five precipitation gauge stations in the study area the soils in the watershed are derived from the fine grained soil of the alluvium on the mid and high terrace to acid sulfate soils on undulating plains paramananthan 2000 for the most part the soil had a depth of more than 100 cm and was gently to moderately sloping the soil texture was mostly sand silty clay 81 2 and loamy sand 18 8 based on land use data derived from satellite imagery glovis usgs gov from 2013 and ground truthing 36 9 of skudai watershed was urbanized of which 53 was residential area 0 9 small industries 8 institutions 18 1 commercial and 20 roads and utilities forest land covered 31 5 of the area including mangrove areas agriculture 29 3 80 oil palm and 20 rubber plantations wetlands 1 5 mostly surrounded by riparian vegetation and bare land 0 8 intrusions and vacant lands however due to future planned development in the watershed fig 2 urban areas are expected to cover 80 of the watershed about 62 residential 27 commercial 2 6 industrial and 8 4 roads and utilities based on the future development plan drafted by the iskandar regional development authority irda 2011 2 3 the hspf model application basin arcview version 4 1 was used to process the spatial data land use elevation and soil data and interlinked meteorological data using the watershed data management utility from the basin platform the hspf user control input uci file which is the non calibrated model of the study area was produced fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the nps nutrient prediction using hspf model 2 4 input data the data used in this study and its sources and resolution are summarized in table 1 precipitation wind speed dew point temperature cloud cover solar radiation and evaporation data all with hourly time steps were obtained from the mmd malaysia meteorological department and did department of irrigation and drainage of malaysia additional meteorological data were also obtained from noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration under the us department of commerce http www noaa gov these data were used to build an input database for model runs via the watershed data management utility subprogram wdmutil both hourly and monthly streamflow records of the watershed were obtained from the did and stream monthly water quality data were collected from the department of the environment of malaysia doe we collected dry and wet atmospheric deposition and point sources data from the doe mmd and indah water konsotium iwk respectively with a monthly time step the soil map of the study area was obtained from the department of agriculture and fisheries doa the elevation data used in this study were acquired from the global data explorer https gdex cr usgs gov gdex and used for the watershed delineation and development of hydrological response units the land use data were developed from remote sensing data retrieved from the united states geological survey usgs eros data centre via the usgs global visualization viewer the imageries were captured by landsat 4 5 thematic mapper and landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapping and operational land imager sensors respectively and were used to produce historical land use land cover lu lc data of the skudai river watershed 2 5 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated using measured hydrological and water quality data by a manual parameter adjustment method and visualized via the hspexp sub program package mishra et al 2017 due to data limitation and variation of the time steps series of the available data for both streamflow and water quality the period considered for hydrological calibration and validation varies with that of water quality some studies have shown the possibility of using data of varied time step or series in modelling process alamanos et al 2019 for the water quality modelling ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ortho phosphate as phosphate po4 p were the only concentrations applied this agrees with several literatures which consider nh3 n and no3 n as the major sources of total nitrogen tn and po4 p as the major source of total phosphorous tp in stormwater chow and yusop 2014 qi et al 2018 the selection of the concentrations also took into account the availability of the data use in the calibration and validation of the model and the ability of the model to compute the tn and tp loads based on the type of concentrations used in model calibration and parameters adjustment li et al 2011 therefore the simulated streamflow nh3 n no3 n and po4 p were compared with their observed values at monthly time steps during the calibration and validation periods two tests were used to assess the performance of the monthly runoff and associated stream concentration simulated by the hspf model the first test was a graphical comparison between the simulated and observed values whereas the second was a quantitative statistical test for the latter the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and percentage bias pbias were implemented the outlined conditions suggested by moriasi et al 2007 were used to evaluate the model performance based on the values obtained for r2 eq 1 nse eq 2 and pbias eq 3 1 r 2 o i o i s i s i s i s i 2 o i o i 2 2 2 n s 1 s i o i 2 o i o i 2 3 p b i a s o i s i o i 100 where o i and s i are the measured and simulated values respectively o i and s i are the means of the measured and simulated values respectively and n is the total amount of data 2 6 land use land cover scenarios the remote sensing data table 2 were used to produce lu lc classes for each corresponding year of the imagery arcgis v 10 3 software was applied for the geometric correction lu lc classification and accuracy assessment using the methodology adopted by ioannis and meliadis 2011 and zhao et al 2012 the historical and current base maps of the study area coupled with field data were used in the classification of the targeted five lu lc classes and lu lc classification accuracy was measured using a confusion matrix and the kappa index then the historical lu lc scenarios of the study area was produced l1 l2 and l3 and the lu lc of 2013 refer as l4 was used as baseline in the calibration and validation of the model however the remote sensing imagery used in this study were selected based on image clarity low percent of cloud cover and the resolutions fiorucci et al 2018 lechner et al 2019 the years selected for the lu lc scenarios are defined on the basis of the above mentioned criteria the methodology utilized by mishra et al 2014 was used to develop a model to project future lu lc changes using a land change model lcm through the idris selva arc view program package three types of input data were created for the lu lc projection the basic lu lc images 1989 and 2009 lu lc the transition potential areas file transitional probability matrix and map and the developed suitability image collection that is used for the transition sub model structure land use for the years 2029 and 2039 were generated and selected to represent future developments of the watershed 20 and 30 years respectively after the historical land use of the year 2009 which was used in the lcm modeller a total of five lu lc scenarios were selected based on the historical and projected urban development of the watershed from 1989 to 2013 and from 2029 to 2039 respectively bello et al 2019 these scenarios were used to assess the impact of lu lc changes on the nutrient dynamics of the skudai river watershed because prior studies have shown that lu lc changes determine the magnitude of nutrient transport to the receiving water rankinen et al 2016 2 7 sensitivity of lu lc composition to total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp loads the sensitivity of the lu lc classes to the nitrogen and phosphorus loads was determined using the method applied by zhang et al 2016 in which the relative sensitivity of two or more related elements can be computed from the relationship defined by eq 4 the objective of the sensitivity analysis was to identify the impact of a single lu lc composition forest land agriculture urban wetland or barren land on the nutrient load from nps areas furthermore this analysis will indicate how lu lc changes alter the influence of a given lu lc class on the nutrient flux over time 4 y i x i x a x a where y is the sensitivity coefficient relative change of yield contributed by the lu lc class to the watershed system for the chosen lu lc scenario x is the yield contributed by the lu lc class in a given year i is the considered lu lc of a given scenario used to generate the yields nutrients and a is the earliest lu lc generated yield e g scenario l1 2 8 evaluation of scenarios five simulation scenarios were developed by application of three historical 1989 1999 2009 and two projected lu lc 2029 and 2039 data sets of skudai river watershed lu lc of the year 2013 is considered as the baseline because it represents the current lu lc status of the watershed and the calibration parameters used in the initial calibration were maintained for the simulation of each scenario the output results of the nps loads of tn and tp in all the scenarios were evaluated and the corresponding simulated stream concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and orthophosphate po4 p at the watershed outlets over the simulation period from 2002 to 2014 were analysed a spatial map of the nps loads of tn and tp for each scenario was generated using arcgis v 10 2 utilizing the natural neighbour interpolation technique vizcaíno et al 2016 and jenks natural breaks classification method was utilized to determine the best arrangement of values of tn and tp loads into different classes within the watershed jiang 2013 the variability in the stream flows and stream concentrations nh3 n no3 n and po4 p was evaluated using non parametric test statistics and taylor diagram which represent three different statistics on the same graph i e the normalized standard deviation the pearson correlation and root mean square difference this diagram taylor 2001 provides a summarized graphical solution on how the simulated outputs of each scenario l1 l2 l3 l5 l6 differs or matches the baseline l4 output results four rivers sengkang senai melana and skudai rivers were selected based on their locations and catchment characteristics to determine their tn and tp concentrations under each simulated lu lc scenario using the method described in the basin technical note 7 usepa 2005 the computed tn and tp concentrations in the runoff were used to characterize the trophic states of the rivers using the criteria proposed by dodds et al 1998 and li et al 2021 this is as shown in table 3 several studies have attempted to determine the trophic conditions of rivers lakes and reservoirs in the region such as by sharip et al 2014 soo et al 2017 umi et al 2020 the intentions of these attempts were to measure how lu lc changes that are derived from urban development affect the water quality conditions of the receiving rivers and also to estimate the likely effects of urbanization on the potential stream eutrophication apart from that the variability of tn and tp can be linked to lu lc changes because it has been observed that changes in the tn and tp concentrations can be attributed to a decreased inflow of nutrients from freshwater yan et al 2016 in the current study the relationship between percentage urban development annual nutrient loads and stream nutrient concentrations under the lu lc scenarios was developed using multiple linear regression the aim was to estimate how increases or decreases in nutrient loads under urbanization settings can affect the stream nutrient concentrations in the watershed which can be used to set the pollutants removal target under varied urban development conditions 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of hspf model the hydrological component of the skudai river watershed was calibrated by adjustment of parameters using observed streamflow data from 2002 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2014 with monthly time steps fig 4 a b the model performance was good with 11 overestimation of the flow for the seven year simulation period the validation results show a satisfactory performance with captured variability of 83 and overestimation of 17 table 4 the nh3 n no3 n and po4 p concentrations were calibrated with a monthly time step from 2002 to 2008 and validated from 2009 to 2014 fig 4c h based on the model performance evaluation the model produced a good simulation output for both the calibration and the validation period for all the modelled stream concentrations table 4 the coefficients of the determinants r2 fall within the range of 0 56 to 0 81 for the calibration period and within the range of 0 62 to 0 77 for the validation period the pbias values for all the calibration and validation results for the stream concentrations show good performances based on the benchmark outlined by moriasi et al 2007 3 2 sensitivity of lu lc classes to tn and tp loads the sensitivity of the tn and tp loads to lu lc classes from nps areas as they varied over time is shown in fig 5 a b and indicates that barren land is more sensitive to both tn and tp loads followed by urban areas and wetland agricultural and forest lands show the lowest sensitivity to tn and tp loads the low sensitivity shown by the forest and agricultural lands was due to the distribution of the lu lc classes in the watershed agricultural and forest lands dominate the upstream part of the watershed while the mid section and downstream parts are dominated by urban areas therefore the response of the watershed to nutrient pollutants will be higher in urban areas as the lu lc changes compared to forest and agricultural lands 3 3 spatial distribution of tn and tp loads under lu lc changes measurement of a watershed response under different lu lc scenarios historical and future changes is crucial for better management of water resources the six lu lc scenarios indicate an increase in the average annual tn load from the nps areas for skudai river watershed most significantly in the urban areas fig 6 a it shows an increase in the tn load as the urban area increases for instance the nps load of tn is expected to double under the l6 scenario fig 6a compared with the l1 scenario it is observed that between the lu lc scenarios of l1 and l2 the tn load in the watershed increases by 10 2 2990 132 to 3295 593 kg yr but between l3 and l4 the tn load increases by only 2 3572 515 to 3653 08 kg yr these results demonstrate that the response of the watershed to tn loads from nps areas depends on the rate of disturbance of the lu lc urban development between l1 and l2 is higher than that between scenarios l3 and l4 see fig 6 also it was observed that between the l4 and l6 scenarios there was a 24 73 increase in the tn load 3653 08 to 4556 605 kg yr from nps areas the reason for the high increase in tn load was that the nps areas were predominantly urban in the l6 scenario unlike scenarios l1 l2 l3 and l4 which the lu lc classes were consolidated and contribute to tn load based on their spatial composition and nutrient accumulation in each sub catchment in the l6 scenario urban areas are expected to cover 49 2 of the watershed unlike the l1 l2 l3 and l4 scenarios where urban areas covered 18 2 30 5 36 and 37 of the watershed respectively the tp distribution under different lu lc scenarios fig 6b shows that the nps load increases with increasing urban development and follows a trend similar to that of tn as discussed earlier annual tp loads are expected to increase by 31 3 in the future considering the average tp loads between the l4 and l6 scenarios 203 82 to 267 76 kg yr on comparing the l1 scenario with the l4 scenario it can be seen that the tp load in the watershed was redistributed as the nps areas changed the l1 scenario fig 6b produced a high tp load at the upstream and downstream parts of the watershed which were dominated by agricultural and urban areas but between the l3 and l6 scenarios the high tp load changes toward the downstream section of the watershed and for sub catchments that are predominantly urban areas this means that urban areas produce higher tn and tp loads than agricultural and forest lands fig 7 shows that the tn and tp loads have a linear relationship with urban development this indicates that tp and tn loads in the watershed will continue to increase as urban development increases the regression equation from these relationships shows that an 1 increase in the urban area in the watershed produces estimated tn and tp loads of 1963 90 and 41 63 kg ha yr respectively it indicates a high tendency toward excess nitrogen and phosphorus in the watershed river system over time 3 4 the variability of stream concentrations under lu lc changes simulated results of the streamflows alongside the nh3 n no3 n and po4 p concentrations at the watershed outlet under different lu lc scenarios were analysed using the jonckheere terpstra non parametric test the test result shows in table 5 the alternative hypothesis of the median values of the simulated streamflows nh3 n no3 n and po4 p concentrations increases with increasing urban development can be accepted and this trend is statistically significant p 0 05 to evaluate the impact of urbanization and its significant on nutrient influx in the watershed a plot of taylor diagram was produced fig 8 a shows the variability of the nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentrations under the lu lc scenarios the ranges of normalized standard deviation nse correlation r and the root mean square difference rmse shows that they are similar in terms of standard deviation their correlation is high and their rmse varies between the baseline l4 and the scenario l1 l2 l3 l5 l6 for the simulated no3 n concentrations it was observed that all scenarios have a rmse values that ranges from 0 15 to 0 4 indicating a significant change in the concentration among the scenarios coupled with the high nse values an evident that no3 n concentrations are spread out over a large range of values and tend to be very far to the mean of the baseline for ammonia nitrogen nh3 n fig 8b they have varied rmse ranges from 0 2 to 0 6 and nse ranges from 0 77 to 0 95 indicating no perfect fit between baseline and the scenarios l1 l2 l3 l5 and l6 respectively also for po4 p concentrations fig 8c and streamflow fig 8d they exhibit similar response as the rmse and nse values fluctuate along the varied ranges the r values shows a direct correlation among the scenarios but all the scenarios showed a significant change when compared with the baseline in terms of nse and rmse values it means that both the nutrients concentration and streamflow spread out over a large range and tend to be far from the mean values for these reasons the results show that urbanization at watershed scale affects the streamflow nh3 n no3 n and po4 p concentrations significantly 3 5 impact of urbanization on the river system in the watershed in order to investigate the effect of urbanization on the watershed river system the changes in tn and tp in the runoff of the sengkang senai melana and skudai rivers were evaluated the rivers produced different trophic classes based on the simulated mean runoff of tn and tp concentrations over the simulated period of 2002 to 2014 under different lu lc scenarios table 6 summarizes the nutrient runoff characteristics n and p of the four selected rivers and the results show that sengkang river produced low total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in all the scenarios indicating low concentration of n and p in the stream the river s lu lc changes only slightly over the six lu lc scenarios as it remains predominately a mixture of forest and agricultural land this maintains the nutrient level of the river for the period of five decades however senai and melana rivers show different trophic conditions over the six scenarios for senai river the l1 and l2 scenarios produced a low nutrient level but in the l3 to the l5 scenario the nutrient level changes from low to intermediate while the l6 scenario shows a high nutrient level in the river runoff the nutrient level remains unchanged from scenario l1 to l2 but it changes from scenario l3 to l5 because urban areas increase from 14 3 in l2 to 25 8 in the l5 scenario with forest land decreasing due to continuous conversion to either urban or agricultural land the same trend was observed in melana river although the river indicates a high nutrient level between the l3 and l6 scenarios as the urban area increased from 53 1 under l3 to 80 2 under the l6 scenario this is not surprising as the melana river catchment is the most urbanized among all the rivers in the watershed however the nutrient level of skudai river at the watershed outlet and confluence between skudai river and johor strait is persistently high over the six lu lc scenarios some of the reasons for this eutrophic state of the river are the low flow conditions towards the outlets due to tidal effects low gradients and steady nutrient inflow due to frequent rainfall which continuously washes up nutrients from the nps areas towards the downstream part of the watershed 3 6 estimating stream concentrations from changes in nutrient loads under urban development stream concentrations were estimated by multiple linear regression using the simulated results of tn and tp loads and the corresponding percentage urban development in the watershed under the six scenarios as noted in table 7 the best predictive equations for estimation of tn and tp concentrations based on tn tp loads and percentage increase in urban development are models m1 and m4 r2 0 98 and 0 96 respectively based on this relationship the nutrient concentrations in runoff can be determined if the nutrient discharges per hectare from the urban areas are known already determined in fig 5 combining the two models table 7 and fig 5 the changes in the tn and tp concentrations can be determined if the tn and tp loads from nps are reduced in the watershed for example if the tn load is decreased by 1963 90 kg ha yr due to control of nps pollutants from 1 of the urban development the tn concentration will decrease by 0 023 mg l while decreasing the tp load by 41 63 kg ha yr will decrease the tp stream concentration by 0 004 mg l considering the same urban development conditions this implies that we can use the relationship to determine the desired amount by which to reduce the tn and tp loads due to urban development to maintain the minimum ecosystem sustainability level via targeted best management practices bmps 4 discussion 4 1 impact of land use on the nutrient s pollutant prior studies have shown the impact of historical lu lc on nutrient load from nps areas garnier et al 2013 however this study presents the effects of lu lc changes on the excess nutrient flow in a tropical watershed system using combined historical and future lu lc according to wang et al 2009 lu lc change has been considered as a common occurrence that plays a significant role in regulating nutrient levels in the ecosystem this study demonstrates how nutrient load from nps areas varies over a period of 50 years and its relationship to urban development it was observed that the rates of change in the nutrient loads fig 6 depend on the scale of disturbance of the lu lc in the watershed and this corresponds to the finding of shrestha et al 2017 that changes in lu lc influence the nutrient load significantly independently of the climate condition it is noted that the response of the skudai river watershed to the lu lc changes is high when the percentage of urban areas is greater than in previous lu lc categories the findings by bu et al 2014 show that areas dominated by agricultural and urban lu lc tend to have higher nutrient inflow when compared to other areas however nutrient inflow from agricultural land did not outweigh that from the urban areas the reason is that the agricultural practices in the watershed mostly oil palm plantations do not promote much soil nutrient export but rather excess harvesting might deplete the soil nutrients himes et al 2014 this means that smaller amounts of nutrients can be transported from agricultural areas urban areas tend to accumulate and export more nutrients from solid waste zabaleta and rodic 2015 leaf litter bratt et al 2017 and atmospheric deposition carey et al 2013 pinto et al 2013 suggested that lu lc categories have a varying influence on nutrient export in a catchment this means that the sensitivity of lu lc classes is determined by the influence of a class in contributing to the export of nutrients to the water body fig 6 in skudai river watershed barren and urban areas are found to be the most sensitive to tn and tp export atmospheric depositions in the urban areas are mostly due to the vehicular exhausts which influence the nutrient inflow from surface runoff making it difficult to prevent pollution of the river by these depositions yang and toor 2017 barren land mostly vacant lands promotes nutrient pollution through sand and gravel mining of construction sites bayram and önsoy 2015 therefore allowing excess nutrient flow as anthropogenic activities continue due to urban development 4 2 benefits of nutrients assessment under varied land use conditions the relationship between urban development and nutrient export in the watershed fig 6 shows that excess nutrients are likely to be transported based on the tn and tp loads produced per percentage point of urban growth but it is difficult to determine whether nutrient loads from nps areas are in excess without identifying the corresponding tn and tp concentrations under various urban developments in the watershed the flow of nutrients due to lu lc changes alters the tn and tp concentrations in the selected rivers table 5 and results in excess nutrient flow from nps areas into the river system subsequently their trophic state changes from normal to mesotrophic or eutrophic conditions dodds 2006 because any shift in the nutrient concentration has the potential to trigger eutrophication and harmful algal blooms dodds and smith 2016 studies have shown that nutrient concentrations are correlated with algal biomass dong et al 2018 and they are used to characterize reference distributions of stream autotrophic state segatto et al 2020 this study not only identified the likely consequences of lu lc changes controlled by rapid urban development for the production of excess nutrients in the river system but also provided information on the extent of these effects management decisions on urban development should be attached to water quality improvement strategies and prevention measures saraswat et al 2016 such management strategies will ensure resilience to the effects of proposed lu lc changes within the watershed system relating urban development to nutrient pollutants by estimating the amount of nutrients that will be exported due to a certain percentage increase in urban development will provide a basis for deciding on the management steps that need to be taken alongside the proposed urban development prior studies have outlined some water quality management proposals under similar conditions santhi et al 2006 estimating future tn and tp loads from npss and the stream concentration in an urbanizing area requires the integration of bmps to reduce the amount of estimated nutrients prior to urban development according to schoumans et al 2014 it is easier to prevent the impairment of water quality than to restore the water quality after it has been degraded the advantages of this approach are a reduction in the cost of bmp implementation prevention of ecosystem degradation and creation of awareness among urban developers in addition it maintains the natural ecological system and function of the receiving water bodies roy et al 2008 however to reduced nutrient pollutants through bmps a target nutrient reduction level must be defined panagopoulos et al 2011 in order to do so a relationship between annual nps loads tn and tp and the corresponding stream nutrient concentrations table 5 was developed it can be used to estimate the amount by which nutrient concentrations in runoff can be reduced if nutrient discharge per hectare from urban areas is decreased by a certain amount yee et al 2021 this implies that it can be used to define the desired amount by which tn and tp loads should be reduced in other to maintain the minimum water quality standard via targeted bmps in addition a flexible regulatory framework can be developed in which a suitable water quality status is maintained in various urbanization settings 4 3 nutrient pollutants enrichment its ecological resilience and threats on tropical estuary the flow of nutrients pollutants from coastal rivers significantly affects the ecological resilience of the tropical estuaries the study conducted by lee et al 2020a shows that the tropics do have an increase in the river flow during the wet season which results in turbidity surges and nutrient concentrations although tidal influence the principle of dilution and subsequent eutrophication responses as a result of nitrogen and phosphorous export rate might elevate or reduce the estuary bottom hypoxia however the constant flow of nutrient pollutants overcomes the ecological resilience of the estuaries and subsequent eutrophication associated with macroalgal blooms as illustrated in this study the rivers that are closer to the estuary tend to change their trophic conditions due to rapid urban development see table 6 and fig 1 and thus amplified the nutrients pollutant flowing into the strait of johor the impact of this pollutant s flows manifested on the persistent fish kills in the strait of johor hii et al 2021 scientific evidence shows that excess nutrient flow from the coastal rivers triggers eutrophication bottom water hypoxia and stratification of the water column mohd din et al 2020 although a lot of physical and biogeochemical processes regulate the amount of do concentrations in the estuary which makes it difficult to understand coastal hypoxia yang et al 2021 the linkage between nutrient flows from urban watersheds and the estuaries are identified in many parts of the world oelsner and stets 2019 but utilizing the historical trends and changes in the trophic states of the rivers via modelling approach will help in identifying the rivers that trigger eutrophication of the coastal waters for example the linkage between johor strait and the skudai river watershed can be well established based on the information provided in this study and other previous studies kok and leong 2019 it will also help in the management of nutrient pollutants from nps that could curtail future ecosystem degradation in the tropical region 4 4 development of flexible water quality management options since no single water quality management process has been identified as the optimum so an adaptive management approach can be developed as suggested by bouwes et al 2016 moreover watersheds have different sources of pollutants yang et al 2013 in some watersheds point sources ps pollution outweigh nps pollution and vice versa areas with abundant rainfall conditions such as the skudai river watershed tend to have nps as the primary sources of pollutants rather than ps this is because ps are strictly controlled by environmental agencies coupled with the low loadings from the treatment plants muyibi et al 2008 therefore bmps are the most effective management tools in this category of watersheds and these bmps depend on the site soil condition target pollutant removal level climate and available budget bosch et al 2014 randhir et al 2017 the proposed management solutions can provide a more flexible plan regarding the tradeoff between urban development and water quality protection recent studies have shown that design and placement of bmps can be integrated with planned urban development bello et al 2019 dong et al 2020 huang et al 2020 therefore allowing a better control of nps with urban development and ensured reduction of nutrient pollutants at watershed scale however ps pollution loads cannot be ignored either considering that ps pollution would likely increase as urban development and population increase hence effective management and treatment of domestic and industrial effluent should be another important approach to avoid impairment of the water quality as in most cases urban development plans tend to be lopsided if they do not estimate the environmental impacts of the proposed development in the watershed river system or receiving water body since future developments are difficult to control landscape design framework for biodiversity conservation that was proposed by gagné et al 2015 can serve as a guide for urban planners to prevent the negative impacts of urban development on the ecosystem and water quality in the watershed it is important to note that the values presented in this study are considered as estimated results that can be used by water managers to make decisions and proposals to prevent water quality deterioration in a tropical watershed in each phase of urban development 5 conclusion this study evaluates the effect of increasing urbanization on nitrogen and phosphorus pollution from nps areas it provides insightful information on how urban development changes the watershed response to nutrient flows under different lu lc variations in a region of abundant rainfall the hspf model was used to evaluate these impacts in an urbanized watershed in malaysia as shown in the results obtained in this study tn and tp load increases from 3 08 103 to 4 56 103 kg yr and 0 13 103 to 0 27 103 kg yr respectively with increasing urban area from 18 2 to 49 2 stream concentrations in the watershed produce varying responses as the watershed lu lc changes the rmse and nse values indicate increased in concentrations which also leads to changes in the stream s trophic conditions from oligotropic 1 to mesotropic 2 then to eutrophic 3 state in depth analysis have shown that rivers which do not experience much disturbance maintain their trophic state while rivers affected by urbanization activities continue to change their trophic state towards the eutrophication stage due to the changes in tn and tp concentrations however this condition can be prevented by integrating water quality management alongside urban development particularly if the excess nutrient pollutant sources are quantified at different levels of lu lc changes this will go a long way in controlling possible harmful algal blooms in the receiving water body furthermore implementation of recommended bmps as a control strategy to curtail the export of excess nutrients into the river systems as a result of urban growth will ensure ecosystem safety provision of bmps along with urban planning will ensure a sustainable natural ecosystem and maintenance of water quality standard as nutrient pollutant increases due urban development credit authorship contribution
