1440,the development of a cover for inclined acid generating areas such as the external face of dykes and the slope of waste rock piles is undoubtedly one of the biggest technical reclamation challenges at several mine sites the laronde mine site owned and operated by agnico eagle mines quebec canada is currently engaged to identify an optimal reclamation scenario for the dyke 1 of its acid generating tailings storage facilities one of the promising reclamation options for controlling water infiltration in the acid generating waste rock on the dyke 1 is the use of an inclined cover built with available mine waste materials an instrumented inclined cell with an inclination angle of 18 3 degrees was built on a slope of this dyke to validate if low sulfide tailings and non potentially acid generating waste rock can be used as cover material to reclaim the dyke 1 the instrumented inclined cell was monitored for 3 years 2017 to 2019 using volumetric lysimeters suction sensors and volumetric water content sensors the monitoring was done under natural climatic conditions and artificial wetting events under natural conditions less than 1 5 mm of incident rainfall percolated in the volumetric lysimeters installed along the slope of the inclined cell under controlled conditions associated with artificial wetting events of 6 4 mm h over a period of 12 h net percolation values between 1 and 9 4 to 60 mm of the sum of incident precipitation were measured the distance between the top of the cell and the down dip limit ddl point was greater than the slope length of the cover under natural conditions and the ddl point moved from the bottom toward the top to reach values between 12 and 20 m from the top of the slope when the wetting events were applied on the cover these results confirmed the suitability of mining materials as an inclined cover material to control water infiltration in reactive mine waste rocks graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords inclined cover acid mine drainage dyke reclamation field cell tests water infiltration mine waste materials 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd from sulfide mine wastes is a critical environmental problem facing the mining industry e g blowes et al 2003 2014 rimstidt and vaughan 2003 nordstrom et al 2015 reclamation methods often used to control the generation of amd aim to limit the availability of one or more of the three main components associated with oxidation reactions of sulfide minerals water oxygen and sulfides e g srk 1989 aubertin et al 2002 lottermoser 2010 amd control methods are usually adapted to the needs and conditions of the mine site to be reclaimed climate water balance size of mine site material availability reactive tailings or waste rock in order to obtain the best performance for the lowest possible costs wilson et al 1997 aubertin et al 1997a another important aspect is the geometry of the site that can influence the performance of the systems installed to control amd aubertin et al 1997b zhan et al 2001 bussière et al 2003 hence the reclamation of inclined portion of mine sites must be addressed in a specific manner to optimize mine site reclamation the development of a cover for an inclined acid generating area such as the external face of dykes 15 to 20 of angle and the slope of waste rock piles where the angle can reach 35 eg aubertin et al 2016 is undoubtedly one of the biggest technical challenges at several mine sites in humid climates despite the large volumes of water coming from precipitation one option for the inclined portions of the tailings storage facilities tsf and waste rock piles wrp consists in controlling water infiltration to reactive mine wastes aubertin et al 2009 inclined covers made of natural materials with low saturated hydraulic conductivity have been used to control water infiltration on some wrp e g yanful et al 1993a o kane et al 1998 the average measured infiltration from lysimeters placed at the base of the cover system was in the range of 2 to 5 of precipitation another option to divert water and control water infiltration is by the use of the capillary barrier effects which appears when a fine grained material overlies a coarse grained material frind et al 1976 ross 1990 stormont 1995a 1995b aubertin et al 2009 the difference between the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the two materials in contact tends to restrict water flow at their interface because the coarse grained material is easily drained and thus typically shows a much lower unsaturated hydraulic conductivity than the finer material located above it in recent years various researchers have evaluated the influence of different parameters e g type of material inclination and length of the slope and recharge rate on the performance of inclined capillary barrier covers to control water infiltration using analytical equations that represent water movement steenhuis et al 1991 morel seytoux 1994 stormont 1995a 1995b parent and cabral 2006 bussière et al 2007a other studies were performed to better understand the impact of these parameters of influence on the hydrogeological behavior of inclined capillary barriers using laboratory infiltration tests and numerical modelling bussière et al 1998 2003 kämpf et al 2003 tami et al 2004 aubertin et al 2009 qian et al 2010 ng charles et al 2015 results show that the thickness of layers plays a critical role in governing the performance of the capillary barrier to divert water the system performance was also shown to be extremely sensitive to the hydraulic functions of cover materials investigation of the performance of inclined capillary barriers to divert water under high precipitation intensity and high evaporation conditions was conducted by li et al 2013 and zhan tony et al 2014 the main results show that inclined capillary barrier covers made of natural materials perform well under both prolonged light rainfall and short time heavy rainfall conditions low amounts of percolated water were recovered after a breakthrough in the capillary barrier under prolonged heavy rainfalls some field studies related to the capacity of inclined capillary barrier covers to control water infiltration can be found in the literature abdolahzadeh et al 2011 assessed the performance of inclined capillary barrier covers to control percolation into a waste disposal facility and a comparison between observed diversion length of the capillary barrier and predictions with steady state and transient state numerical modelling was realised by lacroix vachon et al 2015 hopp et al 2011 used field tests and numerical modelling to study the mechanisms that produce lateral subsurface flow and vertical percolation in an inclined cover system studies were conducted by rahardjo et al 2012 to evaluate the performance of an instrumented slope covered by a capillary barrier cover system to divert water and consequently to improve slope stability results of most of these studies showed that the hydrogeological behavior of an inclined cover and its ability to reduce the infiltration of water depend on several parameters including thickness and length of cover layers slope angle unsaturated hydrogeological properties of materials and climate conditions given the high number of parameters that influence inclined capillary barrier covers the general conclusion is that there is no one size fits all approach for designing such covers and that lab and intermediate field tests should be performed before applying the technology at the real scale the objective of this article is to assess the hydrogeological behavior of a field experimental cell simulating an inclined capillary barrier cover made entirely of mine wastes materials to control water infiltration on a reactive waste rock dyke at the laronde mine site first the design construction and instrumention of the inclined field experimental cell are presented then the hydrogeological behavior of the inclined cover is presented using 1 matric suction ψ and volumetric water content θ measurements 2 percolation rate into volumetric lysimeters located along the slope into the underlying reactive waste rock layer and 3 runoff and lateral percolation measurements for the different layers the inclined cover was monitored under natural conditions and artificial wetting events conditions that simulate important precipitation events finally the water balance calculation the capacity of the inclined cover to control water infiltration and the water diversion capacity of the inclined cover system are addressed in a discussion section in the literature some studies have tested mine tailings as oxygen barrier covers aubertin et al 1995 bussière et al 2004 2007b ethier et al 2018 rey et al 2020 while others were carried out on using tailings as alternative store and release covers bossé et al 2013 2015 knidiri et al 2017 in an arid to semi arid climate previous studies that focused on controlling water infiltration and amd have mostly used natural materials e g yanful et al 1993b o kane et al 1998 taylor et al 2003 mend 2004 adu wusu and yanful 2006 adu wusu and yanful 2007 ng charles et al 2015 the main originality of this study is related to the use of mining materials in a inclined cover used to control water infiltration on reactive waste rocks in humid climate if the approach is demonstrated successful it could be applied to other sites and help reducing the footprint of mine sites by limiting the use of natural soil in covers used to control water infiltration into reactive mine wastes 2 description of the inclined experimental cell and monitoring 2 1 location of the site and problem statement the laronde mine site owned and operated by agnico eagle mines aem canada is located approximatively 47 km west of rouyn noranda quebec canada 48 15 16 n 78 26 4 w fig 1iii the polymetallic laronde deposit produces copper and zinc concentrates and gold and silver lingots the mine generates approximately 2 4 mt of acid generating tailings annually disposed of in a 165 ha tsf see fig 1i laronde tailings have high acid generating potential ap and negative net neutralization potential nnp of the order of 531 kg caco3 t and 528 kg caco3 t respectively see kalonji kabambi 2020 for details the laronde mine site is currently engaged in a process to identify an optimal reclamation scenario for its acid generating tsf one of the promising options for controlling amd generation in the laronde tsf is the use of a cover with capillary barrier effects ccbe made with low sulfide mine wastes technically this option can not be extended on the 1 5 km of the dyke 1 built in 1988 with acid generating waste rocks fig 1ii moreover the dyke 1 is considered hydraulically separated from the horizontal part of the laronde tsf one of the reclamation options for controlling water infiltration in the amd waste rock on the dyke 1 is the use of an inclined cover built with available mine waste materials 2 2 construction of the inclined experimental cell an instrumented inclined experimental cell was built on a portion of dyke 1 in the fall of 2016 the inclined cell has a length of about 20 m a width of 10 m and a cover inclination angle of approximately 18 3 degrees to construct the cell a hydraulic excavator was used to remove larger boulders of waste rock on dyke 1 see figs 2i ii four 2 m 2 m 0 1 m volumetric lysimeters placed 4 m apart with the first located at 4 m from the top were installed at the base of the experimental inclined cell along the slope see fig 2iii the volumetric lysimeters were filled with the surrounding laronde waste rock and placement density was the same as the material outside the lysimeters it is known in the literature that some flow diversion can occur around volumetric lysimeter which can lead to an understimation of percolation bews et al 1999 o kane and barbour 2003 numerical modelling was used to validate that the proposed lysimeters were not significantly influenced by this phenomenon the experimental cell cover was made of from bottom to top the reactive waste rock that constitute dyke 1 which were used as bottom capillary break layer cbl low sulfide tailings tg as 0 8 m fine grained layer placed over the reactive waste rock and non acid generating waste rock wl to create a 0 3 m top cbl see fig 3 the material was compacted in successive layers to ensure uniform density samples were taken during the construction of the fine grained layer with a cylindrical ring of known volume for quality control of the material the main controlled parameters were the porosity n and initial gravimetric water content w the tg tailings layer had a initial w ranging from 13 8 to 14 4 and a n ranging from 0 32 to 0 35 in situ dry density and initial w were also measured with a nucleodensimetre in the wl layer the initial w and dry density in the wl waste rock layer ranging from 3 3 to 4 2 and from 2000 to 2400 kg m3 respectively the sides of the cell were sloped with a hydraulic excavator to obtain the desired size and geometry see fig 3 2 3 monitoring and top boundary conditions 2 3 1 instrumentation the water balance of a cover system is a key component of the performance assessment of any cover system used to control water infiltration albright et al 2010 the water balance of a sloping cover system can be described by the following equation meiers et al 2009 1 ppt r ae np δs lp where ppt is precipitation r is surface runoff δs is the change in water storage within the cover material np is the net percolation lp is lateral percolation or interflow and ae is the actual evaporation often deduced from the other components of the water balance the meteorological parameters obtained from environment canada s meteorological station at val d or airport located approximatively 50 km south east of the laronde mine site included rainfall relative humidity wind speed air temperature and wind direction the changes in θ with time are used to calculate water storage variations δs by integrating θ at 0 50 and 0 70 m depths in the fine grained material during the monitoring period e g benson et al 2001 albright et al 2004 waugh et al 2008 knidiri et al 2016 four monitoring stations were installed along the slope near the central axis of the cell and above the volumetric lysimeters see figs 2d and 3 to assess variations in θ and ψ at three different strategic depths in the wl waste rock layer 0 20 m and near the top and bottom of the fine grained layer 0 50 and 0 70 m see fig 3 5tm and gs3 sensors decagon devices inc were used to monitor θ in tailings and waste rock layers respectively the 5tm and gs3 probes were calibrated for each material to improve measurement accuracy when calibrated with a specific material both probes have an accuracy of 0 03 m3 m3 for a range of 0 to 100 humidity see kalonji kabambi 2020 for details the volumetric water content sensor was connected to an em 50 datalogger for automatic data recording the measurement interval was fixed at four hours for θ watermark probes irrometer company inc were used to monitor ψ in the different layers and were placed close to volumetric water content sensors four jet fill tensiometers 2725arl of soilmoisture equipment corp were also used to measure suction just above the interface between the reactive waste rock and the tg tailings layers at 1 m next to each monitoring station this type of sensor is known as being more sensitive and precise than the watermark probes bulut and leong 2008 suction near the interface is of interest to validate the presence of capillary barrier effects at the interface indeed when the water pressure exceeds the water entry value wev or water entry pressure of the underlying coarse grained material a breakthrough of the capillary break occurs and the cover is no longer effective in controlling water percolation ross 1990 steenhuis et al 1991 aubertin et al 2009 the measurement range and accuracy of watermark probes are 0 to 200 kpa and 1 kpa respectively the measurement range of jet fill tensiometers is 0 100 kpa with a accuracy of 0 5 1 kpa the ψ values were taken manually every two weeks percolation was measured by weekly sampling of the volumetric lysimeters figs 2c and 3 while surface runoff and lateral percolation in the slope direction were measured also weekly using drainage systems figs 2e f surface runoff lateral percolation and net percolation water were conveyed through pipes to buckets and barrels in order to quantify the water volume fig 3 the percolation water in the volumetric lysimeters was also used to estimate the location where capillary barrier effects disappear and where the cover is no longer effective to divert water called down dip limit ddl point ross 1990 2 3 2 top boundary conditions applied to the inclined experimental cell the hydrogeological behavior of the inclined experimental cell was monitored from may 2017 to october 2019 the monitoring was performed under natural conditions and under controlled conditions simulating artificial wetting events wetting events in 2018 and 2019 were carried out to better assess the diversion capacity of the cover when important precipitation events occur two wetting events were applied based on data of the intensity duration and frequency of short term rainfall events at the rivière heva station 19 km from the mine site published on the environment canada web site 1 1 http climate weatheroffice gc ca prods servs index e html in august 2018 an artificial wetting event of 77 mm over a period of 12 h or 6 4 mm h was applied and in july 2019 the artificial wetting event applied was of 76 mm over a period of 8 h or 9 5 mm h they both correspond to precipitation events with a return period between 50 and 100 years the wetting events were simulated using drip irrigation tubes installed on the inclined cover surface and connected to a water supply pipe fig 4a the water used was pumped from a basin located close the experimental set up figs 4b c d a total of 40 drip irrigation tubes separated by 50 cm were used two water filters action machining inc placed in parallel and an electronic flow meter abb processmaster were installed at the entrance of the irrigation system to filter and to quantify the volume of water added fig 4b during the application of the artificial wetting events the measurement interval was fixed at 5 min for θ and the ψ values were taken manually every 15 min 3 materials properties 3 1 characterization methods the grain size distribution gsd of tg was determined using a malvern mastersizer laser particle size analyser lee black et al 1996 the gsd of wl was determined by mechanical sieving according to astm standard d422 astm 2007a for particles larger than 425 μm and using laser particle size analyser for finer grain sizes the specific gravity gs of each material was determined by a helium pycnometer micromeritics accupyc 1330 according to astm standard d854 10 astm 2012 tg saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was evaluated using a standard rigid wall permeameter according to astm standard d5856 astm 2007b wl ksat was mesured using the constant head permeability test in large high density polyethylene hdpe columns 80 cm in height and 30 cm in diameter using the method proposed by peregoedova et al 2013 tg water retention curve wrc was determined using a pressure cell tempe cell following astm d3152 72 astm 2000 wl wrc was obtained through column drainage tests following the procedure proposed by peregoedova et al 2014 experimental data of both materials were fitted with the retention curve retc software van genuchten et al 1991 using the van genuchten 1980 model 3 2 cover materials properties the main physical and hydrogeological characterization results are presented in table 1 and the complete gsds for the materials are presented in fig 5 according to uscs classification mccarthy 2007 the gds of tg and wl were typical of low plastic silt ml and well graded sand sw respectively gs values of tg and wl were of 2 7 and 2 8 respectively the ksat values obtained during the permeability tests ranged from 2 10 4 m s n 0 35 for wl and 5 10 7 m s n 0 45 for tg the air entry values aev obtained from the materials wrcs were 2 5 n 0 43 and 0 003 m n 0 35 of water for the tg and wl respectively the suction ψ r at residual volumetric water content θr values were of the order of 50 and 0 15 m of water for the tg and wl respectively the wev of the laronde reactive waste rock defined in a previous study was about 2 kpa kalonji kabambi 2014 4 main field results 4 1 climatic conditions the average daily air temperatures and daily precipitations close to the site area measured during the testing period may 2017 to october 2019 are shown in fig 6 the highest and lowest average daily air temperatures were 26 c and 34 c respectively with an average temperature during the active monitoring periods may to october of 15 c the average cumulative annual precipitation at the site was 985 mm with approximately 70 under rainfall and 30 under snow form 2 2 http climat meteo gc ca climate normals index f html the liquid precipitation in 2017 2018 and 2019 including artificial wetting events in 2018 and 2019 were 579 733 and 603 mm respectively 4 2 hydrogeological behavior under natural conditions 4 2 1 volumetric water content measurements fig 7 shows θ values in the cover materials for the different monitoring stations from may 2017 to october 2019 in spring may θ values were higher due to snowmelt in summer july and august θ values tended to decrease and stabilized at values that varied depending on the measuring stations in the fall september october θ values in the tg layer tended to increase due to more frequent precipitation events the θ measured by the probes in the winter periods corresponded to unfrozen volumetric water content this explains the significant drops during the winter period where part of the water is transformed into ice a more detailed observation of θ evolution at the different monitoring stations during the active monitoring period when the cover is unfrozen shows that at station a bottom of the slope the θ average value was 0 32 at the bottom of the tg layer 0 23 at the top of this same layer and 0 10 in the wl layer at station b the average θ value was 0 24 in the tg layer and 0 11 in the wl layer at station c the average θ value was 0 24 in the tg layer and 0 08 in the wl layer and at station d top of the slope the θ average value was 0 23 in the tg layer and 0 01 in the wl layer at stations b c and d we notice a non significant difference of θ between the bottom and the top of the tg layer 4 2 2 matric suction measurements fig 8 gives an overview of ψ values measured in different layers over the testing period the values at 0 20 0 50 0 70 m depth were measured with watermark probes while at 1 00 m depth jet fill tensiometers were used suctions were not measured at 1 m depth in 2019 due to technical problems with tensiometers for the 3 years of monitoring the average ψ values for stations a b c and d were respectively 11 12 14 and 16 kpa in the tg layer and 13 14 12 and 16 kpa in the wl layer near the top of the wl layer that is subjected to evaporation the maximum ψ values measured reached 29 50 and 26 kpa respectively in 2017 2018 and 2019 average ψ values slightly increased from bottom of the slope station a to top of the slope station d in both layers of the inclined cover the ψ values near the interface between the reactive waste rock and the tg layer 1 0 m depth are greater average of 12 kpa than the wev of the reactive waste rock about 2 kpa in agreement with the conceptual models of inclined cover presented in several studies e g oldenburg and pruess 1993 bussière et al 2003 kämpf et al 2003 parent and cabral 2006 the suction is slightly higher in the upper part of the inclined cover the hydrogeological results obtained in this study confirms the presence of a well developed capillary barrier effects but do not show a significant difference of volumetric water content in the tg layer between stations located at the top and bottom of the slope the variations in suction between the top and bottom of the cell are relatively low 5 kpa and for these suction values in the tg water retention curve there is no significant variation of volumetric water content less than the precision of the sensor the volumetric water content variations from one monitoring station to the other can also be explained at least in part by the differences in densities inherent to the construction of such a structure despite all the efforts made during construction slight variations of density in the tg material is expected which may result in a behavior that is not perfectly equivalent to that of a homogeneous and isotropic system e g morris and stormont 1998 ning et al 2011 4 3 hydrogeological behavior during wetting events 4 3 1 volumetric water content measurements the evolution of θ values in the differents layers of the experimental cell before during and after the artificial wetting events is presented in fig 9 as can be observed the evolution of θ was similar for the two artificial wetting events indeed during the two wetting events the probes located at 0 20 0 50 and 0 70 m depth of all monitoring stations were affected but with a slighlty different temporal behavior see fig 9 during the wetting events it took approximately less than an hour to notice the start of an increase in θ in the wl layer at station a b c and d with a water arrival first at station a followed by station b c and d figs 9i ii the increase in θ in the tg layer was gradual and continued until the end of the two wetting events it can also be observed that as expected bussière et al 2003 the θ values were usually higher close to the bottom of the slope stations a and b with values reaching the saturation value porosity of 0 35 at station a at 0 50 m lower maximum θ values were observed at station b c and d for the second wetting event this could be due at least in part to slightly lower initial θ values before the wetting event and also to difference of intensity and duration of the tested artificial wetting events e g jackson 1992 sinai and dirksen 2006 4 3 2 matric suction measurements the ψ measurement results in the tg layer during the two wetting events are presented in fig 10 the watermark probes located at 0 50 m at stations a b and c were defective during the second wetting event for the first wetting event fig 10i the wetting front took about an hour to reach 0 20 m depth at all monitoring stations and it took between 8 and 10 h to lower the matric suction to values less than or equal to 5 kpa at 0 50 m depth at stations a b and d at the same depth but at station c the suction stabilized at 7 kpa after 5 h at the depth of 0 70 m the suction reached 5 kpa after 6 9 and 10 h respectively at stations a b and c at the same depth but at station d suction decreased and stabilized at 10 kpa at the end of the test for the second wetting event fig 10ii the wetting front took also about an hour to reach 0 20 m depth at all measurement stations and it took 6 h to lower the matric suction to values less than or equal to 5 kpa at 0 70 m depth at station a at the same elevation suction values decreased and stabilized between 10 and 13 kpa at the end of the test at stations b c and d based on these results it is clear that the wetting events have much more influence near the bottom of the slope station a compared to near the top of the slope station d it can also be observed that for a same station the bottom of the tg layer elevation 0 70 m was less influenced by the wetting event than the top elevation 0 50 m during the first wetting test ψ values measured at the bottom of the tg layer 0 70 m depth reached the wev about 2 kpa of the underlying reactive waste rock after approximately 10 h at stations a and b and after 11 h at station c at station d the ψ value measured at the end of the test was 10 kpa for the second wetting test the ψ values measured at the bottom of the tg layer reached 2 kpa after 7 h at station a and stabilized at 3 11 and 13 kpa respectively at the end of the test at stations b c and d this would mean that the disappearance of the capillary barrier effects was located between station a and b for this test see section 5 2 4 4 net percolation measurements np estimated from the four volumetric lysimeters are presented in fig 11 the water heights m of lysimeters were estimated by dividing the volume of water m3 from the lysimeters and collected in the buckets by the surface of the lysimeter m2 the results obtained under natural climatic conditions indicated that the inclined cover system configuration limited water np to values less than 1 of incident rainfall less than 5 mm of rainfall from may to october 2017 see fig 11i during the 2017 monitoring period np water was collected in lysimeters a b and c only in may just after snowmelt in 2018 when the wetting event of 77 mm in august was combined to natural conditions water percolation values increased at all stations np rates had reached 9 of total precipitation at station a 4 at station b 5 at station c and 1 at station d see fig 11ii more than 70 of the np volume was recorded three weeks after the wetting events this is aligned with suction and volumetric water content measurements that indicate a disapearance of capillary barrier effects at the bottom interface suction lower than the wev of the waste rock and saturation of the tg layer during the wetting event the second level of increased in np in 2018 is due to a significant precipitation approximately 30 mm recorded in one day in september 2018 in 2019 when the wetting event of 76 mm was combined with natural conditions in july np values slightly increased at stations a and b the inclined cover system configuration limited water percolation to values to less than 1 of incident rainfall less than 5 mm of rainfall from may to october 2019 see fig 11iii 4 5 runoff and lateral percolation measurements values of r and lp are presented in fig 12 the sum of the volume of water recovered in the reservoirs related to r and lp were divided by the surface of the inclined cover to obtain an equivalent water height for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 these values corresponded to 19 mm 49 mm and 58 mm of water respectively figs 12i ii iii these last three values represent 3 7 and 10 of total precipitation for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the results obtained also indicate that generally the cumulative volume water of lp between the tg layer reactive waste rock layer drain 1 see fig 3 for drains location is the larger value followed by r drain 3 and the lp between the wl layer and the tg layer drain 2 however in 2017 the volume of r was greater than the volume of lp between the wl layer tg layer and tg layer reactive waste rock layer 4 6 water storage δs in the tg material was determined by integrating the θ profile during the monitoring period table 2 presents monthly water storage in tg layer the highest monthly storage was generally noticed in october while july and august are usually associated to low water storage except when artificial wetting event is applied cumulative storage in height of water in the tg layer was higher in 2018 28 to 58 mm compared to 2019 2 to 11 mm and 2017 8 to 37 mm results showed that there is no clear trend between location along the slope and water storage 4 7 actual evaporation ae was calculated from the other components of the water balance see eq 1 in 2017 during the monitoring under natural conditions the calculated cumulative ae values were 388 384 384 and 309 mm at stations a b c and d respectively from june to october in 2018 when the wetting event of 77 mm was applied in august the calculated cumulative ae values were 521 463 446 and 446 mm at stations a b c and d respectively from june to october from may to october 2019 when the wetting event of 76 mm was applied in july the calculated cumulative ae values were 314 313 310 and 305 mm at stations a b c and d respectively the maximal annual ae rate from june to october is 388 mm in 2017 lys a 521 mm in 2018 lys a and 314 mm in 2019 lys a indicating that the ae rate was higher in the lower portion of the slope where water was more available for transfer to the atmosphere 5 discussion the results of this study described the hydrogeological behavior of an inclined field experimental cell built on a slope of the dyke 1 of the laronde mine tsf this section presents first a comparison between the water balance observed in this study and others found in the literature for mine covers the capacity of the inclined cover to control water infiltration and the water diversion capacity of the inclined cover system is then discussed in more details 5 1 water balance fig 13 presents the water balance results for the non frozen period june to october for year 2017 and shows the dynamic between the components in the spring the soil is usually frozen and the water seeps little and it has no choice but to runoff this behavior is further favored by the slope of the cell then evaporation increases progressively until it exceeds precipitation during the summer at the end of the summer evaporation decreases and drops below precipitation in the fall as evaporation is generally greater than precipitation during the summer this creates a water deficit and storage is reduced this is the case for stations b c and d in 2017 where the cumulative δs are negative table 2 however when precipitation increase in the fall and evaporation is reduced water storage starts to increase and the cover accumulates water in tg layer results also indicate a different hydrogeological behavior across the stations suggesting that the location along the slope affects the hydrogeological behavior of the inclined experimental cell it is worth mentioning that the dynamic presented in fig 13 is representative of years 2018 and 2019 for 2017 when combining all the stations ae was the main component of the water balance with a contribution of 73 followed by r 13 lp 9 δs 3 and by np 2 see fig 13e results of the annual water balance for the years 2018 and 2019 is presented in table 3 the year 2019 is very similar to 2017 while year 2018 has a slightly different behavior with a greater np and δs values 10 and 16 respectively and a lower proportion of r 4 table 3 other studies had presented field water balance of engineered cover estimated through the use of lysimeters see table 4 all these four studies presented in table 4 used covers made of natural materials e g clay till sand gravel that were compacted or not with thicknesses varying between 0 5 and 1 5 m covers were horizontal or inclined with or without vegetation depending on the studies and were evaluated under different climatic conditions and installed over mine tailings or on waste rock the main objective of these different studies were to control water infiltration to the underlying mine tailings or waste rocks in the four studies ae was the main component of the water balance as observed in the present study ae corresponding to 74 of annual precipitations was measured in iowa between 64 and 87 of the rainfall from june to october for the experiments located in the abitibi region first and fourth studies and between 54 and 65 of annual precipitations at the equity mine site weeks and wilson 2006 these results are well aligned with those of the present study with values between 56 and 75 depending on the year of monitoring and the measurement station the second most important component of the water balance in the previously mentioned studies was np with a value of 23 of the annual rainfall in iowa and 10 to 40 of the cumulative rainfall of june to october for the abitibi experiments first and fourth studies preferential flow path was however observed in iowa which increased cumulative percolation for the second study the average measured infiltration from lysimeters placed at the base of the soil cover system was 5 of precipitation for the 3 years of monitoring once more the percentage of percolation measured in the present study 2 under natural conditions and up to 10 under controlled conditions associated with artificial wetting events remain within the range of values measured in these studies even if there were differences in soil layer thickness in the fonction and the geometry of the covers the value of δs was always a small component of the water balance with annual values varying from 5 to 6 in iowa and from 1 to 4 for the experiments performed in abitibi first and fourth studies δs was not measured in the second study in the present study δs values vary more significantly ranging from 3 in natural monitoring conditions and 2 to 16 when the wetting events were applied to the inclined experimental cell finally it is interesting to note that the r value was estimated to 5 of the annual precipitation at the iowa landfill site while the values observed in the present study range between 3 and 15 depending on the year of monitoring 5 2 water diversion capacity of the inclined cover system the control of water infiltration in the tested cover system was performed by different phenomena such as runoff evaporation storage and lateral diversion the diversion capacity of inclined covers that generate capillary barrier effects can be estimated by analytical solutions however these solutions such as those proposed by ross 1990 steenhuis et al 1991 and morel seytoux 1994 are valid for conditions that are not representative of the tested inclined experimental cell steady state condition infinitely thick coarse grained material layer constant pressure or suction at a given distance from the interface along the slope and a deep phreatic surface the other option to estimate the diversion capacity of the inclined capillary barrier is by analysing the suction evolution figs 8 and 10 close to the interface between reactive waste rock and tg tailings during the monitoring period both under natural and artificial wetting conditions under natural conditions suction values near the interface 1 m depth remained greater than the wev of the reactive waste rock fig 8 which indicates that all along the slope the water does not tend to infiltrate the coarse grained reactive waste rock for the first wetting test suction values measured at the bottom of the tg layer reached the wev of the underlying reactive waste rock after approximately 10 h at stations a and b and after 11 h at station c fig 10i which indicate that the capacity to divert water evolved over time water started to infiltrate the reactive waste rock layer near the bottom of the slope and with time the infiltration moved upward to reach between 12 and 16 m from the top of the slope during the second wetting test the suction values measured at the bottom of the tg layer reached the wev of reactive waste rock layer after approximately 10 h at stations a fig 10ii which indicate that the location of infiltration was between 16 and 20 m from the top of the slope as demonstrated by aubertin et al 2009 this upward movement of the infiltration point ddl point continued during the transient period until it stabilized when the steady state is reached during the wetting events the percolation of water in the volumetric lysimeters was aligned with suction measurements close to the interface water started to flow into the lysimeters when the suction measured at the bottom of the tg layer 0 70 m depth reached the wev about 2 kpa of the underlying reactive waste rock more than 70 of the percolation water was recovered in lysimeters a and b located between 12 and 16 m from the top of the slope for the first wetting event and only in lysimeter a located at 16 m from the top of the slope for the second event 5 3 behavior of the cover system to control water infiltration conceptual model the hydrogeological behavior of the inclined cover made with mining materials to control water infiltration evaluated in this study can be summarized as follows under natural conditions fig 14 a first part of the precipitation water ppt that falls on the wl waste rock layer evaporates ae a second part of water flows at the surface as runoff toward the bottom of the slope and a third part of water infiltrates the wl layer a part of this infiltration water is laterally diverted along the wl tg interface lp subsequently the water percolating in the tg layer is laterally diverted along the tailings reactive waste rocks interface lp as water moves along the tg reactive waste rock interface the volumetric water content gradually increases and the suction gradually decreases in spite of lateral drainage and water accumulation in the fine grained layer δs the suction at the interface does not reach the wev of the reactive waste rock preventing net percolation np in conclusion under the natural conditions observed during testing the diversion length ld is greater than the length of the slope 20 m under significant wetting event conditions fig 15 at the beginning the behavior is similar to the one observed in natural conditions a first portion of the precipitation water ppt that falls on the wl layer is diverted as runoff to the bottom of the slope and a second portion infiltrates this layer as for natural conditions part of the infiltration water is laterally diverted lp along the wl tg interface the water percolating in the tailings layer is laterally drained along the tailings reactive waste rocks interface lp but because of the larger volume of water water accumulates at the interface until the suction at the interface exceeds the wev of the underlying coarse grained material steenhuis et al 1991 morris and stormont 1999 cifuentes et al 2006 aubertin et al 2009 rahardjo et al 2012 at this critical point the ddl point the capillary barrier effects begins to disappear and water begins to percolate into the reactive waste rocks layer in our study the ddl was located between stations a and b for the wetting conditions applied generally the effectiveness of the capillary barrier can be improved by sloping the system kämpf et al 2003 by increasing thickness of layers aubertin et al 2009 or by using materials with more appropriate properties however effectiveness decreases with increasing intensity of precipitation qian et al 2010 for the in situ experimental set up studied the percolation oberved especially under natural conditions is low and corresponds to the behavior of an efficient inclined cover however when significant wetting conditions are applied the system failed for a short period of time to control water infiltration into the reactive waste rock due to the disappearance of the capillary barrier effects between the tg material and the reactive waste rock in the context of a design at the real scale a numerical model could be validated using the existing results and then used to design a system that could be efficient for the entire slope length and for these critical conditions the design component was outside the scope of this study 6 conclusion this study assesses the ability of an inclined cover made of mine waste materials to control water infiltration on a reactive waste rock dike at the laronde mine site this reclamation scenario was assessed under natural climatic conditions and artificial wetting events continuous monitoring of volumetric water content matric suction net percolation rate lateral percolation and runoff was used to evaluate the hydrogeological behavior of the inclined capillary barrier cover the data presented in this paper represent three years of monitoring the main conclusions drawn from this in situ study can be summarized as follows results from the inclined experimental cell built at the laronde mine site demonstrated that inclined capillary barrier cover made of mining materials to control water infiltration on reactive waste rocks can be an attractive alternative to control water infiltration the percolation rate results indicated that the cover system configuration limits water net percolation to values less than 1 5 mm of incident rainfall under the 2017 natural climatic conditions the percolation rate values reached a maximum of 10 60 mm of precipitation when wetting events simulating significant precipitation with a period of return between 50 and 100 years were applied once a year to the inclined experimental cell the water balance of the inclined experimental cell showed that the control on infiltration was mainly due to evaporation with a contribution reaching 75 followed by runoff and lateral percolation water was diverted at the interface between wl and tg during wetting events for a certain distance that varied during the test at the end of the two wetting tests the infiltration point or ddl point was located between 12 and 20 m from the top of the slope the observed hydrogeological behavior of the inclined experimental cell indicated that the cover was able to return to its initial hydrogeological behavior in about a week and subsequently regained its capacity to divert water for the next wetting event results obtained from this study showed the potential of a cover made of mining material to control water infiltration on an inclined surface made of waste rock the next step in the design process would be to develop a numerical model to optimize the cover configuration if this scenario is selected for the reclamation of the dyke 1 of laronde tsf the use of mining materials would reduce the use of natural soil would valorize an unused waste and would demonstrate

1440,the development of a cover for inclined acid generating areas such as the external face of dykes and the slope of waste rock piles is undoubtedly one of the biggest technical reclamation challenges at several mine sites the laronde mine site owned and operated by agnico eagle mines quebec canada is currently engaged to identify an optimal reclamation scenario for the dyke 1 of its acid generating tailings storage facilities one of the promising reclamation options for controlling water infiltration in the acid generating waste rock on the dyke 1 is the use of an inclined cover built with available mine waste materials an instrumented inclined cell with an inclination angle of 18 3 degrees was built on a slope of this dyke to validate if low sulfide tailings and non potentially acid generating waste rock can be used as cover material to reclaim the dyke 1 the instrumented inclined cell was monitored for 3 years 2017 to 2019 using volumetric lysimeters suction sensors and volumetric water content sensors the monitoring was done under natural climatic conditions and artificial wetting events under natural conditions less than 1 5 mm of incident rainfall percolated in the volumetric lysimeters installed along the slope of the inclined cell under controlled conditions associated with artificial wetting events of 6 4 mm h over a period of 12 h net percolation values between 1 and 9 4 to 60 mm of the sum of incident precipitation were measured the distance between the top of the cell and the down dip limit ddl point was greater than the slope length of the cover under natural conditions and the ddl point moved from the bottom toward the top to reach values between 12 and 20 m from the top of the slope when the wetting events were applied on the cover these results confirmed the suitability of mining materials as an inclined cover material to control water infiltration in reactive mine waste rocks graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords inclined cover acid mine drainage dyke reclamation field cell tests water infiltration mine waste materials 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd from sulfide mine wastes is a critical environmental problem facing the mining industry e g blowes et al 2003 2014 rimstidt and vaughan 2003 nordstrom et al 2015 reclamation methods often used to control the generation of amd aim to limit the availability of one or more of the three main components associated with oxidation reactions of sulfide minerals water oxygen and sulfides e g srk 1989 aubertin et al 2002 lottermoser 2010 amd

to obtain the best performance for the lowest possible costs wilson et al 1997 aubertin et al 1997a another important aspect is the geometry of the site that can influence the performance of the systems installed to control amd aubertin et al 1997b zhan et al 2001 bussière et al 2003 hence the reclamation of inclined portion of mine sites must be addressed in a specific manner to optimize mine site reclamation the development of a cover for an inclined acid generating area such as the external face of dykes 15 to 20 of angle and the slope of waste rock piles where the angle can reach 35 eg aubertin et al 2016 is undoubtedly one of the biggest technical challenges at several mine sites in humid climates despite the large volumes of water coming from precipitation one option for the inclined portions of the tailings storage facilities tsf and waste rock piles wrp consists in controlling water infiltration to reactive mine wastes aubertin et al 2009 inclined covers made of natural materials with low saturated hydraulic conductivity have been used to control water infiltration on some wrp e g yanful et al 1993a o kane et al 1998 the average measured infiltration from lysimeters placed at the base of the cover system was in the range of 2 to 5 of precipitation another option to divert water and control water infiltration is by the use of the capillary barrier effects which appears when a fine grained material overlies a coarse grained material frind et al 1976 ross 1990 stormont 1995a 1995b aubertin et al 2009 the difference between the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the two materials in contact tends to restrict water flow at their interface because the coarse grained material is easily drained and thus typically shows a much lower unsaturated hydraulic conductivity than the finer material located above it in recent years various researchers have evaluated the influence of different parameters e g type of material inclination and length of the slope and recharge rate on the performance of inclined capillary barrier covers to control water infiltration using analytical equations that represent water movement steenhuis et al 1991 morel seytoux 1994 stormont 1995a 1995b parent and cabral 2006 bussière et al 2007a other studies were performed to better understand the impact of these parameters of influence on the hydrogeological behavior of inclined capillary barriers using laboratory infiltration tests and numerical modelling bussière et al 1998 2003 kämpf et al 2003 tami et al 2004 aubertin et al 2009 qian et al 2010 ng charles et al 2015 results show that the thickness of layers plays a critical role in governing the performance of the capillary barrier to divert water the system performance was also shown to be extremely sensitive to the hydraulic functions of cover materials investigation of the performance of inclined capillary barriers to divert water under high precipitation intensity and high evaporation conditions was conducted by li et al 2013 and zhan tony et al 2014 the main results show that inclined capillary barrier covers made of natural materials perform well under both prolonged light rainfall and short time heavy rainfall conditions low amounts of percolated water were recovered after a breakthrough in the capillary barrier under prolonged heavy rainfalls some field studies related to the capacity of inclined capillary barrier covers to control water infiltration can be found in the literature abdolahzadeh et al 2011 assessed the performance of inclined capillary barrier covers to control percolation into a waste disposal facility and a comparison between observed diversion length of the capillary barrier and predictions with steady state and transient state numerical modelling was realised by lacroix vachon et al 2015 hopp et al 2011 used field tests and numerical modelling to study the mechanisms that produce lateral subsurface flow and vertical percolation in an inclined cover system studies were conducted by rahardjo et al 2012 to evaluate the performance of an instrumented slope covered by a capillary barrier cover system to divert water and consequently to improve slope stability results of most of these studies showed that the hydrogeological behavior of an inclined cover and its ability to reduce the infiltration of water depend on several parameters including thickness and length of cover layers slope angle unsaturated hydrogeological properties of materials and climate conditions given the high number of parameters that influence inclined capillary barrier covers the general conclusion is that there is no one size fits all approach for designing such covers and that lab and intermediate field tests should be performed before applying the technology at the real scale the objective of this article is to assess the hydrogeological behavior of a field experimental cell simulating an inclined capillary barrier cover made entirely of mine wastes materials to control water infiltration on a reactive waste rock dyke at the laronde mine site first the design construction and instrumention of the inclined field experimental cell are presented then the hydrogeological behavior of the inclined cover is presented using 1 matric suction ψ and volumetric water content θ measurements 2 percolation rate into volumetric lysimeters located along the slope into the underlying reactive waste rock layer and 3 runoff and lateral percolation measurements for the different layers the inclined cover was monitored under natural conditions and artificial wetting events conditions that simulate important precipitation events finally the water balance calculation the capacity of the inclined cover to control water infiltration and the water diversion capacity of the inclined cover system are addressed in a discussion section in the literature some studies have tested mine tailings as oxygen barrier covers aubertin et al 1995 bussière et al 2004 2007b ethier et al 2018 rey et al 2020 while others were carried out on using tailings as alternative store and release covers bossé et al 2013 2015 knidiri et al 2017 in an arid to semi arid climate previous studies that focused on controlling water infiltration and amd have mostly used natural materials e g yanful et al 1993b o kane et al 1998 taylor et al 2003 mend 2004 adu wusu and yanful 2006 adu wusu and yanful 2007 ng charles et al 2015 the main originality of this study is related to the use of mining materials in a inclined cover used to control water infiltration on reactive waste rocks in humid climate if the approach is demonstrated successful it could be applied to other sites and help reducing the footprint of mine sites by limiting the use of natural soil in covers used to control water infiltration into reactive mine wastes 2 description of the inclined experimental cell and monitoring 2 1 location of the site and problem statement the laronde mine site owned and operated by agnico eagle mines aem canada is located approximatively 47 km west of rouyn noranda quebec canada 48 15 16 n 78 26 4 w fig 1iii the polymetallic laronde deposit produces copper and zinc concentrates and gold and silver lingots the mine generates approximately 2 4 mt of acid generating tailings annually disposed of in a 165 ha tsf see fig 1i laronde tailings have high acid generating potential ap and negative net neutralization potential nnp of the order of 531 kg caco3 t and 528 kg caco3 t respectively see kalonji kabambi 2020 for details the laronde mine site is currently engaged in a process to identify an optimal reclamation scenario for its acid generating tsf one of the promising options for controlling amd generation in the laronde tsf is the use of a cover with capillary barrier effects ccbe made with low sulfide mine wastes technically this option can not be extended on the 1 5 km of the dyke 1 built in 1988 with acid generating waste rocks fig 1ii moreover the dyke 1 is considered hydraulically separated from the horizontal part of the laronde tsf one of the reclamation options for controlling water infiltration in the amd waste rock on the dyke 1 is the use of an inclined cover built with available mine waste materials 2 2 construction of the inclined experimental cell an instrumented inclined experimental cell was built on a portion of dyke 1 in the fall of 2016 the inclined cell has a length of about 20 m a width of 10 m and a cover inclination angle of approximately 18 3 degrees to construct the cell a hydraulic excavator was used to remove larger boulders of waste rock on dyke 1 see figs 2i ii four 2 m 2 m 0 1 m volumetric lysimeters placed 4 m apart with the first located at 4 m from the top were installed at the base of the experimental inclined cell along the slope see fig 2iii the volumetric lysimeters were filled with the surrounding laronde waste rock and placement density was the same as the material outside the lysimeters it is known in the literature that some flow diversion can occur around volumetric lysimeter which can lead to an understimation of percolation bews et al 1999 o kane and barbour 2003 numerical modelling was used to validate that the proposed lysimeters were not significantly influenced by this phenomenon the experimental cell cover was made of from bottom to top the reactive waste rock that constitute dyke 1 which were used as bottom capillary break layer cbl low sulfide tailings tg as 0 8 m fine grained layer placed over the reactive waste rock and non acid generating waste rock wl to create a 0 3 m top cbl see fig 3 the material was compacted in successive layers to ensure uniform density samples were taken during the construction of the fine grained layer with a cylindrical ring of known volume for quality control of the material the main controlled parameters were the porosity n and initial gravimetric water content w the tg tailings layer had a initial w ranging from 13 8 to 14 4 and a n ranging from 0 32 to 0 35 in situ dry density and initial w were also measured with a nucleodensimetre in the wl layer the initial w and dry density in the wl waste rock layer ranging from 3 3 to 4 2 and from 2000 to 2400 kg m3 respectively the sides of the cell were sloped with a hydraulic excavator to obtain the desired size and geometry see fig 3 2 3 monitoring and top boundary conditions 2 3 1 instrumentation the water balance of a cover system is a key component of the performance assessment of any cover system used to control water infiltration albright et al 2010 the water balance of a sloping cover system can be described by the following equation meiers et al 2009 1 ppt r ae np δs lp where ppt is precipitation r is surface runoff δs is the change in water storage within the cover material np is the net percolation lp is lateral percolation or interflow and ae is the actual evaporation often deduced from the other components of the water balance the meteorological parameters obtained from environment canada s meteorological station at val d or airport located approximatively 50 km south east of the laronde mine site included rainfall relative humidity wind speed air temperature and wind direction the changes in θ with time are used to calculate water storage variations δs by integrating θ at 0 50 and 0 70 m depths in the fine grained material during the monitoring period e g benson et al 2001 albright et al 2004 waugh et al 2008 knidiri et al 2016 four monitoring stations were installed along the slope near the central axis of the cell and above the volumetric lysimeters see figs 2d and 3 to assess variations in θ and ψ at three different strategic depths in the wl waste rock layer 0 20 m and near the top and bottom of the fine grained layer 0 50 and 0 70 m see fig 3 5tm and gs3 sensors decagon devices inc were used to monitor θ in tailings and waste rock layers respectively the 5tm and gs3 probes were calibrated for each material to improve measurement accuracy when calibrated with a specific material both probes have an accuracy of 0 03 m3 m3 for a range of 0 to 100 humidity see kalonji kabambi 2020 for details the volumetric water content sensor was connected to an em 50 datalogger for automatic data recording the measurement interval was fixed at four hours for θ watermark probes irrometer company inc were used to monitor ψ in the different layers and were placed close to volumetric water content sensors four jet fill tensiometers 2725arl of soilmoisture equipment corp were also used to measure suction just above the interface between the reactive waste rock and the tg tailings layers at 1 m next to each monitoring station this type of sensor is known as being more sensitive and precise than the watermark probes bulut and leong 2008 suction near the interface is of interest to validate the presence of capillary barrier effects at the interface indeed when the water pressure exceeds the water entry value wev or water entry pressure of the underlying coarse grained material a breakthrough of the capillary break occurs and the cover is no longer effective in controlling water percolation ross 1990 steenhuis et al 1991 aubertin et al 2009 the measurement range and accuracy of watermark probes are 0 to 200 kpa and 1 kpa respectively the measurement range of jet fill tensiometers is 0 100 kpa with a accuracy of 0 5 1 kpa the ψ values were taken manually every two weeks percolation was measured by weekly sampling of the volumetric lysimeters figs 2c and 3 while surface runoff and lateral percolation in the slope direction were measured also weekly using drainage systems figs 2e f surface runoff lateral percolation and net percolation water were conveyed through pipes to buckets and barrels in order to quantify the water volume fig 3 the percolation water in the volumetric lysimeters was also used to estimate the location where capillary barrier effects disappear and where the cover is no longer effective to divert water called down dip limit ddl point ross 1990 2 3 2 top boundary conditions applied to the inclined experimental cell the hydrogeological behavior of the inclined experimental cell was monitored from may 2017 to october 2019 the monitoring was performed under natural conditions and under controlled conditions simulating artificial wetting events wetting events in 2018 and 2019 were carried out to better assess the diversion capacity of the cover when important precipitation events occur two wetting events were applied based on data of the intensity duration and frequency of short term rainfall events at the rivière heva station 19 km from the mine site published on the environment canada web site 1 1 http climate weatheroffice gc ca prods servs index e html in august 2018 an artificial wetting event of 77 mm over a period of 12 h or 6 4 mm h was applied and in july 2019 the artificial wetting event applied was of 76 mm over a period of 8 h or 9 5 mm h they both correspond to precipitation events with a return period between 50 and 100 years the wetting events were simulated using drip irrigation tubes installed on the inclined cover surface and connected to a water supply pipe fig 4a the water used was pumped from a basin located close the experimental set up figs 4b c d a total of 40 drip irrigation tubes separated by 50 cm were used two water filters action machining inc placed in parallel and an electronic flow meter abb processmaster were installed at the entrance of the irrigation system to filter and to quantify the volume of water added fig 4b during the application of the artificial wetting events the measurement interval was fixed at 5 min for θ and the ψ values were taken manually every 15 min 3 materials properties 3 1 characterization methods the grain size distribution gsd of tg was determined using a malvern mastersizer laser particle size analyser lee black et al 1996 the gsd of wl was determined by mechanical sieving according to astm standard d422 astm 2007a for particles larger than 425 μm and using laser particle size

hydraulic conductivity ksat was evaluated using a standard rigid wall permeameter according to astm standard d5856 astm 2007b wl ksat was mesured using the constant head permeability test in large high density polyethylene hdpe columns 80 cm in height and 30 cm in diameter using the method proposed by peregoedova et al 2013 tg water retention curve wrc was determined using a pressure cell tempe cell following astm d3152 72 astm 2000 wl wrc was obtained through column drainage tests following the procedure proposed by peregoedova et al 2014 experimental data of both materials were fitted with the retention curve retc software van genuchten et al 1991 using the van genuchten 1980 model 3 2 cover materials properties the main physical and hydrogeological characterization results are presented in table 1 and the complete gsds for the materials are presented in fig 5 according to uscs classification mccarthy 2007 the gds of tg and wl were typical of low plastic silt ml and well graded sand sw respectively gs values of tg and wl were of 2 7 and 2 8 respectively the ksat values obtained during the permeability tests ranged from 2 10 4 m s n 0 35 for wl and 5 10 7 m s n 0 45 for tg the air entry values aev obtained from the materials wrcs were 2 5 n 0 43 and 0 003 m n 0 35 of water for the tg and wl respectively the suction ψ r at residual volumetric water content θr values were of the order of 50 and 0 15 m of water for the tg and wl respectively the wev of the laronde reactive waste rock defined in a previous study was about 2 kpa kalonji kabambi 2014 4 main field results 4 1 climatic conditions the average daily air temperatures and daily precipitations close to the site area measured during the testing period may 2017 to october 2019 are shown in fig 6 the highest and lowest average daily air temperatures were 26 c and 34 c respectively with an average temperature during the active monitoring periods may to october of 15 c the average cumulative annual precipitation at the site was 985 mm with approximately 70 under rainfall and 30 under snow form 2 2 http climat meteo gc ca climate normals index f html the liquid precipitation in 2017 2018 and 2019 including artificial wetting events in 2018 and 2019 were 579 733 and 603 mm respectively 4 2 hydrogeological behavior under natural conditions 4 2 1 volumetric water content measurements fig 7 shows θ values in the cover materials for the different monitoring stations from may 2017 to october 2019 in spring may θ values were higher due to snowmelt in summer july and august θ values tended to decrease and stabilized at values that varied depending on the measuring stations in the fall september october θ values in the tg layer tended to increase due to more frequent precipitation events the θ measured by the probes in the winter periods corresponded to unfrozen volumetric water content this explains the significant drops during the winter period where part of the water is transformed into ice a more detailed observation of θ evolution at the different monitoring stations during the active monitoring period when the cover is unfrozen shows that at station a bottom of the slope the θ average value was 0 32 at the bottom of the tg layer 0 23 at the top of this same layer and 0 10 in the wl layer at station b the average θ value was 0 24 in the tg layer and 0 11 in the wl layer at station c the average θ value was 0 24 in the tg layer and 0 08 in the wl layer and at station d top of the slope the θ average value was 0 23 in the tg layer and 0 01 in the wl layer at stations b c and d we notice a non significant difference of θ between the bottom and the top of the tg layer 4 2 2 matric suction measurements fig 8 gives an overview of ψ values measured in different layers over the testing period the values at 0 20 0 50 0 70 m depth were measured with watermark probes while at 1 00 m depth jet fill tensiometers were used suctions were not measured at 1 m depth in 2019 due to technical problems with tensiometers for the 3 years of monitoring the average ψ values for stations a b c and d were respectively 11 12 14 and 16 kpa in the tg layer and 13 14 12 and 16 kpa in the wl layer near the top of the wl layer that is subjected to evaporation the maximum ψ values measured reached 29 50 and 26 kpa respectively in 2017 2018 and 2019 average ψ values slightly increased from bottom of the slope station a to top of the slope station d in both layers of the inclined cover the ψ values near the interface between the reactive waste rock and the tg layer 1 0 m depth are greater average of 12 kpa than the wev of the reactive waste rock about 2 kpa in agreement with the conceptual models of inclined cover presented in several studies e g oldenburg and pruess 1993 bussière et al 2003 kämpf et al 2003 parent and cabral 2006 the suction is slightly higher in the upper part of the inclined cover the hydrogeological results obtained in this study confirms the presence of a well developed capillary barrier effects but do not show a significant difference of volumetric water content in the tg layer between stations located at the top and bottom of the slope the variations in suction between the top and bottom of the cell are relatively low 5 kpa and for these suction values in the tg water retention curve there is no significant variation of volumetric water content less than the precision of the sensor the volumetric water content variations from one monitoring station to the other can also be explained at least in part by the differences in densities inherent to the construction of such a structure despite all the efforts made during construction slight variations of density in the tg material is expected which may result in a behavior that is not perfectly equivalent to that of a homogeneous and isotropic system e g morris and stormont 1998 ning et al 2011 4 3 hydrogeological behavior during wetting events 4 3 1 volumetric water content measurements the evolution of θ values in the differents layers of the experimental cell before during and after the artificial wetting events is presented in fig 9 as can be observed the evolution of θ was similar for the two artificial wetting events indeed during the two wetting events the probes located at 0 20 0 50 and 0 70 m depth of all monitoring stations were affected but with a slighlty different temporal behavior see fig 9 during the wetting events it took approximately less than an hour to notice the start of an increase in θ in the wl layer at station a b c and d with a water arrival first at station a followed by station b c and d figs 9i ii the increase in θ in the tg layer was gradual and continued until the end of the two wetting events it can also be observed that as expected bussière et al 2003 the θ values were usually higher close to the bottom of the slope stations a and b with values reaching the saturation value porosity of 0 35 at station a at 0 50 m lower maximum θ values were observed at station b c and d for the second wetting event this could be due at least in part to slightly lower initial θ values before the wetting event and also to difference of intensity and duration of the tested artificial wetting events e g jackson 1992 sinai and dirksen 2006 4 3 2 matric suction measurements the ψ measurement results in the tg layer during the two wetting events are presented in fig 10 the watermark probes located at 0 50 m at stations a b and c were defective during the second wetting event for the first wetting event fig 10i the wetting front took about an hour to reach 0 20 m depth at all monitoring stations and it took between 8 and 10 h to lower the matric suction to values less than or equal to 5 kpa at 0 50 m depth at stations a b and d at the same depth but at station c the suction stabilized at 7 kpa after 5 h at the depth of 0 70 m the suction reached 5 kpa after 6 9 and 10 h respectively at stations a b and c at the same depth but at station d suction decreased and stabilized at 10 kpa at the end of the test for the second wetting event fig 10ii the wetting front took also about an hour to reach 0 20 m depth at all measurement stations and it took 6 h to lower the matric suction to values less than or equal to 5 kpa at 0 70 m depth at station a at the same elevation suction values decreased and stabilized between 10 and 13 kpa at the end of the test at stations b c and d based on these results it is clear that the wetting events have much more influence near the bottom of the slope station a compared to near the top of the slope station d it can also be observed that for a same station the bottom of the tg layer elevation 0 70 m was less influenced by the wetting event than the top elevation 0 50 m during the first wetting test ψ values measured at the bottom of the tg layer 0 70 m depth reached the wev about 2 kpa of the underlying reactive waste rock after approximately 10 h at stations a and b and after 11 h at station c at station d the ψ value measured at the end of the test was 10 kpa for the second wetting test the ψ values measured at the bottom of the tg layer reached 2 kpa after 7 h at station a and stabilized at 3 11 and 13 kpa respectively at the end of the test at stations b c and d this would mean that the disappearance of the capillary barrier effects was located between station a and b for this test see section 5 2 4 4 net percolation measurements np estimated from the four volumetric lysimeters are presented in fig 11 the water heights m of lysimeters were estimated by dividing the volume of water m3 from the lysimeters and collected in the buckets by the surface of the lysimeter m2 the results obtained under natural climatic conditions indicated that the inclined cover system configuration limited water np to values less than 1 of incident rainfall less than 5 mm of rainfall from may to october 2017 see fig 11i during the 2017 monitoring period np water was collected in lysimeters a b and c only in may just after snowmelt in 2018 when the wetting event of 77 mm in august was combined to natural conditions water percolation values increased at all stations np rates had reached 9 of total precipitation at station a 4 at station b 5 at station c and 1 at station d see fig 11ii more than 70 of the np volume was recorded three weeks after the wetting events this is aligned with suction and volumetric water content measurements that indicate a disapearance of capillary barrier effects at the bottom interface suction lower than the wev of the waste rock and saturation of the tg layer during the wetting event the second level of increased in np in 2018 is due to a significant precipitation approximately 30 mm recorded in one day in september 2018 in 2019 when the wetting event of 76 mm was combined with natural conditions in july np values slightly increased at stations a and b the inclined cover system configuration limited water percolation to values to less than 1 of incident rainfall less than 5 mm of rainfall from may to october 2019 see fig 11iii 4 5 runoff and lateral percolation measurements values of r and lp are presented in fig 12 the sum of the volume of water recovered in the reservoirs related to r and lp were divided by the surface of the inclined cover to obtain an equivalent water height for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 these values corresponded to 19 mm 49 mm and 58 mm of water respectively figs 12i ii iii these last three values represent 3 7 and 10 of total precipitation for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the results obtained also indicate that generally the cumulative volume water of lp between the tg layer reactive waste rock layer drain 1 see fig 3 for drains location is the larger value followed by r drain 3 and the lp between the wl layer and the tg layer drain 2 however in 2017 the volume of r was greater than the volume of lp between the wl layer tg layer and tg layer reactive waste rock layer 4 6 water storage δs in the tg material was determined by integrating the θ profile during the monitoring period table 2 presents monthly water storage in tg layer the highest monthly storage was generally noticed in october while july and august are usually associated to low water storage except when artificial wetting event is applied cumulative storage in height of water in the tg layer was higher in 2018 28 to 58 mm compared to 2019 2 to 11 mm and 2017 8 to 37 mm results showed that there is no clear trend between location along the slope and water storage 4 7 actual evaporation ae was calculated from the other components of the water balance see eq 1 in 2017 during the monitoring under natural conditions the calculated cumulative ae values were 388 384 384 and 309 mm at stations a b c and d respectively from june to october in 2018 when the wetting event of 77 mm was applied in august the calculated cumulative ae values were 521 463 446 and 446 mm at stations a b c and d respectively from june to october from may to october 2019 when the wetting event of 76 mm was applied in july the calculated cumulative ae values were 314 313 310 and 305 mm at stations a b c and d respectively the maximal annual ae rate from june to october is 388 mm in 2017 lys a 521 mm in 2018 lys a and 314 mm in 2019 lys a indicating that the ae rate was higher in the lower portion of the slope where water was more available for transfer to the atmosphere 5 discussion the results of this study described the hydrogeological behavior of an inclined field experimental cell built on a slope of the dyke 1 of the laronde mine tsf this section presents first a comparison between the water balance observed in this study and others found in the literature for mine covers the capacity of the inclined cover to control water infiltration and the water diversion capacity of the inclined cover system is then discussed in more details 5 1 water balance fig 13 presents the water balance results for the non frozen period june to october for year 2017 and shows the dynamic between the components in the spring the soil is usually frozen and the water seeps little and it has no choice but to runoff this behavior is further favored by the slope of the cell then evaporation increases progressively until it exceeds precipitation during the summer at the end of the summer evaporation decreases and drops below precipitation in the fall as evaporation is generally greater than precipitation during the summer this creates a water deficit and storage is reduced this is the case for stations b c and d in 2017 where the cumulative δs are negative table 2 however when precipitation increase in the fall and evaporation is reduced water storage starts to increase and the cover accumulates water in tg layer results also indicate a different hydrogeological behavior across the stations suggesting that the location along the slope affects the hydrogeological behavior of the inclined experimental cell it is worth mentioning that the dynamic presented in fig 13 is representative of years 2018 and 2019 for 2017 when combining all the stations ae was the main component of the water balance with a contribution of 73 followed by r 13 lp 9 δs 3 and by np 2 see fig 13e results of the annual water balance for the years 2018 and 2019 is presented in table 3 the year 2019 is very similar to 2017 while year 2018 has a slightly different behavior with a greater np and δs values 10 and 16 respectively and a lower proportion of r 4 table 3 other studies had presented field water balance of engineered cover estimated through the use of lysimeters see table 4 all these four studies presented in table 4 used covers made of natural materials e g clay till sand gravel that were compacted or not with thicknesses varying between 0 5 and 1 5 m covers were horizontal or inclined with or without vegetation depending on the studies and were evaluated under different climatic conditions and installed over mine tailings or on waste rock the main objective of these different studies were to control water infiltration to the underlying mine tailings or waste rocks in the four studies ae was the main component of the water balance as observed in the present study ae corresponding to 74 of annual precipitations was measured in iowa between 64 and 87 of the rainfall from june to october for the experiments located in the abitibi region first and fourth studies and between 54 and 65 of annual precipitations at the equity mine site weeks and wilson 2006 these results are well aligned with those of the present study with values between 56 and 75 depending on the year of monitoring and the measurement station the second most important component of the water balance in the previously mentioned studies was np with a value of 23 of the annual rainfall in iowa and 10 to 40 of the cumulative rainfall of june to october for the abitibi experiments first and fourth studies preferential flow path was however observed in iowa which increased cumulative percolation for the second study the average measured infiltration from lysimeters placed at the base of the soil cover system was 5 of precipitation for the 3 years of monitoring once more the percentage of percolation measured in the present study 2 under natural conditions and up to 10 under controlled conditions associated with artificial wetting events remain within the range of values measured in these studies even if there were differences in soil layer thickness in the fonction and the geometry of the covers the value of δs was always a small component of the water balance with annual values varying from 5 to 6 in iowa and from 1 to 4 for the experiments performed in abitibi first and fourth studies δs was not measured in the second study in the present study δs values vary more significantly ranging from 3 in natural monitoring conditions and 2 to 16 when the wetting events were applied to the inclined experimental cell finally it is interesting to note that the r value was estimated to 5 of the annual precipitation at the iowa landfill site while the values observed in the present study range between 3 and 15 depending on the year of monitoring 5 2 water diversion capacity of the inclined cover system the control of water infiltration in the tested cover system was performed by different phenomena such as runoff evaporation storage and lateral diversion the diversion capacity of inclined covers that generate capillary barrier effects can be estimated by analytical solutions however these solutions such as those proposed by ross 1990 steenhuis et al 1991 and morel seytoux 1994 are valid for conditions that are not representative of the tested inclined experimental cell steady state condition infinitely thick coarse grained material layer constant pressure or suction at a given distance from the interface along the slope and a deep phreatic surface the other option to estimate the diversion capacity of the inclined capillary barrier is by analysing the suction evolution figs 8 and 10 close to the interface between reactive waste rock and tg tailings during the monitoring period both under natural and artificial wetting conditions under natural conditions suction values near the interface 1 m depth remained greater than the wev of the reactive waste rock fig 8 which indicates that all along the slope the water does not tend to infiltrate the coarse grained reactive waste rock for the first wetting test suction values measured at the bottom of the tg layer reached the wev of the underlying reactive waste rock after approximately 10 h at stations a and b and after 11 h at station c fig 10i which indicate that the capacity to divert water evolved over time water started to infiltrate the reactive waste rock layer near the bottom of the slope and with time the infiltration moved upward to reach between 12 and 16 m from the top of the slope during the second wetting test the suction values measured at the bottom of the tg layer reached the wev of reactive waste rock layer after approximately 10 h at stations a fig 10ii which indicate that the location of infiltration was between 16 and 20 m from the top of the slope as demonstrated by aubertin et al 2009 this upward movement of the infiltration point ddl point continued during the transient period until it stabilized when the steady state is reached during the wetting events the percolation of water in the volumetric lysimeters was aligned with suction measurements close to the interface water started to flow into the lysimeters when the suction measured at the bottom of the tg layer 0 70 m depth reached the wev about 2 kpa of the underlying reactive waste rock more than 70 of the percolation water was recovered in lysimeters a and b located between 12 and 16 m from the top of the slope for the first wetting event and only in lysimeter a located at 16 m from the top of the slope for the second event 5 3 behavior of the cover system to control water infiltration conceptual model the hydrogeological behavior of the inclined cover made with mining materials to control water infiltration evaluated in this study can be summarized as follows under natural conditions fig 14 a first part of the precipitation water ppt that falls on the wl waste rock layer evaporates ae a second part of water flows at the surface as runoff toward the bottom of the slope and a third part of water infiltrates the wl layer a part of this infiltration water is laterally diverted along the wl tg interface lp subsequently the water percolating in the tg layer is laterally diverted along the tailings reactive waste rocks interface lp as water moves along the tg reactive waste rock interface the volumetric water content gradually increases and the suction gradually decreases in spite of lateral drainage and water accumulation in the fine grained layer δs the suction at the interface does not reach the wev of the reactive waste rock preventing net percolation np in conclusion under the natural conditions observed during testing the diversion length ld is greater than the length of the slope 20 m under significant wetting event conditions fig 15 at the beginning the behavior is similar to the one observed in natural conditions a first portion of the precipitation water ppt that falls on the wl layer is diverted as runoff to the bottom of the slope and a second portion infiltrates this layer as for natural conditions part of the infiltration water is laterally diverted lp along the wl tg interface the water percolating in the tailings layer is laterally drained along the tailings reactive waste rocks interface lp but because of the larger volume of water water accumulates at the interface until the suction at the interface exceeds the wev of the underlying coarse grained material steenhuis et al 1991 morris and stormont 1999 cifuentes et al 2006 aubertin et al 2009 rahardjo et al 2012 at this critical point the ddl point the capillary barrier effects begins to disappear and water begins to percolate into the reactive waste rocks layer in our study the ddl was located between stations a and b for the wetting conditions applied generally the effectiveness of the capillary barrier can be improved by sloping the system kämpf et al 2003 by increasing thickness of layers aubertin et al 2009 or by using materials with more appropriate properties however effectiveness decreases with increasing intensity of precipitation qian et al 2010 for the in situ experimental set up studied the percolation oberved especially under natural conditions is low and corresponds to the behavior of an efficient inclined cover however when significant wetting conditions are applied the system failed for a short period of time to control water infiltration into the reactive waste rock due to the disappearance of the capillary barrier effects between the tg material and the reactive waste rock in the context of a design at the real scale a numerical model could be validated using the existing results and then used to design a system that could be efficient for the entire slope length and for these critical conditions the design component was outside the scope of this study 6 conclusion this study assesses the ability of an inclined cover made of mine waste materials to control water infiltration on a reactive waste rock dike at the laronde mine site this reclamation scenario was assessed under natural climatic conditions and artificial wetting events continuous monitoring of volumetric water content matric suction net percolation rate lateral percolation and runoff was used to evaluate the hydrogeological behavior of the inclined capillary barrier cover the data presented in this paper represent three years of monitoring the main conclusions drawn from this in situ study can be summarized as follows results from the inclined experimental cell built at the laronde mine site demonstrated that inclined capillary barrier cover made of mining materials to control water infiltration on reactive waste rocks can be an attractive alternative to control water infiltration the percolation rate results indicated that the cover system configuration limits water net percolation to values less than 1 5 mm of incident rainfall under the 2017 natural climatic conditions the percolation rate values reached a maximum of 10 60 mm of precipitation when wetting events simulating significant precipitation with a period of return between 50 and 100 years were applied once a year to the inclined experimental cell the water balance of the inclined experimental cell showed that the control on infiltration was mainly due to evaporation with a contribution reaching 75 followed by runoff and lateral percolation water was diverted at the interface between wl and tg during wetting events for a certain distance that varied during the test at the end of the two wetting tests the infiltration point or ddl point was located between 12 and 20 m from the top of the slope the observed hydrogeological behavior of the inclined experimental cell indicated that the cover was able to return to its initial hydrogeological behavior in about a week and subsequently regained its capacity to divert water for the next wetting event results obtained from this study showed the potential of a cover made of mining material to control water infiltration on an inclined surface made of waste rock the next step in the design process would be to develop a numerical model to optimize the cover configuration if this scenario is selected for the reclamation of the dyke 1 of laronde tsf the use of mining materials would reduce the use of natural soil would valorize an unused waste and would demonstrate

1441,in this paper a machine learning algorithm based on artificial neural network architecture investigates the correlation between drainage chemistries in seepage water and ambient weather conditions around waste rock piles the proposed neural network consists of a long short term memory unit and a fully connected neural network which uses sequenced input to consider current and previous weather impact on the drainage chemistries a 20 year 1998 2017 monitoring database obtained from the full scale waste rock pile of the equity silver mine in bc canada is used for validating the proposed approach the neural network is trained based on total precipitation and mean temperature as input and the acidity as output the results indicate that the calculated acidity from the trained neural network matches with that measured in the field well in addition the accuracy of calculated acidity can be further increased by adding a time tag of acidity measurement date into the input layer this refined approach can capture the long term evolution and dynamics of hydrogeochemical and biochemical properties inside the waste rock piles keywords machine learning artificial neural network long short term memory full scale waste rock piles drainage chemistry historical monitoring data 1 introduction minesites around the world are composed of various large components such as waste rock piles tailings impoundment ore stockpiles mine walls in pits and underground workings and roads these components contain reactive geologic materials particularly rock that is blasted broken and exposed to air and water resulting in oxidation the geochemical reactions within these components can result in contamination of water passing over and through them dold 2017 parbhakar fox and lottermoser 2015 waste rock piles can be particularly difficult to understand and simulate this is due to complexities such as a large range of mixed and segregated particle sizes laminar and turbulent flow zones deep and irregular convection of both air and water and spatially heterogeneous mineral distributions the flow and chemistry of water draining from these rock piles can be complex and dynamic due to these variables as well as the many hydrogeochemical and biochemical mechanisms occurring inside them their individual contributions and combined interactions create complex temporal patterns in effluent flow and chemistry morin 2019 that are difficult to quantify and simulate mechanistically during the past several decades many predictive mechanistic models have been proposed to study the drainage chemistries in the seepage water from waste rock piles for example molson et al 2005 da silva et al 2009 and fala et al 2013 explored numerical modeling approaches with mass transport equations to assess water flows and geochemical transport inside a waste rock pile liu et al 2019 developed a leaching model based on dimensional analysis and explained the correlation between drainage chemistries and seepage flow rates from waste rock piles ma et al 2020b evaluated the impact of net infiltration on the seepage flow and developed a multicomponent numerical model to predict the iron concentration for a full scale waste rock pile with the development of sensor and data acquisition technology various kinds of data can be automatically generated for mine sites nowadays such as weather monitoring data including precipitation rain snow temperature wind etc and mine site monitoring data including internal temperature gas concentrations air water flow drainage chemistry etc these data can be further accumulated to form a monitoring database which makes it possible to investigate drainage chemistries from waste rock piles based on the approach of analyzing the database compared to the traditional approach the advantage of analyzing the database is that it generally requires much less simplification and fewer assumptions because these monitoring data already inherently contain the information of all the underlying hydrogeochemical and biochemical mechanisms in the field machine learning algorithms is a kind of a mathematical model to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so physical chemical and biological mechanisms are not explicitly included and simulated currently the machine learning technology has been explored to analyze monitoring database from waste rock piles and investigate drainage chemistries in field conditions for instance khandelwal and singh 2005 explored using machine learning to predict the drainage chemistries by incorporating ph temperature and hardness as input however the study was not based on existing mine sites database aryafar et al 2012 assessed heavy metal pollution by machine learning for a copper mine at iran betrie et al 2013 compared the performances of five machine learning techniques for predicting copper concentration at island copper mine in bc canada in betrie s study conductivity ph acidity and effective precipitation were combined as the input to correlate the copper concentration as output ma et al 2020a adopted a fully connected neural network to predict the seepage flow rates measured from a full scale waste rock pile based on purely the environmental input including current and previous weather monitoring data the impacts from short term and long term fluctuation in precipitation and temperature on the seepage flow rates were compared in that paper this paper introduces a machine learning methodology based on artificial neural network to correlate the measured drainage chemistries in the seepage water with the weather monitoring data collected from full scale waste rock piles this study is based on the assumptions that drainage chemistries are controlled by the seepage water which is mainly determined by the temporal evolutions of precipitation and temperature in the field all hydrogeochemical and biochemical properties related to the waste rock piles are considered to be constant time independent here and hence treated as undetermined coefficients inside the neural network which will be determined in the training process and they are not directly reflected in the input layer for training compared to the fully connected neural network proposed in ma et al 2020a this paper extends correlating seepage flow rates to correlating drainage chemistries and also incorporates a long short term memory unit into the neural network architecture the advantage of the architecture proposed in this paper is that it significantly reduces undetermined coefficients inside the neural network for handling sequenced environmental input thus keeping the size of neural network architecture minimum and efficient especially for handling the training with limited observation samples the 20 years of monitoring data collected from the waste rock pile of the equity silver mine are used for validating the proposed approach the results show that the acidity in the seepage water is correlated to the total precipitation and mean temperature in addition this paper also proposes a refined neural network architecture by adding the time tag which is composed of acidity measurement date into the input layer the refined neural network is able to simulate the long term evolution and dynamics of hydrogeochemical and biochemical properties inside the waste rock piles the training results indicate that the refined neural network architecture can provide much better correlation between environmental input and acidity and even reasonably predict future acidities when weather forecast is available on site 2 methodology artificial neural network is a machine learning algorithm defined as an interconnected group of mathematical neurons that simulates biological neurons by performing matrix calculations bishop 1995 hassoun 1995 the artificial neural network has been studied for decades and this mathematical approximation approach is able to mimic biological learning processes through receiving inputs calculating a weighted sum and then passing the sum through a transformation known as activation function to generate outputs recurrent neural network lipton et al 2015 is one category of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence which exhibits temporal dynamic behavior long short term memory lstm unit is a special recurrent neural network architecture which is composed of an input gate an output gate and a forget gate the lstm unit remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the unit lstm was developed to remedy the vanishing gradient problem that is often encountered when training a traditional recurrent neural network they were designed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and were refined and popularized by many people in following work lstm has been proved to work very well on various problems and they are currently widely adopted for sequenced input training in this paper an artificial neural network architecture that consists of a lstm unit and a fully connected neuron layer is proposed to learn the underlying hydrogeochemical and biochemical mechanisms inside real full scale waste rock piles exploring the correlation between the drainage chemistry and weather conditions in field conditions the conceptual schematic of the proposed neuron network architecture is described in fig 1 for waste rock piles the drainage chemistry from the seepage water is mainly controlled by the leaching process inside the piles which is heavily dependent on the water flow mechanisms liu et al 2019 the water flow passing through the waste rock piles examined here section 3 1 below is the combination of two components the net infiltration from precipitation falling directly onto the surface of waste rock pile and the groundwater originating from surrounding uphill infiltration morin et al 2010 indicated that factors such as accumulation of snow infiltration lag times through the waste rock cover and slow delayed changes in basal groundwater flow can directly impact the seepage flow and the drainage chemistries as a result it is believed that the temporal evolution of precipitation is one primary factor affecting the water flow and the leaching process in addition the temporal evolution of environmental temperature is another major factor as it impacts melting of accumulated snowpack evaporation rate that affects the net infiltration into the waste rock pile and convection flow of air into the pile that provides reactant to oxidation reactions thus this study assumes that the temporal evolutions of precipitation and temperature are correlated to the drainage chemistry data although the dependency between them may be very sophisticated in nature consequently the proposed neural network architecture adopts the weather monitoring data as the input and the drainage chemistry data as the output in the input layer of lstm unit current and preceding total precipitation and mean temperature are extracted from the weather monitoring database from environment canada website these weather monitoring data are preprocessed in time sequence before entering into the lstm the mathematical calculation for an lstm unit is generally expressed as follows 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 4 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 5 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 6 h t o t tanh c t where denotes the hadamard product σ is the sigmoid activation function and tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function in addition x t is the input vector weather input data at time step t f t is forget gate s activation vector i t is input update gate s activation vector o t is the output gate s activation vector c t is cell input activation vector h t is hidden state vector or the output vector to the fully connected layer c t is cell state vector w and b are weight matrices and bias vector parameters which need to be learned during training after iterating the designed time steps within the lstm it finally propagates to the next fully connected neuron layer to export the drainage chemistry data the artificial neuron in this layer is calculated as follows 7 dc i t σ w dc i h t b dc i where dc i t is the drainage chemistry data for species i at time step t w dc i and b dc i are weight vector and bias parameter for species i in addition both of the input and output data are pre processed to be normalized before feeding for training the neural network as this allows all undetermined coefficients to be scaled to the same size during the training iterations the normalization generally speeds up learning process and leads to faster convergence in this study the mean for each set of data are set to 0 and the standard deviation is set to 1 the normalization calculation is given as 8 x i 1 n x i n 9 s i 1 n x i x n 10 y i x i x s where x and s is the mean and standard deviation for the data set of x n is the total number of observation samples denotes hadamard division and y is the normalization of x all undetermined coefficients in the proposed neural network architecture are adjusted by feeding observation samples into the calculation here an observation sample is defined as a pair of input and output extracted from monitoring database in the training process all randomly initiated coefficients in eqs 1 7 are updated through a special data iteration technique called backpropagation algorithm as a key process in neural network training the backpropagation algorithm automatically updates the values of coefficients for the lstm unit and all other neurons through calculating the gradient of the cost function for individual or group of observation sample in this study the mean squared errors mse is selected as the cost function which is the average squared difference between calculated outputs and real measurements for output the calculation of mse for a single observation sample is as follows 11 mse 1 m i 1 m dc i dc i 2 where dc i is the ith calculated output dc i is the ith real measurement and m is the number of the drainage chemistry observations for machine learning the performance of the neural network is assessed in the training process to prevent both of underfitting and overfitting based on various validation methods in this study the hold out approach is applied to validate the training performance among all observation samples the training samples are those randomly selected by the computer for actual training the validation samples are randomly determined for evaluating the generalization of the neural network and the training process continues until the generalization does not get improved and the rest are called testing samples which do not impact on the training process but give independent assessment for the training performance after the training process is completed both of mse and r will be used estimate the training performance here r value measures the correlation between calculated results and measured ones which is calculated as follows 12 r m dc dc dc dc m dc 2 d c 2 m dc 2 dc 2 theoretically the lower value for mse and the closer to 1 for r the better training performance a well trained neural network developed in this study is able to predict future drainage chemistries for full scale waste rock piles as long as the historical weather database historical drainage chemistry database and the weather forecast onsite are available 3 a full scale case study 3 1 site information the monitoring data from the equity silver mine at houston bc canada are used for the following case study this mine site is situated on a 1300 m elevation plateau within a humid alpine environment as shown in fig 2 the main waste rock pile of this site contains approximately 80 million tons of waste rock covering an area of approximately 1 4 km2 acid rock drainage ard has been observed from this waste rock pile since the 1980s a soil cover system was installed on the waste rock piles during 1990 1994 with an average thickness of 0 5 m of compacted till and 0 3 m of uncompacted till for reducing the amount of infiltrated water and oxygen extensive research on the ard issue has been performed at the equity silver mine starting from the 1990s the research work focused on hydrological characterization saretzky 1998 cover systems o kane et al 1995 modeling of infiltration lin 2010 geochemical reactions ma et al 2019 morin et al 2012 and leaching process liu et al 2019 ma et al 2020b nevertheless there are still needs for understanding the dynamic natures of the drainage chemistries at the equity silver mine specially a reliable approach to evaluate drainage chemistries under full scale field conditions is critical for the mine site management and contaminant treatment strategies historical weather monitoring at this mine site indicate that the average annual precipitation is about 600 mm with approximately 40 as rain and the rest as snow as mentioned in above section different types of precipitation as rain and snow apparently have differing hydrogeologic mechanisms on the water flow through the waste rock piles which significantly impact the leaching process previous studies liu et al 2019 on this site reveal that the snow november to april and rain april to october seasons have completely different patterns for drainage chemistry which makes traditional data analysis approach hard to capture a universal correlation that can be applied to the whole year 3 2 input output and samples for the neural network in this case study the weather monitoring data at the equity silver site are extracted from the website of environment canada climate weather gc ca the data is in the form of daily averages including minimum temperature maximum temperature mean temperature total rain total snow total precipitation and snow thickness on ground etc a total 20 years monitoring database for 1998 2017 is pre processed for training the proposed neural network architecture as mentioned in the methodology section two independent weather parameters measured on a daily basis the total precipitation and mean temperature are adopted as the neural network inputs for this study in terms of the output of the neural network the chemistries in drainage seepage water are generally measured in a dynamic time frame at the equity silver mine the measurements during march to july are usually more frequent than the remaining time in a year as increased outflow rate is mainly observed during spring freshet and large precipitation periods minimum outflow rate is usually reported in late autumn and winter among all drainage chemistry data from the equity silver mine acidity is selected for this case study as it is directly linked to the lime consumption for ard treatment generally the acidity times the seepage flow rate integrated through time equals to the acidity loading that should be neutralized over the time period which controls the amount of lime consumptions onsite for acidity measurement monitoring stations c7 and bessemer dump bd are collected more frequently than other observation stations the locations for these two observation stations are shown in fig 3 total numbers of acidity measurements for c7 and bd stations during 1998 2017 is 384 and 365 respectively all acidity caco3 equivalent measurements from c7 and bd for the neural network output are plotted in fig 4 for comparison the total precipitation and mean temperature at the equity silver mine for the neural network input are also illustrated in fig 4 it should be noticed that those weather data are monitored on a daily basis and any missing data is represented by a gap as the acidity is not measured in a fixed time frame and the time interval is dynamic each measurement data is represented by a solid point in the figure and then all points are interpolated by straight lines as some weather data are missing at the equity silver site not all acidity measurements at c7 and bd stations are utilized for building the observation samples for machine learning those acidity measurements without a complete time series input data will be neglected regarding the hold out approach to validate the training performance 70 of the total observation samples are used for training 15 for validation and 15 for testing in this case study 3 3 parametric studies from eqs 1 7 the size of the neural network determines the number of undetermined coefficients when the number of observation samples is limited increasing undetermined coefficients may cause overfitting and decreasing may result in underfitting the general guideline to select an optimized neural network for machine learning is to choose the smaller network when the mse and r from two architectures are similar for the proposed neural network architecture shown in fig 1 the size of input and output vectors is generally fixed so the size of hidden state vector h t becomes the main factor controlling the total number of undetermined coefficients a parametric study of 5 10 20 for the hidden states is performed in this case study to find the best neural network architecture which has lowest value for mse and the closest to 1 for r in addition to determine how the past weather can impact on the acidity output for these two monitoring sites c7 and bd two types of input layers are adopted for training in the study the schematic of input layers are provided in fig 5 when a day with a measurement of acidity output is determined that measurement day is defined as current day and that measurement day with previous 6 days are defined as current week type a input layer is compounded by two components total daily precipitation and mean daily temperature with 10 time steps which is extracted from the daily data from previous 10 days type a input layer is mainly to reflect the short term weather impact on the acidity in the field condition regarding type b input layer it has two components total weekly precipitation and mean weekly temperature with 10 time steps which is extracted from the weekly average data from previous 10 weeks type b input layer is designed to evaluate the long term weather impact on the acidity it is observed that type b input layer has longer weather data than type a does while the frequency information mainly daily fluctuation in type b is neglected for comparison both types of input layers are used for training the proposed neural network to figure out which type input layer is more competent to correlate to the acidity stochastic gradient descent with momentum sgdm is adopted as the backpropagation algorithm to update those undetermined coefficients during the training process in terms of detail training parameters the initial learning rate is set to 0 005 and further decreases by 0 2 after 125 epochs the momentum is set to 0 9 and the mini batch size is set to 20 the training stops when the maximum epochs reaches to 200 in addition the training may be stopped early if the network performance on the 15 evaluation datasets stops improving or remains the same for 6 epochs in a row all weight coefficients within the neural network architecture are randomly initialized before the training process so the trainings are iterated 5 times for each scenario to find the lowest mse for the best training performance the proposed neural network architecture is built based on the deep learning toolbox in the commercial software matlab the weather data for neural network input are pre processed in microsoft excel before importing into the matlab the workstation used for the case study consists of intel xeon e5 1650 v4 and 64gb ram 3 4 training results the lowest mses between the real measured acidity and the calculated acidity from the trained neural network in the parametric study are listed in table 1 for the acidity at bd station the results indicate the optimized size for the hidden state in this case study is 10 as it has lower mse than the case with 5 hidden state but similar mse from the case with 20 hidden states furthermore the results from parametric study for bd station illustrate that the type b input layer generally has much better performance than the type a input layer does the mses for type b are also less than those for type a at c7 station however c7 station has less mse improvement from type a to type b compared with the observation from bd stations these results suggest that the acidity may be more dependent on the mid term weather conditions 10 weeks rather than short term ones 10 days for both of bd and c7 stations at the equity silver mine site furthermore fig 6 shows the correlations between the measured acidity and the calculated acidity from the trained neural network with type b input and 10 hidden states for both of bd and c7 stations the correlation for bd station is 0 70 which is much better than 0 51 for c7 station in addition the type b input is also trained by a fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer 10 neurons proposed in ma et al 2020a and the hold out criteria is kept the same the calculated correlation from the fully connected neural network is 0 64 for bd and 0 42 for c7 which shows less correlation than the results from the lstm methodology proposed in this paper the different training performances for bd and c7 can be explained by a spectral analysis that is performed on the water flow rates at equity silver by morin 2016 and morin 2019 this study reveals that the flow rates from c7 station has significant hourly fluctuation in the same scale of yearly fluctuation during spring summer time displaying fractal patterns it means that the acidity measurement at certain time of a day used for this study could fall in a wide range randomly and may not represent the daily average or weekly average acidity to match the input frequency of weather data at c7 station this misrepresentation could lead to data noise for c7 station and deteriorate the training performance especially when the total number of observation samples is limited however the flow rate from bd station is more stable than that from c7 station making the measurement possible to capture the daily average or weekly average of acidity as a result our further discussion will only focus on explaining results for bd station fig 7 illustrates a temporal based comparison between the measured acidity and the calculated acidity from the trained neural network with type b input and 10 hidden states for bd station it shows that the average of measured acidity tends to increase from 1998 to 2009 and then gradually decrease starting from 2010 the input of the proposed neural network is based on the environmental monitoring data that has a similar pattern for each year fig 4 thus it is only capable of capturing the seasonal acidity fluctuation within a year but incapable of reflecting long term acidity fluctuation across years as a result the calculated acidity does not rise and fall through the years as measured acidity does the physical mechanism for the long term fluctuation in acidity could be sophisticated in nature for example this long term fluctuation may be the results of change of internal flow pathway consumption of sulfide minerals generation of secondary minerals etc the training performance could be further improved if these long term evolutions inside the waste rock piles are considered in a refined neural network architecture 3 5 refined neural network architecture to capture long term fluctuation the neural network architecture initially proposed in fig 1 is based on the assumptions that all properties of waste rock pile do not change with time and the drainage chemistry is only dependent on the environmental inputs there are many other hydrogeochemical and biochemical parameters related to the drainage chemistry that are undetermined uncharacterized however for simplicity these parameters are initially considered as constants when calculating the outputs as mentioned above some long term evolutions for these parameters inside waste rock piles should not be neglected in certain conditions and could potentially impact the drainage chemistry thus long term evolution should be included in the model to better simulate this reality ma et al 2020a proposed to integrate the time information when the measurement is performed into the input layer to capture the impact of climate change and long term evolutions inside the waste rock piles the number of the year and the month were added into the input layer of a fully connected neural network to predict the seepage flow rates and the improvement of training performance was observed similarly this paper adds one additional input feature into the sequenced input layer for the lstm module the new input feature is composed of accumulated day number for example the day with first monitoring data is considered as the first day jan 1st 1998 and the corresponding time tag is set to 1 any future time tag for one acidity measurement is the accumulated day number starting from the first day by adding this time tag all hydrogeochemical and biochemical parameters inside the waste rock piles no longer have to remain constant in the temporal scale and now they become potentially time dependent the conceptual details of the refined neural network architecture are explained in fig 8 all parameters related to the training process are selected to be the same to those used for the training of original neural network architecture which are provided in section 3 2 fig 9 compares the correlations between the measured acidity and the calculated acidity at bd station from both trained neural networks with type b input and 10 hidden states the correlation based on the refined neural network is 0 86 and it shows considerable improvement compared with 0 70 obtained from the original neural network architecture fig 6 the corresponding mse for the refined neural network is 0 26 compared with 0 54 for the original one furthermore fig 10 illustrates a temporal based comparison between the measured acidity and the calculated acidity from the refined neural network trained with type b input and 10 hidden states for bd stations it is observed that the long term evolution of acidity that is not reflected in the original neural network in section 3 4 has been well captured by the refined approach generally the refined neural network figures out that the acidity at bd station is in downward trend after 2010 this trend is further combined with the input of seasonal fluctuation of environmental data to output the acidity profile so that the calculated acidity from the refined neural network is able to better represent the real measurements in both of short term within a year and long term cross years temporal scale 3 6 prediction based on historical data it is expected that the proposed neural network architecture is able to predict future drainage chemistry based on studying historical data in this section a refined neural network proposed in section 3 5 with type b input and 10 hidden states will be trained by the first 16 years 1999 2014 acidity data from bd station then the trained neural network is used to predict the following 2 years 2015 2016 contiguous acidity data from bd station the prediction is based on the fact that the acidity data from 2015 to 2016 is unknown when the training is performed for simplification the weather monitoring data from 2015 to 2016 is adopted as the input to predict the acidity data in that 2 years for real prediction weather forecasting data should be adopted as the input of neural network the acidity data from bd station in 1998 and 2017 is not included for training or prediction as they are not complete as the prediction will be performed after the training there is no need to allocate testing data here anymore so 80 of the total observation samples 1999 2014 are randomly selected for training and the rest 20 of the data are for validation in the training process the acidity data 2015 2016 predicted by the trained neural network is compared with the corresponding real monitoring acidity data in fig 11 the mse for all training and validation data 1999 2014 is 0 28 and the mse for prediction data 2015 2016 is 0 23 considering the total number of training samples acidity data is limited in this study the proposed neural network architecture provides reasonable prediction of both short term within a year and long term cross years fluctuations prediction accuracy can be further improved when more historical data is available for training in the future the proposed neural network should not be applied to predict a long time period in the future as the predictions are all based on the past that was used for training all evolutions inside the piles for future are learned from the past and unexpectable factors in the future cannot be included a further parametric study is performed on total precipitation and mean temperature separately to evaluate their impacts on acidity prediction a variation 20 is applied on the total precipitation and mean temperature data from 2015 to 2016 respectively the comparison between the acidity predicted by the varied weather inputs and the acidity from real monitoring data is provided in fig 12 it is observed that the higher 20 total precipitation decreases the acidity and lower 20 total precipitation increases the acidity it explains the fact that when the loading geochemical reaction is stable the acidity is generally in inverse proportion to the total water flow fig 12 also indicates that higher 20 mean temperature fluctuation has higher acidity and lower 20 mean temperature fluctuation has lower acidity here the higher temperature fluctuation refers to higher temperature in summer and lower temperature in winter which means higher temperature difference between the ambient environment and the internal of waste rock pile as a result a stronger convective air flow could bring more fresh oxygen into the pile for geochemical reaction in addition it is found that the sensitivity of mean temperature input on the acidity output is higher than the total precipitation input in this case study 4 conclusions a neural network architecture is proposed in this paper to study the interrelationship between the drainage chemistry data and environmental monitoring data from the field of waste rock piles the advantage of this machine learning based approach generally requires no pre defined simplifications and assumptions for hydrogeochemical and biochemical mechanisms inside full scale waste rock piles the proposed neural network is composed of a lstm unit and a fully connected layer which enables sequenced environmental input to consider the impact of infiltration lag time and delayed change of groundwater on drainage chemistries furthermore the proposed neural network is improved by adding time tags into the input layer to include the impact of long term evolutions and dynamics inside waste rock piles on the drainage chemistries a full scale case study on the waste rock pile of the equity silver mine is performed the results illustrate that the acidity measurements can be correlated to the current and previous total precipitation and mean temperature the dependency of output acidity on previous 10 weeks weather input is stronger than that on previous 10 days weather input in addition the refined neural network architecture can even capture the long term evolution of the acidity measurements in field conditions and even reasonably predict future acidities when weather forecast is available however as a non mechanistic model the proposed neural network cannot predict acidities far away in the future and in particular cannot predict the eventual decline in acidity as the sulfides burn out the study results also indicate that the training performance may deteriorate when the output acidity has higher frequency fluctuation in nature than the data acquisition frequency of environmental input such as caused by fractal temporal patterns to solve this issue it is suggested to increase the data

1441,in this paper a machine learning algorithm based on artificial neural network architecture investigates the correlation between drainage chemistries in seepage water and ambient weather conditions around waste rock piles the proposed neural network consists of a long short term memory unit and a fully connected neural network which uses sequenced input to consider current and previous weather impact on the drainage chemistries a 20 year 1998 2017 monitoring database obtained from the full scale waste rock pile of the equity silver mine in bc canada is used for validating the proposed approach the neural network is trained based on total precipitation and mean temperature as input and the acidity as output the results indicate that the calculated acidity from the trained neural network matches with that measured in the field well in addition the accuracy of calculated acidity can be further increased by adding a time tag of acidity measurement date into the input layer this refined approach can capture the long term evolution and dynamics of hydrogeochemical and biochemical properties inside the waste rock piles keywords machine learning artificial neural network long short term memory full scale waste rock piles drainage chemistry historical monitoring data 1 introduction minesites around the world are composed of various large components such as waste rock piles tailings impoundment ore stockpiles mine walls in pits and underground workings and roads these components contain reactive geologic materials particularly rock that is blasted broken and exposed to air and water resulting in oxidation the geochemical reactions within these components can result in contamination of water passing over and through them dold 2017 parbhakar fox and lottermoser 2015 waste rock piles can be particularly difficult to understand and simulate this is due to complexities such as a large range of mixed and segregated particle sizes laminar and turbulent flow zones deep and irregular convection of both air and water and spatially heterogeneous mineral distributions the flow and chemistry of water draining from these rock piles can be complex and dynamic due to these variables as well as the many hydrogeochemical and biochemical mechanisms occurring inside them their individual contributions and combined interactions create complex temporal patterns in effluent flow and chemistry morin 2019 that are difficult to quantify and simulate mechanistically during the past several decades many predictive mechanistic models have been proposed to study the drainage chemistries in the seepage water from waste rock piles for example molson et al 2005 da silva et al 2009 and fala et al 2013 explored numerical modeling approaches with mass transport equations to assess water flows and geochemical transport inside a waste rock pile liu et al 2019 developed a leaching model based on dimensional analysis and explained the correlation between drainage chemistries and seepage flow rates from waste rock piles ma et al 2020b evaluated the impact of net infiltration on the seepage flow and developed a multicomponent numerical model to predict the iron concentration for a full scale waste rock pile with the development of sensor and data acquisition technology various kinds of data can be automatically generated for mine sites nowadays such as weather monitoring data including precipitation rain snow temperature wind etc and mine site monitoring data including internal temperature gas concentrations air water flow drainage chemistry etc these data can be further accumulated to form a monitoring database which makes it possible to investigate drainage chemistries from waste rock piles based on the approach of analyzing the database compared to the traditional approach the advantage of analyzing the database is that it generally requires much less simplification and fewer assumptions because these monitoring data already inherently contain the information of all the underlying hydrogeochemical and biochemical mechanisms in the field machine learning algorithms is a kind of a mathematical model to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so physical chemical and biological mechanisms are not explicitly included and simulated currently the machine learning technology has been explored to analyze monitoring database from waste rock piles and investigate drainage chemistries in field conditions for instance khandelwal and singh 2005 explored using machine learning to predict the drainage chemistries by incorporating ph temperature and hardness as input however the study was not based on existing mine sites database aryafar et al 2012 assessed heavy metal pollution by machine learning for a copper mine at iran betrie et al 2013 compared the performances of five machine learning techniques for predicting copper concentration at island copper mine in bc canada in betrie s study conductivity ph acidity and effective precipitation were combined as the input to correlate the copper concentration as output ma et al 2020a adopted a fully connected neural network to predict the seepage flow rates measured from a full scale waste rock pile based on purely the environmental input including current and previous weather monitoring data the impacts from short term and long term fluctuation in precipitation and temperature on the seepage flow rates were compared in that paper this paper introduces a machine learning methodology based on artificial neural network to correlate the measured drainage chemistries in the seepage water with the weather monitoring data collected from full scale waste rock piles this study is based on the assumptions that drainage chemistries are controlled by the seepage water which is mainly determined by the temporal evolutions of precipitation and temperature in the field all hydrogeochemical and biochemical properties related to the waste rock piles are considered to be constant time independent here and hence treated as undetermined coefficients inside the neural network which will be determined in the training process and they are not directly reflected in the input layer for training compared to the fully connected neural network proposed in ma et al 2020a this paper extends correlating seepage flow rates to correlating drainage chemistries and also incorporates a long short term memory unit into the neural network architecture the advantage of the architecture proposed in this paper is that it significantly reduces undetermined coefficients inside the neural network for handling sequenced environmental input thus keeping the size of neural network architecture minimum and efficient especially for handling the training with limited observation samples the 20 years of monitoring data collected from the waste rock pile of the equity silver mine are used for validating the proposed approach the results show that the acidity in the seepage water is correlated to the total precipitation and mean temperature in addition this paper also proposes a refined neural network architecture by adding the time tag which is composed of acidity measurement date into the input layer the refined neural network is able to simulate the long term evolution and dynamics of hydrogeochemical and biochemical properties inside the waste rock piles the training results indicate that the refined neural network architecture can provide much better correlation between environmental input and acidity and even reasonably predict future acidities when weather forecast is available on site 2 methodology artificial neural network is a machine learning algorithm defined as an interconnected group of mathematical neurons that simulates biological neurons by performing matrix calculations bishop 1995 hassoun 1995 the artificial neural network has been studied for decades and this mathematical approximation approach is able to mimic biological learning processes through receiving inputs calculating a weighted sum and then passing the sum through a transformation known as activation function to generate outputs recurrent neural network lipton et al 2015 is one category of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence which exhibits temporal dynamic behavior long short term memory lstm unit is a special recurrent neural network architecture which is composed of an input gate an output gate and a forget gate the lstm unit remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the unit lstm was developed to remedy the vanishing gradient problem that is often encountered when training a traditional recurrent neural network they were designed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and were refined and popularized by many people in following work lstm has been proved to work very well on various problems and they are currently widely adopted for sequenced input training in this paper an artificial neural network architecture that consists of a lstm unit and a fully connected neuron layer is proposed to learn the underlying hydrogeochemical and biochemical mechanisms inside real full scale waste rock piles exploring the correlation between the drainage chemistry and weather conditions in field conditions the conceptual schematic of the proposed neuron network architecture is described in fig 1 for waste rock piles the drainage chemistry from the seepage water is mainly controlled by the leaching process inside the piles which is heavily dependent on the water flow mechanisms liu et al 2019 the water flow passing through the waste rock piles examined here section 3 1 below is the combination of two components the net infiltration from precipitation falling directly onto the surface of waste rock pile and the groundwater originating from surrounding uphill infiltration morin et al 2010 indicated that factors such as accumulation of snow infiltration lag times through the waste rock cover and slow delayed changes in basal groundwater flow can directly impact the seepage flow and the drainage chemistries as a result it is believed that the temporal evolution of precipitation is one primary factor affecting the water flow and the leaching process in addition the temporal evolution of environmental temperature is another major factor as it impacts melting of accumulated snowpack evaporation rate that affects the net infiltration into the waste rock pile and convection flow of air into the pile that provides reactant to oxidation reactions thus this study assumes that the temporal evolutions of precipitation and temperature are correlated to the drainage chemistry data although the dependency between them may be very sophisticated in nature consequently the proposed neural network architecture adopts the weather monitoring data as the input and the drainage chemistry data as the output in the input layer of lstm unit current and preceding total precipitation and mean temperature are extracted from the weather monitoring database from environment canada website these weather monitoring data are preprocessed in time sequence before entering into the lstm the mathematical calculation for an lstm unit is generally expressed as follows 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 4 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 5 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 6 h t o t tanh c t where denotes the hadamard product σ is the sigmoid activation function and tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function in addition x t is the input vector weather input data at time step t f t is forget gate s activation vector i t is input update gate s activation vector o t is the output gate s activation vector c t is cell input activation vector h t is hidden state vector or the output vector to the fully connected layer c t is cell state vector w and b are weight matrices and bias vector parameters which need to be learned during training after iterating the designed time steps within the lstm it finally propagates to the next fully connected neuron layer to export the drainage chemistry data the artificial neuron in this layer is calculated as follows 7 dc i t σ w dc i h t b dc i where dc i t is the drainage chemistry data for species i at time step t w dc i and b dc i are weight vector and bias parameter for species i in addition both of the input and output data are pre processed to be normalized before feeding for training the neural network as this allows all undetermined coefficients to be scaled to the same size during the training iterations the normalization generally speeds up learning process and leads to faster convergence in this study the mean for each set of data are set to 0 and the standard deviation is set to 1 the normalization calculation is given as 8 x i 1 n x i n 9 s i 1 n x i x n 10 y i x i x s where x and s is the mean and standard deviation for the data set of x n is the total number of observation samples denotes hadamard division and y is the normalization of x all undetermined coefficients in the proposed neural network architecture are adjusted by feeding observation samples into the calculation here an observation sample is defined as a pair of input and output extracted from monitoring database in the training process all randomly initiated coefficients in eqs 1 7 are updated through a special data iteration technique called backpropagation algorithm as a key process in neural network training the backpropagation algorithm automatically updates the values of coefficients for the lstm unit and all other neurons through calculating the gradient of the cost function for individual or group of observation sample in this study the mean squared errors mse is selected as the cost function which is the average squared difference between calculated outputs and real measurements for output the calculation of mse for a single observation sample is as follows 11 mse 1 m i 1 m dc i dc i 2 where dc i is the ith calculated output dc i is the ith real measurement and m is the number of the drainage chemistry observations for machine learning the performance of the neural network is assessed in the training process to prevent both of underfitting and overfitting based on various validation methods in this study the hold out approach is applied to validate the training performance among all observation samples the training samples are those randomly selected by the computer for actual training the validation samples are randomly determined for evaluating the generalization of the neural network and the training process continues until the generalization does not get improved and the rest are called testing samples which do not impact on the training process but give independent assessment for the training performance after the training process is completed both of mse and r will be used estimate the training performance here r value measures the correlation between calculated results and measured ones which is calculated as follows 12 r m dc dc dc dc m dc 2 d c 2 m dc 2 dc 2 theoretically the lower value for mse and the closer to 1 for r the better training performance a well trained neural network developed in this study is able to predict future drainage chemistries for full scale waste rock piles as long as the historical weather database historical drainage chemistry database and the weather forecast onsite are available 3 a full scale case study 3 1 site information the monitoring data from the equity silver mine at houston bc canada are used for the following case study this mine site is situated on a 1300 m elevation plateau within a humid alpine environment as shown in fig 2 the main waste rock pile of this site contains approximately 80 million tons of waste rock covering an area of approximately 1 4 km2 acid rock drainage ard has been observed from this waste rock pile since the 1980s a soil cover system was installed on the waste rock piles during 1990 1994 with an average thickness of 0 5 m of compacted till and 0 3 m of uncompacted till for reducing the amount of infiltrated water and oxygen extensive research on the ard issue has been performed at the equity silver mine starting from the 1990s the research work focused on hydrological characterization saretzky 1998 cover systems o kane et al 1995 modeling of infiltration lin 2010 geochemical reactions ma et al 2019 morin et al 2012 and leaching process liu et al 2019 ma et al 2020b nevertheless there are still needs for understanding the dynamic natures of the drainage chemistries at the equity silver mine specially a reliable approach to evaluate drainage chemistries under full scale field conditions is critical for the mine site management and contaminant treatment strategies historical weather monitoring at this mine site indicate that the average annual precipitation is about 600 mm with approximately 40 as rain and the rest as snow as mentioned in above section different types of precipitation as rain and snow apparently have differing hydrogeologic mechanisms on the water flow through the waste rock piles which significantly impact the leaching process previous studies liu et al 2019 on this site reveal that the snow november to april and rain april to october seasons have completely different patterns for drainage chemistry which makes traditional data analysis approach hard to capture a universal correlation that can be applied to the whole year 3 2 input output and samples for the neural network in this case study the weather monitoring data at the equity silver site are extracted from the website of environment canada climate weather gc ca the data is in the form of daily averages including minimum temperature maximum temperature mean temperature total rain total snow total precipitation and snow thickness on ground etc a total 20 years monitoring database for 1998 2017 is pre processed for training the proposed neural network architecture as mentioned in the methodology section two independent weather parameters measured on a daily basis the total precipitation and mean temperature are adopted as the neural network inputs for this study in terms of the output of the neural network the chemistries in drainage seepage water are generally measured in a dynamic time frame at the equity silver mine the measurements during march to july are usually more frequent than the remaining time in a year as increased outflow rate is mainly observed during spring freshet and large precipitation periods minimum outflow rate is usually reported in late autumn and winter among all drainage chemistry data from the equity silver mine acidity is selected for this case study as it is directly linked to the lime consumption for ard treatment generally the acidity times the seepage flow rate integrated through time equals to the acidity loading that should be neutralized over the time period which controls the amount of lime consumptions onsite for acidity measurement monitoring stations c7 and bessemer dump bd are collected more frequently than other observation stations the locations for these two observation stations are shown in fig 3 total numbers of acidity measurements for c7 and bd stations during 1998 2017 is 384 and 365 respectively all acidity caco3 equivalent measurements from c7 and bd for the neural network output are plotted in fig 4 for comparison the total precipitation and mean temperature at the equity silver mine for the neural network input are also illustrated in fig 4 it should be noticed that those weather data are monitored on a daily basis and any missing data is represented by a gap as the acidity is not measured in a fixed time frame and the time interval is dynamic each measurement data is represented by a solid point in the figure and then all points are interpolated by straight lines as some weather data are missing at the equity silver site not all acidity measurements at c7 and bd stations are utilized for building the observation samples for machine learning those acidity measurements without a complete time series input data will be neglected regarding the hold out approach to validate the training performance 70 of the total observation samples are used for training 15 for validation and 15 for testing in this case study 3 3 parametric studies from eqs 1 7 the size of the neural network determines the number of undetermined coefficients when the number of observation samples is limited increasing undetermined coefficients may cause overfitting and decreasing may result in underfitting the general guideline to select an optimized neural network for machine learning is to choose the smaller network when the mse and r from two architectures are similar for the proposed neural network architecture shown in fig 1 the size of input and output vectors is generally fixed so the size of hidden state vector h t becomes the main factor controlling the total number of undetermined coefficients a parametric study of 5 10 20 for the hidden states is performed in this case study to find the best neural network architecture which has lowest value for mse and the closest to 1 for r in addition to determine how the past weather can impact on the acidity output for these two monitoring sites c7 and bd two types of input layers are adopted for training in the study the schematic of input layers are provided in fig 5 when a day with a measurement of acidity output is determined that measurement day is defined as current day and that measurement day with previous 6 days are defined as current week type a input layer is compounded by two components total daily precipitation and mean daily temperature with 10 time steps which is extracted from the daily data from previous 10 days type a input layer is mainly to reflect the short term weather impact on the acidity in the field condition regarding type b input layer it has two components total weekly precipitation and mean weekly temperature with 10 time steps which is extracted from the weekly average data from previous 10 weeks type b input layer is designed to evaluate the long term weather impact on the acidity it is observed that type b input layer has longer weather data than type a does while the frequency information mainly daily fluctuation in type b is neglected for comparison both types of input layers are used for training the proposed neural network to figure out which type input layer is more competent to correlate to the acidity stochastic gradient descent with momentum sgdm is adopted as the backpropagation algorithm to update those undetermined coefficients during the training process in terms of detail training parameters the initial learning rate is set to 0 005 and further decreases by 0 2 after 125 epochs the momentum is set to 0 9 and the mini batch size is set to 20 the training stops when the maximum epochs reaches to 200 in addition the training may be stopped early if the network performance on the 15 evaluation datasets stops improving or remains the same for 6 epochs in a row all weight coefficients within the neural network architecture are randomly initialized before the training process so the trainings are iterated 5 times for each scenario to find the lowest mse for the best training performance the proposed neural network architecture is built based on the deep learning toolbox in the commercial software matlab the weather data for neural network input are pre processed in microsoft excel before importing into the matlab the workstation used for the case study consists of intel xeon e5 1650 v4 and 64gb ram 3 4 training results the lowest mses between the real measured acidity and the calculated acidity from the trained neural network in the parametric study are listed in table 1 for the acidity at bd station the results indicate the optimized size for the hidden state in this case study is 10 as it has lower mse than the case with 5 hidden state but similar mse from the case with 20 hidden states furthermore the results from parametric study for bd station illustrate that the type b input layer generally has much better performance than the type a input layer does the mses for type b are also less than those for type a at c7 station however c7 station has less mse improvement from type a to type b compared with the observation from bd stations these results suggest that the acidity may be more dependent on the mid term weather conditions 10 weeks rather than short term ones 10 days for both of bd and c7 stations at the equity silver mine site furthermore fig 6 shows the correlations between the measured acidity and the calculated acidity from the trained neural network with type b input and 10 hidden states for both of bd and c7 stations the correlation for bd station is 0 70 which is much better than 0 51 for c7 station in addition the type b input is also trained by a fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer 10 neurons proposed in ma et al 2020a and the hold out criteria is kept the same the calculated correlation from the fully connected neural network is 0 64 for bd and 0 42 for c7 which shows less correlation than the results from the lstm methodology proposed in this paper the different training performances for bd and c7 can be explained by a spectral analysis that is performed on the water flow rates at equity silver by morin 2016 and morin 2019 this study reveals that the flow rates from c7 station has significant hourly fluctuation in the same scale of yearly fluctuation during spring summer time displaying fractal patterns it means that the acidity measurement at certain time of a day used for this study could fall in a wide range randomly and may not represent the daily average or weekly average acidity to match the input frequency of weather data at c7 station this misrepresentation could lead to data noise for c7 station and deteriorate the training performance especially when the total number of observation samples is limited however the flow rate from bd station is more stable than that from c7 station making the measurement possible to capture the daily average or weekly average of acidity as a result our further discussion will only focus on explaining results for bd station fig 7 illustrates a temporal based comparison between the measured acidity and the calculated acidity from the trained neural network with type b input and 10 hidden states for bd station it shows that the average of measured acidity tends to increase from 1998 to 2009 and then gradually decrease starting from 2010 the input of the proposed neural network is based on the environmental monitoring data that has a similar pattern for each year fig 4 thus it is only capable of capturing the seasonal acidity fluctuation within a year but incapable of reflecting long term acidity fluctuation across years as a result the calculated acidity does not rise and fall through the years as measured acidity does the physical mechanism for the long term fluctuation in acidity could be sophisticated in nature for example this long term fluctuation may be the results of change of internal flow pathway consumption of sulfide minerals generation of secondary minerals etc the training performance could be further improved if these long term evolutions inside the waste rock piles are considered in a refined neural network architecture 3 5 refined neural network architecture to capture long term fluctuation the neural network architecture initially proposed in fig 1 is based on the assumptions that all properties of waste rock pile do not change with time and the drainage chemistry is only dependent on the environmental inputs there are many other hydrogeochemical and biochemical parameters related to the drainage chemistry that are undetermined uncharacterized however for simplicity these parameters are initially considered as constants when calculating the outputs as mentioned above some long term evolutions for these parameters inside waste rock piles should not be neglected in certain conditions and could potentially impact the drainage chemistry thus long term evolution should be included in the model to better simulate this reality ma et al 2020a proposed to integrate the time information when the measurement is performed into the input layer to capture the impact of climate change and long term evolutions inside the waste rock piles the number of the year and the month were added into the input layer of a fully connected neural network to predict the seepage flow rates and the improvement of training performance was observed similarly this paper adds one additional input feature into the sequenced input layer for the lstm module the new input feature is composed of accumulated day number for example the day with first monitoring data is considered as the first day jan 1st 1998 and the corresponding time tag is set to 1 any future time tag for one acidity measurement is the accumulated day number starting from the first day by adding this time tag all hydrogeochemical and biochemical parameters inside the waste rock piles no longer have to remain constant in the temporal scale and now they become potentially time dependent the conceptual details of the refined neural network architecture are explained in fig 8 all parameters related to the training process are selected to be the same to those used for the training of original neural network architecture which are provided in section 3 2 fig 9 compares the correlations between the measured acidity and the calculated acidity at bd station from both trained neural networks with type b input and 10 hidden states the correlation based on the refined neural network is 0 86 and it shows considerable improvement compared with 0 70 obtained from the original neural network architecture fig 6 the corresponding mse for the refined neural network is 0 26 compared with 0 54 for the original one furthermore fig 10 illustrates a temporal based comparison between the measured acidity and the calculated acidity from the refined neural network trained with type b input and 10 hidden states for bd stations it is observed that the long term evolution of acidity that is not reflected in the original neural network in section 3 4 has been well captured by the refined approach generally the refined neural network figures out that the acidity at bd station is in downward trend after 2010 this trend is further combined with the input of seasonal fluctuation of environmental data to output the acidity profile so that the calculated acidity from the refined neural network is able to better represent the real measurements in both of short term within a year and long term cross years temporal scale 3 6 prediction based on historical data it is expected that the proposed neural network architecture is able to predict future drainage chemistry based on studying historical data in this section a refined neural network proposed in section 3 5 with type b input and 10 hidden states will be trained by the first 16 years 1999 2014 acidity data from bd station then the trained neural network is used to predict the following 2 years 2015 2016 contiguous acidity data from bd station the prediction is based on the fact that the acidity data from 2015 to 2016 is unknown when the training is performed for simplification the weather monitoring data from 2015 to 2016 is adopted as the input to predict the acidity data in that 2 years for real prediction weather forecasting data should be adopted as the input of neural network the acidity data from bd station in 1998 and 2017 is not included for training or prediction as they are not complete as the prediction will be performed after the training there is no need to allocate testing data here anymore so 80 of the total observation samples 1999 2014 are randomly selected for training and the rest 20 of the data are for validation in the training process the acidity data 2015 2016 predicted by the trained neural network is compared with the corresponding real monitoring acidity data in fig 11 the mse for all training and validation data 1999 2014 is 0 28 and the mse for prediction data 2015 2016 is 0 23 considering the total number of training samples acidity data is limited in this study the proposed neural network architecture provides reasonable prediction of both short term within a year and long term cross years fluctuations prediction accuracy can be further improved when more historical data is available for training in the future the proposed neural network should not be applied to predict a long time period in the future as the predictions are all based on the past that was used for training all evolutions inside the piles for future are learned from the past and unexpectable factors in the future cannot be included a further parametric study is performed on total precipitation and mean temperature separately to evaluate their impacts on acidity prediction a variation 20 is applied on the total precipitation and mean temperature data from 2015 to 2016 respectively the comparison between the acidity predicted by the varied weather inputs and the acidity from real monitoring data is provided in fig 12 it is observed that the higher 20 total precipitation decreases the acidity and lower 20 total precipitation increases the acidity it explains the fact that when the loading geochemical reaction is stable the acidity is generally in inverse proportion to the total water flow fig 12 also indicates that higher 20 mean temperature fluctuation has higher acidity and lower 20 mean temperature fluctuation has lower acidity here the higher temperature fluctuation refers to higher temperature in summer and lower temperature in winter which means higher temperature difference between the ambient environment and the internal of waste rock pile as a result a stronger convective air flow could bring more fresh oxygen into the pile for geochemical reaction in addition it is found that the sensitivity of mean temperature input on the acidity output is higher than the total precipitation input in this case study 4 conclusions a neural network architecture is proposed in this paper to study the interrelationship between the drainage chemistry data and environmental monitoring data from the field of waste rock piles the advantage of this machine learning based approach generally requires no pre defined simplifications and assumptions for hydrogeochemical and biochemical mechanisms inside full scale waste rock piles the proposed neural network is composed of a lstm unit and a fully connected layer which enables sequenced environmental input to consider the impact of infiltration lag time and delayed change of groundwater on drainage chemistries furthermore the proposed neural network is improved by adding time tags into the input layer to include the impact of long term evolutions and dynamics inside waste rock piles on the drainage chemistries a full scale case study on the waste rock pile of the equity silver mine is performed the results illustrate that the acidity measurements can be correlated to the current and previous total precipitation and mean temperature the dependency of output acidity on previous 10 weeks weather input is stronger than that on previous 10 days weather input in addition the refined neural network architecture can even capture the long term evolution of the acidity measurements in field conditions and even reasonably predict future acidities when weather forecast is available however as a non mechanistic model the proposed neural network cannot predict acidities far away in the future and in particular cannot predict the eventual decline in acidity as the sulfides burn out the study results also indicate that the training performance may deteriorate when the output acidity has higher frequency fluctuation in nature than the data acquisition frequency of environmental input such as caused by fractal temporal patterns to solve this issue it is suggested to increase the data

1442,thermal use of the shallow subsurface and its aquifers 400 m is steadily increasing currently more than 2800 aquifer thermal energy storage ates systems are operating worldwide alongside more than 1 2 million ground source heat pump gshp systems in europe alone these rising numbers of shallow geothermal energy sge systems will put additional pressure on typically vulnerable groundwater systems hitherto suitable criteria to control the thermal use of groundwater in national and international legislations are often still at a preliminary state or even non existing while the european union eu water framework directive wfd defined the release of heat into the groundwater as pollution in the year 2000 the cooling of groundwater for heating purposes is not explicitly mentioned yet in contrast some national legislations have stricter guidelines for example in germany detrimental changes in physical chemical and biological characteristics have to be avoided in the swiss water ordinance it is even recommended that the groundwater biocenosis should be kept in natural state however exact definitions of detrimental changes and natural state are still missing hence the current study provides an overview on natural and affected thermal groundwater conditions and international and national legislations of the thermal use of groundwater also it presents recent studies on groundwater ecosystems and proposes a sustainable policy framework for the thermal use of groundwater in addition to geothermal heat sources other anthropogenic heat sources such as climate change underground car parks heated basements district heating systems land fills wastewater treatment plants and mining are considered although no legislation on these anthropogenic heat sources and their impact on groundwater is currently in place finally we intend to answer the above question and provide recommendations for the further discussions on the joint use of shallow groundwater systems for drinking water production and thermal use keywords geothermal energy thermal use groundwater heat pump systems groundwater temperature anthropogenic heat sources 1 introduction groundwater is a crucial resource for our society and is competitively used for drinking water production irrigation industrial and geothermal applications the latter are applied worldwide to sustainably heat and cool buildings their numbers in particular of low enthalpy shallow geothermal energy sge systems 400 m depth have continuously risen in the past decades e g bayer et al 2012 huttrer 1997 lund toth 2020 sanner et al 2003 a common technological principle is to induce slight seasonal temperature changes within a certain volume of shallow ground and to employ an above ground heat pump for achieving the temperature range needed for the connected heating or cooling device sge systems are typically either closed loop or open loop systems spitler 2005 stauffer et al 2013 closed loop systems such as ground source heat pump gshp systems are based on circulating an artificial heat carrier fluid in a closed loop through devices installed in the ground e g chiasson et al 2000 hähnlein et al 2010 stauffer et al 2013 in contrast open loop variants such as groundwater heat pump gwhp systems extract groundwater directly depending on the mode i e heating or cooling both of these systems cool or heat local groundwater temperatures accordingly e g brielmann et al 2009 muela maya et al 2018 pophillat et al 2020 in addition groundwater can also be utilized to store energy within so called aquifer thermal energy storage ates systems e g bloemendal et al 2014 fleuchaus et al 2018 palmer et al 1992 rostampour et al 2019 typically open systems have a larger thermal impact on groundwater than closed systems hence the thermal impact of their heat or cold injections often referred to as cold and heat plumes have been intensively studied using analytical and numerical methods during the past decades e g andrews 1978 banks 2012 casasso sethi 2015 galgaro cultrera 2013 garcía gil et al 2014 lo russo et al 2016 park et al 2020 wang et al 2019 warner algan 1984 the increasing number of shallow geothermal systems has also technical social and environmental consequences e g hähnlein et al 2013 tsagarakis et al 2020 changes in groundwater temperatures gwt for example impact groundwater quality biodiversity and groundwater ecosystem functioning among others e g brielmann et al 2009 brielmann et al 2011 griebler et al 2016 revealed that a moderate increase in gwt 5 to 10 k in contaminated and oligotrophic energy poor aquifers typically causes only minor alterations in groundwater chemistry microbial diversity and ecosystem functions beside sge systems a multitude of other anthropogenic heat sources such as landfills wastewater treatment plants industrial sites underground car parks heated basements district heating systems and mining thermally impact groundwater e g epting et al 2017 menberg et al 2013a menberg et al 2013b taniguchi et al 2009 tissen et al 2019 westaway younger 2016 in cities these anthropogenic heat sources result in overall increased gwt leading to so called subsurface urban heat islands suhi in settlements with even only 5000 inhabitants e g benz et al 2018a benz et al 2018b epting huggenberger 2013 ferguson woodbury 2007 taniguchi et al 2007 in german cities for example menberg et al 2013a observed typical suhi intensities of about 3 to 7 k and also local hot spots up to 20 k warmer than the rural background gwt tissen et al 2019 recently studied gwt anomalies in more than 10 000 wells in ten european countries with surface air temperatures globally increasing due to climate change e g beltrami et al 2005 green et al 2011 gwt are experiencing the same with a certain delay e g benz et al 2016 benz et al 2017 burns et al 2017 figura et al 2011 hemmerle bayer 2020 kurylyk macquarrie 2014 menberg et al 2014 taylor stefan 2009 thus the natural state of gwt is variously altered by human activities which has led to the implementation of diverse legislations and temperature thresholds with the aim of preserving groundwater quality often based on the precautionary principle like in switzerland or germany hähnlein et al 2010 tsagarakis et al 2020 these studies revealed that the legislations across european countries are very heterogeneous and although the european wfd european union 2000 classifies heat input into the aquifer as pollution guidelines are often vague tissen et al 2019 demonstrated that gwt are frequently affected by non regulated anthropogenic heat sources regularly exceeding current temperature threshold values for open geothermal systems such thresholds however are legally binding in only six european countries austria denmark france liechtenstein the netherlands and switzerland hähnlein et al 2010 furthermore only in switzerland and liechtenstein these threshold values are universally applied in comparison to undisturbed gwt independent from the type of groundwater use and disturbance with allowed temperature ranges between 3 k in liechtenstein and 3 k in switzerland temperature thresholds in the remaining countries apply to the geo thermal use of groundwater only while other anthropogenic heat sources are neglected this highlights the need for a holistic and sustainable thermal management of groundwater addressing all heat sources and balancing the growing conflict between various groundwater users the key objective of the present study is to discuss and answer the following question is thermal use of groundwater a pollution to do so first natural and affected thermal conditions of groundwater are contrasted in detail and diverse anthropogenic heat sources are identified and described second an overview of current international and national legislations on the thermal use of groundwater is provided moreover the results are discussed in context of a suggested sustainable policy framework for the thermal use of groundwater finally the question will be answered and recommendations for a sustainable thermal management of groundwater are provided 2 thermal groundwater conditions 2 1 natural conditions the surface energy balance predicts that near surface and shallow subsurface including groundwater temperatures are naturally in dynamic equilibrium e g benz et al 2017 hölting coldewey 2019 hence in rural areas annual mean gwt can be estimated using surface air temperatures sat ground surface temperatures gst or land surface temperatures lst derived from satellite images benz et al 2016 čermák et al 2014 demonstrated that in warm or moderate climates this estimation is valid however more factors and complex processes have to be considered benz et al 2017 revealed that the offset δt between near surface and subsurface temperatures is predominantly influenced by latent heat in form of evapotranspiration and insulation in form of snow cover thus considering both processes shallow gwt can be globally estimated with an approximate resolution of 1 km 1 km and a root mean square error of 1 4 k fig 1 illustrates observed and estimated shallow gwt 60 m below surface in europe representing natural thermal groundwater conditions however these natural conditions are progressively altered by anthropogenic activities such as man made climate change urbanization and other anthropogenic activities that disturb the surface energy balance e g taylor stefan 2008 taylor stefan 2009 2 2 affected condition 2 2 1 climate change one dominant and globally acting anthropogenic factor for increased gwt is the accelerating climate change the latter has been intensively studied over the last decades e g bates et al 2008 bense et al 2020 green et al 2011 gunawardhana kazama 2012 kurylyk macquarrie 2014 although gwt is known to be a significant driver for water quality and groundwater ecosystem processes e g griebler et al 2016 korbel et al 2017 sharma et al 2012 few studies have focused on climate change in subsurface systems and the implications on groundwater and groundwater dependent ecosystems e g kløve et al 2014 kurylyk et al 2014a b mammola et al 2019 mastrocicco et al 2019 mcdonough et al 2020 as global gwt is linked to evapotranspiration i e latent heat and snow cover i e insulation which themselves are affected by climate change gwt might experience accelerated changes in the future e g dagenais et al 2020 figura et al 2011 demonstrated that in the late 1980s an atmospheric phenomenon called the arctic oscillation impacted water temperatures in the entire northern hemisphere hari et al 2006 and among others also groundwater temperatures this so called climate regime shift crs occurred in the years 1987 and 1988 and resulted in a rise in gwt by 0 7 1 1 k in swiss aquifers table 1 menberg et al 2014 confirmed this crs and detected also a second crs in two german aquifers in the late 1990s the observed gwt change ranged between 0 3 and 0 6 k in contrast to the increase in sat gwt changes are damped and show time lags between 1 and 4 years in addition we also studied time series of sat and gwt in karlsruhe germany over the last 50 years indicating a significant increase in sat and gwt fig 1 from 1968 to 2018 the sat increased by 2 5 k which is 0 5 k per decade the latter is above the globally observed increase in sat which warmed by 0 5 k since the middle of the nineteenth century e g hartmann et al 2013 jones briffa 1992 in contrast average gwt rose by 1 0 k over this time period table 1 which is 0 2 k per decade revealing an average damping of the temperature signal by 40 hence climate change has already impacted gwt and will continue to do so globally although the magnitude compared to the atmosphere is damped shallow aquifers 100 m below surface have warmed up and will continue to do so similar to sat fig 2 using historical data and linear regression figura et al 2015 projected a likely warming of 1 1 to 3 8 k due to climate change and increasing stream temperatures in swiss aquifers fed by riverbank infiltration until 2100 2 2 2 subsurface urban heat islands in the last decades the phenomena of suhi was observed in numerous cities worldwide for example tokyo taniguchi et al 2005 winnipeg ferguson woodbury 2004 berlin menberg et al 2013a london headon et al 2009 basel epting et al 2017 paris hemmerle et al 2019 and amsterdam visser et al 2020 a recent overview on suhi is provided by bayer et al 2019 regional studies in asia e g taniguchi et al 2009 europe e g tissen et al 2019 and north america e g eggleston mccoy 2015 documented increased urban subsurface temperatures including gwt ranging between 2 and 6 k table 1 as an example groundwater temperature depth profiles of the suhi in berlin are illustrated in fig 3 the measured gwt in the city center are up to 6 k higher than in the rural area furthermore the profiles reveal that the suhi in berlin reaches down to a depth of more than 100 m similar depths are also detected in other cities such as osaka and winnipeg e g benz et al 2018a zhu et al 2010 epting et al 2017 measured increased gwt by up to 6 and 8 k in commercial and industrial areas of basel switzerland table 1 in two german cities karlsruhe and cologne menberg et al menberg et al 2013b and benz et al 2015 could demonstrate that the dominant heat fluxes responsible for the development of the suhi are increased ground surface temperatures mainly due to sealing and basements of buildings hence these studies showed that in suhi groundwater temperatures typically increase by up to 6 k table 1 however local gwt anomalies reaching temperatures higher than 25 c also exist e g bayer et al 2019 tissen et al 2019 these extreme temperatures can be of natural or anthropogenic origin to further investigate such anthropogenic heat anomalies benz et al 2017 introduced the anthropogenic heat intensity ahi which is defined as the difference between the gwt at a specific well location and the median of the surrounding rural background gwt tissen et al 2019 evaluated more than 10 000 wells in europe showing that extreme gwt anomalies between 25 and 47 c are typically related to natural hot springs in contrast ahis ranging between 3 and 10 k are due to anthropogenic heat sources such as land fills wastewater treatment plants or mining operations table 1 furthermore two thirds of all heat anomalies beneath artificial surface have an ahi 6 k and are specifically attributed to heated basements district heating systems and underground car parks the latter often represent dominant local sources as illustrated for an underground car park in vienna austria with basement temperatures of more than 26 c fig 4 this anthropogenic thermal footprint on aquifer systems and in particular gwt can have positive negative or also no impacts for example changing thermal conditions of contaminant transport in groundwater can enhance dissolution and biodegradation e g beyer et al 2016 zuurbier et al 2013 and also alter groundwater ecosystems e g brielmann et al 2011 griebler et al 2016 furthermore increased gwt can be an additional heat source for the application of sge systems resulting in more efficient systems e g epting et al 2020 rivera et al 2017 in contrast higher gwt can also reduce the efficiency of groundwater cooling systems which are commonly applied in urban areas e g schüppler et al 2019 likewise sge systems thermally alter the groundwater and have manifold impacts e g hähnlein et al 2013 due to this increasing anthropogenic thermal footprint on groundwater the thermal use of groundwater should be further studied regulated and finally also sustainably managed hence the next chapter provides an overview of current international and national regulations on the thermal use of groundwater 3 legal aspects worldwide there are no common rules and directives on the thermal use of groundwater however in 2010 the united nations un general assembly identified the human right to water and sanitation through the resolution 64 292 this calls upon on all states and international organizations to provide safe clean accessible and affordable drinking water half of which is supplied by groundwater foster chilton 2003 previously the european union eu passed the wfd and in article 2 2000 the following statement is given for the definition of pollution european union 2000 pollution means the direct and indirect introduction as a result of human activity of substances or heat into the air water or land which may be harmful to human health or the quality of aquatic ecosystems or terrestrial ecosystems directly depending on aquatic ecosystems which result in damage to material property or which impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment thus according to the wfd 2000 transfer of heat into water is considered to be a pollution as it results or may result in adverse effects to resident groundwater organisms and ecosystem services chapman 2007 however although heat is defined as a pollution only few studies exist that have addressed its effects on the ecological status of aquatic specifically groundwater or groundwater dependent ecosystems brielmann et al 2009 brielmann et al 2011 in particular long term field studies on the aquatic biodiversity and groundwater ecosystem functions are lacking griebler et al 2016 thus far only few studies indicate that heat i e increased gwt results in irrecoverable biological effects in 2006 the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec passed and groundwater is explicitly mentioned as a valuable natural resource european union 2006 groundwater is a valuable natural resource and as such should be protected from deterioration and chemical pollution this is particularly important for groundwater dependent ecosystems and for the use of groundwater in water supply for human consumption it also mentioned that criteria should be established for the identification of any significant and sustained upward trends in pollutant concentrations which according to the wfd would also include heat however to our knowledge such criteria do not exist yet beside the protection of groundwater for drinking water supply the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec explicitly mentions also groundwater dependent ecosystems e g bertrand et al 2012 kløve et al 2014 conversely this fact also provides space for other uses such as the application of sge systems to obtain an overview of the legal status for the thermal use of groundwater hähnlein et al 2010 performed an international survey in more than 60 countries worldwide they demonstrated that in most countries no specific legislation is in place and until now only in few european countries recommended and or legally binding legislations exist for instance legally binding threshold values for gwt currently only exist in the six following european countries austria denmark france liechtenstein netherlands and switzerland fig 5 table 2 unfortunately all six countries have differently defined threshold values and even the eu member states deviate in austria three types of threshold values are defined gwt difference maximum and minimum gwt yet again the scientific justification of these thresholds is lacking or even non existent and they appear to be almost arbitrarily chosen however they have a huge impact on the feasibility and efficiency of sge systems hence there is an urgent need for further studies and european wide guidelines this high diversity on european and international legislations acts also as a main market barrier for sge systems tsagarakis et al 2020 thus we strongly recommend a consistent approach and framework in europe and even worldwide which is subsequently discussed in more detail 4 recommendations hitherto only few european countries have a legislation for the thermal use of groundwater hähnlein et al 2010 tsagarakis et al 2020 in addition technical assessments for the licensing of sge systems are often not required and if required they are inconsistent between countries e g abesser et al 2018 based on the previously suggested legal framework by hähnlein et al 2013 we present an updated and more precise policy framework for a sustainable thermal use of groundwater 4 1 suggested policy framework in fig 6 the updated policy framework is illustrated for open systems such as groundwater heat pump gwhp and aquifer thermal energy storage ates systems closed systems are neglected here as their thermal and spatial impacts on aquifers are typically very local 4 2 technical assessment in contrast to the suggested sge policy framework by hähnlein et al 2013 we distinguish between small 45 mwh a medium 45 mwh a and large 10 l s open loop systems these values are primarily based on the experience from licensing of open systems in the state of baden württemberg south west germany as part of an expert panel as the first step of the technical assessment and planning the applicant has to provide a hydrogeological conceptual model hcm of the site demonstrating site specific understanding of the subsurface followed by the development of the hcm and depending on the system type and size analytical or numerical heat transport simulations have to be performed showing the thermal influence i e thermal plumes of the planned installations recently pophillat et al 2020 provided a set of analytical solutions and according to the groundwater flow velocity and well injection rate three analytical solutions for the simulation of the thermal plume can be applied 1 a radial heat transport model 2 a linear advective heat transport model and 3 a planar advective heat transport model for larger groundwater flow velocities 1 m d and well injections rates 2 l s however the provided analytical solutions deviate from the numerical simulations thus numerical simulations should be used in these cases e g casasso sethi 2015 le lous et al 2020 nam ooka 2010 palmer et al 1992 stauffer et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 the technical assessment is completed if the applicant can prove that there is no thermal interference with any previously implemented installations and or other site specific thermal anomalies if this is the case for small sized systems 45 mwh a the license can be approved fig 6 4 3 environmental assessment for medium and large systems 45 mwh a we recommend an environmental assessment which in particular addresses site specific conditions such as water chemistry groundwater quality and groundwater ecological conditions furthermore the environmental assessment could also include one or even both proposed concepts made by griebler et al 2015 1 the thermal impact and or 2 the minor threshold values in german they are called geringfügigkeitsschwellenwerte which are routinely used for chemicals this concept is based on the precautionary principle and could be applied for example for the later proposed groundwater protection zone in contrast the thermal impact considers i the amplitude δt of the temperature alterations from the natural background conditions ii the volume impacted by the thermal disturbance and iii the duration of the thermal impact however specific definitions and values for both concepts are not available yet and still have to be identified and defined nevertheless initially it should be verified that the planned system is not located in any existing protection zone or any groundwater contamination in contrast to the water protection zone which is well established in germany hölting coldewey 2019 mull 1981 we suggest to introduce a novel groundwater protection zone fig 7 the aim of this specific groundwater protection zone gpz is the protection of groundwater which is not specifically used for drinking water supply i e water protection zone yet crucial for vulnerable groundwater ecosystems and groundwater dependent ecosystems hence such gpz have to be identified on local and regional levels and if possible marked with the illustrated signpost fig 7 furthermore such local groundwater protection zones have to be harmonized and adapted to already existing protection concepts such as water protection zones and nature protection areas e g european natura 2000 for example wirsing et al 2020 introduced a concept for an integrated nature conservation valuation which provides an ecologically sustainable groundwater abstraction management this concept which in particular addresses the nature value of an area could be extended to also account for the thermal impact on groundwater including the subsurface in form of local groundwater protection zones an initial environmental assessment of the groundwater fauna in an urban aquifer was recently performed by koch et al 2020 the aim was to assess the ecological condition of anthropogenically influenced aquifer using the classification scheme developed by griebler et al 2014 the main outcome of the study is illustrated in fig 8 showing groundwater wells which indicate natural or anthropogenically affected conditions the assessment shows that in about 60 of the sampled wells the ecological conditions is not in a good ecological state i e affected while there is no spatial pattern surprisingly even in the natural forest which hosts a large water work and associated water protection zone only half of the wells indicate good ecological or natural conditions these results clearly demonstrate the challenge related to develop a sound ecological and environmental assessment of local aquifer systems hence more experimental and in particular long term field studies are required to assess the current ecological status of the groundwater and also to further understand the thermal sensitivity of the groundwater biocenosis and their ecosystem functions due to local differences such as hydrogeology water chemistry and background temperatures fig 1 hähnlein et al 2013 previously recommended not to use static regulations such as minimum and maximum gwt as shown in table 2 instead relative criteria such as temperature differences δt are endorsed to address such varying conditions and settings the latter should be based on natural in situ conditions griebler et al 2016 showed that based on the current knowledge a moderate increase in gwt by 5 to 10 k results in minor changes in water chemistry microbial biodiversity and ecosystem function in pristine and energy poor aquifers hence we recommend two distinct temperature differences δt max 5 k in vulnerable groundwater ecosystems i e locations within groundwater protection zones and 10 k in other conditions i e natural and affected conditions fig 6 high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage ht ates systems which are still rare and operate at higher temperatures 40 c e g fleuchaus et al 2018 can significantly impact the subsurface e g bonte et al 2011a bonte et al 2011b bonte et al 2013a bonte et al 2013b fleuchaus et al 2020 for example bonte et al 2013b revealed in laboratory experiments that at 60 c there is a significant increase in concentrations of specific and also harmful compounds such as phosphorus arsenic molybdenum vanadium boron and fluorine hence for ht ates systems site specific environmental assessments should be performed in contrast if sge systems are solely used for heating the reinjection causes a local decrease in gwt in denmark for example the minimum allowed temperature is defined by 2 c table 2 moreover in geotechnical interventions such as artificial ground freezing e g alzoubi et al 2020 soil and groundwater temperatures are even lowered below 0 c making the soil water and groundwater finally freeze although several ecological studies have investigated the thermal impact on the groundwater biocenosis with increasing temperatures e g brielmann et al 2009 griebler et al 2014 to our knowledge only few studies for example by brielmann et al 2011 and bonte et al 2013b have performed laboratory studies at low temperatures with 4 c and 5 c respectively both studies demonstrated that at low temperatures there are no significant effects on water quality nevertheless the environmental impact of lowering soil and groundwater temperatures has hardly been investigated thus there is also a demand to improve our understanding of the thermal impact at lower temperatures 5 c in particular in the field and over longer time periods 5 conclusion the importance of groundwater as a resource for drinking water supply and home of essential ecosystem services is undeniable and as such is explicitly mentioned in the un sustainable development goal 6 however there is an increasing pressure on this resource in particular from agricultural use mainly in respect to quantity and from renewable energies in particular from sge systems in respect to quality in this study we investigated the impact of the thermal use of groundwater in particular and draw the following conclusions there are various often superposing anthropogenic heat sources resulting in an increase of groundwater temperatures not only due the operations of sge systems the thermal groundwater condition is therefore often already affected and different from the expected natural state increased gwt can generally have negative effects on chemical physical and biological conditions according to the eu wfd heat is considered to be a pollutant moderate increases in groundwater temperatures from 5 k to 10 k however appear to cause only minor changes in water chemistry microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functions in pristine and energy poor oligotrophic aquifers a comprehensive understanding of the harmfulness of changing groundwater temperatures however is still lacking a policy framework for a sustainable thermal use of shallow groundwater is proposed static regulations for heating or cooling of groundwater should not be used instead temperature limits should be relative and orientated on background values priority areas for specific uses i e thermal hydraulic etc should be discussed and defined by environmental lawyers together with local authorities local groundwater protection zones should be identified marked and harmonized with existing protection concepts such as water protection zones and nature protection areas there is a need for further research in particular to better understand the thermal sensitivity of the groundwater biocenosis and their ecosystem functions long term field studies are lacking finally the stated question cannot be clearly answered as we do not fully know at what point changes in gwt become harmful and only if they are harmful heat can be truly considered to be a pollutant nevertheless at present we can only conclude that moderate temperature changes of 10 k appear to have minor and harmless impacts on our groundwater ecosystems in pristine and energy poor aquifers i e oligotrophic conditions in energy rich i e eutrophic conditions aquifers this conclusion still has to be verified however temperature changes larger than 10 k do significantly alter this vulnerable ecosystem and therefore have to be explicitly considered in the legislation and a sustainable groundwater management the suggested policy framework for a sustainable thermal use of shallow groundwater provides a road map to balance between the different stakeholders and their interests furthermore final decisions should be made with all stakeholders on a local level where the different interests and needs can be weighed against each other one important first step for such a holistic and sustainable management of groundwater resources are numerical flow solute and heat transport models of the local groundwater system which already exist partly for several cities such as basel epting huggenberger 2013 zaragoza garcía gil et al 2016 and lyon attard et al 2016 based on the gained insights from such numerical flow heat and transport models including local contaminated sites groundwater resource management and renewable energy plans can be harmonized finally in order to obtain a local consensus we propose regular and enduring roundtable meetings with all relevant stakeholders shuzhong et al 2017 the latter strongly depends on the national and local situations however these meetings should include local authorities water and energy supply companies scientists

1442,thermal use of the shallow subsurface and its aquifers 400 m is steadily increasing currently more than 2800 aquifer thermal energy storage ates systems are operating worldwide alongside more than 1 2 million ground source heat pump gshp systems in europe alone these rising numbers of shallow geothermal energy sge systems will put additional pressure on typically vulnerable groundwater systems hitherto suitable criteria to control the thermal use of groundwater in national and international legislations are often still at a preliminary state or even non existing while the european union eu water framework directive wfd defined the release of heat into the groundwater as pollution in the year 2000 the cooling of groundwater for heating purposes is not explicitly mentioned yet in contrast some national legislations have stricter guidelines for example in germany detrimental changes in physical chemical and biological characteristics have to be avoided in the swiss water ordinance it is even recommended that the groundwater biocenosis should be kept in natural state however exact definitions of detrimental changes and natural state are still missing hence the current study provides an overview on natural and affected thermal groundwater conditions and international and national legislations of the thermal use of groundwater also it presents recent studies on groundwater ecosystems and proposes a sustainable policy framework for the thermal use of groundwater in addition to geothermal heat sources other anthropogenic heat sources such as climate change underground car parks heated basements district heating systems land fills wastewater treatment plants and mining are considered although no legislation on these anthropogenic heat sources and their impact on groundwater is currently in place finally we intend to answer the above question and provide recommendations for the further discussions on the joint use of shallow groundwater systems for drinking water production and thermal use keywords geothermal energy thermal use groundwater heat pump systems groundwater temperature anthropogenic heat sources 1 introduction groundwater is a crucial resource for our society and is competitively used for drinking water production irrigation industrial and geothermal applications the latter are applied worldwide to sustainably heat and cool buildings their numbers in particular of low enthalpy shallow geothermal energy sge systems 400 m depth have continuously risen in the past decades e g bayer et al 2012 huttrer 1997 lund toth 2020 sanner et al 2003 a common technological principle is to induce slight seasonal temperature changes within a certain volume of shallow ground and to employ an above ground heat pump for achieving the temperature range needed for the connected heating or cooling device sge systems are typically either closed loop or open loop systems spitler 2005 stauffer et al 2013 closed loop systems such as ground source heat pump gshp systems are based on circulating an artificial heat carrier fluid in a closed loop through devices installed in the ground e g chiasson et al 2000 hähnlein et al 2010 stauffer et al 2013 in contrast open loop variants such as groundwater heat pump gwhp systems extract groundwater directly depending on the mode i e heating or cooling both of these systems cool or heat local groundwater temperatures accordingly e g brielmann et al 2009 muela maya et al 2018 pophillat et al 2020 in addition groundwater can also be utilized to store energy within so called aquifer thermal energy storage ates systems e g bloemendal et al 2014 fleuchaus et al 2018 palmer et al 1992 rostampour et al 2019 typically open systems have a larger thermal impact on groundwater than closed systems hence the thermal impact of their heat or cold injections often referred to as cold and heat plumes have been intensively studied using analytical and numerical methods during the past decades e g andrews 1978 banks 2012 casasso sethi 2015 galgaro cultrera 2013 garcía gil et al 2014 lo russo et al 2016 park et al 2020 wang et al 2019 warner algan 1984 the increasing number of shallow geothermal systems has also technical social and environmental consequences e g hähnlein et al 2013 tsagarakis et al 2020 changes in groundwater temperatures gwt for example impact groundwater quality biodiversity and groundwater ecosystem functioning among others e g brielmann et al 2009 brielmann et al 2011 griebler et al 2016 revealed that a moderate increase in gwt 5 to 10 k in contaminated and oligotrophic energy poor aquifers typically causes only minor alterations in groundwater chemistry microbial diversity and ecosystem functions beside sge systems a multitude of other anthropogenic heat sources such as landfills wastewater treatment plants industrial sites underground car parks heated basements district heating systems and mining thermally impact groundwater e g epting et al 2017 menberg et al 2013a menberg et al 2013b taniguchi et al 2009 tissen et al 2019 westaway younger 2016 in cities these anthropogenic heat sources result in overall increased gwt leading to so called subsurface urban heat islands suhi in settlements with even only 5000 inhabitants e g benz et al 2018a benz et al 2018b epting huggenberger 2013 ferguson woodbury 2007 taniguchi et al 2007 in german cities for example menberg et al 2013a observed typical suhi intensities of about 3 to 7 k and also local hot spots up to 20 k warmer than the rural background gwt tissen et al 2019 recently studied gwt anomalies in more than 10 000 wells in ten european countries with surface air temperatures globally increasing due to climate change e g beltrami et al 2005 green et al 2011 gwt are experiencing the same with a certain delay e g benz et al 2016 benz et al 2017 burns et al 2017 figura et al 2011 hemmerle bayer 2020 kurylyk macquarrie 2014 menberg et al 2014 taylor stefan 2009 thus the natural state of gwt is variously altered by human activities which has led to the implementation of diverse legislations and temperature thresholds with the aim of preserving groundwater quality often based on the precautionary principle like in switzerland or germany hähnlein et al 2010 tsagarakis et al 2020 these studies revealed that the legislations across european countries are very heterogeneous and although the european wfd european union 2000 classifies heat input into the aquifer as pollution guidelines are often vague tissen et al 2019 demonstrated that gwt are frequently affected by non regulated anthropogenic heat sources regularly exceeding current temperature threshold values for open geothermal systems such thresholds however are legally binding in only six european countries austria denmark france liechtenstein the netherlands and switzerland hähnlein et al 2010 furthermore only in switzerland and liechtenstein these threshold values are universally applied in comparison to undisturbed gwt independent from the type of groundwater use and disturbance with allowed temperature ranges between 3 k in liechtenstein and 3 k in switzerland temperature thresholds in the remaining countries apply to the geo thermal use of groundwater only while other anthropogenic heat sources are neglected this highlights the need for a holistic and sustainable thermal management of groundwater addressing all heat sources and balancing the growing conflict between various groundwater users the key objective of the present study is to discuss and answer the following question is thermal use of groundwater a pollution to do so first natural and affected thermal conditions of groundwater are contrasted in detail and diverse anthropogenic heat sources are identified and described second an overview of current international and national legislations on the thermal use of groundwater is provided moreover the results are discussed in context of a suggested sustainable policy framework for the thermal use of groundwater finally the question will be answered and recommendations for a sustainable thermal management of groundwater are provided 2 thermal groundwater conditions 2 1 natural conditions the surface energy balance predicts that near surface and shallow subsurface including groundwater temperatures are naturally in dynamic equilibrium e g benz et al 2017 hölting coldewey 2019 hence in rural areas annual mean gwt can be estimated using surface air temperatures sat ground surface temperatures gst or land surface temperatures lst derived from satellite images benz et al 2016 čermák et al 2014 demonstrated that in warm or moderate climates this estimation is valid however more factors and complex processes have to be considered benz et al 2017 revealed that the offset δt between near surface and subsurface temperatures is predominantly influenced by latent heat in form of evapotranspiration and insulation in form of snow cover thus considering both processes shallow gwt can be globally estimated with an approximate resolution of 1 km 1 km and a root mean square error of 1 4 k fig 1 illustrates observed and estimated shallow gwt 60 m below surface in europe representing natural thermal groundwater conditions however these natural conditions are progressively altered by anthropogenic activities such as man made climate change urbanization and other anthropogenic activities that disturb the surface energy balance e g taylor stefan 2008 taylor stefan 2009 2 2 affected condition 2 2 1 climate change one dominant and globally acting anthropogenic factor for increased gwt is the accelerating climate change the latter has been intensively studied over the last decades e g bates et al 2008 bense et al 2020 green et al 2011 gunawardhana kazama 2012 kurylyk macquarrie 2014 although gwt is known to be a significant driver for water quality and groundwater ecosystem processes e g griebler et al 2016 korbel et al 2017 sharma et al 2012 few studies have focused on climate change in subsurface systems and the implications on groundwater and groundwater dependent ecosystems e g kløve et al 2014 kurylyk et al 2014a b mammola et al 2019 mastrocicco et al 2019 mcdonough et al 2020 as global gwt is linked to evapotranspiration i e latent heat and snow cover i e insulation which themselves are affected by climate change gwt might experience accelerated changes in the future e g dagenais et al 2020 figura et al 2011 demonstrated that in the late 1980s an atmospheric phenomenon called the arctic oscillation impacted water temperatures in the entire northern hemisphere hari et al 2006 and among others also groundwater temperatures this so called climate regime shift crs occurred in the years 1987 and 1988 and resulted in a rise in gwt by 0 7 1 1 k in swiss aquifers table 1 menberg et al 2014 confirmed this crs and detected also a second crs in two german aquifers in the late 1990s the observed gwt change ranged between 0 3 and 0 6 k in contrast to the increase in sat gwt changes are damped and show time lags between 1 and 4 years in addition we also studied time series of sat and gwt in karlsruhe germany over the last 50 years indicating a significant increase in sat and gwt fig 1 from 1968 to 2018 the sat increased by 2 5 k which is 0 5 k per decade the latter is above the globally observed increase in sat which warmed by 0 5 k since the middle of the nineteenth century e g hartmann et al 2013 jones briffa 1992 in contrast average gwt rose by 1 0 k over this time period table 1 which is 0 2 k per decade revealing an average damping of the temperature signal by 40 hence climate change has already impacted gwt and will continue to do so globally although the magnitude compared to the atmosphere is damped shallow aquifers 100 m below surface have warmed up and will continue to do so similar to sat fig 2 using historical data and linear regression figura et al 2015 projected a likely warming of 1 1 to 3 8 k due to climate change and increasing stream temperatures in swiss aquifers fed by riverbank infiltration until 2100 2 2 2 subsurface urban heat islands in the last decades the phenomena of suhi was observed in numerous cities worldwide for example tokyo taniguchi et al 2005 winnipeg ferguson woodbury 2004 berlin menberg et al 2013a london headon et al 2009 basel epting et al 2017 paris hemmerle et al 2019 and amsterdam visser et al 2020 a recent overview on suhi is provided by bayer et al 2019 regional studies in asia e g taniguchi et al 2009 europe e g tissen et al 2019 and north america e g eggleston mccoy 2015 documented increased urban subsurface temperatures including gwt ranging between 2 and 6 k table 1 as an example groundwater temperature depth profiles of the suhi in berlin are illustrated in fig 3 the measured gwt in the city center are up to 6 k higher than in the rural area furthermore the profiles reveal that the suhi in berlin reaches down to a depth of more than 100 m similar depths are also detected in other cities such as osaka and winnipeg e g benz et al 2018a zhu et al 2010 epting et al 2017 measured increased gwt by up to 6 and 8 k in commercial and industrial areas of basel switzerland table 1 in two german cities karlsruhe and cologne menberg et al menberg et al 2013b and benz et al 2015 could demonstrate that the dominant heat fluxes responsible for the development of the suhi are increased ground surface temperatures mainly due to sealing and basements of buildings hence these studies showed that in suhi groundwater temperatures typically increase by up to 6 k table 1 however local gwt anomalies reaching temperatures higher than 25 c also exist e g bayer et al 2019 tissen et al 2019 these extreme temperatures can be of natural or anthropogenic origin to further investigate such anthropogenic heat anomalies benz et al 2017 introduced the anthropogenic heat intensity ahi which is defined as the difference between the gwt at a specific well location and the median of the surrounding rural background gwt tissen et al 2019 evaluated more than 10 000 wells in europe showing that extreme gwt anomalies between 25 and 47 c are typically related to natural hot springs in contrast ahis ranging between 3 and 10 k are due to anthropogenic heat sources such as land fills wastewater treatment plants or mining operations table 1 furthermore two thirds of all heat anomalies beneath artificial surface have an ahi 6 k and are specifically attributed to heated basements district heating systems and underground car parks the latter often represent dominant local sources as illustrated for an underground car park in vienna austria with basement temperatures of more than 26 c fig 4 this anthropogenic thermal footprint on aquifer systems and in particular gwt can have positive negative or also no impacts for example changing thermal conditions of contaminant transport in groundwater can enhance dissolution and biodegradation e g beyer et al 2016 zuurbier et al 2013 and also alter groundwater ecosystems e g brielmann et al 2011 griebler et al 2016 furthermore increased gwt can be an additional heat source for the application of sge systems resulting in more efficient systems e g epting et al 2020 rivera et al 2017 in contrast higher gwt can also reduce the efficiency of groundwater cooling systems which are commonly applied in urban areas e g schüppler et al 2019 likewise sge systems thermally alter the groundwater and have manifold impacts e g hähnlein et al 2013 due to this increasing anthropogenic thermal footprint on groundwater the thermal use of groundwater should be further studied regulated and finally also sustainably managed hence the next chapter provides an overview of current international and national regulations on the thermal use of groundwater 3 legal aspects worldwide there are no common rules and directives on the thermal use of groundwater however in 2010 the united nations un general assembly identified the human right to water and sanitation through the resolution 64 292 this calls upon on all states and international organizations to provide safe clean accessible and affordable drinking water half of which is supplied by groundwater foster chilton 2003 previously the european union eu passed the wfd and in article 2 2000 the following statement is given for the definition of pollution european union 2000 pollution means the direct and indirect introduction as a result of human activity of substances or heat into the air water or land which may be harmful to human health or the quality of aquatic ecosystems or terrestrial ecosystems directly depending on aquatic ecosystems which result in damage to material property or which impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment thus according to the wfd 2000 transfer of heat into water is considered to be a pollution as it results or may result in adverse effects to resident groundwater organisms and ecosystem services chapman 2007 however although heat is defined as a pollution only few studies exist that have addressed its effects on the ecological status of aquatic specifically groundwater or groundwater dependent ecosystems brielmann et al 2009 brielmann et al 2011 in particular long term field studies on the aquatic biodiversity and groundwater ecosystem functions are lacking griebler et al 2016 thus far only few studies indicate that heat i e increased gwt results in irrecoverable biological effects in 2006 the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec passed and groundwater is explicitly mentioned as a valuable natural resource european union 2006 groundwater is a valuable natural resource and as such should be protected from deterioration and chemical pollution this is particularly important for groundwater dependent ecosystems and for the use of groundwater in water supply for human consumption it also mentioned that criteria should be established for the identification of any significant and sustained upward trends in pollutant concentrations which according to the wfd would also include heat however to our knowledge such criteria do not exist yet beside the protection of groundwater for drinking water supply the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec explicitly mentions also groundwater dependent ecosystems e g bertrand et al 2012 kløve et al 2014 conversely this fact also provides space for other uses such as the application of sge systems to obtain an overview of the legal status for the thermal use of groundwater hähnlein et al 2010 performed an international survey in more than 60 countries worldwide they demonstrated that in most countries no specific legislation is in place and until now only in few european countries recommended and or legally binding legislations exist for instance legally binding threshold values for gwt currently only exist in the six following european countries austria denmark france liechtenstein netherlands and switzerland fig 5 table 2 unfortunately all six countries have differently defined threshold values and even the eu member states deviate in austria three types of threshold values are defined gwt difference maximum and minimum gwt yet again the scientific justification of these thresholds is lacking or even non existent and they appear to be almost arbitrarily chosen however they have a huge impact on the feasibility and efficiency of sge systems hence there is an urgent need for further studies and european wide guidelines this high diversity on european and international legislations acts also as a main market barrier for sge systems tsagarakis et al 2020 thus we strongly recommend a consistent approach and framework in europe and even worldwide which is subsequently discussed in more detail 4 recommendations hitherto only few european countries have a legislation for the thermal use of groundwater hähnlein et al 2010 tsagarakis et al 2020 in addition technical assessments for the licensing of sge systems are often not required and if required they are inconsistent between countries e g abesser et al 2018 based on the previously suggested legal framework by hähnlein et al 2013 we present an updated and more precise policy framework for a sustainable thermal use of groundwater 4 1 suggested policy framework in fig 6 the updated policy framework is illustrated for open systems such as groundwater heat pump gwhp and aquifer thermal energy storage ates systems closed systems are neglected here as their thermal and spatial impacts on aquifers are typically very local 4 2 technical assessment in contrast to the suggested sge policy framework by hähnlein et al 2013 we distinguish between small 45 mwh a medium 45 mwh a and large 10 l s open loop systems these values are primarily based on the experience from licensing of open systems in the state of baden württemberg south west germany as part of an expert panel as the first step of the technical assessment and planning the applicant has to provide a hydrogeological conceptual model hcm of the site demonstrating site specific understanding of the subsurface followed by the development of the hcm and depending on the system type and size analytical or numerical heat transport simulations have to be performed showing the thermal influence i e thermal plumes of the planned installations recently pophillat et al 2020 provided a set of analytical solutions and according to the groundwater flow velocity and well injection rate three analytical solutions for the simulation of the thermal plume can be applied 1 a radial heat transport model 2 a linear advective heat transport model and 3 a planar advective heat transport model for larger groundwater flow velocities 1 m d and well injections rates 2 l s however the provided analytical solutions deviate from the numerical simulations thus numerical simulations should be used in these cases e g casasso sethi 2015 le lous et al 2020 nam ooka 2010 palmer et al 1992 stauffer et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 the technical assessment is completed if the applicant can prove that there is no thermal interference with any previously implemented installations and or other site specific thermal anomalies if this is the case for small sized systems 45 mwh a the license can be approved fig 6 4 3 environmental assessment for medium and large systems 45 mwh a we recommend an environmental assessment which in particular addresses site specific conditions such as water chemistry groundwater quality and groundwater ecological conditions furthermore the environmental assessment could also include one or even both proposed concepts made by griebler et al 2015 1 the thermal impact and or 2 the minor threshold values in german they are called geringfügigkeitsschwellenwerte which are routinely used for chemicals this concept is based on the precautionary principle and could be applied for example for the later proposed groundwater protection zone in contrast the thermal impact considers i the amplitude δt of the temperature alterations from the natural background conditions ii the volume impacted by the thermal disturbance and iii the duration of the thermal impact however specific definitions and values for both concepts are not available yet and still have to be identified and defined nevertheless initially it should be verified that the planned system is not located in any existing protection zone or any groundwater contamination in contrast to the water protection zone which is well established in germany hölting coldewey 2019 mull 1981 we suggest to introduce a novel groundwater protection zone fig 7 the aim of this specific groundwater protection zone gpz is the protection of groundwater which is not specifically used for drinking water supply i e water protection zone yet crucial for vulnerable groundwater ecosystems and groundwater dependent ecosystems hence such gpz have to be identified on local and regional levels and if possible marked with the illustrated signpost fig 7 furthermore such local groundwater protection zones have to be harmonized and adapted to already existing protection concepts such as water protection zones and nature protection areas e g european natura 2000 for example wirsing et al 2020 introduced a concept for an integrated nature conservation valuation which provides an ecologically sustainable groundwater abstraction management this concept which in particular addresses the nature value of an area could be extended to also account for the thermal impact on groundwater including the subsurface in form of local groundwater protection zones an initial environmental assessment of the groundwater fauna in an urban aquifer was recently performed by koch et al 2020 the aim was to assess the ecological condition of anthropogenically influenced aquifer using the classification scheme developed by griebler et al 2014 the main outcome of the study is illustrated in fig 8 showing groundwater wells which indicate natural or anthropogenically affected conditions the assessment shows that in about 60 of the sampled wells the ecological conditions is not in a good ecological state i e affected while there is no spatial pattern surprisingly even in the natural forest which hosts a large water work and associated water protection zone only half of the wells indicate good ecological or natural conditions these results clearly demonstrate the challenge related to develop a sound ecological and environmental assessment of local aquifer systems hence more experimental and in particular long term field studies are required to assess the current ecological status of the groundwater and also to further understand the thermal sensitivity of the groundwater biocenosis and their ecosystem functions due to local differences such as hydrogeology water chemistry and background temperatures fig 1 hähnlein et al 2013 previously recommended not to use static regulations such as minimum and maximum gwt as shown in table 2 instead relative criteria such as temperature differences δt are endorsed to address such varying conditions and settings the latter should be based on natural in situ conditions griebler et al 2016 showed that based on the current knowledge a moderate increase in gwt by 5 to 10 k results in minor changes in water chemistry microbial biodiversity and ecosystem function in pristine and energy poor aquifers hence we recommend two distinct temperature differences δt max 5 k in vulnerable groundwater ecosystems i e locations within groundwater protection zones and 10 k in other conditions i e natural and affected conditions fig 6 high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage ht ates systems which are still rare and operate at higher temperatures 40 c e g fleuchaus et al 2018 can significantly impact the subsurface e g bonte et al 2011a bonte et al 2011b bonte et al 2013a bonte et al 2013b fleuchaus et al 2020 for example bonte et al 2013b revealed in laboratory experiments that at 60 c there is a significant increase in concentrations of specific and also harmful compounds such as phosphorus arsenic molybdenum vanadium boron and fluorine hence for ht ates systems site specific environmental assessments should be performed in contrast if sge systems are solely used for heating the reinjection causes a local decrease in gwt in denmark for example the minimum allowed temperature is defined by 2 c table 2 moreover in geotechnical interventions such as artificial ground freezing e g alzoubi et al 2020 soil and groundwater temperatures are even lowered below 0 c making the soil water and groundwater finally freeze although several ecological studies have investigated the thermal impact on the groundwater biocenosis with increasing temperatures e g brielmann et al 2009 griebler et al 2014 to our knowledge only few studies for example by brielmann et al 2011 and bonte et al 2013b have performed laboratory studies at low temperatures with 4 c and 5 c respectively both studies demonstrated that at low temperatures there are no significant effects on water quality nevertheless the environmental impact of lowering soil and groundwater temperatures has hardly been investigated thus there is also a demand to improve our understanding of the thermal impact at lower temperatures 5 c in particular in the field and over longer time periods 5 conclusion the importance of groundwater as a resource for drinking water supply and home of essential ecosystem services is undeniable and as such is explicitly mentioned in the un sustainable development goal 6 however there is an increasing pressure on this resource in particular from agricultural use mainly in respect to quantity and from renewable energies in particular from sge systems in respect to quality in this study we investigated the impact of the thermal use of groundwater in particular and draw the following conclusions there are various often superposing anthropogenic heat sources resulting in an increase of groundwater temperatures not only due the operations of sge systems the thermal groundwater condition is therefore often already affected and different from the expected natural state increased gwt can generally have negative effects on chemical physical and biological conditions according to the eu wfd heat is considered to be a pollutant moderate increases in groundwater temperatures from 5 k to 10 k however appear to cause only minor changes in water chemistry microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functions in pristine and energy poor oligotrophic aquifers a comprehensive understanding of the harmfulness of changing groundwater temperatures however is still lacking a policy framework for a sustainable thermal use of shallow groundwater is proposed static regulations for heating or cooling of groundwater should not be used instead temperature limits should be relative and orientated on background values priority areas for specific uses i e thermal hydraulic etc should be discussed and defined by environmental lawyers together with local authorities local groundwater protection zones should be identified marked and harmonized with existing protection concepts such as water protection zones and nature protection areas there is a need for further research in particular to better understand the thermal sensitivity of the groundwater biocenosis and their ecosystem functions long term field studies are lacking finally the stated question cannot be clearly answered as we do not fully know at what point changes in gwt become harmful and only if they are harmful heat can be truly considered to be a pollutant nevertheless at present we can only conclude that moderate temperature changes of 10 k appear to have minor and harmless impacts on our groundwater ecosystems in pristine and energy poor aquifers i e oligotrophic conditions in energy rich i e eutrophic conditions aquifers this conclusion still has to be verified however temperature changes larger than 10 k do significantly alter this vulnerable ecosystem and therefore have to be explicitly considered in the legislation and a sustainable groundwater management the suggested policy framework for a sustainable thermal use of shallow groundwater provides a road map to balance between the different stakeholders and their interests furthermore final decisions should be made with all stakeholders on a local level where the different interests and needs can be weighed against each other one important first step for such a holistic and sustainable management of groundwater resources are numerical flow solute and heat transport models of the local groundwater system which already exist partly for several cities such as basel epting huggenberger 2013 zaragoza garcía gil et al 2016 and lyon attard et al 2016 based on the gained insights from such numerical flow heat and transport models including local contaminated sites groundwater resource management and renewable energy plans can be harmonized finally in order to obtain a local consensus we propose regular and enduring roundtable meetings with all relevant stakeholders shuzhong et al 2017 the latter strongly depends on the national and local situations however these meetings should include local authorities water and energy supply companies scientists

1443,groundwater in the coastal districts of west bengal india is highly susceptible to various factors such as over pumping variations in rainfall lower elevation and risk due to sea level rise in addition to these factors tropical cyclone induced storm surge and saltwater intrusion also induce potential risks to the quality of the coastal aquifers there are several knowledge gaps as many of these factors have not previously been systematically and rigorously analysed furthermore up to date information is either unavailable or insufficient accordingly the present study analysed the groundwater vulnerability during the pre and post monsoon months for the period from 2001 to 2010 at three main coastal districts of west bengal east midnapore south 24 parganas and north 24 parganas administrative regions the galdit index based model was employed to assess salt water intrusion into the groundwater using geographic information system gis spatial distribution maps were also generated to identify highly vulnerable groundwater locations map removal and single parameter sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the sensitivity of the parameters the study reveals that the depth of ground water levels for the three districts increased and also the rainfall exerts a significant effect on the groundwater depth the chemical constituents tds and chloride contents in groundwater during the period 2004 to 2010 were analysed the average tds range values for pre and post monsoon seasons were observed to vary in the range between 100 and 3874 mg l and 83 1929 mg l respectively reports indicate that groundwater in the area is highly saturated with iron containing minerals like fe oh 3 goethite and hematite and is also moderately saturated with the calcite chalcedony dolomite and quartz whereas under saturated with anhydrite and gypsum the implications of the research points to the urgent need for remedial action and appropriate responses at policy level to protect groundwater keywords groundwater vulnerability saltwater intrusion galdit gis sensitivity analysis climate change 1 introduction groundwater is the water that is stored underground typically in the pores and crevices of soil sand and or rock often referred to as aquifers groundwater is an important source of drinking water it is also used for agricultural irrigation and industrial processes as well as a vital component of many natural ecosystems raghunath 1987 ritter et al 2002 groundwater resources are particularly important in arid regions where surface water is scarce kardan moghaddam et al 2015 overheu et al 2014 however there are many pressures and strains on groundwater resources including weather systems meteorology climate change and urban development herbert and döll 2019 michael et al 2017 richey et al 2015 rapid population growth and urbanization results in over pumping of the fresh water which leads to depletion of groundwater and also decreases or increases the chemical levels green et al 2011 morris et al 2003 this raises groundwater vulnerability which is a measure of how easy or difficult it is for pollution contamination at the land surface to reach a production aquifer harter and rollins 2008 morris et al 2003 coastal aquifers in addition to surface pollution are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion from seawater adepelumi et al 2009 cheng et al 1999 kardan moghaddam et al 2017 additional factors that affect coastal aquifers for saltwater intrusion are tidal fluctuations topography recharge rate rainfall evaporation seasonal changes and climate change coastal zones are subject to more severe and complex issues than most other land and water resources and form an important component of much needed water resources systems custodio and bruggeman 1987 rahman et al 2018 safi et al 2018 tulipano and fidelibus 1988 coastal zones often contain relatively larger populations because of many locational benefits in terms of food economy and industrial development this increase in human intervention over coastal areas lead to increasing demand of fresh water studies anwar and aggarwal 2016 lobo ferreira et al 2005 maity et al 2017 moharana and patra 2014 santha sophiya and syed 2013 have been conducted for different coastal aquifers of india recently manivannan and elango 2019 delineated the area and locations of seawater intrusion and submarine groundwater discharge along the entire indian coast and reported that 7 of the total coastal area groundwater level is directly below mean sea level and therefore affected by the saltwater intrusion sea water is denser as compared to fresh water and over pumping of the fresh water leads to intrusion of saltwater into the coastal aquifer the theoretical explanation for saltwater intrusion was given by the ghyben herzberg relation drabbe and badon ghijben 1898 herzberg 1901 according to this relation there exists a hydrostatic equilibrium between fresh water and saltwater i e for every one meter of fresh water above the sea level there exists 40 m of fresh water below sea level in an unconfined aquifer thus for a loss of 1 m of fresh water above sea level 40 m of fresh water below sea level is lost until equilibrium is reached hence maintaining the fresh groundwater balance is very important to avoid groundwater vulnerability furthermore changes in groundwater levels with respect to mean sea elevation along the coast largely influences the extent of seawater intrusion in the fresh water aquifers lobo ferreira et al 2005 groundwater rise fall depends upon several factors such as rainfall recharge flow rate type of soil pumping capacity and many more elements maliva 2020 osborn and hardy 1999a van stempvoort et al 1993 in addition to these above aspects climate variability also plays a very crucial role in influencing groundwater researchers showed that climate change has a direct impact on soils land cover hydrologic systems with increasing temperatures variability of rainfall evapotranspiration and showed increased frequency in extreme events as cyclones floods and droughts hamed et al 2018 mokadem et al 2018 two major climatic conditions that are influencing the rainfall over the indian continent are the el niño southern oscillation enso and indian ocean dipole iod enso and iod influence rainfall and drought conditions leading to changes in groundwater availability fu et al 2019 gupta et al 2018 huang et al 2019 lipczynska kochany 2018 millar et al 2018 beside surface water getting affected the potential impacts of the drought trend with quantity and quality deterioration are also linked to climate change hamed et al 2018 the quality of the water in an aquifer also depends on the type of sedimentary basins the swi and mineralisation in sedimentary basin assessment is also a key factor to understand the the potential artificial recharge for an aquifer hamed et al 2018 ncibi et al 2020b ncibi et al 2020a there are different methods for identifying groundwater vulnerability such as drastic sintacs si pi gods avi epik wespa irish maia pesticide and galdit and each was developed for specific conditions carvalho resende et al 2019 kardan moghaddam et al 2017 all these are index based methods that were developed for different specific conditions and requirements and out of all these methods galdit is the most widely used specifically for coastal areas although there are different methods for use the drastic and galdit models were extensively used because they are cost effective easily available parameters as data and provide relatively accurate results for extensive regions trabelsi et al 2016 the remaining index based methods are either most specialised methods that need extensive collection of data or just a simple assessment of chemical constituents therefore one can choose the method depending upon the available parameters the galdit model was first developed by lobo ferriera and chachadi in 2001 and has been implemented in different coastal regions throughout the world adroja 2014 ezekiel et al 2016 lobo ferreira et al 2005 kardan moghaddam et al 2017 recinos et al 2015 satishkumar et al 2016 even though index based methods are widely used for the continuous estimation of saltwater intrusion geophysical and geochemical observational analyses are also widely used in such analyses vertical electrical resistivity methods are used to measure chemical parameters such as cl tds hardness ph etc to observe the salt affected regions adeoti et al 2010 ginzburg et al 1976 song et al 2006 while there are several knowledge gaps as many of these factors have not previously been systematically and rigorously analysed furthermore up to date information is either unavailable or insufficient in three districts of west bengal india accordingly the present study mainly focussed on the generation of groundwater vulnerability maps for the coastal districts east midnapore em south 24 parganas s24p and north 24 parganas n24p of west bengal india using the galdit model this model has been in use for many locations across the world for numerous studies and is the proven method to establish basic vulnerability zones with typically available data without much complications therefore for any region in india with lack of many available parameters in long term this could be a good approach these maps can be useful for better planning and policy making to reduce vulnerability and better safeguard groundwater resources in this study the observed chemical parameters during the period 2001 2010 were also analysed 2 study area the west bengal coast is located at latitude 21 35 n and longitude 87 30 89 10 e the remarkable coastal feature are the sundarbans islands which span between west bengal and bangladesh the west bengal part of the sundarbans are the largest occupied mangroves in india and consist of many different islands the coastline length of almost 220 km is in a very complex geometrical structure due to the large area of the river braided network flowing into the ocean in west bengal the major important regions that are under high risk are the hugli river estuary sundarbans digha mangroves and various islands for example sagar island the hugli river estuary is vulnerable due to its high levels of pollution and contamination because of domestic agriculture and industrial waste also head water flow has decreased due to increased consumption of river water leading to erosion sundarbans mangroves act as a protective barrier to natural hazards like cyclones and soil erosion but the reclamation of sundarbans for the benefit of industrial and urban development is leading to over exposure of land to these natural hazards digha beach with its high level of tourism activities has been eroding and also suffering from an increased risk of oil pollution in coastal waters due to the use of boats that use oil saltwater intrusion now plays a major role increasing the groundwater vulnerability of these districts west bengal coastal districts em s24p and n24p organized into administrative blocks which include major urban settlements are of particular interest to this study fig 1 additionally the land use land cover map has been prepared from bhuvan thematic data https bhuvan app1 nrsc gov in thematic thematic index php the map statistics shows that the total built up area for the districts em n24p and s24p are 1234 05 km2 844 2 km2 2302 78 km2 respectively whereas coastal wet lands are occupied with an area of 35 68 km2 8 91 km2 and 92 85 km2 for the same the area of the districts em s24p and n24p are 4736 km2 9960 km2 and 4094 km2 respectively the districts s24p and n24p are low lying areas with lots of river networks tidal rivers and creeks these districts total 50 blocks 29 blocks are in s24p 5 blocks are in n24p and 16 blocks are in pm these districts are highly vulnerable to frequently occurring tropical cyclones and their induced storm surges coinciding with frequent river floods furthermore the rapid increase in population due to port activities urbanization and resource utilization is leading to over pumping of fresh groundwater the former hazards result in sea water intrusion swi onto the land surface while the later hazards result in swi in groundwater with respect to these vulnerabilities sea level rise due to climate change and vice versa are also intensifying risks on the west bengal coast which is one of the important coastal zones of india for both biological productivities and socio economic improvement hence in the present study it is proposed to conduct research in the light of the above mentioned swi over the west bengal coastal districts 2 1 hydrometeorology of the study area the general climate of these regions is sub tropical with a humid atmosphere the climate of these districts are influenced by northeast and southwest monsoons the hydrological conditions from 1973 to 2010 were observed for the present study and the annual average precipitation is 1675 mm for this period the observations revealed that the maximum rainfall was found for the months june july august and september whereas the remaining months showed lowest from these hydrological conditions the former months are considered as the wet period and the later ones as the dry period with average precipitation 1480 mm and 150 mm respectively the rainfall trends and variabilities are shown in fig 2a and the annual average rainfall wet and dry periods for all the three districts are shown in fig 2b 2 2 hydrogeology of study area these coastal districts are comprised of unconsolidated sediments made of sands with varying grades silts and clay fig 3 these alluviums comprise of sand silt and clay with different grain sizes the fence diagram showing the lithology cross section for the coast of east midnapore are shown in fig 4 the aquifers are covered with various clay materials the shallow aquifers occur at a depth range of 30 50 m whereas deep aquifers occur in the depth range of 100 350 m the characteristics of aquifers are given in table 1 the depth to groundwater aquifers for the period 2001 to 2010 revealed that the average depth below ground level h for em s24p and n24p were 7 068 m 3 913 m 3 184 m respectively fig 5 reveals an increasing trend for h in the averages for pre and post monsoon time periods groundwater at a shallower depth is more vulnerable to vertical contamination as it determines the depth of material through which a contaminant must travel before reaching the aquifer osborn and hardy 1999b here n24p and s24p districts are more vulnerable to groundwater contamination than em district not far behind the average depth barely reached more than 10 m for the s24p and n24p districts in both seasons leaving the aquifers more vulnerable whereas the em district showed almost 10 m and above in depth for pre monsoon seasons hence there is less vulnerability from contamination from surface em 2 3 relationship between teleconnections and hydro geologic variability the climate is a crucial factor for addressing the changes in physical parameters of earth and atmosphere here the relationship between the teleconnections el niño southern oscillation enso and indian ocean dipole iod were compared with the hydro geologic parameters precipitation and water depth for both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons enso is based on the sea surface temperature and pressure variabilities warm surface temperature implies el niño whereas cool surface temperatures implies la niña iod is defined as the difference in the sea surface temperature between the two equatorial areas or pole of the indian ocean one is the western pole near the arabian sea and the other is eastern pole closer to the bay of bengal sudha rani et al 2017 the availability of groundwater depth data was during the period 2001 to 2010 hence these periods were observed with the enso iod and were shown in fig 5 5h from the observations the negative iod ve iod is always associated with higher rainfall and positive iod ve iod associated with lower rainfall however the year 2001 for pre monsoon revealed higher rainfall with ve iod and this led to the investigation of other seasons the observations showed that the iod influence on rainfall might be at a lag of 2 3 months fig 5 the observations also revealed that the rainfall has a significant influence on depth to groundwater level higher rainfall is always associated with lower h and vice versa the average rainfall for the pre monsoon varied from 46 mm to 90 mm whereas for the post monsoon season variation the range is from 30 mm to 133 mm although the em district shows relatively higher rainfall the h values are large compared to s24p and n24p for both seasons this may be due to over pumping of freshwater loss of water due to runoff or elevation that is a little higher compared to s24p and n24p districts the large river network with their outlets and lower elevations in the s24p and n24p districts might be the reason for their lower h values for the enso the pre monsoon season has not revealed significant impact on rainfall but for the post monsoon la niña showed higher rainfall patterns and el niño showed otherwise in summary there is a good relationship between iod and h for both seasons and enso and h for post monsoon seasons this observation is not performed at an overall climatic scale but instead is conducted to understand the influence of climatic parameters on the groundwater of west bengal 3 data and methodology the methodology used in this study is an index based model developed by chachadi and lobo ferriera in 2001 noronha and chachadi 2003 abbreviated as galdit from the parameters considered see below it was originally developed to assess the vulnerability of coastal aquifer systems to seawater intrusion in india luoma et al 2017 this vulnerability index is an indicator based approach specifically designed for coastal aquifers as the name suggests it uses six parameters as indicators for assessing coastal groundwater vulnerability the parameters are as listed below 1 groundwater occurrence g 2 aquifer hydraulic conductivity a 3 height of the groundwater level above mean sea level l 4 distance from the shore d 5 impact of existing sea water intrusion i 6 thickness of the aquifer t the model incorporates a weight range and importance rating that defines the relative importance of each factor under varied hydro geological settings santha sophiya and syed 2013 as shown in table 2 the galdit index formula is as follows lobo ferreira et al 2005 1 galdit index i 1 6 wi ri i 1 6 wi where wi is the weight of the ith indicator and ri is the importance rating of the ith indicator 3 1 groundwater occurrence g groundwater aquifers are categorised as confined unconfined and leaky confined confined aquifers are formed under the permeable rock with less movement of groundwater and are deeper thus when a well is dug water comes out instantaneously due to its larger cone of depression they are considered as highly vulnerable compared to that of other aquifer types therefore the vulnerability ranking for the confined aquifers in galdit model is highest unconfined aquifers are free from the pressure through surface and at the same time a normal rainfall can recharges them very well therefore these are low vulnerable this form of aquifer is not very susceptible to vulnerability due to its minimum hydraulic pressure maintenance by the leakage process from adjoining aquifer the ranking systems for these aquifers are provided in table 3 this method is used for the vulnerability ranking of saltwater intrusion however in terms of pollution the ranking differs therefore depending upon the study one should consider influence of groundwater occurrence in general the surface aquifer type is considered for such studies however the multi layered aquifers system observations were also used to study the interconnection between the aquifers and were proved to be more efficient to study the saltwater intrusion as well as mineralisation hamed et al 2014 hamed et al 2008 for example saidi et al 2011 studied the multi layered aquifer for the gafsa south mining district to identify the origins and the mineralisation processes of groundwater flow and showed that they aquifers are interconnected 3 2 aquifer hydraulic conductivity a by definition hydraulic conductivity is the ability of the aquifer to transmit the groundwater the porosity of the soil changes the hydraulic conductivity controlling the groundwater and saltwater movements into the aquifers as the hydraulic conductivity level increases vulnerability to sea water intrusion can increase aquifer hydraulic conductivity is measured using the pumping tests and there are different numerical methods to measure the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers in this research was measured from transmissivity values obtained from the water resource information system wris website http www india wris nrsc gov in wrsi html these values considered are not for a period but single values available for 14 locations in the study area the relation between transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity is as follows t i k i d i where ti is the transmissivity of ith well ki is the hydraulic conductivity of ith well and di is the thickness of the aquifer 3 3 height of the groundwater level above mean sea level l the depth of the groundwater level above the mean sea level has the potential of reducing or increasing the flow of groundwater into sea water in other words if the groundwater levels are held constant a change in sea level can cause the same effect and sea level raises the amount of fresh water outflow to sea reduces chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 lobo ferreira et al 2005 and the equilibrium relation between saltwater fresh water interface is explained in the introduction above the observation groundwater depth below ground level data was obtained from state water investigation directorate swid for pre and post monsoon seasons for the period 2001 to 2010 the mean values throughout the period are used for the present study 3 4 distance from the shore d the distance from the shore plays a pivotal role for sea water intrusion if the distance from seashore to inland increases transversely the intrusion of saltwater decreases for the present study the base layer from landsat 5 data for the year 2010 is delineated for the shoreline using mndwi index technique the perpendicular distance from the coastline towards offshore is buffered for the risk rating 3 5 impact on existing status of seawater intrusion in the area i the existing status of seawater intrusion can be obtained from chemical analysis data there are different ways of identifying saline water wells from these observations including ph total dissolved solvents tds chlorine cl and bicarbonate hco3 total hardness th etc depending upon the availability of the data one or more parameters may be used the amount of chlorine present in sea water is much more than in the groundwater while more bicarbonate is present in groundwater than in the sea water adroja 2014 thus the ratio of chlorine to bicarbonate analyses can indicate the existing status of sea water intrusion in the area therefore for the present study the ratio of cl and bicarbonate hco3 was used for the period 2001 2010 for the em district the chemical data is only available for the year 2004 pre monsoon season therefore for the present galdit study same data is considered as the average value for em district 3 6 thickness of the aquifer t the governing equation connecting the length l of sea water interface for confined aquifers is as shown below noronha et al 2003 2 l k b 2 2 qδ for l b where k is aquifer hydraulic conductivity b is the saturated thickness q is the freshwater flow rate and δ is given by 3 δ ρ freshwater ρ seawater ρ freshwater 40 where ρ is the density of water this equation indicates that as the thickness of the aquifer increases the sea water interface also increases therefore the thickness of the aquifer plays a vital role in the aquifer vulnerability to sea water although the hydrological system is constituted with several layers like shallow and deep systems for the present study the thickness parameter is taken as a single layer this is due to the constraints in the availability of individual layer data finally for the present study all the six parameters were used to create the vulnerably map for the study area these observation data are provided by swid state water investigation directorate and cgwb central ground water board kolkata for the present study the present study used total 74 well observations data from 2001 to 2010 where the number of wells in each district em n24p and s24p are 20 25 and 29 respectively however thickness of the aquifer used has no such long term values the lack of data availability from 2011 to 2016 during this work has constrained the study to this current period 3 7 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis by definition is a technique used to determine the impact of every individual parameter on a particular model or dependent parameter the major advantage of these index based models is the implementation of assessment techniques using a high number of input data layers in order to limit the impacts of errors or uncertainties of the individual parameters on the final output evans and myers 1990 rosen 1994 by reducing the number of parameters it is possible to get the same result as that of the dependent parameter recently several works have been performed to understand whether all the parameters are necessary for the particular work eg akbari 2011 djémin et al 2016 saidi et al 2011 in the present study sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze the importance of each parameter in the galdit index there are two kinds of sensitivity analysis techniques map removal sensitivity analysis developed by lodwick et al 1990 and single parameter sensitivity analysis developed by napolitano and fabbri 1996 3 7 1 map removal sensitivity analysis this method measures the sensitivity of the vulnerability map by removing one or more layers the basic formula as given by lodwick et al 1990 is as follows in eq 4 4 s v n v n v 100 where s represents the sensitivity measure v and v are unperturbed and perturbed vulnerability indices respectively and n and n are the number of data layers used to compute the vulnerability indices for v and v respectively the actual vulnerability index is the unperturbed index whereas perturbed index is for the map removed measure 3 7 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis this method can assess the single or individual parameter influence on the vulnerability index model this method gives the effective weight of each parameter to analyses the importance of that parameter for the measured vulnerability index the formula for this method given by napolitano and fabbri 1996 is as follows in eq 5 5 w pi p ri p wi vuln i 100 where p ri and p wi are the ratings and the weights respectively of the parameter p assigned and vuln i is the vulnerability index computed from the galdit index 4 results and discussion according to the integrated coastal zone management ray 2014 iczm project report most of the coastal aquifers of em s24p and n24p are under confined conditions hence groundwater occurrence for the study region was considered as in confined conditions groundwater occurrence map for the study area is shown in fig 6 the figure shows the aquifer hydraulic conductivity spatial distribution map for the study area the hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 0 489 m day to 259 041 m day due to increasing population and with rapid developmental activities the demand for groundwater will also increase leading to over exploitation of the groundwater this yet again lead to decreased water levels forming cone of depression and saltwater ingress into fresh groundwater the range of hydraulic conductivity values measured are reviewed using the literature observations provided by sahu and sikdar 2011 table 3 from the fig 6 it was clear that zones 15 17 29 51 and their surrounding areas show higher a values fig 7 shows the height of the groundwater level above mean sea level for pre and post monsoon seasons respectively and are the averaged values for the period 2001 to 2010 the higher l values for the pre monsoon season are most prominent in the upper portions of em and s24p districts with maximum of 9 882 m whereas the lower portions of all the districts and complete n24p show lower l values with a minimum of 3 348 m for the post monsoon season the most prominent l values are on the eastern side of em zone numbers 17 26 29 30 and most parts of s24p districts with maximum of 4 530 m whereas the western portion of em and almost all n24p showed lower values with a minimum of 5 365 m this indicates that the post monsoon season has much more groundwater vulnerability and the value ranges also confirm this fig 8 a b shows the distance from shore to the well the lesser the distance from the shore the greater the vulnerability tropical cyclone induced storm surges also cause saltwater intrusion into the shallow aquifer if the distance from the shore is less in addition the sea level rise causes salinity intrusion in closer proximity to the shore impact of existing status of seawater intrusion i for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are shown in fig 9a b because em district chemical data is available only for pre monsoon season its values were taken as same for both the seasons while the other two districts showed significant changes the ratio of chlorine to bicarbonate has been taken to estimate the i value for the present study the distribution maps indicate that the kolkata region some parts of sagar island and parts of mednipur region showed highest levels of saltwater intrusion this can be explained due to the population in kolkata and industrialization in sagar and lower east part of em the observation data reveals that swi was highest for the data points in haroa bhagbanpur mograhat khejuri contai amdanga and canning blocks fig 9a b the spatial map for the aquifer thickness is shown in fig 8b and is the total aquifer thickness added for each well aquifer thickness for the study region ranges from 5 to 345 28 m therefore the rating of 10 was given to most parts of the study area as aquifer thickness exceeds 10 m all the above parameters are used with predetermined weightings to create a vulnerability index map the galdit expression can be expanded as follows 6 galditindex gw gr aw ar lw lr dw dr iw ir tw tr i wi the predetermined weightage and ratings are provided in table 4 galdit maps were created for both pre monsoon and post monsoon groundwater height levels which illustrates the risk of sea water intrusion into groundwater fig 10a shows the pre monsoon vulnerability map with zone numbers and index ranges from 3 86 to 9 66 hence according to the ranking table table 4 in the study area can be divided into three ratings starting from low vulnerability moderately vulnerable and highly vulnerable classes s24p and n24p districts show high vulnerability areas whereas the em district shows moderately to low vulnerability fig 10b shows the post monsoon vulnerability map with its zone numbers and is in the range of 5 3 to 9 0 therefore two vulnerability classes are presented moderate vulnerability to only a limited geographical area and high vulnerability to most of the study area hence the salinity impact on groundwater is greater in the post monsoon season than that of the pre monsoon season with respect to vulnerability the human population also plays a major role in the change of chemical constituents and amount of groundwater available this ultimately leads to increase in vulnerability to saltwater the population increase during the period 2001 to 2010 is presented in table 5 and it reveals that in the s24p and n24p districts the population has increased by more than 1 million whereas the em district population increased to nearly 7 hundred thousand this increase in the population has a direct impact on the groundwater as the pumping of fresh groundwater increases although the parameter was not included as part of the study calculations the galdit maps showed that both s24p and n24p districts are more vulnerable compared to em district the best way to control groundwater exploitation leading to swi along these regions is rainwater harvesting followed with artificial recharge however most of these wells are tapping deeper fresh groundwater bearing zones making artificial recharge to ground water not much feasible in all these coastal locations therefore awareness and control of seasonal groundwater exploitation may be the key solution as any other model galdit has some degree of uncertainty due to the limitations on observational data and digitization the inaccuracy also occurs as some of the parameters are indirect measurements for example hydraulic conductivity is measured using the available thickness and transmissivity values these limitations have less effect when working on low resolution hence this method is considered appropriate for the present study 4 1 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis helped to evaluate the relative importance of each individual parameter in the vulnerability index 4 1 1 map removal vulnerability the map removal sensitivity was evaluated for galdit index by removing each parameter from the index and comparing the result if any of the parameters are not significant in the model it can be conveniently observed using this method table 6 provides a statistical summary of the parameters removed and their sensitivity for both pre and post monsoon seasons the study indicates higher mean parameter variations for distance in pre monsoon season this reveals that the highest variation in the vulnerability index can be obtained when distance from the shore d parameter is removed the remaining mean variations do not exceed 1 this greater variance of d may be due to the greater weight value given in the galdit model table 2 however in pre monsoon seasons the other height parameter of the groundwater level l which also has the same weighting value as that of d does not show significance while for the post monsoon season the mean variations does not exceed 1 therefore the study indicates that all the parameters cumulatively affected the vulnerability index 4 1 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis the single map sensitivity analysis has revealed the significance of each individual parameter by measuring their effective weight here the theoretical weights considered for galdit were compared with that of effective weights measured tables 6 and 7 show that for pre monsoon seasons almost all the parameters showed a higher deviation from theoretical weight that means that each single parameter has a significant effect however the mean values indicate that aquifer hydraulic conductivity a followed by thickness of the aquifer t and saltwater intrusion i show higher variations with a difference of 31 04 17 54 and 8 14 respectively the rest of the parameters also showed variations but less relative to the above for the post monsoon season saltwater intrusion i followed by hydraulic conductivity a and thickness of the aquifer t have shown higher effective weight variabilities with a difference in weights of 34 17 22 17 and 12 66 respectively here distance from the shore has a lesser effective weight than the theoretical one the results therefore infer from the statistical description that the weights assigned to the groundwater level height l and the shore distance d have strong theoretical weights but the remaining parameter weights theoretical in the galdit model should be adjusted to increase the evaluation 4 2 chemical analysis chemical analysis was performed to understand the different chemical parameters and their change during the period 2001 to 2010 the chemical parameters data were obtained from swid kolkata the chemical data for the east midnapore district was only available for 2004 pre monsoon period due to the availability of data chemical analysis for the period 2001 to 2010 it was only possible to examine south 24 parganas and north 24 parganas districts the statistical summary of chemical constituents for pre monsoon and post monsoon are provided in table 8 chloride and total dissolved solvents tds spatial distribution maps were created for both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in the present study figs 11 and 12 according to the world health organisation who the tds value for drinking water is below 500 mg l but can be increased up to 1500 mg l if needed from the observations contai egra and bhagabanpur blocks from em district joynagar and bishnupur from s24p district gaighata haroa hansbad and sandeshkhali blocks from n24p district showed higher levels of tds for pre monsoon for the post monsoon season budge budge bashirhat and sagar from s24p and hasnabad haroa and gaighata from n24p showed the highest tds values fig 11a shows the average tds spatial distribution maps for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons through the period 2001 to 2010 the average tds range values for pre and post monsoon were 3874 100 mg l and 1929 83 mg l respectively however the observations for individual years showed a maximum of 4480 mg l for the year 2010 and were increasing over the period table 7a chloride is a prominent indication for existing salinity levels the chloride concentration ranges for the pre and post monsoon seasons are 18 mg l 1134 mg l for the 15 mg l 1536 mg l respectively the statistical summary also shows that the maximum chloride concentration has been elevating throughout the period 2004 to 2010 fig 12 a b chloride is a well known element found in the sea so any rise in levels of chloride concentration means that intrusion of sea water occurs tropical cyclone induced storm surge causes the inundation of sea water on to the land surface leading to saltwater intrusion into surface groundwater in the low topographic areas the blocks affected by chloride concentration on s24p n24p districts are mograhat with average of 1536 mg l hasnabad sanning sagar budge budge bhangor mathurapur sonarpurkulpi and kultol also the observation indicate that the post monsoon seasons have higher chloride concentration than that of pre monsoon fig 11b shows the average chloride spatial distribution maps for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons through the period 2001 to 2010 the difference in tds with that of chloride content maps are evident as tds is a combination of different chemical constituents the spatial distribution maps for chemical parameters do not match with the galdit index maps because the galdit maps were a accumulation of six different parameters and the chemical parameter is one of them the significance of each of the parameters was discussed further in sensitivity analysis technique subsection 5 conclusion the study assessed saltwater intrusion into groundwater using a galdit index based model and gis techniques six parameters were considered for the index groundwater occurrence aquifer hydraulic conductivity height of groundwater level above sea level distance from the shore impact of existing status of seawater intrusion and thickness of aquifer from the observations it was evident that rainfall due to enso and iod had a significant influence on depth to groundwater level h the research further reveals that there is a relationship between iod and h for both pre and post monsoon seasons and between enso and h for post monsoon seasons the galdit model range showed that both south and north 24 parganas district areas are moderately to highly vulnerable and east midnapore has low vulnerability for pre monsoon season whereas the galdit index for the post monsoon season indicates that east midnapore south 24 parganas and lower parts of north 24 parganas districts are highly vulnerable and the northern part of north 24 parganas district is moderately vulnerable hence salinity intrusion on groundwater is greater in the post monsoon seasons than that of the pre monsoon seasons the map removal method illustrates that the highest variation in the vulnerability index is obtained for the pre monsoon when distance from the shore d parameter is removed whereas post monsoon season vulnerability map is a cumulative of all the galdit parameters used single parameter sensitivity analysis revealed that each single parameter has significant effect however the mean values indicated that aquifer hydraulic conductivity a followed by thickness of the aquifer t then saltwater intrusion i have higher variations for the pre monsoon season by studying the chemical analysis data during the study period it was observed that the tds and chloride content are increasing for methods such as galdit the major limitation is availability of observation data due to the unavailability of field observations for any or all the parameters the model must be performed with constraints this study provides new data and insights that are helpful for decision making for progressing groundwater management and can be used for improving adaptation and mitigation strategies the solution for the swi issue should be to control the seasonal pumping of groundwater and drilling depth of new wells in addition to organising awareness programs to reduce water usage in the midst of climate change hamed et al 2018 suggested that reusing of the wastewater should be an integral part through wastewater treatment which can be primarily used on agricultural land this work also emphasizes the importance of better understanding the seasonal variations in groundwater in order for example to constrain the pumping of groundwater to reduce seasonal saltwater intrusion declaration of competing interest this manuscript has not been previously

1443,groundwater in the coastal districts of west bengal india is highly susceptible to various factors such as over pumping variations in rainfall lower elevation and risk due to sea level rise in addition to these factors tropical cyclone induced storm surge and saltwater intrusion also induce potential risks to the quality of the coastal aquifers there are several knowledge gaps as many of these factors have not previously been systematically and rigorously analysed furthermore up to date information is either unavailable or insufficient accordingly the present study analysed the groundwater vulnerability during the pre and post monsoon months for the period from 2001 to 2010 at three main coastal districts of west bengal east midnapore south 24 parganas and north 24 parganas administrative regions the galdit index based model was employed to assess salt water intrusion into the groundwater using geographic information system gis spatial distribution maps were also generated to identify highly vulnerable groundwater locations map removal and single parameter sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the sensitivity of the parameters the study reveals that the depth of ground water levels for the three districts increased and also the rainfall exerts a significant effect on the groundwater depth the chemical constituents tds and chloride contents in groundwater during the period 2004 to 2010 were analysed the average tds range values for pre and post monsoon seasons were observed to vary in the range between 100 and 3874 mg l and 83 1929 mg l respectively reports indicate that groundwater in the area is highly saturated with iron containing minerals like fe oh 3 goethite and hematite and is also moderately saturated with the calcite chalcedony dolomite and quartz whereas under saturated with anhydrite and gypsum the implications of the research points to the urgent need for remedial action and appropriate responses at policy level to protect groundwater keywords groundwater vulnerability saltwater intrusion galdit gis sensitivity analysis climate change 1 introduction groundwater is the water that is stored underground typically in the pores and crevices of soil sand and or rock often referred to as aquifers groundwater is an important source of drinking water it is also used for agricultural irrigation and industrial processes as well as a vital component of many natural ecosystems raghunath 1987 ritter et al 2002 groundwater resources are particularly important in arid regions where surface water is scarce kardan moghaddam et al 2015 overheu et al 2014 however there are many pressures and strains on groundwater resources including weather systems meteorology climate change and urban development herbert and döll 2019 michael et al 2017 richey et al 2015 rapid population growth and urbanization results in over pumping of the fresh water which leads to depletion of groundwater and also decreases or increases the chemical levels green et al 2011 morris et al 2003 this raises groundwater vulnerability which is a measure of how easy or difficult it is for pollution contamination at the land surface to reach a production aquifer harter and rollins 2008 morris et al 2003 coastal aquifers in addition to surface pollution are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion from seawater adepelumi et al 2009 cheng et al 1999 kardan moghaddam et al 2017 additional factors that affect coastal aquifers for saltwater intrusion are tidal fluctuations topography recharge rate rainfall evaporation seasonal changes and climate change coastal zones are subject to more severe and complex issues than most other land and water resources and form an important component of much needed water resources systems custodio and bruggeman 1987 rahman et al 2018 safi et al 2018 tulipano and fidelibus 1988 coastal zones often contain relatively larger populations because of many locational benefits in terms of food economy and industrial development this increase in human intervention over coastal areas lead to increasing demand of fresh water studies anwar and aggarwal 2016 lobo ferreira et al 2005 maity et al 2017 moharana and patra 2014 santha sophiya and syed 2013 have been conducted for different coastal aquifers of india recently manivannan and elango 2019 delineated the area and locations of seawater intrusion and submarine groundwater discharge along the entire indian coast and reported that 7 of the total coastal area groundwater level is directly below mean sea level and therefore affected by the saltwater intrusion sea water is denser as compared to fresh water and over pumping of the fresh water leads to intrusion of saltwater into the coastal aquifer the theoretical explanation for saltwater intrusion was given by the ghyben herzberg relation drabbe and badon ghijben 1898 herzberg 1901 according to this relation there exists a hydrostatic equilibrium between fresh water and saltwater i e for every one meter of fresh water above the sea level there exists 40 m of fresh water below sea level in an unconfined aquifer thus for a loss of 1 m of fresh water above sea level 40 m of fresh water below sea level is lost until equilibrium is reached hence maintaining the fresh groundwater balance is very important to avoid groundwater vulnerability furthermore changes in groundwater levels with respect to mean sea elevation along the coast largely influences the extent of seawater intrusion in the fresh water aquifers lobo ferreira et al 2005 groundwater rise fall depends upon several factors such as rainfall recharge flow rate type of soil pumping capacity and many more elements maliva 2020 osborn and hardy 1999a van stempvoort et al 1993 in addition to these above aspects climate variability also plays a very crucial role in influencing groundwater researchers showed that climate change has a direct impact on soils land cover hydrologic systems with increasing temperatures variability of rainfall evapotranspiration and showed increased frequency in extreme events as cyclones floods and droughts hamed et al 2018 mokadem et al 2018 two major climatic conditions that are influencing the rainfall over the indian continent are the el niño southern oscillation enso and indian ocean dipole iod enso and iod influence rainfall and drought conditions leading to changes in groundwater availability fu et al 2019 gupta et al 2018 huang et al 2019 lipczynska kochany 2018 millar et al 2018 beside surface water getting affected the potential impacts of the drought trend with quantity and quality deterioration are also linked to climate change hamed et al 2018 the quality of the water in an aquifer also depends on the type of sedimentary basins the swi and mineralisation in sedimentary basin assessment is also a key factor to understand the the potential artificial recharge for an aquifer hamed et al 2018 ncibi et al 2020b ncibi et al 2020a there are different methods for identifying groundwater vulnerability such as drastic sintacs si pi gods avi epik wespa irish maia pesticide and galdit and each was developed for specific conditions carvalho resende et al 2019 kardan moghaddam et al 2017 all these are index based methods that were developed for different specific conditions and requirements and out of all these methods galdit is the most widely used specifically for coastal areas although there are different methods for use the drastic and galdit models were extensively used because they are cost effective easily available parameters as data and provide relatively accurate results for extensive regions trabelsi et al 2016 the remaining index based methods are either most specialised methods that need extensive collection of data or just a simple assessment of chemical constituents therefore one can choose the method depending upon the available parameters the galdit model was first developed by lobo ferriera and chachadi in 2001 and has been implemented in different coastal regions throughout the world adroja 2014 ezekiel et al 2016 lobo ferreira et al 2005 kardan moghaddam et al 2017 recinos et al 2015 satishkumar et al 2016 even though index based methods are widely used for the continuous estimation of saltwater intrusion geophysical and geochemical observational analyses are also widely used in such analyses vertical electrical resistivity methods are used to measure chemical parameters such as cl tds hardness ph etc to observe the salt affected regions adeoti et al 2010 ginzburg et al 1976 song et al 2006 while there are several knowledge gaps as many of these factors have not previously been systematically and rigorously analysed furthermore up to date information is either unavailable or insufficient in three districts of west bengal india accordingly the present study mainly focussed on the generation of groundwater vulnerability maps for the coastal districts east midnapore em south 24 parganas s24p and north 24 parganas n24p of west bengal india using the galdit model this model has been in use for many locations across the world for numerous studies and is the proven method to establish basic vulnerability zones with typically available data without much complications therefore for any region in india with lack of many available parameters in long term this could be a good approach these maps can be useful for better planning and policy making to reduce vulnerability and better safeguard groundwater resources in this study the observed chemical parameters during the period 2001 2010 were also analysed 2 study area the west bengal coast is located at latitude 21 35 n and longitude 87 30 89 10 e the remarkable coastal feature are the sundarbans islands which span between west bengal and bangladesh the west bengal part of the sundarbans are the largest occupied mangroves in india and consist of many different islands the coastline length of almost 220 km is in a very complex geometrical structure due to the large area of the river braided network flowing into the ocean in west bengal the major important regions that are under high risk are the hugli river estuary sundarbans digha mangroves and various islands for example sagar island the hugli river estuary is vulnerable due to its high levels of pollution and contamination because of domestic agriculture and industrial waste also head water flow has decreased due to increased consumption of river water leading to erosion sundarbans mangroves act as a protective barrier to natural hazards like cyclones and soil erosion but the reclamation of sundarbans for the benefit of industrial and urban development is leading to over exposure of land to these natural hazards digha beach with its high level of tourism activities has been eroding and also suffering from an increased risk of oil pollution in coastal waters due to the use of boats that use oil saltwater intrusion now plays a major role increasing the groundwater vulnerability of these districts west bengal coastal districts em s24p and n24p organized into administrative blocks which include major urban settlements are of particular interest to this study fig 1 additionally the land use land cover map has been prepared from bhuvan thematic data https bhuvan app1 nrsc gov in thematic thematic index php the map statistics shows that the total built up area for the districts em n24p and s24p are 1234 05 km2 844 2 km2 2302 78 km2 respectively whereas coastal wet lands are occupied with an area of 35 68 km2 8 91 km2 and 92 85 km2 for the same the area of the districts em s24p and n24p are 4736 km2 9960 km2 and 4094 km2 respectively the districts s24p and n24p are low lying areas with lots of river networks tidal rivers and creeks these districts total 50 blocks 29 blocks are in s24p 5 blocks are in n24p and 16 blocks are in pm these districts are highly vulnerable to frequently occurring tropical cyclones and their induced storm surges coinciding with frequent river floods furthermore the rapid increase in population due to port activities urbanization and resource utilization is leading to over pumping of fresh groundwater the former hazards result in sea water intrusion swi onto the land surface while the later hazards result in swi in groundwater with respect to these vulnerabilities sea level rise due to climate change and vice versa are also intensifying risks on the west bengal coast which is one of the important coastal zones of india for both biological productivities and socio economic improvement hence in the present study it is proposed to conduct research in the light of the above mentioned swi over the west bengal coastal districts 2 1 hydrometeorology of the study area the general climate of these regions is sub tropical with a humid atmosphere the climate of these districts are influenced by northeast and southwest monsoons the hydrological conditions from 1973 to 2010 were observed for the present study and the annual average precipitation is 1675 mm for this period the observations revealed that the maximum rainfall was found for the months june july august and september whereas the remaining months showed lowest from these hydrological conditions the former months are considered as the wet period and the later ones as the dry period with average precipitation 1480 mm and 150 mm respectively the rainfall trends and variabilities are shown in fig 2a and the annual average rainfall wet and dry periods for all the three districts are shown in fig 2b 2 2 hydrogeology of study area these coastal districts are comprised of unconsolidated sediments made of sands with varying grades silts and clay fig 3 these alluviums comprise of sand silt and clay with different grain sizes the fence diagram showing the lithology cross section for the coast of east midnapore are shown in fig 4 the aquifers are covered with various clay materials the shallow aquifers occur at a depth range of 30 50 m whereas deep aquifers occur in the depth range of 100 350 m the characteristics of aquifers are given in table 1 the depth to groundwater aquifers for the period 2001 to 2010 revealed that the average depth below ground level h for em s24p and n24p were 7 068 m 3 913 m 3 184 m respectively fig 5 reveals an increasing trend for h in the averages for pre and post monsoon time periods groundwater at a shallower depth is more vulnerable to vertical contamination as it determines the depth of material through which a contaminant must travel before reaching the aquifer osborn and hardy 1999b here n24p and s24p districts are more vulnerable to groundwater contamination than em district not far behind the average depth barely reached more than 10 m for the s24p and n24p districts in both seasons leaving the aquifers more vulnerable whereas the em district showed almost 10 m and above in depth for pre monsoon seasons hence there is less vulnerability from contamination from surface em 2 3 relationship between teleconnections and hydro geologic variability the climate is a crucial factor for addressing the changes in physical parameters of earth and atmosphere here the relationship between the teleconnections el niño southern oscillation enso and indian ocean dipole iod were compared with the hydro geologic parameters precipitation and water depth for both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons enso is based on the sea surface temperature and pressure variabilities warm surface temperature implies el niño whereas cool surface temperatures implies la niña iod is defined as the difference in the sea surface temperature between the two equatorial areas or pole of the indian ocean one is the western pole near the arabian sea and the other is eastern pole closer to the bay of bengal sudha rani et al 2017 the availability of groundwater depth data was during the period 2001 to 2010 hence these periods were observed with the enso iod and were shown in fig 5 5h from the observations the negative iod ve iod is always associated with higher rainfall and positive iod ve iod associated with lower rainfall however the year 2001 for pre monsoon revealed higher rainfall with ve iod and this led to the investigation of other seasons the observations showed that the iod influence on rainfall might be at a lag of 2 3 months fig 5 the observations also revealed that the rainfall has a significant influence on depth to groundwater level higher rainfall is always associated with lower h and vice versa the average rainfall for the pre monsoon varied from 46 mm to 90 mm whereas for the post monsoon season variation the range is from 30 mm to 133 mm although the em district shows relatively higher rainfall the h values are large compared to s24p and n24p for both seasons this may be due to over pumping of freshwater loss of water due to runoff or elevation that is a little higher compared to s24p and n24p districts the large river network with their outlets and lower elevations in the s24p and n24p districts might be the reason for their lower h values for the enso the pre monsoon season has not revealed significant impact on rainfall but for the post monsoon la niña showed higher rainfall patterns and el niño showed otherwise in summary there is a good relationship between iod and h for both seasons and enso and h for post monsoon seasons this observation is not performed at an overall climatic scale but instead is conducted to understand the influence of climatic parameters on the groundwater of west bengal 3 data and methodology the methodology used in this study is an index based model developed by chachadi and lobo ferriera in 2001 noronha and chachadi 2003 abbreviated as galdit from the parameters considered see below it was originally developed to assess the vulnerability of coastal aquifer systems to seawater intrusion in india luoma et al 2017 this vulnerability index is an indicator based approach specifically designed for coastal aquifers as the name suggests it uses six parameters as indicators for assessing coastal groundwater vulnerability the parameters are as listed below 1 groundwater occurrence g 2 aquifer hydraulic conductivity a 3 height of the groundwater level above mean sea level l 4 distance from the shore d 5 impact of existing sea water intrusion i 6 thickness of the aquifer t the model incorporates a weight range and importance rating that defines the relative importance of each factor under varied hydro geological settings santha sophiya and syed 2013 as shown in table 2 the galdit index formula is as follows lobo ferreira et al 2005 1 galdit index i 1 6 wi ri i 1 6 wi where wi is the weight of the ith indicator and ri is the importance rating of the ith indicator 3 1 groundwater occurrence g groundwater aquifers are categorised as confined unconfined and leaky confined confined aquifers are formed under the permeable rock with less movement of groundwater and are deeper thus when a well is dug water comes out instantaneously due to its larger cone of depression they are considered as highly vulnerable compared to that of other aquifer types therefore the vulnerability ranking for the confined aquifers in galdit model is highest unconfined aquifers are free from the pressure through surface and at the same time a normal rainfall can recharges them very well therefore these are low vulnerable this form of aquifer is not very susceptible to vulnerability due to its minimum hydraulic pressure maintenance by the leakage process from adjoining aquifer the ranking systems for these aquifers are provided in table 3 this method is used for the vulnerability ranking of saltwater intrusion however in terms of pollution the ranking differs therefore depending upon the study one should consider influence of groundwater occurrence in general the surface aquifer type is considered for such studies however the multi layered aquifers system observations were also used to study the interconnection between the aquifers and were proved to be more efficient to study the saltwater intrusion as well as mineralisation hamed et al 2014 hamed et al 2008 for example saidi et al 2011 studied the multi layered aquifer for the gafsa south mining district to identify the origins and the mineralisation processes of groundwater flow and showed that they aquifers are interconnected 3 2 aquifer hydraulic conductivity a by definition hydraulic conductivity is the ability of the aquifer to transmit the groundwater the porosity of the soil changes the hydraulic conductivity controlling the groundwater and saltwater movements into the aquifers as the hydraulic conductivity level increases vulnerability to sea water intrusion can increase aquifer hydraulic conductivity is measured using the pumping tests and there are different numerical methods to measure the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers in this research was measured from transmissivity values obtained from the water resource information system wris website http www india wris nrsc gov in wrsi html these values considered are not for a period but single values available for 14 locations in the study area the relation between transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity is as follows t i k i d i where ti is the transmissivity of ith well ki is the hydraulic conductivity of ith well and di is the thickness of the aquifer 3 3 height of the groundwater level above mean sea level l the depth of the groundwater level above the mean sea level has the potential of reducing or increasing the flow of groundwater into sea water in other words if the groundwater levels are held constant a change in sea level can cause the same effect and sea level raises the amount of fresh water outflow to sea reduces chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 lobo ferreira et al 2005 and the equilibrium relation between saltwater fresh water interface is explained in the introduction above the observation groundwater depth below ground level data was obtained from state water investigation directorate swid for pre and post monsoon seasons for the period 2001 to 2010 the mean values throughout the period are used for the present study 3 4 distance from the shore d the distance from the shore plays a pivotal role for sea water intrusion if the distance from seashore to inland increases transversely the intrusion of saltwater decreases for the present study the base layer from landsat 5 data for the year 2010 is delineated for the shoreline using mndwi index technique the perpendicular distance from the coastline towards offshore is buffered for the risk rating 3 5 impact on existing status of seawater intrusion in the area i the existing status of seawater intrusion can be obtained from chemical analysis data there are different ways of identifying saline water wells from these observations including ph total dissolved solvents tds chlorine cl and bicarbonate hco3 total hardness th etc depending upon the availability of the data one or more parameters may be used the amount of chlorine present in sea water is much more than in the groundwater while more bicarbonate is present in groundwater than in the sea water adroja 2014 thus the ratio of chlorine to bicarbonate analyses can indicate the existing status of sea water intrusion in the area therefore for the present study the ratio of cl and bicarbonate hco3 was used for the period 2001 2010 for the em district the chemical data is only available for the year 2004 pre monsoon season therefore for the present galdit study same data is considered as the average value for em district 3 6 thickness of the aquifer t the governing equation connecting the length l of sea water interface for confined aquifers is as shown below noronha et al 2003 2 l k b 2 2 qδ for l b where k is aquifer hydraulic conductivity b is the saturated thickness q is the freshwater flow rate and δ is given by 3 δ ρ freshwater ρ seawater ρ freshwater 40 where ρ is the density of water this equation indicates that as the thickness of the aquifer increases the sea water interface also increases therefore the thickness of the aquifer plays a vital role in the aquifer vulnerability to sea water although the hydrological system is constituted with several layers like shallow and deep systems for the present study the thickness parameter is taken as a single layer this is due to the constraints in the availability of individual layer data finally for the present study all the six parameters were used to create the vulnerably map for the study area these observation data are provided by swid state water investigation directorate and cgwb central ground water board kolkata for the present study the present study used total 74 well observations data from 2001 to 2010 where the number of wells in each district em n24p and s24p are 20 25 and 29 respectively however thickness of the aquifer used has no such long term values the lack of data availability from 2011 to 2016 during this work has constrained the study to this current period 3 7 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis by definition is a technique used to determine the impact of every individual parameter on a particular model or dependent parameter the major advantage of these index based models is the implementation of assessment techniques using a high number of input data layers in order to limit the impacts of errors or uncertainties of the individual parameters on the final output evans and myers 1990 rosen 1994 by reducing the number of parameters it is possible to get the same result as that of the dependent parameter recently several works have been performed to understand whether all the parameters are necessary for the particular work eg akbari 2011 djémin et al 2016 saidi et al 2011 in the present study sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze the importance of each parameter in the galdit index there are two kinds of sensitivity analysis techniques map removal sensitivity analysis developed by lodwick et al 1990 and single parameter sensitivity analysis developed by napolitano and fabbri 1996 3 7 1 map removal sensitivity analysis this method measures the sensitivity of the vulnerability map by removing one or more layers the basic formula as given by lodwick et al 1990 is as follows in eq 4 4 s v n v n v 100 where s represents the sensitivity measure v and v are unperturbed and perturbed vulnerability indices respectively and n and n are the number of data layers used to compute the vulnerability indices for v and v respectively the actual vulnerability index is the unperturbed index whereas perturbed index is for the map removed measure 3 7 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis this method can assess the single or individual parameter influence on the vulnerability index model this method gives the effective weight of each parameter to analyses the importance of that parameter for the measured vulnerability index the formula for this method given by napolitano and fabbri 1996 is as follows in eq 5 5 w pi p ri p wi vuln i 100 where p ri and p wi are the ratings and the weights respectively of the parameter p assigned and vuln i is the vulnerability index computed from the galdit index 4 results and discussion according to the integrated coastal zone management ray 2014 iczm project report most of the coastal aquifers of em s24p and n24p are under confined conditions hence groundwater occurrence for the study region was considered as in confined conditions groundwater occurrence map for the study area is shown in fig 6 the figure shows the aquifer hydraulic conductivity spatial distribution map for the study area the hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 0 489 m day to 259 041 m day due to increasing population and with rapid developmental activities the demand for groundwater will also increase leading to over exploitation of the groundwater this yet again lead to decreased water levels forming cone of depression and saltwater ingress into fresh groundwater the range of hydraulic conductivity values measured are reviewed using the literature observations provided by sahu and sikdar 2011 table 3 from the fig 6 it was clear that zones 15 17 29 51 and their surrounding areas show higher a values fig 7 shows the height of the groundwater level above mean sea level for pre and post monsoon seasons respectively and are the averaged values for the period 2001 to 2010 the higher l values for the pre monsoon season are most prominent in the upper portions of em and s24p districts with maximum of 9 882 m whereas the lower portions of all the districts and complete n24p show lower l values with a minimum of 3 348 m for the post monsoon season the most prominent l values are on the eastern side of em zone numbers 17 26 29 30 and most parts of s24p districts with maximum of 4 530 m whereas the western portion of em and almost all n24p showed lower values with a minimum of 5 365 m this indicates that the post monsoon season has much more groundwater vulnerability and the value ranges also confirm this fig 8 a b shows the distance from shore to the well the lesser the distance from the shore the greater the vulnerability tropical cyclone induced storm surges also cause saltwater intrusion into the shallow aquifer if the distance from the shore is less in addition the sea level rise causes salinity intrusion in closer proximity to the shore impact of existing status of seawater intrusion i for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are shown in fig 9a b because em district chemical data is available only for pre monsoon season its values were taken as same for both the seasons while the other two districts showed significant changes the ratio of chlorine to bicarbonate has been taken to estimate the i value for the present study the distribution maps indicate that the kolkata region some parts of sagar island and parts of mednipur region showed highest levels of saltwater intrusion this can be explained due to the population in kolkata and industrialization in sagar and lower east part of em the observation data reveals that swi was highest for the data points in haroa bhagbanpur mograhat khejuri contai amdanga and canning blocks fig 9a b the spatial map for the aquifer thickness is shown in fig 8b and is the total aquifer thickness added for each well aquifer thickness for the study region ranges from 5 to 345 28 m therefore the rating of 10 was given to most parts of the study area as aquifer thickness exceeds 10 m all the above parameters are used with predetermined weightings to create a vulnerability index map the galdit expression can be expanded as follows 6 galditindex gw gr aw ar lw lr dw dr iw ir tw tr i wi the predetermined weightage and ratings are provided in table 4 galdit maps were created for both pre monsoon and post monsoon groundwater height levels which illustrates the risk of sea water intrusion into groundwater fig 10a shows the pre monsoon vulnerability map with zone numbers and index ranges from 3 86 to 9 66 hence according to the ranking table table 4 in the study area can be divided into three ratings starting from low vulnerability moderately vulnerable and highly vulnerable classes s24p and n24p districts show high vulnerability areas whereas the em district shows moderately to low vulnerability fig 10b shows the post monsoon vulnerability map with its zone numbers and is in the range of 5 3 to 9 0 therefore two vulnerability classes are presented moderate vulnerability to only a limited geographical area and high vulnerability to most of the study area hence the salinity impact on groundwater is greater in the post monsoon season than that of the pre monsoon season with respect to vulnerability the human population also plays a major role in the change of chemical constituents and amount of groundwater available this ultimately leads to increase in vulnerability to saltwater the population increase during the period 2001 to 2010 is presented in table 5 and it reveals that in the s24p and n24p districts the population has increased by more than 1 million whereas the em district population increased to nearly 7 hundred thousand this increase in the population has a direct impact on the groundwater as the pumping of fresh groundwater increases although the parameter was not included as part of the study calculations the galdit maps showed that both s24p and n24p districts are more vulnerable compared to em district the best way to control groundwater exploitation leading to swi along these regions is rainwater harvesting followed with artificial recharge however most of these wells are tapping deeper fresh groundwater bearing zones making artificial recharge to ground water not much feasible in all these coastal locations therefore awareness and control of seasonal groundwater exploitation may be the key solution as any other model galdit has some degree of uncertainty due to the limitations on observational data and digitization the inaccuracy also occurs as some of the parameters are indirect measurements for example hydraulic conductivity is measured using the available thickness and transmissivity values these limitations have less effect when working on low resolution hence this method is considered appropriate for the present study 4 1 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis helped to evaluate the relative importance of each individual parameter in the vulnerability index 4 1 1 map removal vulnerability the map removal sensitivity was evaluated for galdit index by removing each parameter from the index and comparing the result if any of the parameters are not significant in the model it can be conveniently observed using this method table 6 provides a statistical summary of the parameters removed and their sensitivity for both pre and post monsoon seasons the study indicates higher mean parameter variations for distance in pre monsoon season this reveals that the highest variation in the vulnerability index can be obtained when distance from the shore d parameter is removed the remaining mean variations do not exceed 1 this greater variance of d may be due to the greater weight value given in the galdit model table 2 however in pre monsoon seasons the other height parameter of the groundwater level l which also has the same weighting value as that of d does not show significance while for the post monsoon season the mean variations does not exceed 1 therefore the study indicates that all the parameters cumulatively affected the vulnerability index 4 1 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis the single map sensitivity analysis has revealed the significance of each individual parameter by measuring their effective weight here the theoretical weights considered for galdit were compared with that of effective weights measured tables 6 and 7 show that for pre monsoon seasons almost all the parameters showed a higher deviation from theoretical weight that means that each single parameter has a significant effect however the mean values indicate that aquifer hydraulic conductivity a followed by thickness of the aquifer t and saltwater intrusion i show higher variations with a difference of 31 04 17 54 and 8 14 respectively the rest of the parameters also showed variations but less relative to the above for the post monsoon season saltwater intrusion i followed by hydraulic conductivity a and thickness of the aquifer t have shown higher effective weight variabilities with a difference in weights of 34 17 22 17 and 12 66 respectively here distance from the shore has a lesser effective weight than the theoretical one the results therefore infer from the statistical description that the weights assigned to the groundwater level height l and the shore distance d have strong theoretical weights but the remaining parameter weights theoretical in the galdit model should be adjusted to increase the evaluation 4 2 chemical analysis chemical analysis was performed to understand the different chemical parameters and their change during the period 2001 to 2010 the chemical parameters data were obtained from swid kolkata the chemical data for the east midnapore district was only available for 2004 pre monsoon period due to the availability of data chemical analysis for the period 2001 to 2010 it was only possible to examine south 24 parganas and north 24 parganas districts the statistical summary of chemical constituents for pre monsoon and post monsoon are provided in table 8 chloride and total dissolved solvents tds spatial distribution maps were created for both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in the present study figs 11 and 12 according to the world health organisation who the tds value for drinking water is below 500 mg l but can be increased up to 1500 mg l if needed from the observations contai egra and bhagabanpur blocks from em district joynagar and bishnupur from s24p district gaighata haroa hansbad and sandeshkhali blocks from n24p district showed higher levels of tds for pre monsoon for the post monsoon season budge budge bashirhat and sagar from s24p and hasnabad haroa and gaighata from n24p showed the highest tds values fig 11a shows the average tds spatial distribution maps for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons through the period 2001 to 2010 the average tds range values for pre and post monsoon were 3874 100 mg l and 1929 83 mg l respectively however the observations for individual years showed a maximum of 4480 mg l for the year 2010 and were increasing over the period table 7a chloride is a prominent indication for existing salinity levels the chloride concentration ranges for the pre and post monsoon seasons are 18 mg l 1134 mg l for the 15 mg l 1536 mg l respectively the statistical summary also shows that the maximum chloride concentration has been elevating throughout the period 2004 to 2010 fig 12 a b chloride is a well known element found in the sea so any rise in levels of chloride concentration means that intrusion of sea water occurs tropical cyclone induced storm surge causes the inundation of sea water on to the land surface leading to saltwater intrusion into surface groundwater in the low topographic areas the blocks affected by chloride concentration on s24p n24p districts are mograhat with average of 1536 mg l hasnabad sanning sagar budge budge bhangor mathurapur sonarpurkulpi and kultol also the observation indicate that the post monsoon seasons have higher chloride concentration than that of pre monsoon fig 11b shows the average chloride spatial distribution maps for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons through the period 2001 to 2010 the difference in tds with that of chloride content maps are evident as tds is a combination of different chemical constituents the spatial distribution maps for chemical parameters do not match with the galdit index maps because the galdit maps were a accumulation of six different parameters and the chemical parameter is one of them the significance of each of the parameters was discussed further in sensitivity analysis technique subsection 5 conclusion the study assessed saltwater intrusion into groundwater using a galdit index based model and gis techniques six parameters were considered for the index groundwater occurrence aquifer hydraulic conductivity height of groundwater level above sea level distance from the shore impact of existing status of seawater intrusion and thickness of aquifer from the observations it was evident that rainfall due to enso and iod had a significant influence on depth to groundwater level h the research further reveals that there is a relationship between iod and h for both pre and post monsoon seasons and between enso and h for post monsoon seasons the galdit model range showed that both south and north 24 parganas district areas are moderately to highly vulnerable and east midnapore has low vulnerability for pre monsoon season whereas the galdit index for the post monsoon season indicates that east midnapore south 24 parganas and lower parts of north 24 parganas districts are highly vulnerable and the northern part of north 24 parganas district is moderately vulnerable hence salinity intrusion on groundwater is greater in the post monsoon seasons than that of the pre monsoon seasons the map removal method illustrates that the highest variation in the vulnerability index is obtained for the pre monsoon when distance from the shore d parameter is removed whereas post monsoon season vulnerability map is a cumulative of all the galdit parameters used single parameter sensitivity analysis revealed that each single parameter has significant effect however the mean values indicated that aquifer hydraulic conductivity a followed by thickness of the aquifer t then saltwater intrusion i have higher variations for the pre monsoon season by studying the chemical analysis data during the study period it was observed that the tds and chloride content are increasing for methods such as galdit the major limitation is availability of observation data due to the unavailability of field observations for any or all the parameters the model must be performed with constraints this study provides new data and insights that are helpful for decision making for progressing groundwater management and can be used for improving adaptation and mitigation strategies the solution for the swi issue should be to control the seasonal pumping of groundwater and drilling depth of new wells in addition to organising awareness programs to reduce water usage in the midst of climate change hamed et al 2018 suggested that reusing of the wastewater should be an integral part through wastewater treatment which can be primarily used on agricultural land this work also emphasizes the importance of better understanding the seasonal variations in groundwater in order for example to constrain the pumping of groundwater to reduce seasonal saltwater intrusion declaration of competing interest this manuscript has not been previously

1444,natural attenuation processes depend on the availability of suitable electron acceptors at the megasite zeitz concentrations of the main contaminant benzene were observed to increase constantly in the lower aquifer to levels of more than 2 5 mm this was accompanied by decreasing concentrations of sulphate so4 2 which has been previously shown to be the main electron acceptor for benzene oxidation at this site resulting in an electron acceptor limited sulphidic benzene plume therefore a field experiment was conducted to stimulate benzene biodegradation by injecting nitrate no3 into the sulphidic benzene plume aiming i to recycle sulphate by nitrate dependent sulphide oxidation and ii to serve as direct electron acceptor for benzene oxidation within 60 days 6 74 tons sodium nitrate nano3 were injected into the lower aquifer and the resulting biogeochemical effects within the benzene plume were monitored for more than one year by chemical and microbiological analyses of groundwater samples taken from various depths of ten monitoring wells located in three observation lines downstream of nitrate injection nitrate was microbiologically consumed as shown by changes in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values partial nitrite accumulation and changing ratios of na no3 main electron donors for nitrate reduction were reduced sulphur compounds verified by changing δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 values partially increasing sulphate concentrations and strongly increasing abundances of typical sulphur oxidizing nitrate reducing bacterial taxa within the nitrate plume the general absent hydrogen isotope fractionation of benzene also in the sulphidic nitrate free part of the plume indicates that benzene was not biodegraded by sulphate reducing consortia however detected small carbon isotope fractionation of benzene points to in situ benzene biodegradation processes in the plume probably supported by nitrate in conclusion nitrate injection resulted in changing redox conditions and recycling of sulphate in the sulphidic sulphate depleted benzene plume due to microbial oxidation of reduced sulphur species leading to presumably favored conditions for in situ benzene biodegradation keywords benzene compound specific stable isotope analysis nitrate sulphide oxidation enhanced natural attenuation bioremediation 1 introduction besides chlorinated hydrocarbons btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes compounds are the most common groundwater pollutants that require remediation measures wiedemeier et al 1999 it is nowadays well understood that many monoaromatic pollutants can be degraded at oxic and anoxic conditions by several microorganisms farhadian et al 2008 weelink et al 2010 although aerobic biodegradation of btex is much faster than anaerobic biodegradation the latter process is crucial for natural attenuation processes at btex contaminated sites due to the low aqueous solubility and rapid consumption of oxygen during anaerobic btex degradation microorganisms transfer electrons from the target compounds to different terminal electron acceptors such as nitrate ferric iron sulphate or carbonate so that the plume is composed of different redox zones depending on the availability of electron acceptors meckenstock et al 2015 benzene which is a carcinogenic substance causing leukemia and further mutagenic diseases is the worst degradable of the btex compounds at anoxic conditions vogt et al 2011 nevertheless benzene mineralization at anoxic conditions has been observed with various electron acceptors such as carbonate sulphate ferric iron or nitrate often at laboratory conditions summarized by vogt et al 2011 in previous studies in situ benzene biodegradation in groundwater was shown to be stimulated by injecting nitrate and sulfate cunningham et al 2001 or nitrate triethyl phosphate and persulfate xiong et al 2012 pathways and extent of anaerobic benzene degradation in contaminated aquifers are mainly controlled by the prevailing biogeochemical conditions and the presence of specific benzene degrading microorganisms concentrations of the inorganic sulphur compounds sulphide and sulphate are important markers for those biogeochemical conditions the presence of free sulphide σ h2saq hs s2 in groundwater is always a clear indicator for sulphate reducing conditions furthermore the occurrence of free sulphide implies that any iron ions that had been present in the aquifer precipitated as insoluble iron sulphur compounds due to the very low solubility product of fe s compounds their precipitation reaction is very fast and usually complete fe s compounds represent an electron donor that is used up in the presence of suitable electron acceptors such as nitrate the oxidation of fe s compounds produces sulphate that can act as a further electron acceptor in the aquifer previous field and laboratory studies showed that sulphate is the preferential electron acceptor for anaerobic benzene degradation at the study site kästner et al 2006 schirmer et al 2006 fischer et al 2007 vogt et al 2007 kleinsteuber et al 2008 herrmann et al 2010 rakoczy et al 2011 taubert et al 2012 however higher concentrations of free sulphide 50 mg l 1 have been shown to inhibit benzene degradation under sulphate reducing conditions in laboratory experiments with microbial communities from the test site taubert et al 2012 likely due to its known potential toxicity for aerobic and anaerobic organisms koschorreck 2008 in addition benzene concentrations in the lower aquifer were observed to considerably increase so alongside with decreasing sulphate concentrations resulting in conditions in which benzene mineralization was limited by the available sulphate however preliminary on site experiments showed that in the presence of nitrate free sulphide and presumably fe s compounds are quickly oxidized to sulphate by nitrate reducing sulphide oxidizing proteobacteria heber 2013 poser et al 2014 furthermore benzene mineralization at nitrate reducing conditions by indigenous microbial communities from the zeitz site has been verified in laboratory microcosm and on site column experiments keller et al 2018 demonstrating the potential of the indigenous microbial community to switch between sulphate and nitrate as electron acceptors upon benzene mineralization thus a concept was developed for the lower aquifer based on addition of nitrate to recycle the natural electron acceptor sulphate by nitrate dependent sulphide oxidation and to make an alternative electron acceptor available for anaerobic benzene oxidation in the field experiment we aimed to evaluate the biogeochemical processes in the benzene contaminated sulphidic aquifer triggered by nitrate injection nitrate is well soluble in water and provides a high oxidation potential rising up the redox potential in the surrounding milieu compared to oxygen gas which is a comparable strong electron acceptor nitrate solutions can be easily injected into aquifers without forming gas phases interfering with the groundwater flow in the nitrate injection field experiment reactive processes of the sulphur nitrogen and carbon cycle were monitored by 34s and 18o isotope analysis of sulphate 15n and 18o isotope analysis of nitrate and 13c and 2h isotope analysis of benzene molecular biological methods were employed to characterize the impact of the nitrate injection on the groundwater microbial community within the benzene plume the results are discussed with respect to the development of a strategy for monitored bioremediation to control btex plumes in sulphidic aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description 2 1 1 history of the study site the investigation area is located on the site of a former hydrogenation plant north of the city of zeitz in central germany that facility was installed in 1939 for the production of fuel lubricants and paraffins out of lignite during world war ii especially in the years 1944 45 the plant was partly destroyed by severe bomb strikes that resulted in a spilling of vast amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons into the soil in 1963 a new plant for the production of benzene was established gödeke et al 2004 between 1965 and 1977 at least nine documented production accidents contributed to the btex contamination of the groundwater benzene entered the underground at several locations throughout the test site and contaminated groundwater down to 30 m gödeke et al 2006 after the german reunification in 1990 all production facilities were shut down schirmer et al 2006 since then numerous measures had been taken to apply active or passive remediation strategies in order to prevent a further spreading of the groundwater pollutants the benzene dominated btex plume was used as a field laboratory to study anaerobic btex degradation vieth et al 2005 fischer et al 2006 fischer et al 2007 fischer et al 2008 2009 furthermore the helmholtz center for environmental research installed a pilot plant for testing different groundwater remediation approaches based on enhancing the natural attenuation capability of the aquifer wachter et al 2004 gödeke et al 2006 schirmer et al 2006 vogt et al 2007 especially anaerobic benzene degradation at sulphate reducing or nitrate reducing conditions was investigated in different column systems filled with coarse sand and flushed with anoxic benzene containing groundwater from the lower aquifer gw 61 vogt et al 2007 knöller et al 2008 taubert et al 2012 poser et al 2014 keller et al 2018 2 1 2 hydrogeology of the investigation area geologically the test site consists of a sequence of two heterogeneous aquifers with a thickness between 12 and 20 m gödeke et al 2006 that are separated by a discontinuous sulphur rich 2 lignite clay layer schirmer et al 2006 the upper quaternary aquifer is partly unconfined and represents a sand deposit from the pleistocene elster glacial period the lower tertiary aquifer consists of gravel deposited by an eocene river a schematic cross section of the area is given in the supporting information fig 1b benzene contaminations occur in both aquifers up to 1600 mg l 1 in the upper and up to 250 mg l 1 in the lower aquifer gödeke et al 2006 the general groundwater flow direction is north east fig 1a gödeke et al 2004 2 2 nitrate injection and groundwater infiltration 6 74 tons of nano3 were injected as 35 solution 19 23 m3 4110 mm into the groundwater flow over a period of 60 days 23rd july to 20th september 2015 the nitrate solution was stored in four stainless steel tanks each having a volume of 1500 l the tanks were flushed with dinitrogen n2 prior to storage of nitrate solution to remove oxygen the nitrate solution was pumped into the infiltration well in a rate of 10 9 l h 1 via stainless steel connections the groundwater was pumped from well gw eb2 fig 1a enriched with no3 in the injection well and pumped via injection well into the lower aquifer at 40 m below ground in a rate of 1500 l h 1 during the whole time of the field experiment groundwater from eb2 was taken from a depth of 22 30 m contained high concentrations of benzene and was sulphidic fig 2 hence represented the original plume conditions of the lower aquifer 2 3 biogeochemical monitoring downstream of the injection well water samples were collected in nine groundwater monitoring wells located in three observation lines on a weekly to biweekly basis fig 1 the observation wells were equipped with a multi level packer system imw germany described in

located in the upstream of the injection well benzene sulphate and sulphide concentrations were monitored for more than 10 years from june 2006 until december 2016 fig 2 beginning in march 2011 t 1700d benzene concentrations continuously increased from below 0 5 mm to up to 2 5 mm in december 2012 t 2367d afterwards benzene concentrations dropped to levels in the range of 0 75 to 1 mm until the end of monitoring sulphate concentrations decreased from around 4 mm to less than 0 5 mm in december 2012 until december 2016 sulphate concentrations gradually increased to maximal concentrations of around 2 5 mm the groundwater was always sulphidic sulphide concentrations ranged from less than 0 1 mm to more than 2 mm highest concentrations were observed in the last years of monitoring notably sulphide concentrations of around 1 5 mm were shown in laboratory experiments to strongly inhibit benzene mineralization at sulphate reducing conditions taubert et al 2012 furthermore sulphate concentrations were far not sufficient for complete benzene mineralization from 2012 to 2016 fig 2 considering that the mineralization of 1 mol benzene is coupled to the reduction of 3 75 mol sulphate weelink et al 2010 the data show that a plume partially depleted in sulphate and containing high benzene and sulphide loads was flowing in direction of the test field which motivated us to perform a nitrate injection field experiment to test an enhanced natural attenuation ena approach based on nitrate reduction previous investigations suggested that the prevailing hydrochemical conditions in the aquifer support the occurrence of bacterial sulphate reduction as the main process for anaerobic benzene degradation schirmer et al 2006 vogt et al 2007 knöller et al 2008 to verify the assumption of sulphate reducing conditions we conducted an initial screening especially focused on the correlation between sulphate concentrations and the isotopic composition of dissolved groundwater sulphate during the initial screening sulphate concentrations and δ34s values varied between 4 4 mm 422 mg l 1 and 0 45 mm 43 mg l 1 and between 8 8 and 51 3 respectively the left plot in fig 3 shows the relationship between sulphate concentrations expressed as the fraction of reacted sulphate and the sulphur isotopic signature of groundwater sulphate the observed high and very high δ34s values above 20 are a first indication for an isotopic enrichment associated with bacterial reduction of groundwater sulphate increasing δ34s values in concert with decreasing sulphate concentrations provide further evidence for the occurrence of sulphate reduction the observed correlation follows a logarithmic relationship that may be expressed by a general logarithmic equation rayleigh equation δ34s observed εln c c 0 δ34s initial where ε is the isotopic enrichment factor according to knöller et al 2006 an isotopic enrichment factor between 35 and 40 can be expected for straightforward bacterial sulphate reduction in a hydrochemical setting with similar conditions as present in the investigated aquifer fitting the rayleigh equation to the observed field data yields an apparent enrichment factor of ca 18 compared to the expected values for ε of 35 and 40 the field based ε is relatively low this indicates that bacterial sulphate reduction is not the sole process controlling sulphate concentrations and isotopic compositions if concentration changes occur without changes of δ34s values the field based enrichment factor appears to be lower than the expected ε such fractionation patterns are associated with the process of dilution the right plot of fig 3 shows the dual sulphate isotope space and the correlation between the sulphur and oxygen isotopic composition of groundwater sulphate during the initial screening july 15 2015 the relationship between δ18o so4 and δ34s so4 is characterized by a strong positive linear correlation with a slope close to a quarter this slope can be considered as typical for isotope fractionation associated with bacterial sulphate reduction therefore any further processes affecting the isotopic composition of sulphate do not seem to be likely this implies that mixing of sulphate from isotopically different sources does not occur in the aquifer no correlation between sampling depth and sulphate isotopic composition is obvious however no isotopic enrichment was observed in the deepest sampling level suggesting that bacterial sulphate reduction is of minor importance below 45 m depth 3 2 nitrate injection and temporal development of sulphate sodium ions nitrite and nitrate concentrations nitrate was injected in a section of the lower confined tertiary sand aquifer fig 1 that is affected by the benzene contaminant plume fig 4 shows the temporal development of nitrate nitrite sulphate and sodium concentrations in those wells of each observation line that seemed to be most impacted by the nitrate injection bb1 in the first line 17a in the second line 31a in the third line the reason for the observed high nitrate impact seems to be the depth of the respective wells bb1 17a and 31a are the wells with the deepest drilling depth in each line therefore morphology and groundwater flow direction determine the flow direction of the injected substance the investigated aquifer showed a background concentration of 1 4 2 2 mm na 32 to 51 mg l 1 na with an average of 1 7 mm 39 mg l 1 in contrast to the reactive behavior of nitrate a biogeochemical turnover of sodium is not expected so that na the counter cation of the applied nitrate solution was considered as a conservative tracer during the field experiment due to the longest relative travel time of the injected solution through the aquifer we expected that the strongest biogeochemical impact of the nitrate injection should be visible in observation wells 31a 02 and 44a 02 in the third observation line line 1 in the first observation line only the lowermost sampling levels p5 were affected by the nitrate injection nitrate concentrations started to increase after 42 days in the lowest sampling level p5 the highest nitrate concentration of 57 8 mm was measured 56 days after the start of the injection simultaneously sodium concentrations reached its maximum of 56 4 mm particularly in the deepest observation level the concentration of nitrite rose from undetectable to 0 2 mm line 2 a hydrochemical impact of the nitrate injection is visible in all measured sampling levels p1 p2 p3 p4 sodium and nitrate concentrations in the two upper observation levels showed a minor peak 119 days after the beginning of nitrate injection at the same time highest nitrate concentrations in the two lower levels p3 45 4 mm p4 47 3 mm were observed in the further course of the experiment until its end after 427 days nitrate concentrations remained relatively constant on a plateau between 37 and 40 mm sodium concentrations showed similar behavior nitrite concentrations increased significantly in the two lowest sampling levels maximum nitrite concentrations were reached after 266 days p3 0 9 mm p4 1 6 mm sulphate concentrations increased continuously especially in the lowest sampling level highest sulphate concentrations of 8 2 mm were detected after 322 days line 3 the increase of nitrate and sodium concentrations in the third observation line began especially in the lowest level p4 196 days after the start of the injection the highest nitrate concentrations of 7 75 mm were measured after 210 days the upper two sampling levels showed a minor effect of the nitrate injection the increase of the nitrate concentration in the second lowest level p3 was slightly more pronounced compared to levels p1 and p2 but still very small with 0 93 mm generally sulphate concentrations varied considerably in all levels between 2 mm and 5 2 mm while highest sulphate concentrations in level p3 5 4 mm were measured after 103 days the maximum sulphate peak of 5 1 mm in the observation level p4 was observed after 196 days an increase of nitrite concentrations was detected in the two lowermost observation levels only maximum nitrite concentrations of around 3 mm were reached in level p4 after 266 days 3 3 benzene concentrations and benzene carbon and hydrogen isotope signatures generally benzene may be removed from the contaminated groundwater by microorganisms using the injected nitrate as electron acceptor as shown in previous laboratory experiments with indigenous microbial communities from the site keller et al 2018 to assess potential benzene degradation processes benzene concentrations and benzene carbon and hydrogen isotope signatures were monitored at all sampling locations throughout the duration of the experiment benzene concentrations at the investigated site showed significant temporal and local variability the highest benzene concentrations 1 9 mm in the first observation line were determined in the uppermost horizons of bb1 and bb2 in bb3 benzene concentrations varied between 0 38 mm and 1 28 mm benzene concentrations in the plume might be affected by the mixing of the benzene containing infiltration groundwater taken from well eb2 into the existing plume benzene concentrations below the detection limit were found in bb5 demonstrating that this well was located outside the contaminant plume in the second observation line benzene concentrations varied between 0 and 0 46 mm these low concentrations suggest that the benzene plume passed the second line right between wells 17a 00 and 27a 02 well 44a 02 in the third observation line showed the highest measured benzene concentrations at the test site p1 2 2 mm p2 1 3 mm p3 1 mm in well 31a 02 the maximum benzene concentrations were detected in p2 with 0 77 mm the other levels showed lower concentrations with high variations due to the general local and temporal variability of benzene concentrations in the investigated plume no clear evidence about ongoing benzene degradations could be derived from benzene concentrations alone so that benzene carbon and hydrogen isotope signatures were determined to detect benzene biodegradation carbon and or hydrogen isotope fractionation principally indicates biodegradation of hydrocarbons vogt et al 2016 as most microbial hydrocarbon degradation pathways start with a biochemical reaction in which a ch bond within the target hydrocarbon is cleaved vogt et al 2018 those reactions are generally associated with carbon and or hydrogen isotope fractionation elsner et al 2005 leading to an enrichment of 13c and or 2h in the remaining hydrocarbon molecules fig 5 shows correlations of benzene concentrations and hydrogen fig 5a or carbon fig 5b c d isotope signatures of all samples analysed during the field experiment for hydrogen no significant correlation of benzene concentrations and isotope signatures was observed hence no hydrogen isotope fractionation could be verified in the course of the experiment in contrast a small but significant enrichment of 13c benzene was determined resulting in a carbon enrichment factor εc of 0 35 0 06 this indicates that a part of the benzene was biodegraded the magnitude of benzene carbon isotope fractionation is comparable to benzene εc values previously determined in the upper aquifer of the zeitz site at prevalent sulphate reducing conditions fischer et al 2009 notably isotope fractionation was more pronounced in samples affected by nitrate fig 5c d indicating benzene biodegradation at nitrate reducing conditions in previous laboratory experiments benzene biodegradation at nitrate reducing conditions by microbial communities of the zeitz site was shown to be associated with moderate carbon isotope fractionation keller et al 2018 supporting this assumption in the study of keller et al 2018 only a small hydrogen isotope effect was determined upon benzene degradation which corresponds to the data observed in the field experiment due to the generally lower sensitivity of hydrogen isotope analysis compared to carbon isotope analysis small hydrogen isotope effects may not be detected under field conditions however since benzene degradation at sulphate reducing conditions is generally associated with strong hydrogen isotope fractionation fischer et al 2008 mancini et al 2008 fischer et al 2009 the absence of hydrogen isotope fractionation during the field experiment indicates that benzene was not biodegraded by microorganisms using sulphate as electron acceptor 3 4 isotopic variability of groundwater nitrate the injected nitrate had a nitrogen isotopic signature δ15n no3 of 4 5 and an oxygen isotopic signature δ18o no3 of 23 5 fig 6a considering the entire nitrate isotope dataset for samples collected throughout the duration of the experiment a positive correlation in the dual isotope space fig 6a and a negative correlation between isotope signatures and nitrate concentrations is visible fig 6b both correlations may be indicative for the occurrence of bacterial nitrate reduction the regression line in the dual isotope plot considering all samples showed a slope of 0 4 after removing two outliers showing unusual low δ18o no3 values in concert with relatively high δ15n no3 values a slope of 0 9 resulted denitrification normally leads to an equal fractionation of δ18o and δ15n which means that isotopes change in parallel chen and macquarrie 2005 granger et al 2008 deviations from this ratio have been used to untangle individual pathways of nitrogen cycling specifically to address nitrite reoxidation sigman et al 2005 rafter et al 2013 other experimental studies on denitrification in sediments identified ratios between 0 8 and 1 dähnke and thamdrup 2013 prokopenko et al 2013 kessler et al 2014 with minimum values lower than 0 33 in tidal flat sediments wunderlich et al 2013 suggesting substantial variabilities of isotope fractionation ratios in natural environments furthermore the composition of the microbial community can impact the isotope fractionation ratio of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate during denitrification dähnke and thamdrup 2016 positive isotopic shifts of both species strongly indicate that nitrate is consumed by the anaerobic bacterial denitrification processes unusual negative shifts especially for oxygen isotopes as observed for two samples see fig 6a are an indicator for reverse reactions of intermediates for example nitrite which can influence the isotopic signal of the residual nitrate pool casciotti et al 2002 casciotti et al 2011 negative shifts of δ18o no3 by oxygen isotope exchange between nitrate and the ambient water do not seem very likely as this process is extremely slow under environmental conditions typical for groundwater ecosystems knöller et al 2011 measured nitrate concentrations in the groundwater varied significantly between 0 and 57 8 mm depending on the impact of the injected nitrate as well as dispersion dilution processes fig 6b high δ15n no3 values with low nitrate concentrations indicate bacterial no3 consuming anaerobic denitrification reactions in all observation wells affected by the nitrate plume increased nitrite concentrations 0 1 mm were detected proving in situ denitrifying processes despite the positive effect of providing sulphate as electron acceptor for benzene degradation microbial nitrate reduction produces nitrite as one intermediate that has to be considered as a strong inhibitor for dissimilatory sulphate reduction stoeva and coates 2019 therefore minor amounts of nitrate and its subsequent degradation product nitrite may stop the process of dissimilatory sulphate reduction in the aquifer 3 5 sulphate isotopic signatures and changes in the microbial community composition as indicators for nitrate driven oxidation of reduced sulphur compounds the injected nitrate plume reached the first well gallery after 56 days no3 57 8 mm the second after 119 days no3 47 3 mm and the last after 210 days no3 7 75 mm fig 4 table 2 in line 1 sulphate concentrations varied in a low range and showed no significant trend fig 4 corresponding isotopic signatures behaved differently fig 7 δ34s as well as δ18o so4 2 decreased with the arrival of the nitrate plume and increased again after the nitrate had passed the observation line δ34s so4 2 13 to 6 δ18o so4 2 9 to 4 line 2 showed a different behavior due to the specific morphology of the aquifer in that section nitrate rich water accumulated in a morphological depression of the aquifer layers which resulted in longer residence times of the nitrate spiked water due to more stagnant flow conditions as a consequence oxidizing conditions were present over a longer time period sulphate concentrations increased slowly and reached a constant level after 196 days corresponding sulphate isotopic signatures decreased in that stage and reached values of 4 4 δ34s so4 2 and 1 7 δ18o so4 2 respectively caused by sulphide oxidation sulphate showed relatively low isotopic signatures even at the end of the experiment which is probably due to the fact that nitrate concentrations were still high in line 3 sulphate isotopic signatures decreased before nitrate concentrations increased fig 7 this means that the oxidation of sulphide to sulphate indicated by lighter sulphate isotopic signatures fig 7 already began 100 days after the start of the experiment when the entire sulphide pool was oxidized nitrate concentrations increased corresponding δ15n no3 values increased to a maximum of 68 vs air with a certain time delay indicating that nitrate was used as electron acceptor in situ oxidation of sulphide was confirmed by lighter sulphate isotopic signatures both observation wells 31a and 44a in the third line showed continuous sulphidic conditions with concentrations between 0 2 mm and 0 7 mm before the experiment with the breakthrough of injected nitrate sulphide concentrations decreased in all horizons showing that nitrate was utilized for the oxidation of sulphide to sulphate this reaction appeared in observation line 3 in the lowest horizon after 104 days indicated by decreasing sulphate isotopic signatures line 1 in fig 7c when the entire sulphide pool was oxidized nitrate concentrations started to increase which was the case 173 days after injection line 2 in fig 7c the maximum nitrate concentration of 7 75 mm was reached after 210 days then nitrate concentrations continuously dropped after 364 days no nitrate was detectable anymore microbial sulphide oxidation could also be verified by changes in the groundwater microbial community as shown in fig 8 relative abundances of taxa known for oxidation of reduced inorganic sulphur compounds helicobacteraceae sulfurimonas sulfuritalea campylobacterales after campbell et al 2006 strongly increased alongside with the arrival of the nitrate comprising of around 90 of the microbial groundwater community the highly dynamic temporal development of nitrate concentrations does not seem to affect the temporal development of benzene concentrations benzene concentrations varied between 0 03 mm and 0 24 mm well 31a 02 p4 and no significant benzene concentration changes demonstrating that benzene biodegradation could be detected during the field study by benzene concentration analyses fig 9b during the entire field experiment two general processes influenced sulphate isotopic signatures 1 oxidation of sulphide which resulted in decreasing δ34s so4 2 signatures with increasing sulphate concentrations 2 dilution effects which provoke in variable sulphate concentrations fig 9c d these processes occur in varying extent in each observation well depending on the position of the nitrate plume thus groundwater observation well 44a 02 p3 shows a lower impact on injected nitrate maximum no3 with 298 mg l 1 fig 9a compared to 31a 02 p4 maximum no3 with 481 mg l 1 fig 9b while both processes affecting sulphate isotope signatures are visible in well 44a 02 p3 sulphide oxidizing processes are dominating sulphate isotope signatures in well 31a 0p4 fig 9d 3 6 conceptual model the overall impact of the nitrate injection on the hydrochemical development in the contaminated aquifer is illustrated in the conceptual model in fig 10 generally the field experiment showed that the injection of nitrate leads to more favourable hydrochemical conditions in the aquifer with respect to the degradation of organic contaminants in the case of our experiment nitrate does not seems to be utilized as electron acceptor for contaminant degradation directly to a large extent instead a two step process chain results in an indirect use of nitrate for benzene attenuation in the first step nitrate acts as an electron acceptor for the microbial oxidation of sulphide this process most likely affects both dissolved sulphide and sulphide precipitated in the aquifer matrix sulphide oxidation provides sulphate that is may be utilized in a second step as an electron acceptor for benzene degradation by bacterial sulphate reduction as previously shown at this site besides the provision of sulphate the oxidation of dissolved sulphide reduces the toxicity level of the groundwater which improves the hydrochemical prerequisites for microbial activity unfortunately due to the highly temporally and locally variable benzene concentrations in the contaminant plume before the start of the experiment combined with the open system conditions an exact balancing of the two step process was not possible 4 conclusion we conducted a field experiment to investigate biogeochemical processes associated to nitrate injection in a sulphidic aquifer contaminated mainly with benzene to improve the biogeochemical conditions for benzene degradation we injected 6 74 tons of sodium nitrate solution into the confined aquifer the necessary amount of nitrate was calculated based on lab experiments and detailed information about the contaminated site from past studies gödeke et al 2004 gödeke et al 2006 a monitoring programme was conducted documenting benzene nitrate sulphide and sulphate concentration and the respective isotopic compositions the field experiment proved that the prevailing impact of the nitrate injection was the regeneration of sulphate by microbial re oxidation of reduced potentially toxic sulphur compounds knöller et al 2008 poser et al 2014 keller et al 2018 this leads to environmental friendly conditions for the establishment of microorganisms which can use sulphate to degrade organic compounds herrmann et al 2010 no clear prove was obtained from concentration and isotope data that benzene was oxidized by indigenous microbial communities although previous on site and laboratory experiments have demonstrated the potential for microbial benzene oxidation with sulfate or nitrate as electron acceptor the detected low but significant benzene carbon isotope fractionation give some hint for benzene oxidation by denitrifying consortia it might be that the monitoring time period around 15 months was not long enough to verify in situ benzene oxidation our study significantly contributes to the research field of modern in situ large scale remediation strategies for contaminated aquifers based on the concept of enhanced natural attenuation and bioremediation respectively a new approach of enhancing contaminant degradation on field scale was tested and documented our results indicate that nitrate injection results in a promising accelerated improvement of the hydrochemical conditions in the previously sulphidic highly contaminated aquifer leading to a more favourable environmental milieu for microorganisms in the aquifer with respect to the degradation of hydrocarbons declaration of competing

1444,natural attenuation processes depend on the availability of suitable electron acceptors at the megasite zeitz concentrations of the main contaminant benzene were observed to increase constantly in the lower aquifer to levels of more than 2 5 mm this was accompanied by decreasing concentrations of sulphate so4 2 which has been previously shown to be the main electron acceptor for benzene oxidation at this site resulting in an electron acceptor limited sulphidic benzene plume therefore a field experiment was conducted to stimulate benzene biodegradation by injecting nitrate no3 into the sulphidic benzene plume aiming i to recycle sulphate by nitrate dependent sulphide oxidation and ii to serve as direct electron acceptor for benzene oxidation within 60 days 6 74 tons sodium nitrate nano3 were injected into the lower aquifer and the resulting biogeochemical effects within the benzene plume were monitored for more than one year by chemical and microbiological analyses of groundwater samples taken from various depths of ten monitoring wells located in three observation lines downstream of nitrate injection nitrate was microbiologically consumed as shown by changes in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values partial nitrite accumulation and changing ratios of na no3 main electron donors for nitrate reduction were reduced sulphur compounds verified by changing δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 values partially increasing sulphate concentrations and strongly increasing abundances of typical sulphur oxidizing nitrate reducing bacterial taxa within the nitrate plume the general absent hydrogen isotope fractionation of benzene also in the sulphidic nitrate free part of the plume indicates that benzene was not biodegraded by sulphate reducing consortia however detected small carbon isotope fractionation of benzene points to in situ benzene biodegradation processes in the plume probably supported by nitrate in conclusion nitrate injection resulted in changing redox conditions and recycling of sulphate in the sulphidic sulphate depleted benzene plume due to microbial oxidation of reduced sulphur species leading to presumably favored conditions for in situ benzene biodegradation keywords benzene compound specific stable isotope analysis nitrate sulphide oxidation enhanced natural attenuation bioremediation 1 introduction besides chlorinated hydrocarbons btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes compounds are the most common groundwater pollutants that require remediation measures wiedemeier et al 1999 it is nowadays well understood that many monoaromatic pollutants can be degraded at oxic and anoxic conditions by several microorganisms farhadian et al 2008 weelink et al 2010 although aerobic biodegradation of btex is much faster than anaerobic biodegradation the latter process is crucial for natural attenuation processes at btex contaminated sites due to the low aqueous solubility and rapid consumption of oxygen during anaerobic btex degradation microorganisms transfer electrons from the target compounds to different terminal electron acceptors such as nitrate ferric iron sulphate or carbonate so that the plume is composed of different redox zones depending on the availability of electron acceptors meckenstock et al 2015 benzene which is a carcinogenic substance causing leukemia and further mutagenic diseases is the worst degradable of the btex compounds at anoxic conditions vogt et al 2011 nevertheless benzene mineralization at anoxic conditions has been observed with various electron acceptors such as carbonate sulphate ferric iron or nitrate often at laboratory conditions summarized by vogt et al 2011 in previous studies in situ benzene biodegradation in groundwater was shown to be stimulated by injecting nitrate and sulfate cunningham et al 2001 or nitrate triethyl phosphate and persulfate xiong et al 2012 pathways and extent of anaerobic benzene degradation in contaminated aquifers are mainly controlled by the prevailing biogeochemical conditions and the presence of specific benzene degrading microorganisms concentrations of the inorganic sulphur compounds sulphide and sulphate are important markers for those biogeochemical conditions the presence of free sulphide σ h2saq hs s2 in groundwater is always a clear indicator for sulphate reducing conditions furthermore the occurrence of free sulphide implies that any iron ions that had been present in the aquifer precipitated as insoluble iron sulphur compounds due to the very low solubility product of fe s compounds their precipitation reaction is very fast and usually complete fe s compounds represent an electron donor that is used up in the presence of suitable electron acceptors such as nitrate the oxidation of fe s compounds produces sulphate that can act as a further electron acceptor in the aquifer previous field and laboratory studies showed that sulphate is the preferential electron acceptor for anaerobic benzene degradation at the study site kästner et al 2006 schirmer et al 2006 fischer et al 2007 vogt et al 2007 kleinsteuber et al 2008 herrmann et al 2010 rakoczy et al 2011 taubert et al 2012 however higher concentrations of free sulphide 50 mg l 1 have been shown to inhibit benzene degradation under sulphate reducing conditions in laboratory experiments with microbial communities from the test site taubert et al 2012 likely due to its known potential toxicity for aerobic and anaerobic organisms koschorreck 2008 in addition benzene concentrations in the lower aquifer were observed to considerably increase so alongside with decreasing sulphate concentrations resulting in conditions in which benzene mineralization was limited by the available sulphate however preliminary on site experiments showed that in the presence of nitrate free sulphide and presumably fe s compounds are quickly oxidized to sulphate by nitrate reducing sulphide oxidizing proteobacteria heber 2013 poser et al 2014 furthermore benzene mineralization at nitrate reducing conditions by indigenous microbial communities from the zeitz site has been verified in laboratory microcosm and on site column experiments keller et al 2018 demonstrating the potential of the indigenous microbial community to switch between sulphate and nitrate as electron acceptors upon benzene mineralization thus a concept was developed for the lower aquifer based on addition of nitrate to recycle the natural electron acceptor sulphate by nitrate dependent sulphide oxidation and to make an alternative electron acceptor available for anaerobic benzene oxidation in the field experiment we aimed to evaluate the biogeochemical processes in the benzene contaminated sulphidic aquifer triggered by nitrate injection nitrate is well soluble in water and provides a high oxidation potential rising up the redox potential in the surrounding milieu compared to oxygen gas which is a comparable strong electron acceptor nitrate solutions can be easily injected into aquifers without forming gas phases interfering with the groundwater flow in the nitrate injection field experiment reactive processes of the sulphur nitrogen and carbon cycle were monitored by 34s and 18o isotope analysis of sulphate 15n and 18o isotope analysis of nitrate and 13c and 2h isotope analysis of benzene molecular biological methods were employed to characterize the impact of the nitrate injection on the groundwater microbial community within the benzene plume the results are discussed with respect to the development of a strategy for monitored bioremediation to control btex plumes in sulphidic aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description 2 1 1 history of the study site the investigation area is located on the site of a former hydrogenation plant north of the city of zeitz in central germany that facility was installed in 1939 for the production of fuel lubricants and paraffins out of lignite during world war ii especially in the years 1944 45 the plant was partly destroyed by severe bomb strikes that resulted in a spilling of vast amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons into the soil in 1963 a new plant for the production of benzene was established gödeke et al 2004 between 1965 and 1977 at least nine documented production accidents contributed to the btex contamination of the groundwater benzene entered the underground at several locations throughout the test site and contaminated groundwater down to 30 m gödeke et al 2006 after the german reunification in 1990 all production facilities were shut down schirmer et al 2006 since then numerous measures had been taken to apply active or passive remediation strategies in order to prevent a further spreading of the groundwater pollutants the benzene dominated btex plume was used as a field laboratory to study anaerobic btex degradation vieth et al 2005 fischer et al 2006 fischer et al 2007 fischer et al 2008 2009 furthermore the helmholtz center for environmental research installed a pilot plant for testing different groundwater remediation approaches based on enhancing the natural attenuation capability of the aquifer wachter et al 2004 gödeke et al 2006 schirmer et al 2006 vogt et al 2007 especially anaerobic benzene degradation at sulphate reducing or nitrate reducing conditions was investigated in different column systems filled with coarse sand and flushed with anoxic benzene containing groundwater from the lower aquifer gw 61 vogt et al 2007 knöller et al 2008 taubert et al 2012 poser et al 2014 keller et al 2018 2 1 2 hydrogeology of the investigation area geologically the test site consists of a sequence of two heterogeneous aquifers with a thickness between 12 and 20 m gödeke et al 2006 that are separated by a discontinuous sulphur rich 2 lignite clay layer schirmer et al 2006 the upper quaternary aquifer is partly unconfined and represents a sand deposit from the pleistocene elster glacial period the lower tertiary aquifer consists of gravel deposited by an eocene river a schematic cross section of the area is given in the supporting information fig 1b benzene contaminations occur in both aquifers up to 1600 mg l 1 in the upper and up to 250 mg l 1 in the lower aquifer gödeke et al 2006 the general groundwater flow direction is north east fig 1a gödeke et al 2004 2 2 nitrate injection and groundwater infiltration 6 74 tons of nano3 were injected as 35 solution 19 23 m3 4110 mm into the groundwater flow over a period of 60 days 23rd july to 20th september 2015 the nitrate solution was stored in four stainless steel tanks each having a volume of 1500 l the tanks were flushed with dinitrogen n2 prior to storage of nitrate solution to remove oxygen the nitrate solution was pumped into the infiltration well in a rate of 10 9 l h 1 via stainless steel connections the groundwater was pumped from well gw eb2 fig 1a enriched with no3 in the injection well and pumped via injection well into the lower aquifer at 40 m below ground in a rate of 1500 l h 1 during the whole time of the field experiment groundwater from eb2 was taken from a depth of 22 30 m contained high concentrations of benzene and was sulphidic fig 2 hence represented the original plume conditions of the lower aquifer 2 3 biogeochemical monitoring downstream of the injection well water samples were collected in nine groundwater monitoring wells located in three observation lines on a weekly to biweekly basis fig 1 the observation wells were equipped with a multi level packer system imw germany described in

located in the upstream of the injection well benzene sulphate and sulphide concentrations were monitored for more than 10 years from june 2006 until december 2016 fig 2 beginning in march 2011 t 1700d benzene concentrations continuously increased from below 0 5 mm to up to 2 5 mm in december 2012 t 2367d afterwards benzene concentrations dropped to levels in the range of 0 75 to 1 mm until the end of monitoring sulphate concentrations decreased from around 4 mm to less than 0 5 mm in december 2012 until december 2016 sulphate concentrations gradually increased to maximal concentrations of around 2 5 mm the groundwater was always sulphidic sulphide concentrations ranged from less than 0 1 mm to more than 2 mm highest concentrations were observed in the last years of monitoring notably sulphide concentrations of around 1 5 mm were shown in laboratory experiments to strongly inhibit benzene mineralization at sulphate reducing conditions taubert et al 2012 furthermore sulphate concentrations were far not sufficient for complete benzene mineralization from 2012 to 2016 fig 2 considering that the mineralization of 1 mol benzene is coupled to the reduction of 3 75 mol sulphate weelink et al 2010 the data show that a plume partially depleted in sulphate and containing high benzene and sulphide loads was flowing in direction of the test field which motivated us to perform a nitrate injection field experiment to test an enhanced natural attenuation ena approach based on nitrate reduction previous investigations suggested that the prevailing hydrochemical conditions in the aquifer support the occurrence of bacterial sulphate reduction as the main process for anaerobic benzene degradation schirmer et al 2006 vogt et al 2007 knöller et al 2008 to verify the assumption of sulphate reducing conditions we conducted an initial screening especially focused on the correlation between sulphate concentrations and the isotopic composition of dissolved groundwater sulphate during the initial screening sulphate concentrations and δ34s values varied between 4 4 mm 422 mg l 1 and 0 45 mm 43 mg l 1 and between 8 8 and 51 3 respectively the left plot in fig 3 shows the relationship between sulphate concentrations expressed as the fraction of reacted sulphate and the sulphur isotopic signature of groundwater sulphate the observed high and very high δ34s values above 20 are a first indication for an isotopic enrichment associated with bacterial reduction of groundwater sulphate increasing δ34s values in concert with decreasing sulphate concentrations provide further evidence for the occurrence of sulphate reduction the observed correlation follows a logarithmic relationship that may be expressed by a general logarithmic equation rayleigh equation δ34s observed εln c c 0 δ34s initial where ε is the isotopic enrichment factor according to knöller et al 2006 an isotopic enrichment factor between 35 and 40 can be expected for straightforward bacterial sulphate reduction in a hydrochemical setting with similar conditions as present in the investigated aquifer fitting the rayleigh equation to the observed field data yields an apparent enrichment factor of ca 18 compared to the expected values for ε of 35 and 40 the field based ε is relatively low this indicates that bacterial sulphate reduction is not the sole process controlling sulphate concentrations and isotopic compositions if concentration changes occur without changes of δ34s values the field based enrichment factor appears to be lower than the expected ε such fractionation patterns are associated with the process of dilution the right plot of fig 3 shows the dual sulphate isotope space and the correlation between the sulphur and oxygen isotopic composition of groundwater sulphate during the initial screening july 15 2015 the relationship between δ18o so4 and δ34s so4 is characterized by a strong positive linear correlation with a slope close to a quarter this slope can be considered as typical for isotope fractionation associated with bacterial sulphate reduction therefore any further processes affecting the isotopic composition of sulphate do not seem to be likely this implies that mixing of sulphate from isotopically different sources does not occur in the aquifer no correlation between sampling depth and sulphate isotopic composition is obvious however no isotopic enrichment was observed in the deepest sampling level suggesting that bacterial sulphate reduction is of minor importance below 45 m depth 3 2 nitrate injection and temporal development of sulphate sodium ions nitrite and nitrate concentrations nitrate was injected in a section of the lower confined tertiary sand aquifer fig 1 that is affected by the benzene contaminant plume fig 4 shows the temporal development of nitrate nitrite sulphate and sodium concentrations in those wells of each observation line that seemed to be most impacted by the nitrate injection bb1 in the first line 17a in the second line 31a in the third line the reason for the observed high nitrate impact seems to be the depth of the respective wells bb1 17a and 31a are the wells with the deepest drilling depth in each line therefore morphology and groundwater flow direction determine the flow direction of the injected substance the investigated aquifer showed a background concentration of 1 4 2 2 mm na 32 to 51 mg l 1 na with an average of 1 7 mm 39 mg l 1 in contrast to the reactive behavior of nitrate a biogeochemical turnover of sodium is not expected so that na the counter cation of the applied nitrate solution was considered as a conservative tracer during the field experiment due to the longest relative travel time of the injected solution through the aquifer we expected that the strongest biogeochemical impact of the nitrate injection should be visible in observation wells 31a 02 and 44a 02 in the third observation line line 1 in the first observation line only the lowermost sampling levels p5 were affected by the nitrate injection nitrate concentrations started to increase after 42 days in the lowest sampling level p5 the highest nitrate concentration of 57 8 mm was measured 56 days after the start of the injection simultaneously sodium concentrations reached its maximum of 56 4 mm particularly in the deepest observation level the concentration of nitrite rose from undetectable to 0 2 mm line 2 a hydrochemical impact of the nitrate injection is visible in all measured sampling levels p1 p2 p3 p4 sodium and nitrate concentrations in the two upper observation levels showed a minor peak 119 days after the beginning of nitrate injection at the same time highest nitrate concentrations in the two lower levels p3 45 4 mm p4 47 3 mm were observed in the further course of the experiment until its end after 427 days nitrate concentrations remained relatively constant on a plateau between 37 and 40 mm sodium concentrations showed similar behavior nitrite concentrations increased significantly in the two lowest sampling levels maximum nitrite concentrations were reached after 266 days p3 0 9 mm p4 1 6 mm sulphate concentrations increased continuously especially in the lowest sampling level highest sulphate concentrations of 8 2 mm were detected after 322 days line 3 the increase of nitrate and sodium concentrations in the third observation line began especially in the lowest level p4 196 days after the start of the injection the highest nitrate concentrations of 7 75 mm were measured after 210 days the upper two sampling levels showed a minor effect of the nitrate injection the increase of the nitrate concentration in the second lowest level p3 was slightly more pronounced compared to levels p1 and p2 but still very small with 0 93 mm generally sulphate concentrations varied considerably in all levels between 2 mm and 5 2 mm while highest sulphate concentrations in level p3 5 4 mm were measured after 103 days the maximum sulphate peak of 5 1 mm in the observation level p4 was observed after 196 days an increase of nitrite concentrations was detected in the two lowermost observation levels only maximum nitrite concentrations of around 3 mm were reached in level p4 after 266 days 3 3 benzene concentrations and benzene carbon and hydrogen isotope signatures generally benzene may be removed from the contaminated groundwater by microorganisms using the injected nitrate as electron acceptor as shown in previous laboratory experiments with indigenous microbial communities from the site keller et al 2018 to assess potential benzene degradation processes benzene concentrations and benzene carbon and hydrogen isotope signatures were monitored at all sampling locations throughout the duration of the experiment benzene concentrations at the investigated site showed significant temporal and local variability the highest benzene concentrations 1 9 mm in the first observation line were determined in the uppermost horizons of bb1 and bb2 in bb3 benzene concentrations varied between 0 38 mm and 1 28 mm benzene concentrations in the plume might be affected by the mixing of the benzene containing infiltration groundwater taken from well eb2 into the existing plume benzene concentrations below the detection limit were found in bb5 demonstrating that this well was located outside the contaminant plume in the second observation line benzene concentrations varied between 0 and 0 46 mm these low concentrations suggest that the benzene plume passed the second line right between wells 17a 00 and 27a 02 well 44a 02 in the third observation line showed the highest measured benzene concentrations at the test site p1 2 2 mm p2 1 3 mm p3 1 mm in well 31a 02 the maximum benzene concentrations were detected in p2 with 0 77 mm the other levels showed lower concentrations with high variations due to the general local and temporal variability of benzene concentrations in the investigated plume no clear evidence about ongoing benzene degradations could be derived from benzene concentrations alone so that benzene carbon and hydrogen isotope signatures were determined to detect benzene biodegradation carbon and or hydrogen isotope fractionation principally indicates biodegradation of hydrocarbons vogt et al 2016 as most microbial hydrocarbon degradation pathways start with a biochemical reaction in which a ch bond within the target hydrocarbon is cleaved vogt et al 2018 those reactions are generally associated with carbon and or hydrogen isotope fractionation elsner et al 2005 leading to an enrichment of 13c and or 2h in the remaining hydrocarbon molecules fig 5 shows correlations of benzene concentrations and hydrogen fig 5a or carbon fig 5b c d isotope signatures of all samples analysed during the field experiment for hydrogen no significant correlation of benzene concentrations and isotope signatures was observed hence no hydrogen isotope fractionation could be verified in the course of the experiment in contrast a small but significant enrichment of 13c benzene was determined resulting in a carbon enrichment factor εc of 0 35 0 06 this indicates that a part of the benzene was biodegraded the magnitude of benzene carbon isotope fractionation is comparable to benzene εc values previously determined in the upper aquifer of the zeitz site at prevalent sulphate reducing conditions fischer et al 2009 notably isotope fractionation was more pronounced in samples affected by nitrate fig 5c d indicating benzene biodegradation at nitrate reducing conditions in previous laboratory experiments benzene biodegradation at nitrate reducing conditions by microbial communities of the zeitz site was shown to be associated with moderate carbon isotope fractionation keller et al 2018 supporting this assumption in the study of keller et al 2018 only a small hydrogen isotope effect was determined upon benzene degradation which corresponds to the data observed in the field experiment due to the generally lower sensitivity of hydrogen isotope analysis compared to carbon isotope analysis small hydrogen isotope effects may not be detected under field conditions however since benzene degradation at sulphate reducing conditions is generally associated with strong hydrogen isotope fractionation fischer et al 2008 mancini et al 2008 fischer et al 2009 the absence of hydrogen isotope fractionation during the field experiment indicates that benzene was not biodegraded by microorganisms using sulphate as electron acceptor 3 4 isotopic variability of groundwater nitrate the injected nitrate had a nitrogen isotopic signature δ15n no3 of 4 5 and an oxygen isotopic signature δ18o no3 of 23 5 fig 6a considering the entire nitrate isotope dataset for samples collected throughout the duration of the experiment a positive correlation in the dual isotope space fig 6a and a negative correlation between isotope signatures and nitrate concentrations is visible fig 6b both correlations may be indicative for the occurrence of bacterial nitrate reduction the regression line in the dual isotope plot considering all samples showed a slope of 0 4 after removing two outliers showing unusual low δ18o no3 values in concert with relatively high δ15n no3 values a slope of 0 9 resulted denitrification normally leads to an equal fractionation of δ18o and δ15n which means that isotopes change in parallel chen and macquarrie 2005 granger et al 2008 deviations from this ratio have been used to untangle individual pathways of nitrogen cycling specifically to address nitrite reoxidation sigman et al 2005 rafter et al 2013 other experimental studies on denitrification in sediments identified ratios between 0 8 and 1 dähnke and thamdrup 2013 prokopenko et al 2013 kessler et al 2014 with minimum values lower than 0 33 in tidal flat sediments wunderlich et al 2013 suggesting substantial variabilities of isotope fractionation ratios in natural environments furthermore the composition of the microbial community can impact the isotope fractionation ratio of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate during denitrification dähnke and thamdrup 2016 positive isotopic shifts of both species strongly indicate that nitrate is consumed by the anaerobic bacterial denitrification processes unusual negative shifts especially for oxygen isotopes as observed for two samples see fig 6a are an indicator for reverse reactions of intermediates for example nitrite which can influence the isotopic signal of the residual nitrate pool casciotti et al 2002 casciotti et al 2011 negative shifts of δ18o no3 by oxygen isotope exchange between nitrate and the ambient water do not seem very likely as this process is extremely slow under environmental conditions typical for groundwater ecosystems knöller et al 2011 measured nitrate concentrations in the groundwater varied significantly between 0 and 57 8 mm depending on the impact of the injected nitrate as well as dispersion dilution processes fig 6b high δ15n no3 values with low nitrate concentrations indicate bacterial no3 consuming anaerobic denitrification reactions in all observation wells affected by the nitrate plume increased nitrite concentrations 0 1 mm were detected proving in situ denitrifying processes despite the positive effect of providing sulphate as electron acceptor for benzene degradation microbial nitrate reduction produces nitrite as one intermediate that has to be considered as a strong inhibitor for dissimilatory sulphate reduction stoeva and coates 2019 therefore minor amounts of nitrate and its subsequent degradation product nitrite may stop the process of dissimilatory sulphate reduction in the aquifer 3 5 sulphate isotopic signatures and changes in the microbial community composition as indicators for nitrate driven oxidation of reduced sulphur compounds the injected nitrate plume reached the first well gallery after 56 days no3 57 8 mm the second after 119 days no3 47 3 mm and the last after 210 days no3 7 75 mm fig 4 table 2 in line 1 sulphate concentrations varied in a low range and showed no significant trend fig 4 corresponding isotopic signatures behaved differently fig 7 δ34s as well as δ18o so4 2 decreased with the arrival of the nitrate plume and increased again after the nitrate had passed the observation line δ34s so4 2 13 to 6 δ18o so4 2 9 to 4 line 2 showed a different behavior due to the specific morphology of the aquifer in that section nitrate rich water accumulated in a morphological depression of the aquifer layers which resulted in longer residence times of the nitrate spiked water due to more stagnant flow conditions as a consequence oxidizing conditions were present over a longer time period sulphate concentrations increased slowly and reached a constant level after 196 days corresponding sulphate isotopic signatures decreased in that stage and reached values of 4 4 δ34s so4 2 and 1 7 δ18o so4 2 respectively caused by sulphide oxidation sulphate showed relatively low isotopic signatures even at the end of the experiment which is probably due to the fact that nitrate concentrations were still high in line 3 sulphate isotopic signatures decreased before nitrate concentrations increased fig 7 this means that the oxidation of sulphide to sulphate indicated by lighter sulphate isotopic signatures fig 7 already began 100 days after the start of the experiment when the entire sulphide pool was oxidized nitrate concentrations increased corresponding δ15n no3 values increased to a maximum of 68 vs air with a certain time delay indicating that nitrate was used as electron acceptor in situ oxidation of sulphide was confirmed by lighter sulphate isotopic signatures both observation wells 31a and 44a in the third line showed continuous sulphidic conditions with concentrations between 0 2 mm and 0 7 mm before the experiment with the breakthrough of injected nitrate sulphide concentrations decreased in all horizons showing that nitrate was utilized for the oxidation of sulphide to sulphate this reaction appeared in observation line 3 in the lowest horizon after 104 days indicated by decreasing sulphate isotopic signatures line 1 in fig 7c when the entire sulphide pool was oxidized nitrate concentrations started to increase which was the case 173 days after injection line 2 in fig 7c the maximum nitrate concentration of 7 75 mm was reached after 210 days then nitrate concentrations continuously dropped after 364 days no nitrate was detectable anymore microbial sulphide oxidation could also be verified by changes in the groundwater microbial community as shown in fig 8 relative abundances of taxa known for oxidation of reduced inorganic sulphur compounds helicobacteraceae sulfurimonas sulfuritalea campylobacterales after campbell et al 2006 strongly increased alongside with the arrival of the nitrate comprising of around 90 of the microbial groundwater community the highly dynamic temporal development of nitrate concentrations does not seem to affect the temporal development of benzene concentrations benzene concentrations varied between 0 03 mm and 0 24 mm well 31a 02 p4 and no significant benzene concentration changes demonstrating that benzene biodegradation could be detected during the field study by benzene concentration analyses fig 9b during the entire field experiment two general processes influenced sulphate isotopic signatures 1 oxidation of sulphide which resulted in decreasing δ34s so4 2 signatures with increasing sulphate concentrations 2 dilution effects which provoke in variable sulphate concentrations fig 9c d these processes occur in varying extent in each observation well depending on the position of the nitrate plume thus groundwater observation well 44a 02 p3 shows a lower impact on injected nitrate maximum no3 with 298 mg l 1 fig 9a compared to 31a 02 p4 maximum no3 with 481 mg l 1 fig 9b while both processes affecting sulphate isotope signatures are visible in well 44a 02 p3 sulphide oxidizing processes are dominating sulphate isotope signatures in well 31a 0p4 fig 9d 3 6 conceptual model the overall impact of the nitrate injection on the hydrochemical development in the contaminated aquifer is illustrated in the conceptual model in fig 10 generally the field experiment showed that the injection of nitrate leads to more favourable hydrochemical conditions in the aquifer with respect to the degradation of organic contaminants in the case of our experiment nitrate does not seems to be utilized as electron acceptor for contaminant degradation directly to a large extent instead a two step process chain results in an indirect use of nitrate for benzene attenuation in the first step nitrate acts as an electron acceptor for the microbial oxidation of sulphide this process most likely affects both dissolved sulphide and sulphide precipitated in the aquifer matrix sulphide oxidation provides sulphate that is may be utilized in a second step as an electron acceptor for benzene degradation by bacterial sulphate reduction as previously shown at this site besides the provision of sulphate the oxidation of dissolved sulphide reduces the toxicity level of the groundwater which improves the hydrochemical prerequisites for microbial activity unfortunately due to the highly temporally and locally variable benzene concentrations in the contaminant plume before the start of the experiment combined with the open system conditions an exact balancing of the two step process was not possible 4 conclusion we conducted a field experiment to investigate biogeochemical processes associated to nitrate injection in a sulphidic aquifer contaminated mainly with benzene to improve the biogeochemical conditions for benzene degradation we injected 6 74 tons of sodium nitrate solution into the confined aquifer the necessary amount of nitrate was calculated based on lab experiments and detailed information about the contaminated site from past studies gödeke et al 2004 gödeke et al 2006 a monitoring programme was conducted documenting benzene nitrate sulphide and sulphate concentration and the respective isotopic compositions the field experiment proved that the prevailing impact of the nitrate injection was the regeneration of sulphate by microbial re oxidation of reduced potentially toxic sulphur compounds knöller et al 2008 poser et al 2014 keller et al 2018 this leads to environmental friendly conditions for the establishment of microorganisms which can use sulphate to degrade organic compounds herrmann et al 2010 no clear prove was obtained from concentration and isotope data that benzene was oxidized by indigenous microbial communities although previous on site and laboratory experiments have demonstrated the potential for microbial benzene oxidation with sulfate or nitrate as electron acceptor the detected low but significant benzene carbon isotope fractionation give some hint for benzene oxidation by denitrifying consortia it might be that the monitoring time period around 15 months was not long enough to verify in situ benzene oxidation our study significantly contributes to the research field of modern in situ large scale remediation strategies for contaminated aquifers based on the concept of enhanced natural attenuation and bioremediation respectively a new approach of enhancing contaminant degradation on field scale was tested and documented our results indicate that nitrate injection results in a promising accelerated improvement of the hydrochemical conditions in the previously sulphidic highly contaminated aquifer leading to a more favourable environmental milieu for microorganisms in the aquifer with respect to the degradation of hydrocarbons declaration of competing
