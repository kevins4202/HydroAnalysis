wave and wind loads floating wind turbines fwts have relatively high structural requirements which result in high operational and maintenance costs therefore reducing the loads on fwts is important for improving their reliability oguz et al 2018 four main platform types are used for fwts spar buoys barges tension legs and semisubmersibles the detailed structures of the four floating platforms are available in the related references wayman et al 2006 jonkman and sclavounos 2006 lackner 2009 matha 2010 larsen and hanson 2007 nielsen et al 2006 the main disadvantage of fwts is the platform

zhang et al 2015 have used a tuned liquid column damper to control the structural vibration of fwts lackner and rotea 2011 studied the passive semiactive and active control strategies of wind turbines in which the tmd is placed in the nacelle or platform for load reduction stewart 2012 and stewart and lackner 2013 established a simplified model with three degrees of freedom dofs for wind turbines and optimized the tmd parameters however these simplified models neglect the coupling effects among the platform surge pitch and heave movement moreover these studies have examined the influence of the tmd installed in either the platform or nacelle of the fwts and did not consider the simultaneous installation of the tmd in both locations therefore the influence of a tmd on the structural vibration for barge fwts is examined in this paper a complete wind turbine is built discussed in section 2 and the drivetrain model is validated according to germanischer lloyd 2010 gl 2010 a six dof dynamic model is established for fwts section 3 by considering the coupling effect of the platform tower and tmd motions after the dynamic model is established tmd parameter optimization is performed

software program used to model the dynamic behavior of interconnected rigid or flexible bodies subjected to translational and rotational displacement the behavior of a single body or part of a mechanical system is studied in detail using the finite element fe method whereas the behavior of the complete multibody system is studied using multibody system methods multibody system methods enable engineers to generate and solve virtual 3d models to predict and visualize motion coupling force and stress the main advantage of simpack is that it can be adopted to perform full transient nonlinear analyses simpack is particularly well suited for analyzing the dynamics of complex systems simpack ag 2016 simpack can be used for the load analysis and dynamic simulation of drivetrains and complete wind turbines it can also be used for control parameter optimization dynamic stress analysis and fatigue analysis by using simpack a gearbox model with any structure can be created moreover

wind and wave loads on the dynamics of complete wind turbines can be determined using aerodynamic and hydrodynamic software a control analysis of the yaw and pitch can be performed through an interface with control software such as matlab however with the introduction of flexible bodies and an increase in modeling complexity the solution to the multibody dynamic model requires considerable computer hardware resources 2 2 multibody dynamics modeling the main parameter and natural frequency of the 5 mw barge fwts studied in this paper are as follows matha 2010 see table 1 and table 2 the main drivetrain part must be built using a multibody dynamic model in which the independent components are represented by independent rigid or flexible bodies and the interactions are realized by the force element gl 2010 the eigenfrequency associated with the drivetrain must be calculated therefore the physical properties of the components should be considered according to the excitation sources

theoretical and simpack result is less than 5 4 3 therefore the accuracy of the drivetrain model is verified 3 6 dof model for fwts the main motion in the xoz plane displayed in fig 3 of fwts is influenced by the platform surge heave pitch and tower first f a bending first due to the complexity of the complete wind turbine system the dynamic fwt model is simplified to optimize the tmd

1 2 k p 2 z p 2 where i k and d represent the inertia moment spring stiffness and damping coefficient respectively r is the distance from the hinge to the mass center of the corresponding dof and m is the mass of each part the global force q i is obtained from the virtual work theorem as follows 5 q θ t d t θ t θ p d tmd 1 r tmd 1 cos θ t x tmd 1 r tmd 1 θ t cos θ t x p q θ p d t θ t θ p d p 1 θ p

method was used to estimate the unknown parameters including the tower and platform inertia stiffness and damping coefficient of the platform pitch and surge and heave motion moré 1978 ranganathan 2004 due to the sensitivity of the lm method to initial values the initial guess of the unknown parameters should be reasonable to prevent nonconvergent results the initial guess and final estimated parameters are presented in table 3 the response comparisons between the estimation and simpack model are illustrated in fig 5 which indicates good agreement between both models the platform pitch angle is set to 8 without the tmd and 10 with the tmd to verify the estimated parameters the simulation results are compared again with the estimation models fig 5 b and c which suggests that the estimation results are accurate 5 tmd parameter optimization 5 1 evaluation index of the parameter optimization the tmd parameters such as the stiffness damping coefficient and tmd mass must be optimized to achieve enhanced vibration reduction in fwts four wind wave load cases were selected according to iec 61400 3 2009 as presented in table 4 the iecvkm turbulence model with a turbulence intensity of 16 and a jonswap wave spectrum model with a peak spectral period of 12 4 s are used comparisons of the tower top f a and s s displacements are illustrated in fig 6 the tower top f a displacements in the frequency domain for the four load cases are displayed in fig 7 the amplitude of the tower top s s displacement is smaller than that of the tower top f a displacement fig 6 therefore the tower top f a displacement mitigation is selected as the control target fig 7 indicates that the natural frequency of the tmd should be tuned to decrease the vibration at approximately 0 08 hz the standard deviation of the tower top f a displacement is regarded as the evaluation index of the tmd parameter optimization it is expressed as follows 8 j 1 t t 0 t t x ttd x ttd 2 d t where t t is the simulation time x ttd is the tower top f a displacement and x ttd is the average f a displacement 5 2 afsa hartog 1985 analyzed the response of the external harmonic force and derived a formula for calculating the optimum natural frequency and damping ratio of a tmd however inaccurate results are obtained with this formula if the damping of the structural system is not considered therefore the afsa is used to optimize the tmd parameters tables 6 and 7 afsa has a suitable global search ability and is not sensitive to the initial parameters huang and chen 2013 shan et al 2006 this algorithm can simulate the behavior of fish swarms such as preying swarming following and random behavior each fish seeks the local optimum through four behaviors to achieve the global optimum the visual conceptual model of an artificial fish is depicted in fig 8 x is the position of a fish in the swarm and the term visual represents the range that the artificial fish can measure if the fish detects another fish at x v the more suitable living environment is selected through a comparison with others finally the fish determines the most beneficial location to live through a continuous search the specific expressions are as follows 9 x v x v i s u a l r a n d 10 x n e x t x x v x x v x s t e p r a n d where rand is a random function that generates a random number between 0 and 1 and step is the step length the flow chart of the afsa is illustrated in fig 9 1 optimization objective the minimum standard deviation of the tower top f a displacement is selected as the optimization objective f 0 11 f 0 min j m tmd k tmd d tmd where m tmd k tmd and d tmd are the parameters to be optimized 2 boundary condition a according to connor 2003 the tmd s mass is generally less than 5 of the total mass thus the tmd mass is set to 0 m tmd 307 473 kg the total mass of the fwt is 6149 46 tons b the parameters k tmd and d tmd are set as 0 k tmd 105 n m and 0 d tmd 105 ns m respectively 3 input parameter in the afsa the parameters m tmd k tmd and d tmd are optimized in the artificial fish x i 4 output parameter in the afsa the standard deviation of the tower top f a displacement is set as the output parameter y i 12 y i fish x i table 5 presents the main parameter used by the afsa the simulation is performed using a six dof simulink model for 200 s as indicated in table 7 compared with the den hartog method a smaller standard deviation of the tower top f a displacement is obtained with the afsa tables 6 and 7 the tmd installed in the nacelle suppresses the vibration more favorably than the tmd installed in the platform which is consistent with most building structures that have the tmd located on the top layer moreover the standard deviation of the tower top f a displacement is the smallest when tmds are simultaneously placed in the nacelle and platform 6 validation of the optimization results according to iec 61400 3 2009 five wind wave load cases are selected table 8 to comprehensively evaluate the vibration mitigation effects of the tmd under various operating conditions the fwt cosimulation model is established using simpack and matlab simulink as displayed in fig 10 the load cases 1 5 indicate operations in cut in below rated rated above rated and cut out wind speeds with their corresponding wave conditions respectively the standard deviation of the evaluation indices are illustrated in fig 11 and the mitigation rate of the evaluation indices with and without the tmd is presented in table 9 in which the negative percent improvement means a larger output compared with no tmd case fig 11 and table 9 indicate the following 1 the vibration reduction effects for all the evaluation indices are optimal under the five load cases when tmds are simultaneously placed in the nacelle and platform moreover the tmd placed in the nacelle has a superior mitigation effect than the tmd placed in the platform 2 the designed tmd can better suppress the displacement along the f a direction taken as the control objective than along the s s direction when the tmd is placed in the nacelle platform and both locations 6 7 26 7 and 0 of the evaluation indices respectively exhibit increasing values installing the tmd in the platform is practical due to the low cost and favorable convenience of installation however the overall mitigation effect of the tmd installed on the platform is inferior to that of the tmd installed in the nacelle 3 due to the constant wind load acting on the rotor the tmd is mostly on one side under load cases 1 to 3 which results in a limited mitigation effect the designed tmd faces difficulties in suppressing the vibrations under load case 5 due to the large wind wave loads which result in the violent movement of the platform 7 conclusions in this study a complete wind turbine was built and validated according to gl 2010 guideline then a dynamic model with six dofs was established according to the lagrange equation for barge fwts to optimize the tmd parameters the unknown parameters were estimated using the lm method the mass damping and stiffness of the tmd were optimized using the afsa based on the six dof model the optimization results were then compared with the results obtained using the den hartog method finally the wind turbine model with different tmd installations was simulated under five load cases the simulation results indicated that the vibration mitigation effect of the tmd on wind turbines is affected by the tmd location and load case generally the vibration mitigation effect is improved when the tmd is located in the nacelle instead of the platform the optimal vibration mitigation is achieved when tmds are simultaneously installed in both locations

method was used to estimate the unknown parameters including the tower and platform inertia stiffness and damping coefficient of the platform pitch and surge and heave motion moré 1978 ranganathan 2004 due to the sensitivity of the lm method to initial values the initial guess of the unknown parameters should be reasonable to prevent nonconvergent results the initial guess and final estimated parameters are presented in table 3 the response comparisons between the estimation and simpack model are illustrated in fig 5 which indicates good agreement between both models the platform pitch angle is set to 8 without the tmd and 10 with the tmd to verify the estimated parameters the simulation results are compared again with the estimation models fig 5 b and c which suggests that the estimation results are accurate 5 tmd parameter optimization 5 1 evaluation index of the parameter optimization the tmd parameters such as the stiffness damping coefficient and tmd mass must be optimized to achieve enhanced vibration reduction in fwts four wind wave load cases were selected according to iec 61400 3 2009 as presented in table 4 the iecvkm turbulence model with a turbulence intensity of 16 and a jonswap wave spectrum model with a peak spectral period of 12 4 s are used comparisons of the tower top f a and s s displacements are illustrated in fig 6 the tower top f a displacements in the frequency domain for the four load cases are displayed in fig 7 the amplitude of the tower top s s displacement is smaller than that of the tower top f a displacement fig 6 therefore the tower top f a displacement mitigation is selected as the control target fig 7 indicates that the natural frequency of the tmd should be tuned to decrease the vibration at approximately 0 08 hz the standard deviation of the tower top f a displacement is regarded as the evaluation index of the tmd parameter optimization it is expressed as follows 8 j 1 t t 0 t t x ttd x ttd 2 d t where t t is the simulation time x ttd is the tower top f a displacement and x ttd is the average f a displacement 5 2 afsa hartog 1985 analyzed the response of the external harmonic force and derived a formula for calculating the optimum natural frequency and damping ratio of a tmd however inaccurate results are obtained with this formula if the damping of the structural system is not considered therefore the afsa is used to optimize the tmd parameters tables 6 and 7 afsa has a suitable global search ability and is not sensitive to the initial parameters huang and chen 2013 shan et al 2006 this algorithm can simulate the behavior of fish swarms such as preying swarming following and random behavior each fish seeks the local optimum through four behaviors to achieve the global optimum the visual conceptual model of an artificial fish is depicted in fig 8 x is the position of a fish in the swarm and the term visual represents the range that the artificial fish can measure if the fish detects another fish at x v the more suitable living environment is selected through a comparison with others finally the fish determines the most beneficial location to live through a continuous search the specific expressions are as follows 9 x v x v i s u a l r a n d 10 x n e x t x x v x x v x s t e p r a n d where rand is a random function that generates a random number between 0 and 1 and step is the step length the flow chart of the afsa is illustrated in fig 9 1 optimization objective the minimum standard deviation of the tower top f a displacement is selected as the optimization objective f 0 11 f 0 min j m tmd k tmd d tmd where m tmd k tmd and d tmd are the parameters to be optimized 2 boundary condition a according to connor 2003 the tmd s mass is generally less than 5 of the total mass thus the tmd mass is set to 0 m tmd 307 473 kg the total mass of the fwt is 6149 46 tons b the parameters k tmd and d tmd are set as 0 k tmd 105 n m and 0 d tmd 105 ns m respectively 3 input parameter in the afsa the parameters m tmd k tmd and d tmd are optimized in the artificial fish x i 4 output parameter in the afsa the standard deviation of the tower top f a displacement is set as the output parameter y i 12 y i fish x i table 5 presents the main parameter used by the afsa the simulation is performed using a six dof simulink model for 200 s as indicated in table 7 compared with the den hartog method a smaller standard deviation of the tower top f a displacement is obtained with the afsa tables 6 and 7 the tmd installed in the nacelle suppresses the vibration more favorably than the tmd installed in the platform which is consistent with most building structures that have the tmd located on the top layer moreover the standard deviation of the tower top f a displacement is the smallest when tmds are simultaneously placed in the nacelle and platform 6 validation of the optimization results according to iec 61400 3 2009 five wind wave load cases are selected table 8 to comprehensively evaluate the vibration mitigation effects of the tmd under various operating conditions the fwt cosimulation model is established using simpack and matlab simulink as displayed in fig 10 the load cases 1 5 indicate operations in cut in below rated rated above rated and cut out wind speeds with their corresponding wave conditions respectively the standard deviation of the evaluation indices are illustrated in fig 11 and the mitigation rate of the evaluation indices with and without the tmd is presented in table 9 in which the negative percent improvement means a larger output compared with no tmd case fig 11 and table 9 indicate the following 1 the vibration reduction effects for all the evaluation indices are optimal under the five load cases when tmds are simultaneously placed in the nacelle and platform moreover the tmd placed in the nacelle has a superior mitigation effect than the tmd placed in the platform 2 the designed tmd can better suppress the displacement along the f a direction taken as the control objective than along the s s direction when the tmd is placed in the nacelle platform and both locations 6 7 26 7 and 0 of the evaluation indices respectively exhibit increasing values installing the tmd in the platform is practical due to the low cost and favorable convenience of installation however the overall mitigation effect of the tmd installed on the platform is inferior to that of the tmd installed in the nacelle 3 due to the constant wind load acting on the rotor the tmd is mostly on one side under load cases 1 to 3 which results in a limited mitigation effect the designed tmd faces difficulties in suppressing the vibrations under load case 5 due to the large wind wave loads which result in the violent movement of the platform 7 conclusions in this study a complete wind turbine was built and validated according to gl 2010 guideline then a dynamic model with six dofs was established according to the lagrange equation for barge fwts to optimize the tmd parameters the unknown parameters were estimated using the lm method the mass damping and stiffness of the tmd were optimized using the afsa based on the six dof model the optimization results were then compared with the results obtained using the den hartog method finally the wind turbine model with different tmd installations was simulated under five load cases the simulation results indicated that the vibration mitigation effect of the tmd on wind turbines is affected by the tmd location and load case generally the vibration mitigation effect is improved when the tmd is located in the nacelle instead of the platform the optimal vibration mitigation is achieved when tmds are simultaneously installed in both locations

23091,in this paper we numerically investigate three dimensional flow past a freely hanging stationary riser in catenary shape referred to cr with the angle of incoming flow direction with respect to the plane aligned with the cr ranging from α 0 90 at a low reynolds number of 100 the flow dynamics are governed by the incompressible navier stokes equations and a high order spectral hp element method is employed for the solutions of the flow field the numerical results present that the wake topology behind the cr is strongly influenced by the incoming flow direction in particular in the range of small angle of incoming flow direction 0 α 40 the wake is completely suppressed in the medium range of 40 α 50 vortex shedding is developed firstly at the top side of the concave part and then gradually spread over the span towards the convex part wake instability is developed sufficiently along the whole span when the flow incidence is over 50 the wake dynamics is further explored by examining the temporal evolution of hydro forces and field quantities along the span and their frequency characteristics it is revealed that the mechanism of axial flow that is varied along the span of cr can explain hydro dynamics of the wake behavior of the cr keywords catenary riser wake topology hydro forces vortex shedding frequency spectral hp element method 1 introduction highly flexible risers such as steel catenary risers are widely deployed for deep water drilling industry to convey oil from the seabed to the sea surface since it can offer a low cost alternative to conventionally used rigid risers on floating platforms and can also provide economic riser design solutions for fixed platforms for such type of risers it is commonly practical to incorporate a buoyant portion on an intermediate section of the riser or an upward force at a point via a buoy this leads the riser in standard configurations of lazy wave steep wave lazy s and steep s as shown in fig 1 according to whether the riser rests along the sea bed and the means by which the buoyancy is achieved by yong and qiang 2005 in terms of simplest modeling a freely hanging configuration can be considered as a catenary riser cr in contrast to conventional straight riser the angle of the axis of catenary geometry with respect to incoming flow direction varies along the curved span and it has great influence on the surrounding flow behavior this can be expected from a few studies on flow past a deformed body that were carried out recently taking into account of the inclination effect on the wake dynamics miliou et al 2003 2007 gallardo et al 2011 2013 2014 considering as a prototype of cr miliou et al 2003 2007 studied the wake structures behind a curved cylinder whose centerline is a quarter section of a ring their investigation showed that there were two completely different phenomena when the flow was applied onto the convex shaped model and the concave shaped model in the convex configuration case a fully three dimensional vortex shedding was observed at r e 100 and r e 500 for the concave configuration the vortex shedding was completely suppressed at r e 100 but at r e 500 the wake is energized with vortex shedding in particular at the top side of the riser gallardo et al 2011 2013 2014 numerically investigated the turbulent wake of the same configuration but in the turbulent regime r e 3900 it was found that the turbulent wake structures behind the upper side of the convex configuration were more coherent due to the periodic shedding of primary vortices the geometry of catenary shape can be divided into convex part and concave part regarding the flow direction and they may produce profound interference effect in their corresponding wake flow interference effect has been investigated deeply for the wake of the flow past multi cylinders in proximity sumner et al 2000 hu and zhou 2008a bao et al 2011 sumner et al 2000 identified as many as nine wake patterns on the basis of fv flow visualization and piv particle image velocimetry techniques in their experimental investigation of the flow around two staggered circular cylinders hu and zhou 2008a 2008b also characterized four distinct flow structures experimentally from the wake evolution of two staggered circular cylinders at r e 7000 sumner et al 2008 presented the correlation between the strouhal number and the spacing of two staggered circular cylinders a number of numerical simulations including of both two and three dimensional are also dedicated for the fundamental classification of wake patterns mittal et al 1997 akbari and price 2005 thapa et al 2015 generation of axial flow along the span is another key characteristic for the flow around catenary riser early attempts to explore the associated mechanism of axial flow was made on the wake of yawed cylinders hanson 1966 noted that the yaw angle has an effect on the laminar vortex shedding and the critical reynolds number at which vortex shedding initiates hogan and hall 2010 2011 studied the pressure fluctuations of circular cylinders for yawed angles ranging from 60 to 90 at high reynolds number from 2 81 10 4 to 5 61 10 4 they found that the mean flow incidence caused the vortex shedding to become more disorderly and less spanwise coherent the experimental results of two tandem circular cylinders with a yawed downstream cylinder indicated that the wake behind the cylinders behaved as a single large body when the local spacing ratios is small wilkins et al 2013 with increasing of the local spacing ratios some small scale vortices were formed in the gap between the cylinders at the largest local spacing the shedding frequencies were no longer affected by each other younis et al 2016 further investigated the flow past two non parallel tandem cylinders and identified three distinct shedding patterns which were namely of alternating reattachment flow regime bi stable flow regime and co shedding flow regime numerical study on the flow past yawed cylinder was conducted in low reynolds number regimes zhao et al 2009 investigated flow past a yawed cylinder of infinite length with yaw angles ranging from 0 to 60 at r e 1000 by using direct numerical simulation dns approach they reported that the mean drag coefficient agreed well with the independence principle ip lam et al 2012 simulated flow over two tandem yawed and unyawed wavy cylinders at a subcritical reynolds number of 3900 they found that significant beneficial effect on fluctuating force suppression and drag reduction can be achieved at spacing ratios ranging of 1 5 5 5 zhao et al 2013 examined numerically the flow transition in the wake of a circular cylinder at two incidence angles of 0 and 45 it was found that the rms root mean square of the lift coefficient at α 45 is about 20 25 larger than that at α 0 at the reynolds number ranged from 250 to 500 the geometry of a curved body in catenary shape is much more complicated when compared with the yawed straight cylinder in this situation not only the axial flow is generated along the span of the cr but also the flow interference involves the wake dynamics in this paper we investigate the wake characteristics of flow around a stationary long riser whose geometry is shaped with a generalized catenary equation direct numerical simulation by employing high order spectral hp method is carried out for the solution of the incompressible flow in laminar flow regime at low reynolds number of 100 the main objective is to explore how does the angle between the approaching flow and the plane aligned with the curved catenary riser influence the essential features of vortex formation and shedding and further hydrodynamic characteristics of catenary riser apart from the interest from the view of fundamental physics this work can be considered as the first step for study of flexible risers that undergo vortex induced vibrations under the effect of ocean streams and waves 2 physical model and numerical methodology 2 1 physical model the geometric configuration of the cr with circular cross section of diameter d whose axial line is described by the catenary equation in cartesian coordinates as follows 1 y a c o s h x a 1 where a is the catenary coefficient a 10d in this investigation x y denote the incoming flow direction and the vertical direction respectively the non dimensional height of cr is fixed at h d 10 while the distance between the two end points is fixed at g 26 3 d g is the maximum centre to centre spacing of the cr in this investigation the inclination angle α which is defined as the angle between the incoming flow direction and the plane determined by the curved axial line of the cr is varied in the range of 0 90 this means that the cr is aligned with the flow direction at α 0 while it is perpendicular to the flow direction at α 90 the time dependent flow is described by the incompressible naiver stokes equations and the continuity equation as 2 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u 3 u 0 where u is the velocity field p is the pressure r e u d ν is the reynolds number based on the free stream velocity u ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid and d is the diameter of the cr 2 2 numerical methods computations have been performed using a high order spectral h p element time stepping code nektar karniadakis and sherwin 2013 cantwell et al 2015 the spatial domain is discretized into tetrahedral finite elements and within each macro element the high order lagrange polynomials associated with gauss lobatto legendre gll interpolation points are employed as shape and weighting functions which could improve the computational efficiency the temporal discretization on the other hand is based on a high order stiffly stable splitting scheme which allows the primitive variables to be treated independently over each time step miliou et al 2003 the details on the algorithm can refer to karniadakis and sherwin 2013 and karniadakis et al 1991 which are shown in briefly as follows firstly calculate a first intermediate velocity field u evaluating the advection term explicitly and combining it with the solution at previous time steps 4 u q 0 j 1 α q γ 0 u n q δ t q 0 j 1 β q γ 0 u u n q where γ 0 α q and β q are the stiffly stable time integration coefficients which are given by karniadakis et al 1991 j is the order of the time integration for the explicit terms j 2 in this work δ t is the time step secondly solve a poisson equation to obtain the pressure solution at the new time level with a high order boundary conditions 5 δ p n 1 γ 0 δ t u then a second intermediate velocity field u are calculated by 6 u u δ t γ 0 p n 1 finally obtain the velocity field at the new time level by using the second intermediate velocity field as a forcing term in a helmholtz equation 7 δ γ 0 δ t ν u n 1 γ 0 δ t ν u the computational domain is a rectangular box that extends 22 d downstream and 12 d in upstream of the cr 18 d in the vertical direction and 10 d both sides of the cross flow direction as shown in fig 2 the mesh is comprised of tetrahedral elements for the domain discretization the number of tetrahedral element is varied between 84928 α 0 and 105617 α 90 depending on α and the mesh in the near wake region of the cr is finely resolved the perspective and cross sectional views of the mesh for the representative case of α 0 are shown in fig 3 a suitable choice of boundary conditions is essential for the numerical simulation for the cases studied the imposed boundary conditions are listed as follows 1 a uniform velocity profile is specified to the inlet boundary 8 u 1 v 0 w 0 2 the non slip condition is applied at the wall of the cr 9 u 0 v 0 w 0 3 the neumann boundary condition is imposed at the outlet as 10 u x 0 v x 0 w x 0 4 the symmetry boundary condition is specified on the vertical sides 11 u 1 v 0 w 0 5 finally the top boundary condition is assigned as 12 u y 0 v 0 w y 0 besides the pressure was set to zero p 0 this can gives a fully developed zero stress condition in order to avoid reflections from the outlet 2 3 validation test a validation test is conducted at r e 100 for which the geometry configuration of convex shape is the same with that of miliou et al 2007 the 3d wake developed in the flow is visualized by q criterion de villiers 2007 as shown in fig 4 a and b the vortex cores in the near wake are bent according to the curvature of the cylinder but start to distort further downstream showing the same features when compared to the results of miliou et al 2007 fig 4 c depicts the variation of sectional lift coefficient c f y along the non dimensional length s d of the curved cylinder it is also noticed that the profile of c f y is in good agreement with the data given by miliou et al 2007 see fig 4 c and d the time averaged variations of pressure c p along the stagnation line as well as the base line are compared against the results reported in miliou et al 2007 two results collapse well in the same curve lines as depicted in fig 4 e this then verifies the implementation of spectral hp element method for the solution of wake flows of curved cylinder and the polynomial order of p 4 is sufficient for the accuracy of the solution of flow at this low reynolds number 2 4 grid independence as mentioned in subsection 2 3 the polynomial order of p 4 is sufficient for the accuracy of the solution of flow at this low reynolds number however in order to further ensure the accuracy of the numerical results as well as the computational efficiency the grid sensitivity analyses are performed by varying the resolution and the polynomial order p 3 5 for case of α 90 r e 100 in which the wake flow is much energetic table 1 summarizes the results from different meshes for the fixed polynomial order of p 4 with mesh iii being the reference the maximum percentage change of c f y m e a n is reduced from 5 770 to 0 193 while going from mesh ii to mesh iii the value of p is also switched successively at t u d 300 and 385 for the medium mesh as shown in fig 5 table 2 presents the time averaged values of these global quantities a discrepancy of only 0 226 in the magnitude of c f y is noticed when p changes from 4 to 5 thereby it can be concluded that the polynomial order of p 4 with the medium ii is sufficient for the accuracy of the solution of flow at this laminar flow 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 wake topology the wake topology and associated 3d vortical structures of the flow past a cr is visualized by q criterion in fig 6 at small angles of incidence particularly in the range of 0 α 40 the vortex shedding from two half parts of cr are completely suppressed typically fig 6 a presents the perspective view of the vortical structures at α 0 showing stabilized features of steady wake along the whole span of the cr as shown in this figure the wake becomes narrow at the top side of the gap region whilst it becomes wide behind the concave part with formation of a swirling vortex pair in the streamwise direction more importantly the coherent structures aligned with the curved axis of the cr imply that axial flow has great impact on the wake dynamics of the cr the mechanism associated with the wake suppression is essentially similar as that given by miliou et al 2007 they suggested that the strong axial flow and the streamwise vorticity play a key role in suppressing of the wake dynamics similar wake regime can be retained until α over 40 however when α 0 the wake region formed behind the cr is twisted along the length following the inclination of the plane associated with the axial line of the cr fig 6 b shows the instantaneous wake topology at α 40 unlike the flow pattern for the smaller angles of incidence the vortical structures behind the concave part indicates a weak oscillation in the wake flow particularly at the side close to the top boundary this weak oscillation is represented by the formation of array of vortex tubes in vertical direction at the outer sides of the pair of vortex cores in streamwise direction clearly in this situation the swirling vortices in streamwise direction still dominate the wake at the top side of the downstream region however the appearance of vortical structures in vertical direction reveals that the growth of wake instability is started from the concave part of the cr with the increasing of the angle between the incoming flow direction and the plane associated with the curved cr the destabilized portion of the wake region which is characterized by the alternating rolling of vortical structures into the wake is further spread towards the convex part of the cr it can be illustrated in fig 6 c for the case of α 45 showing that the alternating shedding vortex tubes formed in curved configuration starts from the top side of the concave part and terminates around the middle section of the convex part as depicted in fig 6 d for the case of α 50 the region of vortex shedding further occupies the top side of the convex part as α further increases the approaching flow tends to be perpendicular to the plane associated with the cr correspondingly the wake behind the cr becomes more and more energized and unstable until it changes into complete vortex shedding regime along the whole span fig 6 e and f show the evolution of representative 3d vortical tubes for the fully developed vortex shedding regime at α 60 and α 90 respectively as shown in these figures the kármán vortex street in curved shape is generated behind the cr and the associated vortex tubes terminate at the two top sides of the cr the alternating formation of vortex rollers at the two sides appear to be aligned with the plane associated with the cr for the both cases however for the front case the wake intensity is not symmetrically distributed along the span while it is the case for the aft case further insight on the variation of wake features with the inclination angle can be shed from the evolution of the components of vorticities fig 7 shows the contours of the vorticity component in vertical direction ω y on the slices which are distributed along the span of cr the wake oscillation is also firstly detected in fig 7 b and then it spreads along the span from the concave part to the convex part in fig 7 c and d and finally occupies the whole span of the cr in fig 7 e and f in general the change of wake behavior along the span presented in this figure is well consistent with that observed in wake topology in q criterion contours shown in fig 6 for given positions along the span which are located symmetrically with respect to the mid plane at s l 0 5 the corresponding local reynolds numbers are identical however the wake structures presented in fig 6 indicate that the strength of wake is not symmetrically distributed with the mid span except for the case at α 90 this behavior will be further demonstrated in the spectral analysis in the following section thus in the basis of the study of lucor and karniadakis 2003 it is confirmed that the independence principle ip is not valid for the catenary configuration of freely hanging riser considered in this work in essence the flow mechanism for this dynamics is due to the effects of axial flows that strongly depends on specific geometric configurations for instance convex or concave and flow direction to investigate the origin of instabilities we explore how streamwise velocity is varied along the cr fig 8 illustrates the u velocity contours in the vicinity of the cr at y 10 d on the x z plane indicating that wake instability is developed firstly at the top side of the concave part and then gradually spread over the span towards the convex part a variation in the wake width along the span can also be observed additionally it is noticed that the strength of recirculation region amplified with the increase of incoming flow incidence especially at the top side of the concave part strong recirculation promotes absolute instability in the recirculation region which is correlated with the wake instability originated at the top side of the concave part 3 2 sectional forces the temporal evolution of sectional force distribution along the span of the cr is examined in this section fig 9 presents the results of the three components of non dimensionalized sectional forces including c f x c f y and c f z for the cases of α 0 and 30 equation 13 gives the integrated force coefficients of c f x c f y and c f z in three coordinate directions x y and z 13 c f x f x 1 2 ρ u 2 s c f y f y 1 2 ρ u 2 s c f z f z 1 2 ρ u 2 s where ρ is the fluid density f x f y and f z are the components of sectional force acting on the cr and s is the characteristic area i e is the projection area of the riser in the corresponding direction it can be clearly seen that there are no fluctuations in the forces for the both cases which are consistent with the suppressed wake observed in the previous section as shown in fig 9 a c f x decreases along the length of the cr and reaches to the minimum value around the bottom side of the cr and then slightly increases again c f x along the concave part of cr is much smaller when compared to the convex part this behavior is caused by the flow interference effect from the tandem arrangement of the two half parts in contrast c f y decreases consistently along the span of the cr and obtains the minimum around the top side of the concave part this is because the stagnation line is located at the lower side of the convex part and it switches onto the upper side of the concave part moreover c f z is negligible along the whole span at α 0 while its value increases significantly for the case of α 30 the reason is that the frontal area of the cr increases with the increase of incoming flow incidence therefore the force in z direction increases slightly as α increases the time variation of sectional force components along the span of the cr at α 40 45 and 50 are shown in fig 10 nearly time independent forces are observed in fig 10 a b c which then imply that the strength of wake oscillation detected in the vortical structures behind the top side of the concave part is too weak see fig 6 b however it is intensified strongly for the cases of α 45 and 50 which are clearly verified by the visible fluctuation of c f y and c f z it is also confirmed from the distribution of force fluctuations along the span that the wake oscillation is started from the concave part s l 0 5 and then spread towards the convex part s l 0 5 with the increasing of the inclination angle the value of c f x within the bottom section increases significantly the components of sectional force along the span of cr at α 60 and 90 as typical instances for the fully developed vortex shedding regime are depicted in fig 11 c f x reaches to a higher value in the range from 0 93 to 1 32 at α 60 and from 1 13 to 1 39 at α 90 which is larger than that obtained at smaller α as compared with the case of α 50 fig 10 h the fluctuation in c f y is also further amplified when α 60 as shown in fig 11 b for the case of α 90 the hydroforces along the span behaves symmetrically with respect to the mid section s l 0 5 the oscillation of c f y reaches the maximum at the mid plane it is also noticed that the peak to peak amplitude of c f y is ranged from 0 48 and 0 23 at the mid plane s l 0 5 the reason for the different magnitudes of crest and trough can be attributed to the unequal strength of shedding vortices generated at the two sides due to the curved configuration apparently the fluctuation of c f z is maximized at the two inclined sides of the cr as shown in fig 11 f whose peak to peak amplitude is ranged from 0 55 to 0 55 3 3 pressure along the axial line fig 12 presents the pressure contours on the plane associated with the axial line of the cr for the case of α 0 the pressure contours shown in fig 13 a represents the distribution along the stagnation and base lines of the cr since the incoming flow is parallel to the plane of the axial line a positive value is detected both on the stagnation face of the convex and concave parts while it changes into negative along the base line of the two parts a significant variation of pressure contours is displayed as α increases the pressure coefficients show consistently negative values along the whole span of cr and their magnitude increases with the increase of α another interesting feature displayed in this figure is relevant to the generation of axial flow it can be witnessed from the comparison of the different cases that the pressure gradient along the span is highly correlated to the inclination angle the pressure gradient along the axial line is significant for the case of α 0 while it is nearly negligible for the case of α 90 more importantly the decrease of magnitude of pressure gradient is also started from the concave part and then it spread over the span towards the convex part this behaves highly consistent with the wake features discussed in the previous section therefore it is then suggested that the variation of the axial flow along the span of cr is the prominent mechanism responsible for the variation of the wake dynamics along the span for different inclination angles 3 4 spectral analysis the horizontal velocities are sampled along the span of cr and are used to investigate the frequency response characteristics of the wake using the power spectra density function which is expressed by 14 φ f w f w f t where 15 w f t 2 t 2 w t e 2 π f t d t φ is the power spectra w is the horizontal velocity in z direction t is the block length f is the frequency and represents the complex conjugate the power spectral densities obtained at different locations along the span are shown in figs 13 16 respectively for α 45 90 when the cr is inclined at α 45 there is a pronounced peak in the power spectra density which is associated with the shedding frequency at s t 0 130 implying that the shedding wake of the cr is organized and associated with a dominant frequency it is also noticed that the value of φ varies along the spanwise location of the cr the magnitude of the spectra on the concave part are several orders higher than those observed from the symmetric location of the convex part with respect to the mid plane this observation also verifies that the wake oscillation at the concave part is much stronger when compared to the convex part and their strength monotonically increases along the span of cr moreover the second harmonics of shedding frequency which is equal to 0 260 are also slightly discernible for this case as shown in fig 13 as the inclination angle increases to the range of α 50 60 the frequency components present different characteristics as shown in figs 14 and 15 for the cases at α 50 and α 60 the power spectral density have a dominant peak associated with the strouhal number respectively of s t 0 135 and 0 147 higher than that for the case at α 45 higher harmonics are also excited in the power spectral density the harmonic frequency components in the wake of multiple cylinders in close proximity were reported previously in the literature kiya et al 1980 sumner et al 2000 hu and zhou 2008a hu and zhou 2008b bao et al 2012 the peak associated with the second harmonic becomes comparable to the primary peak at the bottom side of the cr the studies on the wake of multi cylinders implies that the flow mechanism underlying the current frequency competence might be correlated to the flow interference effects between the adjacent parts of cr as shown in fig 16 when the angle of incidence increases to α 90 the primary frequency corresponding to the vortex shedding period increases to a value as high as s t 0 160 which is very close to the shedding frequency of straight cylinder at the same reynolds number williamson 1996 han et al 2013 the wake is mainly dominated by the primary shedding frequency which are much different from the previous cases although multiple harmonics are still detected in the power spectral density as depicted in fig 16 the variation of magnitude of the power spectral density for the dominant frequency along the length of cr indicates that the strength of shedding vortices is minimized at the bottom side of the cr 4 conclusions in this study wake characteristics of three dimensional flow past a freely hanging stationary riser in catenary shape are investigated at a low reynolds number of 100 the catenary configuration defined by equation 1 is inclined with the incoming flow direction which is quantified by the angle between the incoming flow direction and the plane aligned with the curved axial line of the catenary riser the flow dynamics are governed by the incompressible navier stokes equations and a high order spectral hp element method is employed for their numerical solutions in the basis of the numerical results the wake behind the catenary riser can be categorized into different regimes depending on the inclination angle with respect to the incoming flow in the range of smaller incoming flow incidence 0 α 40 the wake is completely suppressed showing stabilized features of steady wake along the whole span of the cr as a consequence the components of sectional force appear to be time independent their distribution along the span of the cr is primarily correlated with the axial flow effect along the pan of the convex part and the concave part of cr as the flow incidence increases in the range of 40 α 50 the wake is partially destabilized which is started from the concave part and then gradually spread towards the convex part of catenary riser with increasing of incoming flow incidence correspondingly the fluctuation of sectional force components especially in the vertical and crossflow directions is also detected in the concave part firstly and then develops in the same manner with the wake oscillation with the increasing of the inclination angle higher harmonics of frequency components and their influence become dominant in the unstable wake evolutions as demonstrated in the power spectral analysis for the cases at α 50 and 60 the vortex shedding wake is fully developed along the whole span of the cr when α 50 which is characterized by a formation of kármán vortex street comprised of curved vortex tubes alternating shedding at the two sides of the catenary riser the sectional force components therefore present oscillatory nature of the unstable wake along the whole span with the further increase of inclinations the shedding frequency is close to that of a straight cylinder at the same r e at α 90 the incoming flow is perpendicular with the plane of cr and both the wake topology and hydro force distribution are symmetric with respect to the mid plane at s l 0 5 the pressure distribution along the span of cr reveals that the axial flow is greatly affected by the inclination angle in specific the corresponding pressure gradient varies along the span and it starts to decrease from the concave part and then spread to the convex part with the increasing inclination furthermore this is the prominent mechanism for the variation of wake behavior of the cr for different inclinations a few recent studies revealed the effect of reynolds number on the flow over a curved body miliou et al 2007 studied the nature of flow past a curved cylinder both in laminar and transitional regimes corresponding to r e 100 and r e 500 more recently a fully developed turbulent flow around a curved cylinder at r e 3900 was numerically explored in gallardo et al 2014 from the literature mentioned above it is reasonable to expect that the wake features are also highly dependent on reynolds number for the current geometry configuration this is actually verified in a preliminary study conducted on the case of α 0 at r e 500 vortex shedding with highly three dimensionality was observed in the wake at r e 500 not shown here whereas it is stabilized into a steady wake at r e 100 in addition the dynamic behaviors of wake were shown to be much complicated owing to the interactions between the convex and concave segments for this reason it is necessary to carry out further research on high reynolds number flow it is believed that this work will serve as a first step to further investigate the complicated wake in turbulent flow and even vortex induced vibration of flexible risers of such complex

23091,in this paper we numerically investigate three dimensional flow past a freely hanging stationary riser in catenary shape referred to cr with the angle of incoming flow direction with respect to the plane aligned with the cr ranging from α 0 90 at a low reynolds number of 100 the flow dynamics are governed by the incompressible navier stokes equations and a high order spectral hp element method is employed for the solutions of the flow field the numerical results present that the wake topology behind the cr is strongly influenced by the incoming flow direction in particular in the range of small angle of incoming flow direction 0 α 40 the wake is completely suppressed in the medium range of 40 α 50 vortex shedding is developed firstly at the top side of the concave part and then gradually spread over the span towards the convex part wake instability is developed sufficiently along the whole span when the flow incidence is over 50 the wake dynamics is further explored by examining the temporal evolution of hydro forces and field quantities along the span and their frequency characteristics it is revealed that the mechanism of axial flow that is varied along the span of cr can explain hydro dynamics of the wake behavior of the cr keywords catenary riser wake topology hydro forces vortex shedding frequency spectral hp element method 1 introduction highly flexible risers such as steel catenary risers are widely deployed for deep water drilling industry to convey oil from the seabed to the sea surface since it can offer a low cost alternative to conventionally used rigid risers on floating platforms and can also provide economic riser design solutions for fixed platforms for such type of risers it is commonly practical to incorporate a buoyant portion on an intermediate section of the riser or an upward force at a point via a buoy this leads the riser in standard configurations of lazy wave steep wave lazy s and steep s as shown in fig 1 according to whether the riser rests along the sea bed and the means by which the buoyancy is achieved by yong and qiang 2005 in terms of simplest modeling a freely hanging configuration can be considered as a catenary riser cr in contrast to conventional straight riser the angle of the axis of catenary geometry with respect to incoming flow direction varies along the curved span and it has great influence on the surrounding flow behavior this can be expected from a few studies on flow past a deformed body that were carried out recently taking into account of the inclination effect on the wake dynamics miliou et al 2003 2007 gallardo et al 2011 2013 2014 considering as a prototype of cr miliou et al 2003 2007 studied the wake structures behind a curved cylinder whose centerline is a quarter section of a ring their investigation showed that there were two completely different phenomena when the flow was applied onto the convex shaped model and the concave shaped model in the convex configuration case a fully three dimensional vortex shedding was observed at r e 100 and r e 500 for the concave configuration the vortex shedding was completely suppressed at r e 100 but at r e 500 the wake is energized with vortex shedding in particular at the top side of the riser gallardo et al 2011 2013 2014 numerically investigated the turbulent wake of the same configuration but in the turbulent regime r e 3900 it was found that the turbulent wake structures behind the upper side of the convex configuration were more coherent due to the periodic shedding of primary vortices the geometry of catenary shape can be divided into convex part and concave part regarding the flow direction and they may produce profound interference effect in their corresponding wake flow interference effect has been investigated deeply for the wake of the flow past multi cylinders in proximity sumner et al 2000 hu and zhou 2008a bao et al 2011 sumner et al 2000 identified as many as nine wake patterns on the basis of fv flow visualization and piv particle image velocimetry techniques in their experimental investigation of the flow around two staggered circular cylinders hu and zhou 2008a 2008b also characterized four distinct flow structures experimentally from the wake evolution of two staggered circular cylinders at r e 7000 sumner et al 2008 presented the correlation between the strouhal number and the spacing of two staggered circular cylinders a number of numerical simulations including of both two and three dimensional are also dedicated for the fundamental classification of wake patterns mittal et al 1997 akbari and price 2005 thapa et al 2015 generation of axial flow along the span is another key characteristic for the flow around catenary riser early attempts to explore the associated mechanism of axial flow was made on the wake of yawed cylinders hanson 1966 noted that the yaw angle has an effect on the laminar vortex shedding and the critical reynolds number at which vortex shedding initiates hogan and hall 2010 2011 studied the pressure fluctuations of circular cylinders for yawed angles ranging from 60 to 90 at high reynolds number from 2 81 10 4 to 5 61 10 4 they found that the mean flow incidence caused the vortex shedding to become more disorderly and less spanwise coherent the experimental results of two tandem circular cylinders with a yawed downstream cylinder indicated that the wake behind the cylinders behaved as a single large body when the local spacing ratios is small wilkins et al 2013 with increasing of the local spacing ratios some small scale vortices were formed in the gap between the cylinders at the largest local spacing the shedding frequencies were no longer affected by each other younis et al 2016 further investigated the flow past two non parallel tandem cylinders and identified three distinct shedding patterns which were namely of alternating reattachment flow regime bi stable flow regime and co shedding flow regime numerical study on the flow past yawed cylinder was conducted in low reynolds number regimes zhao et al 2009 investigated flow past a yawed cylinder of infinite length with yaw angles ranging from 0 to 60 at r e 1000 by using direct numerical simulation dns approach they reported that the mean drag coefficient agreed well with the independence principle ip lam et al 2012 simulated flow over two tandem yawed and unyawed wavy cylinders at a subcritical reynolds number of 3900 they found that significant beneficial effect on fluctuating force suppression and drag reduction can be achieved at spacing ratios ranging of 1 5 5 5 zhao et al 2013 examined numerically the flow transition in the wake of a circular cylinder at two incidence angles of 0 and 45 it was found that the rms root mean square of the lift coefficient at α 45 is about 20 25 larger than that at α 0 at the reynolds number ranged from 250 to 500 the geometry of a curved body in catenary shape is much more complicated when compared with the yawed straight cylinder in this situation not only the axial flow is generated along the span of the cr but also the flow interference involves the wake dynamics in this paper we investigate the wake characteristics of flow around a stationary long riser whose geometry is shaped with a generalized catenary equation direct numerical simulation by employing high order spectral hp method is carried out for the solution of the incompressible flow in laminar flow regime at low reynolds number of 100 the main objective is to explore how does the angle between the approaching flow and the plane aligned with the curved catenary riser influence the essential features of vortex formation and shedding and further hydrodynamic characteristics of catenary riser apart from the interest from the view of fundamental physics this work can be considered as the first step for study of flexible risers that undergo vortex induced vibrations under the effect of ocean streams and waves 2 physical model and numerical methodology 2 1 physical model the geometric configuration of the cr with circular cross section of diameter d whose axial line is described by the catenary equation in cartesian coordinates as follows 1 y a c o s h x a 1 where a is the catenary coefficient a 10d in this investigation x y denote the incoming flow direction and the vertical direction respectively the non dimensional height of cr is fixed at h d 10 while the distance between the two end points is fixed at g 26 3 d g is the maximum centre to centre spacing of the cr in this investigation the inclination angle α which is defined as the angle between the incoming flow direction and the plane determined by the curved axial line of the cr is varied in the range of 0 90 this means that the cr is aligned with the flow direction at α 0 while it is perpendicular to the flow direction at α 90 the time dependent flow is described by the incompressible naiver stokes equations and the continuity equation as 2 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u 3 u 0 where u is the velocity field p is the pressure r e u d ν is the reynolds number based on the free stream velocity u ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid and d is the diameter of the cr 2 2 numerical methods computations have been performed using a high order spectral h p element time stepping code nektar karniadakis and sherwin 2013 cantwell et al 2015 the spatial domain is discretized into tetrahedral finite elements and within each macro element the high order lagrange polynomials associated with gauss lobatto legendre gll interpolation points are employed as shape and weighting functions which could improve the computational efficiency the temporal discretization on the other hand is based on a high order stiffly stable splitting scheme which allows the primitive variables to be treated independently over each time step miliou et al 2003 the details on the algorithm can refer to karniadakis and sherwin 2013 and karniadakis et al 1991 which are shown in briefly as follows firstly calculate a first intermediate velocity field u evaluating the advection term explicitly and combining it with the solution at previous time steps 4 u q 0 j 1 α q γ 0 u n q δ t q 0 j 1 β q γ 0 u u n q where γ 0 α q and β q are the stiffly stable time integration coefficients which are given by karniadakis et al 1991 j is the order of the time integration for the explicit terms j 2 in this work δ t is the time step secondly solve a poisson equation to obtain the pressure solution at the new time level with a high order boundary conditions 5 δ p n 1 γ 0 δ t u then a second intermediate velocity field u are calculated by 6 u u δ t γ 0 p n 1 finally obtain the velocity field at the new time level by using the second intermediate velocity field as a forcing term in a helmholtz equation 7 δ γ 0 δ t ν u n 1 γ 0 δ t ν u the computational domain is a rectangular box that extends 22 d downstream and 12 d in upstream of the cr 18 d in the vertical direction and 10 d both sides of the cross flow direction as shown in fig 2 the mesh is comprised of tetrahedral elements for the domain discretization the number of tetrahedral element is varied between 84928 α 0 and 105617 α 90 depending on α and the mesh in the near wake region of the cr is finely resolved the perspective and cross sectional views of the mesh for the representative case of α 0 are shown in fig 3 a suitable choice of boundary conditions is essential for the numerical simulation for the cases studied the imposed boundary conditions are listed as follows 1 a uniform velocity profile is specified to the inlet boundary 8 u 1 v 0 w 0 2 the non slip condition is applied at the wall of the cr 9 u 0 v 0 w 0 3 the neumann boundary condition is imposed at the outlet as 10 u x 0 v x 0 w x 0 4 the symmetry boundary condition is specified on the vertical sides 11 u 1 v 0 w 0 5 finally the top boundary condition is assigned as 12 u y 0 v 0 w y 0 besides the pressure was set to zero p 0 this can gives a fully developed zero stress condition in order to avoid reflections from the outlet 2 3 validation test a validation test is conducted at r e 100 for which the geometry configuration of convex shape is the same with that of miliou et al 2007 the 3d wake developed in the flow is visualized by q criterion de villiers 2007 as shown in fig 4 a and b the vortex cores in the near wake are bent according to the curvature of the cylinder but start to distort further downstream showing the same features when compared to the results of miliou et al 2007 fig 4 c depicts the variation of sectional lift coefficient c f y along the non dimensional length s d of the curved cylinder it is also noticed that the profile of c f y is in good agreement with the data given by miliou et al 2007 see fig 4 c and d the time averaged variations of pressure c p along the stagnation line as well as the base line are compared against the results reported in miliou et al 2007 two results collapse well in the same curve lines as depicted in fig 4 e this then verifies the implementation of spectral hp element method for the solution of wake flows of curved cylinder and the polynomial order of p 4 is sufficient for the accuracy of the solution of flow at this low reynolds number 2 4 grid independence as mentioned in subsection 2 3 the polynomial order of p 4 is sufficient for the accuracy of the solution of flow at this low reynolds number however in order to further ensure the accuracy of the numerical results as well as the computational efficiency the grid sensitivity analyses are performed by varying the resolution and the polynomial order p 3 5 for case of α 90 r e 100 in which the wake flow is much energetic table 1 summarizes the results from different meshes for the fixed polynomial order of p 4 with mesh iii being the reference the maximum percentage change of c f y m e a n is reduced from 5 770 to 0 193 while going from mesh ii to mesh iii the value of p is also switched successively at t u d 300 and 385 for the medium mesh as shown in fig 5 table 2 presents the time averaged values of these global quantities a discrepancy of only 0 226 in the magnitude of c f y is noticed when p changes from 4 to 5 thereby it can be concluded that the polynomial order of p 4 with the medium ii is sufficient for the accuracy of the solution of flow at this laminar flow 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 wake topology the wake topology and associated 3d vortical structures of the flow past a cr is visualized by q criterion in fig 6 at small angles of incidence particularly in the range of 0 α 40 the vortex shedding from two half parts of cr are completely suppressed typically fig 6 a presents the perspective view of the vortical structures at α 0 showing stabilized features of steady wake along the whole span of the cr as shown in this figure the wake becomes narrow at the top side of the gap region whilst it becomes wide behind the concave part with formation of a swirling vortex pair in the streamwise direction more importantly the coherent structures aligned with the curved axis of the cr imply that axial flow has great impact on the wake dynamics of the cr the mechanism associated with the wake suppression is essentially similar as that given by miliou et al 2007 they suggested that the strong axial flow and the streamwise vorticity play a key role in suppressing of the wake dynamics similar wake regime can be retained until α over 40 however when α 0 the wake region formed behind the cr is twisted along the length following the inclination of the plane associated with the axial line of the cr fig 6 b shows the instantaneous wake topology at α 40 unlike the flow pattern for the smaller angles of incidence the vortical structures behind the concave part indicates a weak oscillation in the wake flow particularly at the side close to the top boundary this weak oscillation is represented by the formation of array of vortex tubes in vertical direction at the outer sides of the pair of vortex cores in streamwise direction clearly in this situation the swirling vortices in streamwise direction still dominate the wake at the top side of the downstream region however the appearance of vortical structures in vertical direction reveals that the growth of wake instability is started from the concave part of the cr with the increasing of the angle between the incoming flow direction and the plane associated with the curved cr the destabilized portion of the wake region which is characterized by the alternating rolling of vortical structures into the wake is further spread towards the convex part of the cr it can be illustrated in fig 6 c for the case of α 45 showing that the alternating shedding vortex tubes formed in curved configuration starts from the top side of the concave part and terminates around the middle section of the convex part as depicted in fig 6 d for the case of α 50 the region of vortex shedding further occupies the top side of the convex part as α further increases the approaching flow tends to be perpendicular to the plane associated with the cr correspondingly the wake behind the cr becomes more and more energized and unstable until it changes into complete vortex shedding regime along the whole span fig 6 e and f show the evolution of representative 3d vortical tubes for the fully developed vortex shedding regime at α 60 and α 90 respectively as shown in these figures the kármán vortex street in curved shape is generated behind the cr and the associated vortex tubes terminate at the two top sides of the cr the alternating formation of vortex rollers at the two sides appear to be aligned with the plane associated with the cr for the both cases however for the front case the wake intensity is not symmetrically distributed along the span while it is the case for the aft case further insight on the variation of wake features with the inclination angle can be shed from the evolution of the components of vorticities fig 7 shows the contours of the vorticity component in vertical direction ω y on the slices which are distributed along the span of cr the wake oscillation is also firstly detected in fig 7 b and then it spreads along the span from the concave part to the convex part in fig 7 c and d and finally occupies the whole span of the cr in fig 7 e and f in general the change of wake behavior along the span presented in this figure is well consistent with that observed in wake topology in q criterion contours shown in fig 6 for given positions along the span which are located symmetrically with respect to the mid plane at s l 0 5 the corresponding local reynolds numbers are identical however the wake structures presented in fig 6 indicate that the strength of wake is not symmetrically distributed with the mid span except for the case at α 90 this behavior will be further demonstrated in the spectral analysis in the following section thus in the basis of the study of lucor and karniadakis 2003 it is confirmed that the independence principle ip is not valid for the catenary configuration of freely hanging riser considered in this work in essence the flow mechanism for this dynamics is due to the effects of axial flows that strongly depends on specific geometric configurations for instance convex or concave and flow direction to investigate the origin of instabilities we explore how streamwise velocity is varied along the cr fig 8 illustrates the u velocity contours in the vicinity of the cr at y 10 d on the x z plane indicating that wake instability is developed firstly at the top side of the concave part and then gradually spread over the span towards the convex part a variation in the wake width along the span can also be observed additionally it is noticed that the strength of recirculation region amplified with the increase of incoming flow incidence especially at the top side of the concave part strong recirculation promotes absolute instability in the recirculation region which is correlated with the wake instability originated at the top side of the concave part 3 2 sectional forces the temporal evolution of sectional force distribution along the span of the cr is examined in this section fig 9 presents the results of the three components of non dimensionalized sectional forces including c f x c f y and c f z for the cases of α 0 and 30 equation 13 gives the integrated force coefficients of c f x c f y and c f z in three coordinate directions x y and z 13 c f x f x 1 2 ρ u 2 s c f y f y 1 2 ρ u 2 s c f z f z 1 2 ρ u 2 s where ρ is the fluid density f x f y and f z are the components of sectional force acting on the cr and s is the characteristic area i e is the projection area of the riser in the corresponding direction it can be clearly seen that there are no fluctuations in the forces for the both cases which are consistent with the suppressed wake observed in the previous section as shown in fig 9 a c f x decreases along the length of the cr and reaches to the minimum value around the bottom side of the cr and then slightly increases again c f x along the concave part of cr is much smaller when compared to the convex part this behavior is caused by the flow interference effect from the tandem arrangement of the two half parts in contrast c f y decreases consistently along the span of the cr and obtains the minimum around the top side of the concave part this is because the stagnation line is located at the lower side of the convex part and it switches onto the upper side of the concave part moreover c f z is negligible along the whole span at α 0 while its value increases significantly for the case of α 30 the reason is that the frontal area of the cr increases with the increase of incoming flow incidence therefore the force in z direction increases slightly as α increases the time variation of sectional force components along the span of the cr at α 40 45 and 50 are shown in fig 10 nearly time independent forces are observed in fig 10 a b c which then imply that the strength of wake oscillation detected in the vortical structures behind the top side of the concave part is too weak see fig 6 b however it is intensified strongly for the cases of α 45 and 50 which are clearly verified by the visible fluctuation of c f y and c f z it is also confirmed from the distribution of force fluctuations along the span that the wake oscillation is started from the concave part s l 0 5 and then spread towards the convex part s l 0 5 with the increasing of the inclination angle the value of c f x within the bottom section increases significantly the components of sectional force along the span of cr at α 60 and 90 as typical instances for the fully developed vortex shedding regime are depicted in fig 11 c f x reaches to a higher value in the range from 0 93 to 1 32 at α 60 and from 1 13 to 1 39 at α 90 which is larger than that obtained at smaller α as compared with the case of α 50 fig 10 h the fluctuation in c f y is also further amplified when α 60 as shown in fig 11 b for the case of α 90 the hydroforces along the span behaves symmetrically with respect to the mid section s l 0 5 the oscillation of c f y reaches the maximum at the mid plane it is also noticed that the peak to peak amplitude of c f y is ranged from 0 48 and 0 23 at the mid plane s l 0 5 the reason for the different magnitudes of crest and trough can be attributed to the unequal strength of shedding vortices generated at the two sides due to the curved configuration apparently the fluctuation of c f z is maximized at the two inclined sides of the cr as shown in fig 11 f whose peak to peak amplitude is ranged from 0 55 to 0 55 3 3 pressure along the axial line fig 12 presents the pressure contours on the plane associated with the axial line of the cr for the case of α 0 the pressure contours shown in fig 13 a represents the distribution along the stagnation and base lines of the cr since the incoming flow is parallel to the plane of the axial line a positive value is detected both on the stagnation face of the convex and concave parts while it changes into negative along the base line of the two parts a significant variation of pressure contours is displayed as α increases the pressure coefficients show consistently negative values along the whole span of cr and their magnitude increases with the increase of α another interesting feature displayed in this figure is relevant to the generation of axial flow it can be witnessed from the comparison of the different cases that the pressure gradient along the span is highly correlated to the inclination angle the pressure gradient along the axial line is significant for the case of α 0 while it is nearly negligible for the case of α 90 more importantly the decrease of magnitude of pressure gradient is also started from the concave part and then it spread over the span towards the convex part this behaves highly consistent with the wake features discussed in the previous section therefore it is then suggested that the variation of the axial flow along the span of cr is the prominent mechanism responsible for the variation of the wake dynamics along the span for different inclination angles 3 4 spectral analysis the horizontal velocities are sampled along the span of cr and are used to investigate the frequency response characteristics of the wake using the power spectra density function which is expressed by 14 φ f w f w f t where 15 w f t 2 t 2 w t e 2 π f t d t φ is the power spectra w is the horizontal velocity in z direction t is the block length f is the frequency and represents the complex conjugate the power spectral densities obtained at different locations along the span are shown in figs 13 16 respectively for α 45 90 when the cr is inclined at α 45 there is a pronounced peak in the power spectra density which is associated with the shedding frequency at s t 0 130 implying that the shedding wake of the cr is organized and associated with a dominant frequency it is also noticed that the value of φ varies along the spanwise location of the cr the magnitude of the spectra on the concave part are several orders higher than those observed from the symmetric location of the convex part with respect to the mid plane this observation also verifies that the wake oscillation at the concave part is much stronger when compared to the convex part and their strength monotonically increases along the span of cr moreover the second harmonics of shedding frequency which is equal to 0 260 are also slightly discernible for this case as shown in fig 13 as the inclination angle increases to the range of α 50 60 the frequency components present different characteristics as shown in figs 14 and 15 for the cases at α 50 and α 60 the power spectral density have a dominant peak associated with the strouhal number respectively of s t 0 135 and 0 147 higher than that for the case at α 45 higher harmonics are also excited in the power spectral density the harmonic frequency components in the wake of multiple cylinders in close proximity were reported previously in the literature kiya et al 1980 sumner et al 2000 hu and zhou 2008a hu and zhou 2008b bao et al 2012 the peak associated with the second harmonic becomes comparable to the primary peak at the bottom side of the cr the studies on the wake of multi cylinders implies that the flow mechanism underlying the current frequency competence might be correlated to the flow interference effects between the adjacent parts of cr as shown in fig 16 when the angle of incidence increases to α 90 the primary frequency corresponding to the vortex shedding period increases to a value as high as s t 0 160 which is very close to the shedding frequency of straight cylinder at the same reynolds number williamson 1996 han et al 2013 the wake is mainly dominated by the primary shedding frequency which are much different from the previous cases although multiple harmonics are still detected in the power spectral density as depicted in fig 16 the variation of magnitude of the power spectral density for the dominant frequency along the length of cr indicates that the strength of shedding vortices is minimized at the bottom side of the cr 4 conclusions in this study wake characteristics of three dimensional flow past a freely hanging stationary riser in catenary shape are investigated at a low reynolds number of 100 the catenary configuration defined by equation 1 is inclined with the incoming flow direction which is quantified by the angle between the incoming flow direction and the plane aligned with the curved axial line of the catenary riser the flow dynamics are governed by the incompressible navier stokes equations and a high order spectral hp element method is employed for their numerical solutions in the basis of the numerical results the wake behind the catenary riser can be categorized into different regimes depending on the inclination angle with respect to the incoming flow in the range of smaller incoming flow incidence 0 α 40 the wake is completely suppressed showing stabilized features of steady wake along the whole span of the cr as a consequence the components of sectional force appear to be time independent their distribution along the span of the cr is primarily correlated with the axial flow effect along the pan of the convex part and the concave part of cr as the flow incidence increases in the range of 40 α 50 the wake is partially destabilized which is started from the concave part and then gradually spread towards the convex part of catenary riser with increasing of incoming flow incidence correspondingly the fluctuation of sectional force components especially in the vertical and crossflow directions is also detected in the concave part firstly and then develops in the same manner with the wake oscillation with the increasing of the inclination angle higher harmonics of frequency components and their influence become dominant in the unstable wake evolutions as demonstrated in the power spectral analysis for the cases at α 50 and 60 the vortex shedding wake is fully developed along the whole span of the cr when α 50 which is characterized by a formation of kármán vortex street comprised of curved vortex tubes alternating shedding at the two sides of the catenary riser the sectional force components therefore present oscillatory nature of the unstable wake along the whole span with the further increase of inclinations the shedding frequency is close to that of a straight cylinder at the same r e at α 90 the incoming flow is perpendicular with the plane of cr and both the wake topology and hydro force distribution are symmetric with respect to the mid plane at s l 0 5 the pressure distribution along the span of cr reveals that the axial flow is greatly affected by the inclination angle in specific the corresponding pressure gradient varies along the span and it starts to decrease from the concave part and then spread to the convex part with the increasing inclination furthermore this is the prominent mechanism for the variation of wake behavior of the cr for different inclinations a few recent studies revealed the effect of reynolds number on the flow over a curved body miliou et al 2007 studied the nature of flow past a curved cylinder both in laminar and transitional regimes corresponding to r e 100 and r e 500 more recently a fully developed turbulent flow around a curved cylinder at r e 3900 was numerically explored in gallardo et al 2014 from the literature mentioned above it is reasonable to expect that the wake features are also highly dependent on reynolds number for the current geometry configuration this is actually verified in a preliminary study conducted on the case of α 0 at r e 500 vortex shedding with highly three dimensionality was observed in the wake at r e 500 not shown here whereas it is stabilized into a steady wake at r e 100 in addition the dynamic behaviors of wake were shown to be much complicated owing to the interactions between the convex and concave segments for this reason it is necessary to carry out further research on high reynolds number flow it is believed that this work will serve as a first step to further investigate the complicated wake in turbulent flow and even vortex induced vibration of flexible risers of such complex

23092,biofilm represents a non uniform distribution of flexible microorganisms over a surface with variable density and height it can be modified and displaced due to the flow therefore the modelling of the flow and the assessment of resistance for surfaces covered with biofilm are problematic presently there is no generally accepted method for the evaluation of the effects of a given biofilm on the resistance within this paper roughness function models for surfaces covered with diatomaceous biofilm are established utilizing the experimental data presented in the literature these roughness function models are then implemented within the wall function of the commercial software package star ccm numerical simulations of the rough plates in the turbulent channel flow are performed and the results are verified and validated against the experimentally obtained results presented in the literature utilizing the roughness length scale proposed in the literature and the proposed roughness function models the effects of the biofilm on the resistance of any arbitrary body can be assessed using only roughness measurements finally the increase in the frictional resistance and effective power due to the presence of the biofilm is determined using the validated roughness function models keywords biofilm cfd roughness function model frictional resistance full scale ship 1 introduction biofouling is the accumulation of microorganisms plants algae or animals on wetted surfaces it represents a growing problem from both the economic and environmental point of view even though it occurs in many different fields shipping industry is the most affected by the settlement and the growth of biofouling organisms ship hull roughness is increased because of presence of biofouling organisms thus frictional resistance is increased which results in increased fuel consumption decreased ship speed and increased engine stress bixler and bhusan 2012 schultz et al 2011 have pointed out that all costs related to the development procurement and application as well as relatively costly technical or management solutions for antifouling of ships are economically justified if they only slightly improve the fouling condition of a hull the authors have estimated the overall costs related with fouling of the mid sized naval surface ship to be around 1 million usd per year another problem related to ship biofouling is spreading of species across the world seas and consequently disruption and change of existing biological systems davidson et al 2016 the settlement of fouling organisms on the wetted surface occurs in three stages i e formation of a conditioning film microfouling and macrofouling microfouling can be divided into two stages the first stage of microfouling is formed from the mixture of the conditioning film and the slime of living and dead bacteria cells while the secondary stage is formed when diatoms colonies macroalgae and protozoa spores settlement increases nurioglu et al 2015 larger fouling organisms i e macrofouling such as algae and tubeworms will settle earlier on the wetted surface covered with biofilm than on the unfouled wetted surface van mooy et al 2014 prevention of biofouling using the coating technology has been applied to ships since ancient times but the real revolution of antifouling coatings started when new synthetic petroleum based resins were developed in the 1940s these resins have enabled the development of polymer based coatings with better mechanical properties in the 1950s antifouling coatings based on tributyltin tbt were developed and it was considered that the problem of biofouling was resolved however because of significant environmental concerns tbt coatings were banned worldwide in 2008 therefore a coating technology has been focused nowadays on the finding of the alternative antifouling agents and different antifouling strategies thus nowadays there are two main approaches i e biocide release and non biocide release antifouling coatings nurioglu et al 2015 the latter ones represent coatings which are designed to reduce or prevent the adhesion of fouling organisms fouling release fr coatings are used on ships which sail often and at higher speeds it should be noted that biofouling is dependent on many different parameters and prediction how long will antifouling coating successfully prevent fouling has remained elusive van mooy et al 2014 lately the international maritime organization imo has implemented several regulations to decrease harmful gases emission in the shipping industry the fuel consumption thus has to be reduced not only from shipowner s point of view but from both environmental and legislative point of view as well farkas et al 2018 as said before since biofouling cause the increase in the resistance of the ship and affects the propulsion of the ship it is very important to determine the effects of biofouling on resistance and propulsion characteristics the importance of the assessment of these effects was also recognized by the international towing tank conference ittc thus ittc has recommended a development of a new formulae or methods based on the experimental data for this problem ittc 2011a concept of the roughness function was proposed independently by clauser and hama and they defined it as a downward shift of the mean velocity profile in the log law wall similarity hypothesis assumes that roughness effects are limited to inner layer thus velocity defect profiles for rough and smooth surface become a same in the outer layer this hypothesis is very important and it is mainly used in the assessment of roughness effects nowadays flack and schultz 2014 when roughness functions δ u are determined experimentally for certain surface conditions the effects of these surface conditions on the resistance of any arbitrary body can be assessed either through a similarity law analysis or a boundary layer code schultz and myers 2003 in order to obtain dynamically similar conditions during the experimental determination of δ u in the channel or in the towing tank and on the ship the same roughness reynolds number k should be obtained also fouling organisms or any other kind of roughness must be within the inner layer for the flow both in channel and towing tank and for the flow around ship in order the wall similarity hypothesis to be valid schultz et al 2003 the roughness functions can be described as the differences between the velocity profile of the smooth and rough surfaces within numerical simulations of viscous flow the user has to define a roughness function model which is dependent on k k is defined as a function of the roughness length scale or equivalent sand grain roughness k s which is selected in that way that the δ u values correspond to a predefined δ u model and that the observed behaviours are still deemed appropriate relative to each other therefore in order to assess the hydrodynamic impact of a specified biofouling load on a ship or other marine structure roughness length scale for the surface condition has to be determined since this surface property is not directly measurable ultimate objective of roughness research is to determine relation between roughness length scale and some easily measured surface properties monty et al 2016 schultz et al 2015 have measured frictional resistance for fr hull coatings for four different conditions based on the obtained results the authors proposed a new effective roughness length scale for biofilms demirel et al 2017a have performed a series of towing tank measurements of flat plates covered with artificial barnacles in order to determine the relation between k s the barnacle height and percentage of surface coverage schultz 2004 has performed an experimental study in order to analyse the frictional resistance of five antifouling coatings in unfouled fouled and cleaned condition schultz proposed roughness length scale for unfouled and cleaned antifouling coatings based on the centreline average roughness height furthermore the author also proposed roughness length scale for fouled coatings with barnacles as a function of both height of the largest barnacles and percentage of coverage of the fouled surface schultz 2007 has presented a method for assessing the effect of coating roughness and fouling on the frictional resistance and powering of a full scale ship it should be noticed that within schultz 2007 it was considered that biofouling influences only the frictional resistance i e that residuary resistance remains the same for fouled and unfouled surfaces the author proposed the values of k s for seven representative surface conditions the proposed method assumes the homogeneous distribution of a certain fouling condition over the entire hull and allows relatively fast determination of the effect of certain fouling condition on the frictional resistance oliveira et al 2018 have reanalysed the numerical results presented in demirel et al 2017b the authors concluded that hull form effects on biofouling penalties can be significant for lower speeds as computational fluid dynamics cfd methods based on viscous flow theory have developed rapidly over the past few decades there was a significant increase in the number of numerical investigations related to the roughness research chung et al 2015 have proposed a fast practical and accurate direct numerical simulation dns method that can directly characterize hydraulic resistance from profilometry data of rough surface a model of surface roughness for a numerical simulation or an experiment of a flow over rough wall requires some form of surface filtering busse et al 2015 have investigated a low pass fourier filtering and thus assessed the effects of small scale surface features on turbulent flow past an irregular rough wall chan et al 2015 have performed a dns of a turbulent flow through pipes with sinusoidal roughness based on the obtained results the authors proposed roughness function that depends both on a roughness height as well as on an effective slope since there is no prospect of adequately handling non uniform roughness effects with reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations eca and hoekstra 2011 the importance of determination of accurate relation between k s and some surface condition is even more highlighted khor and xiao 2011 have modelled fouling with small conical shapes on the surface of naca 4424 airfoil and used relation between k s and antifouling roughness parameter for the determination of relation between lift and drag coefficient for the drea submarine hull the authors showed that cfd can be used for modelling the fouling effects demirel et al 2014 have used the experimental data to establish the most suitable roughness function model for antifouling coatings the colebrook type roughness function was implemented in wall function of the solver and the results of numerical simulations were validated against experimental results a newly proposed wall function approach for different fouling conditions was given in demirel et al 2017b based on the experimental results obtained in schultz 2007 the authors used this function in order to determine the increase in total resistance of fouled kriso container ship kcs as well as the influence of hull surface roughness on both frictional and wave resistance the negative effects of biofouling on the open water characteristics of potsdam propeller were determined by owen et al 2018 utilizing the previously proposed roughness function demirel et al 2017b castro et al 2011 have carried out unsteady rans simulations of a full scale kcs in self propulsion conditions taking into account hull roughness by means of wall function the authors proposed a definition of k s in sea trial condition by equalizing the sum of the frictional resistance coefficient and the roughness allowance proposed by ittc with the frictional resistance coefficient for a flat plate in fully rough regime within this paper roughness function models for biofilms were established based on the experimental data presented in schultz et al 2015 the roughness length scale for surfaces covered with biofilm proposed within schultz et al 2015 is a function of both biofilm average height and percentage of surface coverage with biofilm this roughness length scale was adopted in this research the present study contributes to previous studies with the main objective to employ a modified wall function within commercial cfd software star ccm thus the assessment of the effect of biofilm on the resistance of any arbitrary body is enabled using only measurements of biofilm height and percentage of surface coverage with biofilm after the implementation of a certain roughness function model a verification and validation studies were performed utilizing numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow at several reynolds numbers rn as done in experiments performed by schultz and flack 2013 and schultz et al 2015 thereafter the effect of several surface conditions covered with biofilm was determined utilizing the proposed cfd model a very thin flat plate having the same waterline length as kcs was used to represent kcs at full scale at design speed of 24 knots the obtained frictional resistance coefficients for several rough conditions were compared with the results obtained using granville s similarity law analysis and satisfactory agreement was achieved thereafter 3d double body simulations of the flow around full scale kcs were carried out thus an increase in frictional resistance as well as in effective power was estimated for eight surface conditions the structure of this paper is as follows within section 2 governing equations of the performed numerical simulations are presented while in section 3 determination of the proposed roughness function models is shown afterwards a numerical setup as well as the verification and validation procedures are presented in section 4 in section 5 the obtained numerical results are shown along with the comparison with the experimental results furthermore within section 5 the assessment of the increase in the frictional resistance as well in effective power for kcs covered with biofilm is demonstrated finally conclusions along with a plan for future research are presented in section 6 2 governing equations the motion of viscous fluid can be described with continuity and navier stokes equations which are derived from the law of conservation of momentum and by the introduction of constitutive equations constitutive equations divide stress in the fluid on the pressure and viscous term continuity and navier stokes equations for incompressible newtonian fluid are given as follows ferziger and peric 2012 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j f i 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ τ i j x j where ρ is the density u i is the velocity vector f i are body forces per unit mass p is the pressure and τ i j is the viscous stress tensor which is defined as follows 3 τ i j μ u i x j u j x i where μ is the dynamic viscosity equations 1 and 2 have no analytical solution for turbulent flows which are in nature stochastic therefore these equations are solved numerically either using dns partially averaged navier stokes simulations pans large eddy simulations les detached eddy simulations des or rans rans equations are obtained after applying reynolds averaging to the navier stokes equations within this study steady rans simulations were performed since no unsteady phenomenon was simulated in order to complete rans equations the shear stress transport k ω turbulence model sstko was utilized sstko effectively blends k ε model in the far field and k ω near the wall thus the biggest disadvantage of applying k ω turbulence model in practical flow simulations is avoided since sensitivity to the initial values of specific dissipation rate ω in the free stream is avoided the transport equations for sttko are defined as follows cd adapco 2017 4 d d t v ρ k d v a ρ k u i u g i d a i a μ σ k μ t k x i d a i v γ

the function used for free shear modification and γ is defined as follows 6 γ min max γ e f f 0 1 1 eddy viscosity is given as follows 7 μ t ρ k t where t is the turbulent time scale the boundary layer is the layer in the proximity of a non slip surface i e wall where the effects of the viscosity are significant when ship is in motion a turbulent boundary layer is formed around ship and can be divided into two regions i e an inner region and an outer region as said before according to the wall similarity hypothesis the flow in the outer region is not affected by surface conditions the inner region is divided into a viscous sublayer which can be subdivided into a linear sublayer and a buffer layer and a log law region within log law region the non dimensional velocity for smooth surfaces is defined as follows ferziger and peric 2012 8 u 1 κ ln y b where κ is the von karman constant b is the smooth log wall intercept and y is the non dimensional normal distance from the wall the roughness reynolds number represents the key parameter in the description of roughness effects on the flow near the wall and is defined as follows 9 k k u τ ρ μ where k is the roughness length scale and u τ is the friction velocity as previously mentioned roughness effects can be noticed through the downward shift of u as follows 10 u 1 κ ln y b δ u typically the flow over a rough wall is classified in three flow regimes i e hydraulically smooth transitionally rough and fully rough depending on k nevertheless it is important to notice that various roughness types can produce different flow regimes even though the same k is present schultz 2007 therefore there is no universal roughness function model which could describe effects of any roughness kind 3 roughness functions for biofilm biofilm is consisted of any group of microorganisms where cells adhere to each other or to a surface biofilms are non uniformly distributed over a surface flexible and have variable density and height schultz and swain 2000 in addition to due to production of extracellular polymeric substances rich interactions with the fluid flow over the biofilm are present furthermore biofilms can be changed and displaced because of the flow which can make resistance characteristics of biofilm time dependant even at steady flow velocity schultz et al 2015 therefore the modelling of the flow and the assessment of resistance for biofilm covered surfaces are problematic townsin 2003 claimed that the effects of macrofouling are far better understood than the effects of microfouling presently there is no generally accepted method for evaluating the effects of a given biofilm covered surface on the resistance however schultz et al 2015 have performed the experiments for fr coatings for four different surface conditions in a fully developed turbulent channel flow facility 3 1 turbulent channel flow schultz et al 2015 have performed several experiments in the high rn turbulent channel flow tcf facility for unexposed and cleaned plates as well as for plates covered with biofilm after the exposure of three and six months plates were painted with three different commercial fr coatings table 1 it should be noted that coating system for every coated plate included a primer a tie coat and a fr coating the representation of the high rn tcf facility is shown in fig 1 while its main characteristics are shown in table 2 more details regarding the performed experiments can be found in schultz and flack 2013 schultz et al 2015 even though biofilms grown in research schultz et al 2015 and later the obtained results regarding δ u should not be interpreted to represent all biofilms that maybe settled on ships it should be noted that grown biofilms were consisted of diatoms which are commonly found in the biofilms on ships thus the obtained results can be considered as reliable representation of impact of diatomaceous biofilms on the frictional resistance schultz et al 2015 found out that the effect of biofilm on the resistance is dependent on the average biofilm thickness k and the percentage of the surface coverage s c and proposed a new effective roughness length scale for diatomaceous biofilms as follows 11 k e f f 0 055 k s c 1 2 in this research k e f f is used as roughness length scale and therefore k is defined as follows 12 k k e f f u τ ν 3 2 roughness function models schultz et al 2015 have presented δ u dependence on k for several surfaces covered with diatomaceous biofilm the authors claimed that parameter sc has a significant influence on fundamental δ u behaviour i e the roughness function model is different depending on sc thus for the plates with sc 25 the flow can be described as fully rough i e viscous shear stress is negligible and frictional resistance is formed solely because of the presence of roughness for these plates frictional resistance coefficient for rough surface c f r is independent on rn within this research a suitable roughness function model is fitted using the least squares method to δ u values of schultz et al 2015 for sc 25 as follows 13 δ u 1 κ ln 0 27767 k for k 3 61 0 for k 3 61 where κ is equal to 0 42 this roughness function model can be easily implemented within the wall function of the commercial software package star ccm the proposed roughness function model for surfaces which have sc 25 has excellent agreement with the experimental δ u values for higher k values as shown in fig 2 for lower k values the proposed δ u model reasonably matches the experimental data on the other hand in the range of k values from 2 to 4 the proposed model underestimates the experimental data which is caused by the fact that least squares method takes into account both experimental δ u values at higher and at lower k values therefore using this method one function is obtained which describes both δ u values for ac6 and c6 however it is very important to note that τ w values on the hull surfaces for most of smooth ships are typically above 50 pa at design speed and taking into account that u τ for rough surfaces is higher than for smooth surfaces the range of k values on the hull surfaces of full scale ships are often above 4 5 even for smaller k e f f values therefore it is important to note that the proposed roughness function model can be used for reliable assessment of the increase in frictional resistance for higher k values which are common on full scale ships during a sail and for the assessment of the minimal increase due to the presence of biofilm for lower k values i e in the range from 2 to 4 it should be noted that x axis in fig 2 is logarithmic equation 13 can be used for determination of the effects of biofilm on the resistance of any arbitrary body if the percentage of surface coverage with biofilm at the surface of that body is higher than 25 i e frictional resistance is formed solely because of the presence of roughness on the other hand if sc 25 the flow in the patches between the islands of biofilm relaxes to a state which is more similar to the flow over a smooth wall thus within areas between biofilm viscous stress is noticeable even at large rn schultz et al 2015 therefore if sc is smaller than 25 the flow around such surface will be more complex than the flow around surface with sc 25 in addition the roughness function model will change it should be noted that for the surfaces with sc 25 the uncertainty in the prediction of frictional resistance using the roughness function model is somewhat higher than for surfaces with sc 25 since experimental data are scattered fig 3 there are three different δ u shapes which are marked in fig 3 with different symbols i e o and thus the plate a6 has the highest δ u slope even though it does not have the highest sc on the other hand the plate b6 has the smallest δ u slope and the smallest sc all the other plates i e a3 b3 b6 and ac3 have obviously the same δ u fig 2 in order to define the roughness function model as accurate as possible within this research two roughness function models are defined for surfaces with sc 25 first roughness function model is defined for surfaces with 10 sc 25 while second one is defined for surfaces with sc 10 roughness function model for surfaces with sc between 10 and 25 is defined as follows 14 δ u 1 κ ln 1 14492 0 0988 k for k 4 5 0 for k 4 5 where κ is equal to 0 42 the roughness function model presented in equation 14 is fitted to δ u values of plates a3 b3 b6 and ac3 fig 4 as it can be seen from fig 4 the satisfactory agreement between the proposed δ u model and experimentally obtained δ u values are achieved however it should be noted that δ u values for the plate a6 are not considered for definition of the proposed δ u model therefore this δ u model has higher uncertainty for determination of the impact of diatomaceous biofilms on the resistance since the flow around the surface with sc 25 is more complex than the flow around the surface with sc 25 as explained earlier in order to obtain more reliable δ u model for the surfaces with sc 25 which could be used for assessment of the effects of diatomaceous biofilms on the resistance more experimental studies should be performed i e the physical nature of the effect of biofilm on the resistance is far from well understood schultz et al 2015 still the proposed δ u model can be useful in the prediction of increase in the resistance due to presence of diatomaceous biofilm for surface with 10 sc 25 namely the results obtained using the proposed δ u model can be considered as the minimum increase in the resistance because of the presence of biofilm which can be seen from the fig 3 as δ u values for the plate a6 are higher than δ u values for the rest of plates for surfaces with sc 10 the roughness function model is defined as follows 15 δ u 1 κ ln 1 06492 0 05332 k for k 4 0 for k 4 where κ is equal to 0 42 the proposed roughness function model for surfaces with sc 10 has satisfactory agreement with the experimental δ u values as shown in fig 5 as it can be seen from figs 2 4 and 5 the highest relative deviations from proposed roughness function models and experimentally obtained δ u values are present for lower k values thus the proposed δ u model for surfaces with sc 25 for k 4 gives smaller δ u values than experimentally obtained ones on the other hand the proposed δ u models for surfaces with 10 sc 25 and sc 10 at lower k values give higher δ u values than experimentally obtained ones however as said before the range of k values on the hull surfaces of full scale ships are often above 4 5 even for smaller k e f f values and even if lower k values are obtained then the increase in the frictional resistance is almost negligible therefore it can be concluded that the proposed roughness function models can be used for reliable assessment of the increase in the frictional resistance 4 numerical setup roughness function models shown within section 3 are implemented in the wall function of the commercial software package star ccm validation of the proposed δ u models is done by utilizing the numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow within star ccm at several rn tcf is modelled as steady phenomenon and finite volume method is used for discretization of rans equations rans equations are solved in a segregated manner and second order upwind scheme is used for the discretization of convection terms for validation study the test section of high rn tcf facility is modelled for the assessment of the increase in the frictional resistance for kcs the flat plate is modelled the test section of high rn tcf facility is described in detail in schultz et al 2015 and its main particulars are shown in table 2 the flat plate which represents kcs as well as 3d kcs are entirely immersed in the water in order to avoid influence of the boundaries on the obtained solution boundaries are placed far enough from the flat plate and 3d kcs according to ittc 2011b thus the outlet boundary is set to distance 2 4l where l is the length of the flat plate inlet boundary is set to distance l while other boundaries are set to distance 1 5l the computational domain is discretized utilizing a cut cell grid with prism layer mesh on the walls as shown in demirel et al 2014 the distance of the first cell from the rough wall should be set in order to have y value around 50 it should be noted that in full scale simulations y value in the first cell was kept around 150 furthermore it is important that y value in the first cell is higher than k because otherwise the coefficient of frictional resistance will be underpredicted eca and hoekstra 2011 the obtained y distribution at the upper plate b3 for tcf at r n 1 344 10 6 is shown in fig 6 while the obtained y distribution at the flat plate representing kcs at design speed is shown in fig 7 in the validation studies selected boundary conditions are as follows a velocity inlet for inlet boundary a pressure outlet for outlet boundary and no slip wall for the rest of boundaries which include walls of channel and plates in the numerical simulations of the equivalent flat plate shown in fig 8 the selected boundary conditions are shown in fig 9 as it can be seen from fig 9 the symmetry condition is used for right side and top thus only lower left side of the flat plate is modelled i e only 1 4 of the flat plate is modelled it should be noted that the same boundary conditions are applied in numerical simulation of viscous flow around 3d kcs the main particulars of kcs are shown in table 3 along with the main particulars of the flat plate representing kcs which are the same as taken in demirel et al 2017b three meshes are created for the purpose of verification study coarse medium and fine mesh in order to ensure y value around 50 and to keep y above k value as well as to ensure an appropriate transition from prism layer cells to the core mesh the mesh generation is done carefully for each rn thus the number of cells in the validation study varies with respect to rn in the validation studies coarse mesh has around 0 35 0 5 m cells medium mesh around 0 7 1 m cells and fine mesh around 1 4 2 m cells in the studies regarding the determination of the increase in the frictional resistance with flat plate coarse mesh has around 0 5 m cells medium mesh has around 1 1 m cells while fine mesh has around 2 5 m cells while in numerical simulations of 3d kcs coarse mesh has around 1 2 m cells medium mesh has around 2 37 m cells and fine mesh has around 4 6 m cells the cross section of the fine mesh used in validation studies is shown in fig 10 while in fig 11 the fine mesh used for the determination of the increase in the frictional resistance for 3d kcs is shown 4 1 verification and validation v v study in order to determine numerical uncertainty as well as to evaluate the order of convergence verification study is made since all numerical simulations are stopped after 1000 iterations and after 1000 iterations all residuals dropped at least eight orders of magnitude the iterative uncertainty can be considered as negligible therefore verification study is made for grid size and three meshes are made coarse medium and fine mesh grid refinement ratio r in validation studies is equal to 1 26 while in the numerical simulations for the determination of the increase in the frictional resistance for flat plate it is equal to 1 31 and for 3d kcs it is equal to 1 25 if monotonic convergence is achieved i e 0 ε 21 ε 32 1 generalized richardson extrapolation re can be used for determination of numerical uncertainty and errors order of accuracy is calculated as follows 16 p r e ln ε 32 ε 21 ln r where ε 32 s 3 s 2 ε 21 s 2 s 1 and s 1 s 2 s 3 are frictional resistances obtained with numerical simulations utilizing fine medium and coarse mesh respectively re error can be determined as follows 17 δ r e ε 21 r p r e 1 re solution s r e can then be estimated as the difference between s 1 and δ r e the factor of safety approach is used for determination of the numerical uncertainty u f s using this method u f s can be determined as follows 18 u f s f s δ r e where f s 1 25 is the safety factor the normalized uncertainties are obtained using the following equation 19 u u f s s r e 100 the obtained numerical results for frictional resistance coefficients c f cfd are validated against experimentally obtained frictional resistance coefficients c f exp relative deviations are calculated as follows 20 r d c f cfd c f exp c f exp 100 5 results within this section the obtained results are presented firstly the results of validation study for the proposed roughness function models are presented thus the obtained numerical results for the smooth plates in tcf as well as for rough plates in tcf utilizing the proposed δ u models are verified and validated against experimentally obtained results schultz et al 2015 once the proposed δ u models are validated they have been used for the estimation of the increase in frictional resistance and effective power for kcs for several surface conditions covered with biofilm 5 1 validation study the proposed δ u models shown with equations 13 15 are dependent on the both k and sc as k is a function of those variables in addition the selection of certain δ u model depends on sc in table 4 tested rough plates are shown along with their k sc k e f f values and applied δ u model it should be noted that k and sc shown in table 4 represent mean values taken from schultz et al 2015 while k e f f values represent round k e f f values obtained utilizing equation 11 5 1 1 smooth flat plates v v study for smooth plates in tcf is performed for seven rn and the obtained results are presented in tables 5 and 6 c f cfd is calculated using the following equation 21 c f cfd s r e 1 2 ρ u 2 s where s r e is the re solution for the frictional resistance of the smooth plate in tcf and s is the wetted surface of the flat plate and it equals to 0 304 m2 as it can be seen from table 5 the monotonic convergence is obtained for all rn tested the obtained u for grid size are relatively small and can be considered as the only source of numerical uncertainty since iteration uncertainty is negligible the obtained s r e show satisfactory agreement with the experimental results table 6 with the highest rd equal to 1 5 5 1 2 rough plates with sc 25 as can be seen from table 4 plates c6 and ac6 have sc 25 and therefore the appropriate roughness function model is shown with equation 13 v v study for plates c6 and ac6 in tcf is performed for seven rn and the obtained results are presented in tables 7 and 8 as it can be seen from table 7 monotonic convergence is achieved for all rn except for the highest rn tested where oscillatory convergence is achieved for both c6 and ac6 therefore the frictional resistance coefficient for rn 188172 is calculated utilizing s 1 as can be seen from table 8 the obtained frictional resistance coefficients for both c6 and ac6 show satisfactory agreement with the experimentally obtained frictional resistance coefficients with the highest rd equal to 2 813 5 1 3 rough plates with 10 sc 25 plates a3 b3 ac3 and b6 have sc in the range from 10 to 25 and therefore the appropriate δ u model is shown with equation 14 since the experiments in tcf for plates which were exposed 3 months were performed up to rn 114000 v v study for those plates is made for four rn in the range from 26882 to 107527 tables 9 and 10 for plate b6 v v study is made for seven rn in the range from 26882 to 188172 tables 11 and 12 as it can be seen from tables 9 and 11 monotonic convergence is achieved for all rn except for the plate b6 at the highest rn tested where oscillatory convergence is achieved therefore c f cfd at rn 188172 is calculated utilizing s 1 as can be seen from tables 10 and 12 the obtained frictional resistance coefficients for all tested plates show satisfactory agreement with the experimentally obtained frictional resistance coefficients with the highest rd equal to 6 777 the highest rd is achieved at the lowest rn 26882 which can be explained with relatively higher numerical uncertainty obtained at this rn for both b3 and b6 plates than numerical uncertainty obtained at other rn and for other plates at rn 26882 the obtained numerical uncertainty for b3 is equal to 7 129 while for b6 is equal to 7 519 if c f cfd for these two plates at rn 26882 was calculated based on the numerical solution obtained utilizing fine grid rd from the experimental solution would be 0 499 for b3 and 0 354 for b6 that is to say it can be considered that all numerical solutions show satisfactory agreement with the experimentally obtained frictional resistance coefficients 5 1 4 rough plates with sc 10 the plate c3 has sc 10 and therefore δ u model appropriate for describing the roughness effects is shown with equation 15 v v study for plate c3 is performed for four rn in the range from 26882 to 107527 tables 13 and 14 as can be seen from table 13 monotonic convergence is achieved for all rn tested and the obtained u are below 1 in table 14 the obtained rd between c f cfd and c f exp are shown and all rd are below 1 i e satisfactory agreement between numerical and experimental results is obtained 5 1 5 discussion on the validation study as said before satisfactory agreement between numerically and experimentally obtained frictional resistance coefficients is achieved for all rn tested also the obtained u are below 1 except for plates b3 and b6 at rn 26882 where the obtained u are below 7 6 furthermore the proposed δ u models can accurately predict effects of the biofilm on the increase in resistance even for surfaces which have small difference in k e f f this can be seen in tables 10 and 12 for plates which have 10 sc 25 i e those plates have same roughness function model for example plate a3 has k e f f equal to 135 μm while plate ac3 has k e f f equal to 125 μm and plate b3 has k e f f equal to 85 μm while plate b6 has k e f f equal to 90 μm even though the differences between k e f f for these two sets of rough plates is very small the proposed roughness function model successfully takes this into account thus the frictional resistance coefficient increases with the increase of k e f f if the same δ u model is applied accurate determination of k on the rough surface is very important since δ u depends solely on k thus if k is accurately predicted c f can be also accurately computed demirel et al 2014 since u τ is not uniformly distributed even on the surface of the flat plate k values vary on the surface fig 12 this is important benefit of utilizing cfd and δ u models for determination of the effects of roughness rather than utilizing granville similarity method demirel et al 2017b thus once δ u model is proposed and implemented within wall function the determination of the effects of roughness on any arbitrary body can be more accurately predicted utilizing cfd than granville similarity method the comparison between k values obtained in numerical simulations and experiments is shown in figs 13 and 14 since k values vary on the plate k is obtained by averaging k values on the surface of rough plate while k is obtained utilizing equation 12 as can be seen from figs 13 and 14 the satisfactory agreement between experimentally and numerically obtained k values is obtained with the highest rd between k and k equal to 1 84 for the plate ac6 at rn 188172 therefore it can be concluded that k for surfaces covered with biofilm can be obtained correctly utilizing the proposed roughness function models for a given k e f f 5 2 the effect of the biofilm on the increase of the frictional resistance for kcs the proposed δ u models are used for estimation of the increase in frictional resistance for kcs for several surface conditions covered with biofilm at design speed i e 24 knots firstly the frictional resistance of the very thin smooth flat plate representing kcs as well as of 3d kcs is determined utilizing three meshes table 15 monotonic convergence is obtained for both flat plate and 3d kcs and therefore s r e solution is used for the calculation of c f cfd the obtained c f cfd is compared with the obtained c f utilizing schoenherr line as follows 22 0 242 c f log c f r n c f utilizing schoenherr line at this rn is equal to 1 377 10 3 the obtained rd between c f cfd for the flat plate and c f obtained utilizing schoenherr line is relatively small i e it is equal to 0 842 while for 3d kcs is somewhat higher and it is equal to 4 218 this was expected since schoenherr line is made for flat plates thus when c f cfd re obtained for 3d kcs is compared with the c f obtained using grigson friction line farkas et al 2018 the obtained rd is equal to 1 5 the effect of the biofilm on the increase in the frictional resistance for kcs is investigated for eight surface conditions shown in table 16 firstly numerical simulations of viscous flow around rough flat plates representing kcs are performed using fine mesh then the obtained c f are compared with results obtained with granville s similarity law analysis using the experimental data which is detailly explained in schultz 2007 table 17 the investigated surface conditions shown in table 16 can be classified as soft fouling i e slime and grass naval ships technical manual 2002 the fouling rating fr scale proposed within naval ships technical manual 2002 presents ten most commonly fouling patterns and soft fouling can have fr from 10 to 30 depending on the severity schultz 2007 has divided soft fouling into two categories i e deteriorated coating or light slime and heavy slime which have fr 10 20 and fr 30 respectively schultz has suggested that deteriorated coating or light slime has average coating roughness equal to 300 μm while heavy slime has average coating roughness equal to 600 μm within table 17 the obtained c f cfd for surface conditions shown in table 16 are presented along with c f obtained using granville s similarity law and rd between c f cfd and c f granville also the increase in c f because of the presence of biofilm and the percentage increase in c f are shown as well the percentage of increase in c f is calculated utilizing the obtained c f cfd for the smooth plate as can be seen from table 17 the results obtained using the proposed roughness function models have rd below 1 1 when compared to the results which are obtained using granvile s similarity law analysis using the experimentally obtained δ u values therefore it can be concluded that the proposed cfd model can be used for the prediction of biofilm effects on the frictional resistance of full scale flat plates furthermore from table 17 it can be seen that the increase in c f significantly varies depending on k and sc thus δ c f for investigated surface conditions varies from 0 112 to 39 545 once the proposed cfd model has been validated for full scale flat plate representing kcs double body simulations of 3d kcs for eight surface conditions are made using fine mesh the obtained results are shown in table 18 along with the comparison with the results obtained using granville s similarity law analysis as can be seen from table 18 the obtained rd between c f cfd for 3d kcs and c f granville are higher than rd between c f cfd for the flat plate and c f granville this was expected since granville s similarity law analysis is based on constant k value for certain rn as friction velocity varies even across flat plate it can be concluded that k will vary across the ship hull it should be noted that the highest increases in c f are obtained for 3d kcs as was obtained in demirel et al 2017b fig 15 the highest increase in c f is obtained for 3d kcs for surface condition 2 and this increase is equal to 40 106 in order to determine the increase in effective power it is assumed that the form factor value and the wave resistance coefficient remain the same for rough and smooth surface conditions the form factor value for kcs is taken as k 0 1 demirel et al 2017b the total resistance coefficient can be divided as follows 23 c t 1 k c f c w where c w is wave resistance coefficient which is assumed to be the same for model and full scale ship since it is assumed that k and c w are the same for model and full scale ship as well as for smooth and rough surface condition utilizing the experimental data hino 2005 regarding the total resistance of kcs model c w for ship design speed can be determined as follows 24 c w c t exp 1 1 c f cfd where c t exp is the total resistance coefficient taken from hino 2005 and c f cfd is the frictional resistance coefficient obtained utilizing cfd for smooth equivalent plate thus c w for kcs at ship design speed is equal to 2 2095 10 3 the increase in effective power can be estimated as follows 25 δ p e r t r v r t s v r t s v 100 1 k δ c f 1 k c f s c w 100 where r t r is the total resistance for rough surface r t s is the total resistance for smooth surface v is the ship speed i e 24 knots and δ c f is the increase in the frictional resistance because of the presence of the biofilm the obtained δ p e are shown in table 19 and fig 16 these results can be compared to results presented in demirelb et al 2017 where the authors obtained the increase in the effective power equal to 18 1 for kcs for deteriorated coating or light slime namely the investigated surface conditions within this study can be described as very light slime and light slime it should be noted that the obtained increases in the frictional resistance and the effective power presented in tables 17 19 are specific for the ship investigated in this research as well as for surface conditions presented in table 16 however the one can easily determine the increase in the frictional resistance or in the effective power due to presence of biofilm utilizing the proposed δ u models for any arbitrary body 6 conclusion roughness function models for surfaces covered with diatomaceous biofilms were established based on the experimental data presented in schultz et al 2015 the roughness length scale proposed in schultz et al 2015 was adopted and utilized for the calculation of the roughness reynolds number this roughness length scale depends on both the biofilm average height and the percentage of the surface coverage depending on sc three δ u models were proposed and implemented in the wall function within star ccm therefore the determination of the effect of biofilm on the resistance of any arbitrary body is enabled and the average biofilm height and percentage of the surface coverage are the only required input data in order to validate the proposed models numerical simulations of the turbulent channel flow were performed for seven different rough plates firstly verification study was carried out for both smooth and rough plates at several rn the calculated normalized uncertainties were mostly below 1 and these uncertainties are related solely to grid size relative deviations between numerically and experimentally obtained c f for all rn were sufficiently small ranging from 0 029 to 6 777 it should be noted that the most of rd were below 2 9 except for plates b3 and b6 at rn 26882 where rd were equal to 5 518 and 6 777 respectively however the higher rd obtained for those plates can be described through higher u and if s 1 was used for the determination of c f cfd rd would drop to 0 499 for b3 and 0 354 for b6 another important aspect for valid assessment of the frictional resistance is to obtain the correct k value therefore the numerically and experimentally obtained k values were compared and the obtained rd were sufficiently small i e the highest rd was obtained for plate ac6 at rn 188172 and was equal to 1 84 furthermore it was shown that the proposed δ u models can successfully predict the effects of the biofilm on the increase in resistance even if surfaces differ slightly with respect to k e f f therefore it can be concluded that the proposed δ u models can be used for the assessment of the effects of biofilm on the resistance for any arbitrary body utilizing the surface roughness measurements only rather than determining k s hydrodynamically however before drawing any definitive conclusion in the prediction of the effects of the biofilm further studies should be made considering the lack of the experimental data regarding these effects the main reason for this is that the flow around soft fouled surfaces is more complex than the flow around hard fouled surfaces therefore to the best of the authors knowledge there is no generally accepted method for the evaluation of the effects of a given surface covered with biofilm on the resistance the aim of this study was to propose a robust δ u models which could be used for the determination of the effects of the diatomaceous biofilm based on the available experimental data schultz et al 2015 once the proposed δ u models were validated they were used for the prediction of the increase in the frictional resistance for the very thin flat plate representing kcs for eight surface conditions those eight surface conditions varied with respect to k and sc and could be described as very light slime and light slime the obtained increases in c f were compared with the results obtained using granville s similarity law scaling method and the satisfactory agreement was achieved after the proposed cfd model has been validated for full scale flat plate representing kcs the increase in c f has been determined for 3d kcs utilizing double body simulations the obtained results were also compared with the results obtained using granville s similarity law scaling method and the obtained rd were higher than rd between c f flat plate and c f granville this was expected since the friction velocity varies across ship hull while in granville s similarity law scaling method it was assumed as constant the obtained increase in c f significantly varied depending on k and sc up to 40 106 which was obtained for 3d kcs and for surface condition 2 additionally the increase in the effective power was estimated for those eight surface conditions and the obtained increase varied up to 16 706 which was obtained for 3d kcs and for surface condition 2 however it should be noted that the increase in the effective power was estimated under the assumption that the form factor value and the wave resistance coefficient remained the same for smooth and rough surfaces demirel et al 2017b have shown that roughness influences the wave resistance i e that wave resistance coefficient decreases for rough surfaces therefore the future studies will be concentrated on the assessment of the increase in frictional viscous pressure and wave resistance due to the presence of biofilm by utilizing the proposed δ u models on a full scale ship what is more the assessment of the effect of biofilm on the propeller operating point could be investigated if the proposed δ u models are applied in the numerical simulations of the self propulsion test thus the determination of the additional costs regarding the biofouling of the ship hull with biofilms could be assessed more reliably acknowledgement

to professor michael p schultz for sharing his research and providing his experimental data 
23092,biofilm represents a non uniform distribution of flexible microorganisms over a surface with variable density and height it can be modified and displaced due to the flow therefore the modelling of the flow and the assessment of resistance for surfaces covered with biofilm are problematic presently there is no generally accepted method for the evaluation of the effects of a given biofilm on the resistance within this paper roughness function models for surfaces covered with diatomaceous biofilm are established utilizing the experimental data presented in the literature these roughness function models are then implemented within the wall function of the commercial software package star ccm numerical simulations of the rough plates in the turbulent channel flow are performed and the results are verified and validated against the experimentally obtained results presented in the literature utilizing the roughness length scale proposed in the literature and the proposed roughness function models the effects of the biofilm on the resistance of any arbitrary body can be assessed using only roughness measurements finally the increase in the frictional resistance and effective power due to the presence of the biofilm is determined using the validated roughness function models keywords biofilm cfd roughness function model frictional resistance full scale ship 1 introduction biofouling is the accumulation of microorganisms plants algae or animals on wetted surfaces it represents a growing problem from both the economic and environmental point of view even though it occurs in many different fields shipping industry is the most affected by the settlement and the growth of biofouling organisms ship hull roughness is increased because of presence of biofouling organisms thus frictional resistance is increased which results in increased fuel consumption decreased ship speed and increased engine stress bixler and bhusan 2012 schultz et al 2011 have pointed out that all costs related to the development procurement and application as well as relatively costly technical or management solutions for antifouling of ships are economically justified if they only slightly improve the fouling condition of a hull the authors have estimated the overall costs related with fouling of the mid sized naval surface ship to be around 1 million usd per year another problem related to ship biofouling is spreading of species across the world seas and consequently disruption and change of existing biological systems davidson et al 2016 the settlement of fouling organisms on the wetted surface occurs in three stages i e formation of a conditioning film microfouling and macrofouling microfouling can be divided into two stages the first stage of microfouling is formed from the mixture of the conditioning film and the slime of living and dead bacteria cells while the secondary stage is formed when diatoms colonies macroalgae and protozoa spores settlement increases nurioglu et al 2015 larger fouling organisms i e macrofouling such as algae and tubeworms will settle earlier on the wetted surface covered with biofilm than on the unfouled wetted surface van mooy et al 2014 prevention of biofouling using the coating technology has been applied to ships since ancient times but the real revolution of antifouling coatings started when new synthetic petroleum based resins were developed in the 1940s these resins have enabled the development of polymer based coatings with better mechanical properties in the 1950s antifouling coatings based on tributyltin tbt were developed and it was considered that the problem of biofouling was resolved however because of significant environmental concerns tbt coatings were banned worldwide in 2008 therefore a coating technology has been focused nowadays on the finding of the alternative antifouling agents and different antifouling strategies thus nowadays there are two main approaches i e biocide release and non biocide release antifouling coatings nurioglu et al 2015 the latter ones represent coatings which are designed to reduce or prevent the adhesion of fouling organisms fouling release fr coatings are used on ships which sail often and at higher speeds it should be noted that biofouling is dependent on many different parameters and prediction how long will antifouling coating successfully prevent fouling has remained elusive van mooy et al 2014 lately the international maritime organization imo has implemented several regulations to decrease harmful gases emission in the shipping industry the fuel consumption thus has to be reduced not only from shipowner s point of view but from both environmental and legislative point of view as well farkas et al 2018 as said before since biofouling cause the increase in the resistance of the ship and affects the propulsion of the ship it is very important to determine the effects of biofouling on resistance and propulsion characteristics the importance of the assessment of these effects was also recognized by the international towing tank conference ittc thus ittc has recommended a development of a new formulae or methods based on the experimental data for this problem ittc 2011a concept of the roughness function was proposed independently by clauser and hama and they defined it as a downward shift of the mean velocity profile in the log law wall similarity hypothesis assumes that roughness effects are limited to inner layer thus velocity defect profiles for rough and smooth surface become a same in the outer layer this hypothesis is very important and it is mainly used in the assessment of roughness effects nowadays flack and schultz 2014 when roughness functions δ u are determined experimentally for certain surface conditions the effects of these surface conditions on the resistance of any arbitrary body can be assessed either through a similarity law analysis or a boundary layer code schultz and myers 2003 in order to obtain dynamically similar conditions during the experimental determination of δ u in the channel or in the towing tank and on the ship the same roughness reynolds number k should be obtained also fouling organisms or any other kind of roughness must be within the inner layer for the flow both in channel and towing tank and for the flow around ship in order the wall similarity hypothesis to be valid schultz et al 2003 the roughness functions can be described as the differences between the velocity profile of the smooth and rough surfaces within numerical simulations of viscous flow the user has to define a roughness function model which is dependent on k k is defined as a function of the roughness length scale or equivalent sand grain roughness k s which is selected in that way that the δ u values correspond to a predefined δ u model and that the observed behaviours are still deemed appropriate relative to each other therefore in order to assess the hydrodynamic impact of a specified biofouling load on a ship or other marine structure roughness length scale for the surface condition has to be determined since this surface property is not directly measurable ultimate objective of roughness research is to determine relation between roughness length scale and some easily measured surface properties monty et al 2016 schultz et al 2015 have measured frictional resistance for fr hull coatings for four different conditions based on the obtained results the authors proposed a new effective roughness length scale for biofilms demirel et al 2017a have performed a series of towing tank measurements of flat plates covered with artificial barnacles in order to determine the relation between k s the barnacle height and percentage of surface coverage schultz 2004 has performed an experimental study in order to analyse the frictional resistance of five antifouling coatings in unfouled fouled and cleaned condition schultz proposed roughness length scale for unfouled and cleaned antifouling coatings based on the centreline average roughness height furthermore the author also proposed roughness length scale for fouled coatings with barnacles as a function of both height of the largest barnacles and percentage of coverage of the fouled surface schultz 2007 has presented a method for assessing the effect of coating roughness and fouling on the frictional resistance and powering of a full scale ship it should be noticed that within schultz 2007 it was considered that biofouling influences only the frictional resistance i e that residuary resistance remains the same for fouled and unfouled surfaces the author proposed the values of k s for seven representative surface conditions the proposed method assumes the homogeneous distribution of a certain fouling condition over the entire hull and allows relatively fast determination of the effect of certain fouling condition on the frictional resistance oliveira et al 2018 have reanalysed the numerical results presented in demirel et al 2017b the authors concluded that hull form effects on biofouling penalties can be significant for lower speeds as computational fluid dynamics cfd methods based on viscous flow theory have developed rapidly over the past few decades there was a significant increase in the number of numerical investigations related to the roughness research chung et al 2015 have proposed a fast practical and accurate direct numerical simulation dns method that can directly characterize hydraulic resistance from profilometry data of rough surface a model of surface roughness for a numerical simulation or an experiment of a flow over rough wall requires some form of surface filtering busse et al 2015 have investigated a low pass fourier filtering and thus assessed the effects of small scale surface features on turbulent flow past an irregular rough wall chan et al 2015 have performed a dns of a turbulent flow through pipes with sinusoidal roughness based on the obtained results the authors proposed roughness function that depends both on a roughness height as well as on an effective slope since there is no prospect of adequately handling non uniform roughness effects with reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations eca and hoekstra 2011 the importance of determination of accurate relation between k s and some surface condition is even more highlighted khor and xiao 2011 have modelled fouling with small conical shapes on the surface of naca 4424 airfoil and used relation between k s and antifouling roughness parameter for the determination of relation between lift and drag coefficient for the drea submarine hull the authors showed that cfd can be used for modelling the fouling effects demirel et al 2014 have used the experimental data to establish the most suitable roughness function model for antifouling coatings the colebrook type roughness function was implemented in wall function of the solver and the results of numerical simulations were validated against experimental results a newly proposed wall function approach for different fouling conditions was given in demirel et al 2017b based on the experimental results obtained in schultz 2007 the authors used this function in order to determine the increase in total resistance of fouled kriso container ship kcs as well as the influence of hull surface roughness on both frictional and wave resistance the negative effects of biofouling on the open water characteristics of potsdam propeller were determined by owen et al 2018 utilizing the previously proposed roughness function demirel et al 2017b castro et al 2011 have carried out unsteady rans simulations of a full scale kcs in self propulsion conditions taking into account hull roughness by means of wall function the authors proposed a definition of k s in sea trial condition by equalizing the sum of the frictional resistance coefficient and the roughness allowance proposed by ittc with the frictional resistance coefficient for a flat plate in fully rough regime within this paper roughness function models for biofilms were established based on the experimental data presented in schultz et al 2015 the roughness length scale for surfaces covered with biofilm proposed within schultz et al 2015 is a function of both biofilm average height and percentage of surface coverage with biofilm this roughness length scale was adopted in this research the present study contributes to previous studies with the main objective to employ a modified wall function within commercial cfd software star ccm thus the assessment of the effect of biofilm on the resistance of any arbitrary body is enabled using only measurements of biofilm height and percentage of surface coverage with biofilm after the implementation of a certain roughness function model a verification and validation studies were performed utilizing numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow at several reynolds numbers rn as done in experiments performed by schultz and flack 2013 and schultz et al 2015 thereafter the effect of several surface conditions covered with biofilm was determined utilizing the proposed cfd model a very thin flat plate having the same waterline length as kcs was used to represent kcs at full scale at design speed of 24 knots the obtained frictional resistance coefficients for several rough conditions were compared with the results obtained using granville s similarity law analysis and satisfactory agreement was achieved thereafter 3d double body simulations of the flow around full scale kcs were carried out thus an increase in frictional resistance as well as in effective power was estimated for eight surface conditions the structure of this paper is as follows within section 2 governing equations of the performed numerical simulations are presented while in section 3 determination of the proposed roughness function models is shown afterwards a numerical setup as well as the verification and validation procedures are presented in section 4 in section 5 the obtained numerical results are shown along with the comparison with the experimental results furthermore within section 5 the assessment of the increase in the frictional resistance as well in effective power for kcs covered with biofilm is demonstrated finally conclusions along with a plan for future research are presented in section 6 2 governing equations the motion of viscous fluid can be described with continuity and navier stokes equations which are derived from the law of conservation of momentum and by the introduction of constitutive equations constitutive equations divide stress in the fluid on the pressure and viscous term continuity and navier stokes equations for incompressible newtonian fluid are given as follows ferziger and peric 2012 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j f i 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ τ i j x j where ρ is the density u i is the velocity vector f i are body forces per unit mass p is the pressure and τ i j is the viscous stress tensor which is defined as follows 3 τ i j μ u i x j u j x i where μ is the dynamic viscosity equations 1 and 2 have no analytical solution for turbulent flows which are in nature stochastic therefore these equations are solved numerically either using dns partially averaged navier stokes simulations pans large eddy simulations les detached eddy simulations des or rans rans equations are obtained after applying reynolds averaging to the navier stokes equations within this study steady rans simulations were performed since no unsteady phenomenon was simulated in order to complete rans equations the shear stress transport k ω turbulence model sstko was utilized sstko effectively blends k ε model in the far field and k ω near the wall thus the biggest disadvantage of applying k ω turbulence model in practical flow simulations is avoided since sensitivity to the initial values of specific dissipation rate ω in the free stream is avoided the transport equations for sttko are defined as follows cd adapco 2017 4 d d t v ρ k d v a ρ k u i u g i d a i a μ σ k μ t k x i d a i v γ

layer is the layer in the proximity of a non slip surface i e wall where the effects of the viscosity are significant when ship is in motion a turbulent boundary layer is formed around ship and can be divided into two regions i e an inner region and an outer region as said before according to the wall similarity hypothesis the flow in the outer region is not affected by surface conditions the inner region is divided into a viscous sublayer which can be subdivided into a linear sublayer and a buffer layer and a log law region within log law region the non dimensional velocity for smooth surfaces is defined as follows ferziger and peric 2012 8 u 1 κ ln y b where κ is the von karman constant b is the smooth log wall intercept and y is the non dimensional normal distance from the wall the roughness reynolds number represents the key parameter in the description of roughness effects on the flow near the wall and is defined as follows 9 k k u τ ρ μ where k is the roughness length scale and u τ is the friction velocity as previously mentioned roughness effects can be noticed through the downward shift of u as follows 10 u 1 κ ln y b δ u typically the flow over a rough wall is classified in three flow regimes i e hydraulically smooth transitionally rough and fully rough depending on k nevertheless it is important to notice that various roughness types can produce different flow regimes even though the same k is present schultz 2007 therefore there is no universal roughness function model which could describe effects of any roughness kind 3 roughness functions for biofilm biofilm is consisted of any group of microorganisms where cells adhere to each other or to a surface biofilms are non uniformly distributed over a surface flexible and have variable density and height schultz and swain 2000 in addition to due to production of extracellular polymeric substances rich interactions with the fluid flow over the biofilm are present furthermore biofilms can be changed and displaced because of the flow which can make resistance characteristics of biofilm time dependant even at steady flow velocity schultz et al 2015 therefore the modelling of the flow and the assessment of resistance for biofilm covered surfaces are problematic townsin 2003 claimed that the effects of macrofouling are far better understood than the effects of microfouling presently there is no generally accepted method for evaluating the effects of a given biofilm covered surface on the resistance however schultz et al 2015 have performed the experiments for fr coatings for four different surface conditions in a fully developed turbulent channel flow facility 3 1 turbulent channel flow schultz et al 2015 have performed several experiments in the high rn turbulent channel flow tcf facility for unexposed and cleaned plates as well as for plates covered with biofilm after the exposure of three and six months plates were painted with three different commercial fr coatings table 1 it should be noted that coating system for every coated plate included a primer a tie coat and a fr coating the representation of the high rn tcf facility is shown in fig 1 while its main characteristics are shown in table 2 more details regarding the performed experiments can be found in schultz and flack 2013 schultz et al 2015 even though biofilms grown in research schultz et al 2015 and later the obtained results regarding δ u should not be interpreted to represent all biofilms that maybe settled on ships it should be noted that grown biofilms were consisted of diatoms which are commonly found in the biofilms on ships thus the obtained results can be considered as reliable representation of impact of diatomaceous biofilms on the frictional resistance schultz et al 2015 found out that the effect of biofilm on the resistance is dependent on the average biofilm thickness k and the percentage of the surface coverage s c and proposed a new effective roughness length scale for diatomaceous biofilms as follows 11 k e f f 0 055 k s c 1 2 in this research k e f f is used as roughness length scale and therefore k is defined as follows 12 k k e f f u τ ν 3 2 roughness function models schultz et al 2015 have presented δ u dependence on k for several surfaces covered with diatomaceous biofilm the authors claimed that parameter sc has a significant influence on fundamental δ u behaviour i e the roughness function model is different depending on sc thus for the plates with sc 25 the flow can be described as fully rough i e viscous shear stress is negligible and frictional resistance is formed solely because of the presence of roughness for these plates frictional resistance coefficient for rough surface c f r is independent on rn within this research a suitable roughness function model is fitted using the least squares method to δ u values of schultz et al 2015 for sc 25 as follows 13 δ u 1 κ ln 0 27767 k for k 3 61 0 for k 3 61 where κ is equal to 0 42 this roughness function model can be easily implemented within the wall function of the commercial software package star ccm the proposed roughness function model for surfaces which have sc 25 has excellent agreement with the experimental δ u values for higher k values as shown in fig 2 for lower k values the proposed δ u model reasonably matches the experimental data on the other hand in the range of k values from 2 to 4 the proposed model underestimates the experimental data which is caused by the fact that least squares method takes into account both experimental δ u values at higher and at lower k values therefore using this method one function is obtained which describes both δ u values for ac6 and c6 however it is very important to note that τ w values on the hull surfaces for most of smooth ships are typically above 50 pa at design speed and taking into account that u τ for rough surfaces is higher than for smooth surfaces the range of k values on the hull surfaces of full scale ships are often above 4 5 even for smaller k e f f values therefore it is important to note that the proposed roughness function model can be used for reliable assessment of the increase in frictional resistance for higher k values which are common on full scale ships during a sail and for the assessment of the minimal increase due to the presence of biofilm for lower k values i e in the range from 2 to 4 it should be noted that x axis in fig 2 is logarithmic equation 13 can be used for determination of the effects of biofilm on the resistance of any arbitrary body if the percentage of surface coverage with biofilm at the surface of that body is higher than 25 i e frictional resistance is formed solely because of the presence of roughness on the other hand if sc 25 the flow in the patches between the islands of biofilm relaxes to a state which is more similar to the flow over a smooth wall thus within areas between biofilm viscous stress is noticeable even at large rn schultz et al 2015 therefore if sc is smaller than 25 the flow around such surface will be more complex than the flow around surface with sc 25 in addition the roughness function model will change it should be noted that for the surfaces with sc 25 the uncertainty in the prediction of frictional resistance using the roughness function model is somewhat higher than for surfaces with sc 25 since experimental data are scattered fig 3 there are three different δ u shapes which are marked in fig 3 with different symbols i e o and thus the plate a6 has the highest δ u slope even though it does not have the highest sc on the other hand the plate b6 has the smallest δ u slope and the smallest sc all the other plates i e a3 b3 b6 and ac3 have obviously the same δ u fig 2 in order to define the roughness function model as accurate as possible within this research two roughness function models are defined for surfaces with sc 25 first roughness function model is defined for surfaces with 10 sc 25 while second one is defined for surfaces with sc 10 roughness function model for surfaces with sc between 10 and 25 is defined as follows 14 δ u 1 κ ln 1 14492 0 0988 k for k 4 5 0 for k 4 5 where κ is equal to 0 42 the roughness function model presented in equation 14 is fitted to δ u values of plates a3 b3 b6 and ac3 fig 4 as it can be seen from fig 4 the satisfactory agreement between the proposed δ u model and experimentally obtained δ u values are achieved however it should be noted that δ u values for the plate a6 are not considered for definition of the proposed δ u model therefore this δ u model has higher uncertainty for determination of the impact of diatomaceous biofilms on the resistance since the flow around the surface with sc 25 is more complex than the flow around the surface with sc 25 as explained earlier in order to obtain more reliable δ u model for the surfaces with sc 25 which could be used for assessment of the effects of diatomaceous biofilms on the resistance more experimental studies should be performed i e the physical nature of the effect of biofilm on the resistance is far from well understood schultz et al 2015 still the proposed δ u model can be useful in the prediction of increase in the resistance due to presence of diatomaceous biofilm for surface with 10 sc 25 namely the results obtained using the proposed δ u model can be considered as the minimum increase in the resistance because of the presence of biofilm which can be seen from the fig 3 as δ u values for the plate a6 are higher than δ u values for the rest of plates for surfaces with sc 10 the roughness function model is defined as follows 15 δ u 1 κ ln 1 06492 0 05332 k for k 4 0 for k 4 where κ is equal to 0 42 the proposed roughness function model for surfaces with sc 10 has satisfactory agreement with the experimental δ u values as shown in fig 5 as it can be seen from figs 2 4 and 5 the highest relative deviations from proposed roughness function models and experimentally obtained δ u values are present for lower k values thus the proposed δ u model for surfaces with sc 25 for k 4 gives smaller δ u values than experimentally obtained ones on the other hand the proposed δ u models for surfaces with 10 sc 25 and sc 10 at lower k values give higher δ u values than experimentally obtained ones however as said before the range of k values on the hull surfaces of full scale ships are often above 4 5 even for smaller k e f f values and even if lower k values are obtained then the increase in the frictional resistance is almost negligible therefore it can be concluded that the proposed roughness function models can be used for reliable assessment of the increase in the frictional resistance 4 numerical setup roughness function models shown within section 3 are implemented in the wall function of the commercial software package star ccm validation of the proposed δ u models is done by utilizing the numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow within star ccm at several rn tcf is modelled as steady phenomenon and finite volume method is used for discretization of rans equations rans equations are solved in a segregated manner and second order upwind scheme is used for the discretization of convection terms for validation study the test section of high rn tcf facility is modelled for the assessment of the increase in the frictional resistance for kcs the flat plate is modelled the test section of high rn tcf facility is described in detail in schultz et al 2015 and its main particulars are shown in table 2 the flat plate which represents kcs as well as 3d kcs are entirely immersed in the water in order to avoid influence of the boundaries on the obtained solution boundaries are placed far enough from the flat plate and 3d kcs according to ittc 2011b thus the outlet boundary is set to distance 2 4l where l is the length of the flat plate inlet boundary is set to distance l while other boundaries are set to distance 1 5l the computational domain is discretized utilizing a cut cell grid with prism layer mesh on the walls as shown in demirel et al 2014 the distance of the first cell from the rough wall should be set in order to have y value around 50 it should be noted that in full scale simulations y value in the first cell was kept around 150 furthermore it is important that y value in the first cell is higher than k because otherwise the coefficient of frictional resistance will be underpredicted eca and hoekstra 2011 the obtained y distribution at the upper plate b3 for tcf at r n 1 344 10 6 is shown in fig 6 while the obtained y distribution at the flat plate representing kcs at design speed is shown in fig 7 in the validation studies selected boundary conditions are as follows a velocity inlet for inlet boundary a pressure outlet for outlet boundary and no slip wall for the rest of boundaries which include walls of channel and plates in the numerical simulations of the equivalent flat plate shown in fig 8 the selected boundary conditions are shown in fig 9 as it can be seen from fig 9 the symmetry condition is used for right side and top thus only lower left side of the flat plate is modelled i e only 1 4 of the flat plate is modelled it should be noted that the same boundary conditions are applied in numerical simulation of viscous flow around 3d kcs the main particulars of kcs are shown in table 3 along with the main particulars of the flat plate representing kcs which are the same as taken in demirel et al 2017b three meshes are created for the purpose of verification study coarse medium and fine mesh in order to ensure y value around 50 and to keep y above k value as well as to ensure an appropriate transition from prism layer cells to the core mesh the mesh generation is done carefully for each rn thus the number of cells in the validation study varies with respect to rn in the validation studies coarse mesh has around 0 35 0 5 m cells medium mesh around 0 7 1 m cells and fine mesh around 1 4 2 m cells in the studies regarding the determination of the increase in the frictional resistance with flat plate coarse mesh has around 0 5 m cells medium mesh has around 1 1 m cells while fine mesh has around 2 5 m cells while in numerical simulations of 3d kcs coarse mesh has around 1 2 m cells medium mesh has around 2 37 m cells and fine mesh has around 4 6 m cells the cross section of the fine mesh used in validation studies is shown in fig 10 while in fig 11 the fine mesh used for the determination of the increase in the frictional resistance for 3d kcs is shown 4 1 verification and validation v v study in order to determine numerical uncertainty as well as to evaluate the order of convergence verification study is made since all numerical simulations are stopped after 1000 iterations and after 1000 iterations all residuals dropped at least eight orders of magnitude the iterative uncertainty can be considered as negligible therefore verification study is made for grid size and three meshes are made coarse medium and fine mesh grid refinement ratio r in validation studies is equal to 1 26 while in the numerical simulations for the determination of the increase in the frictional resistance for flat plate it is equal to 1 31 and for 3d kcs it is equal to 1 25 if monotonic convergence is achieved i e 0 ε 21 ε 32 1 generalized richardson extrapolation re can be used for determination of numerical uncertainty and errors order of accuracy is calculated as follows 16 p r e ln ε 32 ε 21 ln r where ε 32 s 3 s 2 ε 21 s 2 s 1 and s 1 s 2 s 3 are frictional resistances obtained with numerical simulations utilizing fine medium and coarse mesh respectively re error can be determined as follows 17 δ r e ε 21 r p r e 1 re solution s r e can then be estimated as the difference between s 1 and δ r e the factor of safety approach is used for determination of the numerical uncertainty u f s using this method u f s can be determined as follows 18 u f s f s δ r e where f s 1 25 is the safety factor the normalized uncertainties are obtained using the following equation 19 u u f s s r e 100 the obtained numerical results for frictional resistance coefficients c f cfd are validated against experimentally obtained frictional resistance coefficients c f exp relative deviations are calculated as follows 20 r d c f cfd c f exp c f exp 100 5 results within this section the obtained results are presented firstly the results of validation study for the proposed roughness function models are presented thus the obtained numerical results for the smooth plates in tcf as well as for rough plates in tcf utilizing the proposed δ u models are verified and validated against experimentally obtained results schultz et al 2015 once the proposed δ u models are validated they have been used for the estimation of the increase in frictional resistance and effective power for kcs for several surface conditions covered with biofilm 5 1 validation study the proposed δ u models shown with equations 13 15 are dependent on the both k and sc as k is a function of those variables in addition the selection of certain δ u model depends on sc in table 4 tested rough plates are shown along with their k sc k e f f values and applied δ u model it should be noted that k and sc shown in table 4 represent mean values taken from schultz et al 2015 while k e f f values represent round k e f f values obtained utilizing equation 11 5 1 1 smooth flat plates v v study for smooth plates in tcf is performed for seven rn and the obtained results are presented in tables 5 and 6 c f cfd is calculated using the following equation 21 c f cfd s r e 1 2 ρ u 2 s where s r e is the re solution for the frictional resistance of the smooth plate in tcf and s is the wetted surface of the flat plate and it equals to 0 304 m2 as it can be seen from table 5 the monotonic convergence is obtained for all rn tested the obtained u for grid size are relatively small and can be considered as the only source of numerical uncertainty since iteration uncertainty is negligible the obtained s r e show satisfactory agreement with the experimental results table 6 with the highest rd equal to 1 5 5 1 2 rough plates with sc 25 as can be seen from table 4 plates c6 and ac6 have sc 25 and therefore the appropriate roughness function model is shown with equation 13 v v study for plates c6 and ac6 in tcf is performed for seven rn and the obtained results are presented in tables 7 and 8 as it can be seen from table 7 monotonic convergence is achieved for all rn except for the highest rn tested where oscillatory convergence is achieved for both c6 and ac6 therefore the frictional resistance coefficient for rn 188172 is calculated utilizing s 1 as can be seen from table 8 the obtained frictional resistance coefficients for both c6 and ac6 show satisfactory agreement with the experimentally obtained frictional resistance coefficients with the highest rd equal to 2 813 5 1 3 rough plates with 10 sc 25 plates a3 b3 ac3 and b6 have sc in the range from 10 to 25 and therefore the appropriate δ u model is shown with equation 14 since the experiments in tcf for plates which were exposed 3 months were performed up to rn 114000 v v study for those plates is made for four rn in the range from 26882 to 107527 tables 9 and 10 for plate b6 v v study is made for seven rn in the range from 26882 to 188172 tables 11 and 12 as it can be seen from tables 9 and 11 monotonic convergence is achieved for all rn except for the plate b6 at the highest rn tested where oscillatory convergence is achieved therefore c f cfd at rn 188172 is calculated utilizing s 1 as can be seen from tables 10 and 12 the obtained frictional resistance coefficients for all tested plates show satisfactory agreement with the experimentally obtained frictional resistance coefficients with the highest rd equal to 6 777 the highest rd is achieved at the lowest rn 26882 which can be explained with relatively higher numerical uncertainty obtained at this rn for both b3 and b6 plates than numerical uncertainty obtained at other rn and for other plates at rn 26882 the obtained numerical uncertainty for b3 is equal to 7 129 while for b6 is equal to 7 519 if c f cfd for these two plates at rn 26882 was calculated based on the numerical solution obtained utilizing fine grid rd from the experimental solution would be 0 499 for b3 and 0 354 for b6 that is to say it can be considered that all numerical solutions show satisfactory agreement with the experimentally obtained frictional resistance coefficients 5 1 4 rough plates with sc 10 the plate c3 has sc 10 and therefore δ u model appropriate for describing the roughness effects is shown with equation 15 v v study for plate c3 is performed for four rn in the range from 26882 to 107527 tables 13 and 14 as can be seen from table 13 monotonic convergence is achieved for all rn tested and the obtained u are below 1 in table 14 the obtained rd between c f cfd and c f exp are shown and all rd are below 1 i e satisfactory agreement between numerical and experimental results is obtained 5 1 5 discussion on the validation study as said before satisfactory agreement between numerically and experimentally obtained frictional resistance coefficients is achieved for all rn tested also the obtained u are below 1 except for plates b3 and b6 at rn 26882 where the obtained u are below 7 6 furthermore the proposed δ u models can accurately predict effects of the biofilm on the increase in resistance even for surfaces which have small difference in k e f f this can be seen in tables 10 and 12 for plates which have 10 sc 25 i e those plates have same roughness function model for example plate a3 has k e f f equal to 135 μm while plate ac3 has k e f f equal to 125 μm and plate b3 has k e f f equal to 85 μm while plate b6 has k e f f equal to 90 μm even though the differences between k e f f for these two sets of rough plates is very small the proposed roughness function model successfully takes this into account thus the frictional resistance coefficient increases with the increase of k e f f if the same δ u model is applied accurate determination of k on the rough surface is very important since δ u depends solely on k thus if k is accurately predicted c f can be also accurately computed demirel et al 2014 since u τ is not uniformly distributed even on the surface of the flat plate k values vary on the surface fig 12 this is important benefit of utilizing cfd and δ u models for determination of the effects of roughness rather than utilizing granville similarity method demirel et al 2017b thus once δ u model is proposed and implemented within wall function the determination of the effects of roughness on any arbitrary body can be more accurately predicted utilizing cfd than granville similarity method the comparison between k values obtained in numerical simulations and experiments is shown in figs 13 and 14 since k values vary on the plate k is obtained by averaging k values on the surface of rough plate while k is obtained utilizing equation 12 as can be seen from figs 13 and 14 the satisfactory agreement between experimentally and numerically obtained k values is obtained with the highest rd between k and k equal to 1 84 for the plate ac6 at rn 188172 therefore it can be concluded that k for surfaces covered with biofilm can be obtained correctly utilizing the proposed roughness function models for a given k e f f 5 2 the effect of the biofilm on the increase of the frictional resistance for kcs the proposed δ u models are used for estimation of the increase in frictional resistance for kcs for several surface conditions covered with biofilm at design speed i e 24 knots firstly the frictional resistance of the very thin smooth flat plate representing kcs as well as of 3d kcs is determined utilizing three meshes table 15 monotonic convergence is obtained for both flat plate and 3d kcs and therefore s r e solution is used for the calculation of c f cfd the obtained c f cfd is compared with the obtained c f utilizing schoenherr line as follows 22 0 242 c f log c f r n c f utilizing schoenherr line at this rn is equal to 1 377 10 3 the obtained rd between c f cfd for the flat plate and c f obtained utilizing schoenherr line is relatively small i e it is equal to 0 842 while for 3d kcs is somewhat higher and it is equal to 4 218 this was expected since schoenherr line is made for flat plates thus when c f cfd re obtained for 3d kcs is compared with the c f obtained using grigson friction line farkas et al 2018 the obtained rd is equal to 1 5 the effect of the biofilm on the increase in the frictional resistance for kcs is investigated for eight surface conditions shown in table 16 firstly numerical simulations of viscous flow around rough flat plates representing kcs are performed using fine mesh then the obtained c f are compared with results obtained with granville s similarity law analysis using the experimental data which is detailly explained in schultz 2007 table 17 the investigated surface conditions shown in table 16 can be classified as soft fouling i e slime and grass naval ships technical manual 2002 the fouling rating fr scale proposed within naval ships technical manual 2002 presents ten most commonly fouling patterns and soft fouling can have fr from 10 to 30 depending on the severity schultz 2007 has divided soft fouling into two categories i e deteriorated coating or light slime and heavy slime which have fr 10 20 and fr 30 respectively schultz has suggested that deteriorated coating or light slime has average coating roughness equal to 300 μm while heavy slime has average coating roughness equal to 600 μm within table 17 the obtained c f cfd for surface conditions shown in table 16 are presented along with c f obtained using granville s similarity law and rd between c f cfd and c f granville also the increase in c f because of the presence of biofilm and the percentage increase in c f are shown as well the percentage of increase in c f is calculated utilizing the obtained c f cfd for the smooth plate as can be seen from table 17 the results obtained using the proposed roughness function models have rd below 1 1 when compared to the results which are obtained using granvile s similarity law analysis using the experimentally obtained δ u values therefore it can be concluded that the proposed cfd model can be used for the prediction of biofilm effects on the frictional resistance of full scale flat plates furthermore from table 17 it can be seen that the increase in c f significantly varies depending on k and sc thus δ c f for investigated surface conditions varies from 0 112 to 39 545 once the proposed cfd model has been validated for full scale flat plate representing kcs double body simulations of 3d kcs for eight surface conditions are made using fine mesh the obtained results are shown in table 18 along with the comparison with the results obtained using granville s similarity law analysis as can be seen from table 18 the obtained rd between c f cfd for 3d kcs and c f granville are higher than rd between c f cfd for the flat plate and c f granville this was expected since granville s similarity law analysis is based on constant k value for certain rn as friction velocity varies even across flat plate it can be concluded that k will vary across the ship hull it should be noted that the highest increases in c f are obtained for 3d kcs as was obtained in demirel et al 2017b fig 15 the highest increase in c f is obtained for 3d kcs for surface condition 2 and this increase is equal to 40 106 in order to determine the increase in effective power it is assumed that the form factor value and the wave resistance coefficient remain the same for rough and smooth surface conditions the form factor value for kcs is taken as k 0 1 demirel et al 2017b the total resistance coefficient can be divided as follows 23 c t 1 k c f c w where c w is wave resistance coefficient which is assumed to be the same for model and full scale ship since it is assumed that k and c w are the same for model and full scale ship as well as for smooth and rough surface condition utilizing the experimental data hino 2005 regarding the total resistance of kcs model c w for ship design speed can be determined as follows 24 c w c t exp 1 1 c f cfd where c t exp is the total resistance coefficient taken from hino 2005 and c f cfd is the frictional resistance coefficient obtained utilizing cfd for smooth equivalent plate thus c w for kcs at ship design speed is equal to 2 2095 10 3 the increase in effective power can be estimated as follows 25 δ p e r t r v r t s v r t s v 100 1 k δ c f 1 k c f s c w 100 where r t r is the total resistance for rough surface r t s is the total resistance for smooth surface v is the ship speed i e 24 knots and δ c f is the increase in the frictional resistance because of the presence of the biofilm the obtained δ p e are shown in table 19 and fig 16 these results can be compared to results presented in demirelb et al 2017 where the authors obtained the increase in the effective power equal to 18 1 for kcs for deteriorated coating or light slime namely the investigated surface conditions within this study can be described as very light slime and light slime it should be noted that the obtained increases in the frictional resistance and the effective power presented in tables 17 19 are specific for the ship investigated in this research as well as for surface conditions presented in table 16 however the one can easily determine the increase in the frictional resistance or in the effective power due to presence of biofilm utilizing the proposed δ u models for any arbitrary body 6 conclusion roughness function models for surfaces covered with diatomaceous biofilms were established based on the experimental data presented in schultz et al 2015 the roughness length scale proposed in schultz et al 2015 was adopted and utilized for the calculation of the roughness reynolds number this roughness length scale depends on both the biofilm average height and the percentage of the surface coverage depending on sc three δ u models were proposed and implemented in the wall function within star ccm therefore the determination of the effect of biofilm on the resistance of any arbitrary body is enabled and the average biofilm height and percentage of the surface coverage are the only required input data in order to validate the proposed models numerical simulations of the turbulent channel flow were performed for seven different rough plates firstly verification study was carried out for both smooth and rough plates at several rn the calculated normalized uncertainties were mostly below 1 and these uncertainties are related solely to grid size relative deviations between numerically and experimentally obtained c f for all rn were sufficiently small ranging from 0 029 to 6 777 it should be noted that the most of rd were below 2 9 except for plates b3 and b6 at rn 26882 where rd were equal to 5 518 and 6 777 respectively however the higher rd obtained for those plates can be described through higher u and if s 1 was used for the determination of c f cfd rd would drop to 0 499 for b3 and 0 354 for b6 another important aspect for valid assessment of the frictional resistance is to obtain the correct k value therefore the numerically and experimentally obtained k values were compared and the obtained rd were sufficiently small i e the highest rd was obtained for plate ac6 at rn 188172 and was equal to 1 84 furthermore it was shown that the proposed δ u models can successfully predict the effects of the biofilm on the increase in resistance even if surfaces differ slightly with respect to k e f f therefore it can be concluded that the proposed δ u models can be used for the assessment of the effects of biofilm on the resistance for any arbitrary body utilizing the surface roughness measurements only rather than determining k s hydrodynamically however before drawing any definitive conclusion in the prediction of the effects of the biofilm further studies should be made considering the lack of the experimental data regarding these effects the main reason for this is that the flow around soft fouled surfaces is more complex than the flow around hard fouled surfaces therefore to the best of the authors knowledge there is no generally accepted method for the evaluation of the effects of a given surface covered with biofilm on the resistance the aim of this study was to propose a robust δ u models which could be used for the determination of the effects of the diatomaceous biofilm based on the available experimental data schultz et al 2015 once the proposed δ u models were validated they were used for the prediction of the increase in the frictional resistance for the very thin flat plate representing kcs for eight surface conditions those eight surface conditions varied with respect to k and sc and could be described as very light slime and light slime the obtained increases in c f were compared with the results obtained using granville s similarity law scaling method and the satisfactory agreement was achieved after the proposed cfd model has been validated for full scale flat plate representing kcs the increase in c f has been determined for 3d kcs utilizing double body simulations the obtained results were also compared with the results obtained using granville s similarity law scaling method and the obtained rd were higher than rd between c f flat plate and c f granville this was expected since the friction velocity varies across ship hull while in granville s similarity law scaling method it was assumed as constant the obtained increase in c f significantly varied depending on k and sc up to 40 106 which was obtained for 3d kcs and for surface condition 2 additionally the increase in the effective power was estimated for those eight surface conditions and the obtained increase varied up to 16 706 which was obtained for 3d kcs and for surface condition 2 however it should be noted that the increase in the effective power was estimated under the assumption that the form factor value and the wave resistance coefficient remained the same for smooth and rough surfaces demirel et al 2017b have shown that roughness influences the wave resistance i e that wave resistance coefficient decreases for rough surfaces therefore the future studies will be concentrated on the assessment of the increase in frictional viscous pressure and wave resistance due to the presence of biofilm by utilizing the proposed δ u models on a full scale ship what is more the assessment of the effect of biofilm on the propeller operating point could be investigated if the proposed δ u models are applied in the numerical simulations of the self propulsion test thus the determination of the additional costs regarding the biofouling of the ship hull with biofilms could be assessed more reliably acknowledgement

23093,the current study investigates different cavitation inception prediction methods to characterize tip vortex flows around an elliptical foil and a high skewed low noise propeller adapted inception models cover different levels of complexity including wetted flow eulerian cavitation simulations and rayleigh plesset bubble dynamics models the tip vortex flows are simulated by implicit large eddy simulation on appropriate grid resolutions for tip vortex propagation at least 32 cells per vortex diameter according to previous studies guidelines the results indicate that the cavitation inception predictions by the minimum pressure criterion of the wetted flow analysis are similar to weak water inception measurements in the wetted flow analysis the proposed energy criterion is noted to provide reasonably accurate inception predictions similar to the predictions by eulerian cavitation simulations with much lower computational costs comparison between high speed videos and numerical results of the propeller shows the capability of the numerical methodology in predicting tip vortex structures in different conditions the interaction between vortices and their impact on the pressure field and the cavitation inception are also highlighted the strong dependency of the inception on the initial nuclei sizes are demonstrated and it is shown that for weaker tip vortices this dependency becomes more significant keywords tip vortex inception cavitation elliptical foil propeller les 1 introduction when a fluid passes over a finite span lifting foil close to the tip the pressure differential between the upper and lower surfaces of the wing drives the fluid from the high pressure side on the lower surface to the low pressure side on the upper surface this creates a highly three dimensional rotational vortex flow arndt et al 1991 maines and arndt 1997 souders and platzer 1981 the swirling pattern of the vortex lowers the pressure in the vortex core and therefore in hydrodynamic cases cavitation can incept in the vortex core consequently tip vortex characteristics of a propeller determine its inception behaviour and therefore the boundaries of the cavitation bucket chart of the propeller kuiper 1981 experimental measurements of tip vortex cavitation tvc have revealed that tip vortex cavitation inception tvci is characterized by either the sudden appearance of a continuous cavity or the intermittent appearance of an elongated bubble extending axially over a relatively small portion of the tip vortex higuchi et al 1989 arndt and keller 1992 the parameter determining the inception type of a tip vortex is the nuclei capture property cavitation occurs in the core of a tip vortex only if a nucleus has enough time to reach the core and then trigger cavitation boulon et al 1997 it is well reported that this behaviour of a tip vortex depends on the nuclei radius initial location and the vortex circulation arndt and keller 1992 ligneul and latorre 1993 brianon marjollet and inception 1997 in some of the experimental measurements the effects of nuclei on tvci are addressed in the context of weak water no tensile strength and strong water withstands pressure below the vapour pressure among different forms of cavitation on a blade bubble cavitation and tvc are found to be more sensitive to the nuclei distributions pennings et al 2015a arndt et al 2015 cavitation formation e g tvci depends on the flow reynolds number and the blade geometry arndt and keller 1992 fruman et al 1995 van wijngaarden et al 2005 in correlations or scaling laws the dependency can be represented by a dependency on the lift coefficient measurements of vortex singing on elliptical foils with three different cross sections maines and arndt 1997 showed vortex boundary layer interactions are strongly coupled to the separation characteristics of each foil cross section and lift coefficient for an elliptical foil with naca 66 2 415 cross section the relation is found to be σ i 0 068 c l 2 r e 0 4 in this relation the effects of flow unsteadiness and water quality are neglected the blade load distribution can also contribute to tvc kuiper 2001 baek et al 2015 with a highly loaded tip vorticity is generated in the trailing edge of a propeller blade resulting in a trailing vortex formation at low tip loading separation still occurs close to the tip while the trailing vortex is much weaker leading to a typical local tip vortex formation an unloaded tip forces the loading towards inner radii and at these inner radii dubbioso et al 2014 leading edge separation and therefore a leading edge vortex may be formed non uniform flow field pereira et al 2016 muscari et al 2013 dubbioso et al 2013 and blade surface roughness dreyer 2015 felli and falchi 2011 are the other effective parameters on the type of the tip vortex of a blade the inception point can experimentally be determined either through visual observations of cavitation appearance e g cavitation volume or tip vortex diameter arndt and keller 1992 savio et al 2009 or through acoustic measurements of the noise levels and then signal analysis of bubble bursting lee et al 2013 kim et al 2015 song et al 2017 however as the tip vortex involves small scales of flow dynamics it is very difficult to experimentally measure all relevant flow features e g the pressure at the vortex core where cavitation inception occurs these methods are indirect in this regard numerical simulations can be employed to give further insights on tip vortex properties that experimental tests may not be able to provide shen et al 2001 schot et al 2014 asnaghi et al 2017a 2017b from the numerical simulation perspective tip vortex flows are also known to be challenging flows to study because of the presence of anisotropic turbulence and the large gradients of pressure and velocity in all three directions especially across the vortex core the cavitation inception complicates the flow physics even further as it depends on additional flow parameters such as the nuclei distribution residence time and turbulence fluctuation which are very difficult to control during experimental tests as well as in numerical simulations ligneul and latorre 1993 hsiao and chahine 2005 park et al 2009 shen and dimotakis 1989 guilmineau et al 2017 the co existence of phase change and tip vortex creates a complex flow structure in the tip region of propellers which involves very small scale dynamics both in time and spatial coordinates understanding the physics of these flows is important in finding the tvci speed in order to prevent or control the occurrence of cavitation on propellers bensow and bark 2010 vesting et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 the numerical methods to determine the cavitation inception can generally be classified into three categories wetted flow analysis eulerian cavitation simulations and lagrangian bubble dynamics approaches in the simplest and computationally cheapest approach the wetted flow results are used to determine the inception points through some relations or simplified correlations between inception points and the flow properties in the second approach cavitation simulations have to be conducted to obtain the vapour distribution in each operating condition consequently the method is more costly than the wetted flow approach the approach that includes the nuclei effects and models bubble dynamics behaviours in order to determine inception points is the lagrangian bubble dynamics approach this approach can bring more details on the interactions of the nuclei and tip vortex with an extra cost of modelling the nuclei dynamics in the employed wetted flow approach the minimum pressure criterion is the easiest way to determine the inception point in this method the operating condition when the lowest pressure value of a wetted flow falls below the saturation pressure is considered as the inception point considering the fact that cavitation inception is essentially a wetted flow problem the advantage of the method is its simplicity as it only requires the pressure field of the wetted flow simulation to determine inception points as the method does not include the nuclei contribution on the inception prediction it usually leads to early prediction of cavitation inception the second method of the wetted flow approach is to employ a semi empirical relation in order to determine inception points a semi empirical relation has to be derived based on experimental measurements of the inception behaviour each relation has to be calibrated for a specific geometry e g wing or propeller in order to correctly include the geometry effects the relations may also have some limitations on the range of reynolds number or water quality the third method proposed by the authors is to consider the energy balance between the wetted flow results and corresponding two phase cavitating conditions the model assumes that in the wetted flow results the region with pressure lower than the saturation pressure has a stored energy this stored energy is the energy that is released during the cavitation formation to provide the required energy for the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the vapour phase the model computes this stored energy in the wetted flow simulations and provides an estimated vapour volume that can be generated and through that can determine the inception point in order to determine the inception point by eulerian cavitation simulations the minimum vapour volume detectable during the inception measurements has to be specified the cavitation flow simulation condition that leads to this vapour volume is considered as the inception point the approach that include the nuclei effects and model bubble dynamics behaviour in order to determine the inception point can itself be classified into three different groups according to the level of the complexity kim et al 2014 the most advanced method in this approach considers the coupling between bubbles and the flow field the bubbles are injected upstream and then the lagrangian equations of motion are solved for each bubble to track its path as in this method the two way coupling is considered the sizes and distribution of bubbles affect the velocity and pressure field of the medium flow ma et al 2017 yakubov et al 2013 hsiao chahine in order to include cavitation a separate rayleigh plesset rp equation is solved for each bubble to obtain the bubble radius at each time step since the relation between the bubble motion equation and the medium flow is non linear several inner loops have to be used between the equations to assure the convergence of the results in order to reduce the computational costs of this method multiscale two phase flow eulerian lagrangian approaches are developed to include tracking of micro bubbles in the micro scale along with capturing large cavities at the macro scale hsiao ma chahine the impact of non spherical bubbles can also be considered by modifying the rp equation choi and chahine 2004 2007 however it is reported that the shape of bubbles only becomes important during the bubble collapse time and consequently the collapse pressure pulses and it has a little impact on the cavitation inception prediction the second category so called the uncoupled method only includes effects of the fluid on bubbles and assumes that effects of bubbles on the flow field are negligible thus the paths of the bubbles are computed based on lagrangian equations of motions using the background eulerian flow field this reduces the computational requirements as there is no need for inner loops between the bubbles equations of motion and the medium flow navier stokes equations in the third model adopted in this study paths of bubbles are also defined by the simulation of the wetted flow this removes the requirement for solving bubbles equations of motion and only the rp equation is needed to be solved by considering the surrounding pressure field to determine bubbles radii in this work tip vortex simulations and analysis are conducted on an elliptical foil arndt 1995 2002 and a highly skewed low noise propeller in order to explore the possibility of using cfd to support advanced propeller design work the vortex structures around the elliptical foil resemble the propeller tip vortex behaviour while making it possible to be tested and evaluated in more details both experimentally and numerically the tip vortex at the selected operating conditions is relatively stationary which reduces the computational requirements the experiments used for validation were done by pennings at delft technical university pennings et al 2015a pennings 2016 the selected propeller is from a research series of five bladed highly skewed propellers which has a low effective tip load and is typical for yachts and ro pax vessels where it is very important to suppress and limit propeller induced vibration and noise the propeller was tested in the cavitation tunnel at the hydrodynamics research centre of rolls royce ab kristinehamn sweden here we analyze the tip vortex behaviour of the propeller in wetted and cavitating conditions focusing on the cavitation inception characteristics in the previous studies by the authors the wetted flow analysis of the tip vortex flow including the numerical settings and modelling e g importance of spatial mesh resolution and turbulence modelling are investigated on the elliptical foil asnaghi et al 2017a 2017b the current study extends the research into the tip vortex flows around a high skew propeller and also includes the tip vortex cavitation inception analysis the cavitation inception predictions on the elliptical foil and the propeller are presented and discussed 2 governing equations using the low pass filtering approach the conservation equations of mass and momentum in les models can be written as 1 ρ m t ρ m u i x i 0 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j p x i x j s i j b i j ρ m g i where the over bar denotes low pass filtered quantities and b i j ρ u i u j u i u j is the subgrid stress tensor here ρ m is the mixture density as defined in eq 14 s i j 2 μ d i j is the strain rate tensor and d i j is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient 3 d i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in implicit les iles no explicit model is applied for b i j instead the numerical dissipation is considered enough to mimic the action of b i j fureby 2006 rider 2006 bensow and bark 2010 asnaghi 2015 therefore for the momentum convection term a relatively dissipative scheme should be used to provide appropriate numerical diffusion in the solution procedure for the propeller simulations the detailed inceptions studies are based on iles but additional steady state simulations are performed to cover the full operating range of the propeller the iles model then acts as a laminar steady simulation model 2 1 cavitation inception experimental assessments of cavitation are not straightforward and suffer from large uncertainties pennings et al 2015a arndt et al 2015 this comes from the complex dependency of the tip vortex inception on the reynolds number through the boundary layer development on the blades shear layer vorticity interaction in the blade wake and primarily nuclei distribution and its interactions with the low pressure region of the vortex fruman et al 1995 arndt 2002 schot et al 2014 further there are technical difficulties in distinguishing the actual inception point as a result this makes numerical validation of inception points almost out of reach even though wetted tip vortex flows can be predicted reasonably well by consideration of some simplifications however some methods are proposed to numerically predict inception points including minimum pressure criterion semi empirical relation energy of low pressure region eulerian cavitation simulations and bubble dynamics method although exact validation is difficult the intention is to evaluate the possibility to apply such methods for design considerations when ranking performance between designs 2 1 1 wetted flow based models the minimum pressure criterion is the simplest model of the wetted flow approach where no extra equation needs to be solved and post processing of the results is sufficient the cavitation inception point is obtained from the pressure field of the wetted flow as 4 σ i c p m i n this equation implies that cavitation occurs when the minimum pressure in the flow reaches the saturation pressure the second method is to employ a semi empirical relation obtained from a curve fitted to the experimental data the curve expresses the dependency of the tip vortex cavitation inception on the reynolds number foil geometry and also nuclei distribution for the elliptical foil in weak water arndt et al arndt 1995 suggested the following formula 5 σ i 0 068 c l 2 r e 0 4 in this equation c l is the lift coefficient and r e is the flow reynolds number based on the foil root chord length this method is also a post processing tool once the empirical relation has been established and therefore only wetted flow simulations are required to determine the c l if it is assumed that at the saturation pressure liquid and vapour phases are in an equilibrium state liquid with pressure lower than saturation pressure would have a stored potential energy this stored potential energy which is released during the phase change from liquid to vapour can be roughly estimated as 6 e s t o r e d p s a t p where is the volume of the region with pressure lower than the saturation pressure if the heat transfer and work performed by expansion of this area during the phase change are neglected this stored energy is consumed only to transfer liquid into vapour considering the conservation of energy the following relation between the stored energy and the mass of the transferred liquid into vapour can be achieved 7 p s a t p m l v l where m l v is the mass of the liquid which has been transferred into vapour and l is the mass transfer latent heat knowing that the mass of the generated vapour is equal to m l v the volume of generated vapour is 8 v p s a t p ρ v l this approach will be used as a post processing tool on wetted flow results in order to estimate the vapour volume by eq 8 the estimated vapour volume is compared with the vapour volume visually detectable during the experimental tests to find the cavitation inception point 2 1 2 eulerian cavitation simulations minimum vapour volume criterion this approach assumes that in the visual detection of tip vortex cavitation inception a certain volume of vapour is required in order to be detectable by observers if we assume that the tip vortex cavitation at its inception state has a cylindrical shape with diameter of 1 mm and length of 3 mm the volume of a corresponding cylinder would be 2 365 m m 3 by assuming that the vapour volume fraction of this cylinder is 10 the corresponding vapour volume would be 0 2365 m m 3 then the cavitation inception point would be a condition which leads to this amount of vapour volume in the simulations for this method eulerian cavitation simulations at different conditions i e cavitation numbers are required in order to find the inception point 2 1 3 bubble dynamics the rayleigh plesset rp equation which governs the dynamics of a single spherical bubble is 9 r d 2 r d t 2 3 2 d r d t 2 4 ν l r d r d t 2 s ρ l r p b t p t ρ l where r is the radius of the bubble ν l is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid s is the liquid surface tension ρ l is the liquid density p b t is the pressure inside the bubble and p t is the pressure at the far field the pressure inside the bubble is the summation of the vapour pressure and the non condensable gas pressure 10 p b t p v t p g t at the equilibrium condition the rp equation reduces to 11 p b p 2 s r therefore at the initial condition and by equilibrium condition assumption the gas pressure can be obtained as follows 12 p g 0 p 0 2 s r 0 p v by the ideal gas assumption for the non condensable gas content the gas pressure at any time can be derived from 13 p g p g 0 r 0 r t 3 γ where γ is equal to one for the isothermal bubble expansion the isothermal assumption is valid for bubble dynamics governed mostly by inertia effects e g the cavitation tunnel at temperature 20 c there are basically two ways to include the bubble modelling into the flow simulations uncoupled approach and coupled approach in the coupled approach the lagrangian equations of motion are solved for the bubbles along with the mean flow conservation equations as well as turbulence equations the interacting forces between bubbles and the mean flow can also be included the rp equation is then solved for each bubble at each time instance to recalculate the internal pressure and bubble radius depending on the number of injected bubbles the coupled simulations increases the computational cost in a simplified uncoupled approach it is assumed that due to the small bubble sizes contributions of bubble forces and their presence on the mean flow are negligible therefore the lagrangian equations of motion can be solved for the bubbles as post processing of the mean flow field in this study the uncoupled approach is simplified even further by neglecting the lagrangian equations of motion and assuming that bubbles are travelling through specific paths e g streamlines of the wetted flow or in the core of the tip vortex the rp equation then is solved by considering the surroundings conditions of these paths this simplified approach can be used for cases where the possible cavitation inception paths are known such as the tip vortex trajectory where cavitation incepts primarily in the tip vortex core 2 2 cavitation and mass transfer modelling in order to predict the cavitation inception by employing the minimum vapour volume cavitating flows are needed to be simulated at different operating conditions in this study a transport equation model tem is adopted to simulate the two phase cavitating flow in the eulerian framework where both the vapour and liquid phases are treated as incompressible and the liquid volume fraction function α l is used to specify the distribution of each phase vaz et al 2017 negrato et al 2017 taking advantage of the homogenous mixture model which assumes there is no slip velocity between phases the mixture flow properties can be calculated as 14 ρ m α l ρ l 1 α l ρ v μ m α l μ l 1 α l μ v the tem is modified by adding a source term to mimic the mass transfer between phases 15 α l t α l u i x i m ρ l in this study the modified schnerr sauer model is used as the mass transfer model eq 16 where the vapourization coefficient c v of the original model are modified based on the velocity strain rate time scale and the mean flow

μ γ p sat where γ 2 d i j d i j the average nuclei per liquid volume is considered constant and equal to n 0 10 8 and the initial nuclei diameter is d nuc 10 6 m in the current study the time scale of the mean flow t l u is employed here to normalize the velocity strain rate value further information regarding the concepts and results of this modification can be found in asnaghi et al 2017c 3 case description 3 1 elliptical foil the computational domain of the foil which mimics the cavitation tunnel in the laboratory for ship hydrodynamics at delft technical university pennings et al 2015b schot et al 2014 is presented in fig 1 the geometry of the foil is an elliptical planform having the naca 66 2 415 as cross section profile the foil with different scale factors has been tested at different institutes in various operating conditions both in wetted and cavitating conditions arndt et al 1991 arndt and keller 1992 pennings et al 2015b schot et al 2014 the experimental data of the cavitation inception used for comparisons are obtained by visual techniques arndt and keller 1992 arndt 1995 this however involves more uncertainties into the measurements as it depends on the general judgement of the observer the current simulations are conducted for the foil with the angle of attack 9 and at a constant inlet velocity of 6 8 m s and a fixed pressure outlet boundary the reynolds number based on the root chord length c 0 0 1254 m is r e 8 95 10 5 the no slip condition is applied on the foil and bottom surface and other boundaries are treated as a slip condition the cavitation number is defined by 18 σ p p s a t 1 2 ρ u r e f 2 where p s a t is the saturation pressure and u r e f is the reference velocity i e the inlet velocity in order to identify vortical structures the q criterion is employed this criterion represents the local balance between the shear strain rate tensor and the deformation rate tensor hunt et al 1998 kolar 2007 19 q 1 2 ω i j ω i j d i j d i j where 20 ω i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in a mesh dependency study conducted by the authors asnaghi et al 2016 to find appropriate mesh resolutions to predict tip vortex flows using iles in the near field region it is found that the optimum mesh resolution should have at least 32 grid points across the vortex diameter this number is related to the openfoam numerics on this mesh topology using second order schemes with non orthogonality corrections in table 1 specifications of the elliptical foil mesh resolutions are presented p2s2wake is the mesh resolution having 32 grid points across the vortex diameter in the near field region and p1s1 is a coarser mesh having 16 grid points across the vortex diameter the p1s1 is included in this study to evaluate the mesh resolution impact on the tip vortex cavitation inception analysis the computational domain consist of hexahedral cells fig 2 generated by starccm different refinement regions are defined to refine the resolution up to the tip vortex region having 10 mm for the inner refinement cylinder irc and 60 mm for the outer refinement cylinder orc diameters respectively it should be noted that the inner refinement cylinder also covers the tip surface of the foil therefore the surface resolution at that region follows the inner refinement cylinder resolution in the p2s2wake resolution an extra refinement is also applied in the foil wake region the boundary layer in all of the resolutions are fully resolved in the wall normal direction where based on the inlet velocity y 1 the prismatic layers consists of 20 layers having extrusion factor of 1 15 to provide appropriate boundary layer resolution around the foil the baseline mesh resolution on the foil gives both x and z 250 with finer resolutions provided at the leading edge and trailing edge of the blades and where tip refinement is applied 3 2 low noise high skew propeller the basic design of the propeller is from a research series of five bladed highly skewed propellers having low effective tip load and are typical for yachts and ro pax vessels where it is very important to suppress and limit propeller induced vibration and noise the main or first source of noise for this type of propellers is cavitation in the tip region the tip vortex cavitation and therefore the noise and vibration are sensitive to modification of the blade geometry in the tip region in order to investigate the influence of the tip shape and loading on the cavitation behaviour different designs have been suggested and tested at the rrhrc cavitation tunnel the hydrodynamics research centre of rolls royce ab kristinehamn sweden the focus of the current work is on the analysis of the open water performance of one of the propellers and its behaviour in wetted and cavitating conditions the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller is defined by using non dimensional thrust and torque coefficients and the advance ratio equations 21 23 21 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 22 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 23 j v a n d in these equations d is the propeller diameter n is the rotational speed of the propeller in rev sec ρ is the fluid density t is the propeller thrust force q is the propeller shaft torque and v a is mean inflow velocity towards the propeller plane the open water efficiency of a propeller is defined by 24 η o t v a 2 π n q j k t 2 π k q 3 2 1 experimental setup the schematic of the experimental setup and cavitation tunnel used to test the propeller are plotted in fig 3 in this setup the water flows from left to right with a constant velocity after mounting the propeller the operating condition is set by adjusting the water velocity revolution rate of the propeller and the pressure of the tunnel a pitot tube mounted on the lower part of the side wall of the tunnel measures the inflow velocity it is installed far enough from the wall to be sure that it stands outside the boundary layer developed on the walls of the test tunnel there are also a few pressure sensors to measure the pressure at different locations of the tunnel the thrust and torque are also measured in the rotational axis direction the open water ow performance of the propeller is measured and evaluated at different j values and different cavitation numbers in all of the conditions thrust and torque are measured in order to obtain the performance chart of the propeller the cavitation observed in the experiments is sensitive to the nuclei content of the water and since the cavitation tunnel is a free surface tunnel the water becomes de gased after some time running at low cavitation number the gas content was therefore closely monitored and measurements were taken to keep the nuclei content on an acceptable level during the tests the cavitation behaviour observed in the experiment by a high speed video recording 20000 frame per second was relatively intermittent and varied from blade to blade the latter one can be considered to be related to the high sensitivity of the cavitation on these propellers to the pitch adjustment of blade mounting a deviation of 0 01 together with possible manufacturing discrepancy between the blades can result in substantial differences in the amount of cavitation occurring on each blade scale effects and water quality can be other typical reasons for the intermittency of the cavitation by taking advantage of high speed recordings the visual detection of cavitation inception is adopted 3 2 2 numerical setup the computational domain of the propeller is presented in fig 4 in order to model the moving mesh i e relative motion between the propeller and the external domain the computational domain has been decomposed into two regions connected to each other through ami arbitrary mesh interpolation boundaries while the outer region is stationary the rotation of the region close to the propeller has been handled either by solid body motion with sliding mesh for unsteady computations or by mrf for steady computations the domain is simplified to a cylinder extending 4d upstream the propeller and 8d downstream of the propeller where d 0 2543 m is the diameter of the propeller the simulations are conducted at a constant inlet velocity and a fixed pressure outlet boundary the advance ratio of the propeller is then set by adjusting the rotational rate of the propeller the no slip wall boundary condition is used for the propeller and the shaft the outer cylinder boundary is set as a slip boundary to reduce the mesh resolution requirements far from the propeller then the blockage effects are considered in comparing the numerical results with related experimental measurements the distribution of the propeller mesh is presented in fig 5 different refinement boxes are applied to provide finer resolutions around the rotating propeller region fig 5a similar to the elliptical foil mesh description the boundary layer on the propeller blades are fully resolved in the wall normal direction y 1 the prismatic layers consists of 20 layers having extrusion factor of 1 15 similar to the mesh of the elliptical foil the baseline mesh resolution on the foil gives x and z 250 where finer resolutions are provided at the leading edge and trailing edge of the blades further finer resolution is achieved where tip refinement is applied the nominal values given above are calculated based on the inlet velocity and the propeller diameter as the reference length and verified afterwords the tip vortex refinement is applied on one blade only where three helical shape refinement zones are defined based on the primary vortex trajectory fig 6 the refinement zones cover the tip of the blade and therefore provide more refined grid resolutions on the tip of the refined blade fig 5b these helical refinement regions provide spatial resolutions as fine as 0 2 mm 0 1 mm and 0 05 mm in h1 h2 and h3 regions respectively the resolution of the tip region without the tip refinement h0 is set to be equal 0 4 mm details of spatial resolutions are presented in table 2 the tip vortex inception analysis is conduced on the finest resolution propeller h3 and the other resolutions are employed to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis to the grid resolution 4 solution procedure the openfoam 2 3 x package used in this study for numerical simulation is an open source code written in c to model and simulate fluid dynamics and continuum mechanics openfoam 2015 the spatial discretisation is performed using a cell centred collocated finite volume fv method for unstructured meshes with arbitrary cell shapes and a multi step scheme is used for the time derivatives see openfoam 2015 for more details on the discretisation and the numerical schemes used in openfoam the near wall normal resolution y 1 is calculated by considering the reference velocity of the flow i e the inlet velocity therefore spalding wall model is employed to correct the turbulent viscosity at a few cells where the near wall normal resolution may exceed 5 respectively for steady simulations the simple algorithm and for unsteady simulations the pimple algorithm are used to solve the coupling between the velocity and pressure the pimple algorithm is a merge of the simple and piso algorithms where the piso loop is complemented by an outer iteration loop and possible under relaxation of the variables see asnaghi 2015 for further details for good convergence at each time step at least two outer loops are performed and in each loop at least two pressure correction loops are adapted the propeller rotation is handled by mrf approach in steady simulations and by rigid body motion in unsteady simulations for wetted flow simulations and due to the limitation posed by the quality of the cells nearly 10 time steps per degree of rotation is used and for cavitating flow simulations approximately 25 time steps per degree of rotation is used the solver outer loop tolerances based on the residuals of pressure and velocity in each iteration is set equal to 10 6 for the wetted flow simulations and 10 12 for cavitation simulations as the mass transfer source terms in the pressure equation require a higher tolerance for the residuals to guarantee convergence of the pressure the cavitation simulations are started from the developed wetted flow where the cavitation sources are deactivated for the first few time steps to achieve a stabilized pressure field a second order implicit time scheme is used for the time discretisation in unsteady simulations a second order upwinding scheme is employed to compute the navier stokes convection terms the other divergence terms are computed using a second order linear scheme all of the gradients have been corrected to consider the non orthogonality of the computational cells for the eulerian cavitation simulations the first order upwinding scheme is employed at least 3 outer loops are adapted in each time step to improve the convergence between the transport equation and the other equations converted meshes from starccm to openfoam generally contain some highly skewed faces and also show high non orthogonality between neighbouring cells these poor quality cells usually appear either on the interface of the prismatic boundary layer and the volumetric cells or at the interface of the refinement regions and volumetric cells the consequences are stability issues and limitation in adapting high order schemes especially for the propeller case it is noted that the generated mesh contains very high non orthogonal faces at the range of 80 85 and few high skewed faces up to 6 as it was not possible to improve the quality of the meshes at the current status the numerical discretisation schemes and gradient calculations in the openfoam solver are employed with limiters 5 results 5 1 elliptical foil in arndt and keller 1992 the tip vortex cavitation inception dependency on the water quality is investigated in the context of weak water no tensile strength and strong water withstands pressure considerably below the saturation pressure the weak water resembles the instantaneous mass transfer between phases as it contains very large nuclei e g having radii of 200 μ m on the other hand strong water contains very small nuclei e g having radii of 2 μ m which delays the cavitation inception from fig 12 of this reference and for lift coefficient similar to the current study c l 0 67 the interpolated values of cavitation inception for weak and strong water are 5 47 and 2 81 respectively these values estimated by the experimental tests are used in this study to evaluate the numerical results in previous studies asnaghi 2018 the numerical analysis of the tip vortex flow around the elliptical foil is conducted by the authors where the wetted flow tip vortex simulations were successfully compared with the experimental measurements conducted at the laboratory for ship hydrodynamics at delft technical university pennings et al 2015b the tvci analysis reported here extends the study into the evaluation of different inception models and their comparisons with the experimental measurements in fig 7 the distribution of the averaged pressure coefficients on the tip vortex trajectory for p1s1 and p2s2wake resolutions are presented the vortex core is located by assuming that the lowest pressure occurs at the center of the core as it can be observed both of the resolutions predict the lowest pressure to happen at the region z c 0 1 where the minimum c p for p1s1 is equal 5 34 and for p2s2wake is equal to 6 68 considering the minimum pressure criterion the inception points for p1s1 and p2s2wake resolutions respectively are σ i 5 34 and σ i 6 68 the tip vortex and consequently the pressure field depends on interactions of very small flow structures as formation and development of these structures are time dependent the tip vortex becomes time dependent in fig 8 variations of the vortex core pressure coefficient at different sections downstream of the foil are presented the figure clearly shows the large variation of the pressure field over time the variations are not harmonic representing interactions of flow structures with different modes the root mean square of the vortex core pressure coefficient variation fig 9 clarifies that the maximum oscillations happen at the section z c 0 125 where the lowest averaged pressure is found to occur there in table 3 the lift coefficient and the predicted cavitation inception number based on eq 5 are presented the comparison shows that the cavitation inception number is predicted better in p2s2wake resolution as refining the tip region resolution improves the lift coefficient prediction as it can be noticed the application of this approach is very simple and straightforward the limitation is that it requires massive experimental measurements in different operating conditions for one specific foil to derive its corresponding semi empirical formula 5 1 1 energy balance and minimum vapour volume criteria as the energy balance criterion and the minimum vapour volume in cavitating simulations represent similar outcome predictions using energy balance based on the wetted flow simulation are here compared with results of cavitation simulations in fig 10 variations of predicted and simulated vapour volumes versus cavitation number are presented the simulated vapour volume is computed by employing eulerian cavitation simulations and the predicted vapour volume is computed according to eq 8 considering the minimum vapour volume detectable during the tip vortex inception measurements 0 2365 m m 3 the predicted inception points by the energy criterion are σ i 4 53 for p1s1 resolution and σ i 5 85 for p2s2wake resolution it can be observed from fig 10 that at lower σ values e g σ 4 the discrepancy between predicted vapour volume and simulated vapour volume is higher the reason is related to the fact that in the cavitation simulations the appearance of cavitation alters the flow field and consequently the vortex strength while the predicted vapour volume is computed from the wetted flow fields it can be noted that the difference between the predicted vapour volumes for p1s1 resolution and for p2s2wake resolution are also considerable the strength of the predicted tip vortex and consequently the pressure distribution depend on the spatial resolution as also highlighted in fig 7 in the coarser resolution i e p1s1 resolution a weaker tip vortex and higher pressure field are predicted this leads to a lower prediction of the vapour volume in this resolution comparing to the values predicted by p2s2wake resolution in order to find the cavitation inception point based on the minimum vapour volume the cavitation simulations have been conducted at different cavitation numbers ranging from 4 to 6 5 on both p1s1 and p2s2wake resolutions fig 11 as a stronger tip vortex is predicted by p2s2wake resolution comparing to p1s1 resolution a stronger cavitating tip vortex is also obtained from the cavitation simulation on this resolution considering the minimum vapour volume criterion 0 2365 m m 3 the predicted cavitation inception for p1s1 resolution is σ i 4 5 and for p2s2wake resolution is σ i 5 5 5 1 2 simplified uncoupled bubble dynamics from wetted flow results it is possible to obtain vortex core pressure and velocity distributions considering the location and axial velocity of a particle travelling along the vortex trajectory the exerted pressure on the particle over time can be calculated fig 12 as the axial velocity predicted by p2s2wake resolution is higher at the vortex core it takes shorter time for a particle to travel through the vortex trajectory in the p2s2wake case the response of bubbles to lower pressure region strongly depends on their initial gas content and their initial radius as equilibrium condition is assumed for bubbles at the initial condition initial gas pressure and bubble pressure can be related via eq 12 therefore the only variable parameter is the initial bubble radius here different initial bubble radii are considered ranging from 1 μ m till 200 μ m for each initial bubble radius the rp equation is solved according to the exerted pressure on the bubble to obtain the variation of the radius over time since during the experimental measurements the inception point is measured visually in this criterion the conditions that the bubble radius exceeds 0 5 m m is considered as an indicator of cavitation inception it is observed that in some conditions the solution of the rp equation is unstable therefore smaller time steps are employed for these conditions in a few instances that having smaller time step are not helpful it is noted that the pressure variation between neighbouring cells are relatively large therefore some extra points are used between these neighbouring cells to provide a smoother pressure variation the pressure of these points are interpolated from the pressure of the neighbouring cells in fig 13 predicted cavitation inception numbers for different initial bubble radii are presented the figure also includes the values achieved using the minimum pressure criterion and the values derived from eulerian cavitation simulations noted as e s in the figure the figure clearly shows the dependency of the predicted cavitation inception number on the initial bubble radius similar to the experimental measurements where the lack of nuclei delays the cavitation inception at lower bubble radius lower values are predicted for the cavitation inception number as expected by increasing the initial bubble radius the predicted cavitation inception number by the rp model approaches the value predicted by the minimum pressure criterion the minimum pressure criterion implicitly includes the assumption of homogeneous phase change proposing instantaneous mass transfer as the pressure falls below the saturation pressure one reason for having similar inception predictions by larger bubble radii and the minimum pressure criterion is the fact that larger bubbles while experiencing a lower pressure region need lower time to reach to a radius being visible 5 1 3 summary of cavitation inception predictions for the elliptical foil case the summary of predicted inception points by different methods is presented in table 4 the results are classified into three different categories including wetted flow simulations eulerian cavitation simulations and lagrangian simulations each category contains the results of p1s1 and p2s2wake resolutions comparing the measured weak water inception value with the predicted value by c p criterion and eulerian simulations where no tensile strength is assumed in the modelling clearly show that the results of p2s2wake are in a good agreement with the experimental measurements in weak water it can be also noted that the c p criterion and eulerian simulations predict similar values as inception points one advantage of lagrangian bubble dynamics simulations is the capability to include the tensile strength by considering small bubble radii e g 1 μ m as it is presented in fig 13 the results also show a good agreement between the measured value for the strong water inception 2 81 and the predicted value for the bubble radius of 1 μ m however further investigations both numerically and experimentally are required to validate the results and provide the uncertainty of this type of analysis 5 2 low noise high skew propeller the propeller unsteady simulations are conducted at three different j values 0 82 0 933 and 1 26 where the high speed videos are recorded at j 0 82 and 1 26 and the design point is j 0 933 in order to calculate the inception diagram of the propeller several other operating conditions j values are also considered due to computational resource limitations the simulations of these j values are carried out by employing a steady solver e g simplefoam and mrf approach to handle the rotation three different types of propeller cavitation patterns are investigated including back bubble sheet cavitation bbc back tip vortex btv and face tip vortex ftv in fig 14 open water ow performance of the propeller is presented the figure includes the thrust torque and efficiency values at different j conditions for both numerical simulations and experimental measurements the numerical results are calculated in steady conditions due to limitations in computational resources with no turbulence model to have the same modelling as the iles for the transient simulations this corresponds to a laminar flow assumption which in part explains the discrepancy between the numerical results and the experimental measurements 5 2 1 comparisons with high speed videos at j 0 82 at this j value two main vortices are formed at the blade tip region one is the tip vortex and the other is an inward vortex formed on the blade and then separated at the trailing edge r r 0 9 the interactions of these two vortices with each other and also the nuclei and turbulent disturbances contributions determine the tip vortex cavitation feature in fig 15 three different instances are presented for interactions of these two vortices it can be seen that the inward vortex and tip vortex has different inclinations and trajectories in fig 15a the inward vortex cavitates on the blade and extends to the trailing edge as a cavitating trailing vortex while the tip vortex cavitates downstream of the blade tip as the cavitating inward vortex become thicker the tip vortex cavitation extends further upstream fig 15b finally when the inward vortex cavity disappears the tip vortex cavitation starts from the tip of the blade fig 15c the numerical simulations can precisely detect these two vortices and their interactions fig 16 the figure clearly shows that the interactions of the vortices change their strengths and noticeably their trajectories from fig 16 it can be observed that the tip vortex roll up and therefore the tip vortex strength is strongly dependent on the trailing vortices the presence of cavitation in the trailing vortices will change their dynamics and strength and consequently will alter the strength of the tip vortex and its cavitation characteristics as it was observed in the experimental snapshots fig 15 it clearly indicates the presence of very small scale flow dynamics in the tip region of the blade also noted in the experimental observations in fig 17 the cavitation experimental observations are compared with the numerical predictions where the iso surface of pressure equal to the saturation pressure and also the distribution of q criteria are plotted the location of the bubble cavitation and tip vortex have been accurately predicted by numerical simulations the numerical simulations are carried out in wetted flow conditions and thus the predicted cavitating region does not include the probability of nuclei effects the distribution of q clearly shows that the separated vortices at the trailing of the blade contribute to the strength of the main tip vortex in fig 18 the numerical prediction of q and also the experimental observation of one instance of fig 17 are plotted together the figure proves that the trajectory of the tip vortex is predicted very accurately it also provides more insights regarding the interaction of vortices and its effects on the cavitation formation 5 2 2 minimum pressure criterion in fig 19 experimental measurements and numerical predictions of minimum pressure criterion cavitation inception of the propeller in ow conditions are presented the experimental measurements are extrapolated by adapting power trend lines to extend the measurements data to lower and higher j values numerical inception points are calculated by employing the minimum pressure criterion on the steady wetted flow simulations in this criterion the minimum pressure coefficient is considered as the cavitation inception number σ i c p in the range of 0 8 j 1 0 cavitation appears only on the suction side of the blade as bbc and btv due to measurement difficulties the inception measurements are conducted only at the range of 0 9 j 1 0 and for 0 8 j 0 9 a power line extrapolation is employed a formal assessment of discretisation errors is not possible for an les approach as is used here it is not possible to separate modelling and discretisation errors as the subgrid tensor changes with mesh resolution moreover using a coarser resolution will not be fully adequate for les to give an indication of the sensitivity to mesh resolution we will here show how the results are influenced when using a lower resolution fig 20 presents the predicted cavitation inception number at j 0 82 for a series of four resolutions in the tip meshes h0 h3 as given in table 2 it is clear that the coarser resolutions yield a much too low inception point while the two finer resolutions are closer in predictions however it can not be concluded the finest grid is sufficient for a converged prediction 5 2 3 energy balance and minimum vapour volume criteria in fig 21 variations of predicted and simulated tip vortex vapour volumes by cavitation number are presented for j 0 82 the simulated vapour volume is computed by employing eulerian cavitation simulations and the predicted vapour volume is computed according to eq 8 considering the minimum volume detectable during the tip vortex inception measurements 0 2365 m m 3 the predicted suction side tip vortex cavitation inception point at j 0 82 by the energy criterion and by adapting the computed vapour volume is σ i 7 53 in fig 19 the btv and ftv inception predictions at other operating conditions predicted by this criterion is also presented finding the simulated vapour volume corresponding to the cavitation inception condition requires eulerian cavitation simulations at different cavitation numbers in order to keep the computational cost at a reasonable range the evaluation has been conducted only at one j value j 0 82 at this j value cavitation appears on the suction side as the cavitating tip vortex and blade cavitation by keeping the j value constant the cavitation is simulated at different cavitation numbers and for each condition the vapour volume at different parts of the propeller e g tip or on the blades are calculated fig 21 presents variation of the simulated vapour volume for different cavitation numbers ranging from 4 to 8 at j 0 82 the values are calculated at the tip region of the refined blade considering the minimum vapour volume criterion 0 2365 m m 3 the predicted suction side tip vortex cavitation inception for j 0 82 is σ i 7 5 however the minimum vapour volume criterion is calculated based on the assumption that the cavity contains 10 vapour if it is assumed that the cavity is pure vapour the minimum vapour volume criterion would be 2 365 m m 3 and predicted suction side tip vortex cavitating inception would be σ i 6 in fig 22 distribution of the vapour at the cavitation inception condition is presented 5 2 4 simplified uncoupled bubble dynamics similar to the study of the elliptical foil it is possible to obtain vortex core pressure and velocity distributions from wetted flow results consequently the exerted pressure on the particle travelling through the vortex core over time can be calculated fig 23 at lower j values the suction side tip vortex is stronger and therefore the pressure is lower and velocity is higher at the vortex core it should be noted that bubbles travel faster through the vortex trajectory at lower j values due to having higher axial velocity two different initial bubble sizes are considered r 2 μ m and r 200 μ m to include the study of water quality on the inception prediction where r 2 μ m corresponds to the relatively strong water and r 200 μ m corresponds to the weak water analysis for each initial bubble radius the rp equation is solved according to the exerted pressure on the bubble at each operating conditions to obtain the variation of the radius over time where the conditions that the bubble radius exceeds 0 5 m m is considered as an indicator of cavitation inception in fig 24 variation of bubble radii over time for different operating conditions are presented the plots are related for the initial bubble radii of r 2 μ m and r 200 μ m in the conditions that have been selected as the inception condition it is observed that for r 2 μ m the cavitation inception occurs as a sudden expansion of the bubble while for r 200 μ m the variation of the bubble radius contains both the expansion and shrinkage of the bubble these results are similar to the findings of choi et al 2009 where by simulating vortex cavitation bubbles they noted that large nuclei with near zero critical tension will grow in a quasi steady manner while small nuclei which require larger tension to incept can grow explosively when the critical tension is reached in fig 25 predicted cavitation inception numbers for different initial bubble radii are presented along with the values achieved using the minimum pressure criterion similar to the findings of the elliptical foil inception study the figure shows the dependency of the predicted cavitation inception number on the initial bubble radii in weak water which can be represented by r 200 μ m the water cannot withstand tension therefore cavitation incepts almost immediately as the pressure falls below the saturation pressure for strong water and at lower bubble radius e g r 2 μ m the water can tolerate tension consequently lower values are predicted for the cavitation inception number in strong water the results also indicate that at higher j values as the tip vortex is weaker the dependency of the cavitation inception to the initial nuclei radius is higher 6 conclusion the current paper investigates different tip vortex cavitation inception prediction methods and evaluates their performance in predicting the tvci around an elliptical foil and a high skewed propeller the selected models cover different levels of complexity including wetted flow analysis eulerian cavitation simulation and simplified uncoupled lagrangian bubble dynamics model the tip vortex flows around the elliptical foil is measured by pennings at delft university of technology pennings 2016 at different operating conditions the propeller is from a research series of five bladed high skewed propeller designed and tested at the rrhrc cavitation tunnel the hydrodynamics research centre of rolls royce ab kristinehamn sweden the measurements include propeller performance inception chart of the propeller and high speed video recording of cavitation following previous studies conducted by the authors the tip vortex flows are simulated by employing iles where the tip vortex resolution contains at least 32 grid points across the vortex radius for propeller simulations the rotation is handled by solid body motion and sliding mesh in unsteady simulations and by mrf in steady simulations the evaluated inception methods include minimum pressure criterion semi empirical relation energy of low pressure region eulerian cavitation simulation and bubble dynamics method as the cavitation inception strongly depends on the water quality and to follow notation of arndt and keller 1992 the comparison between numerical results and experimental measurements are presented in the context of weak water no tensile strength and strong water considerably withstands pressure below the saturation pressure the following remarks are highlighted from the obtained results the accuracy of the tip vortex simulation and consequently the pressure field prediction affects the cavitation inception predictions for the elliptical foil the finer resolution leads to prediction of a stronger tip vortex and therefore earlier cavitation inception the minimum pressure criterion inception predictions are found to be close to the weak water cavitation inception measurements the semi empirical model was found to be easily applicable and computationally very efficient as the application does not require a precise tip vortex simulations and therefore coarser mesh resolutions can be employed however as semi empirical relations have to be derived based on experimental measurements of the inception behaviour each relation has to be calibrated for a specific wing or propeller by various experimental measurements in order to correctly include the geometry effects energy balance and minimum vapour volume criteria generally predicts similar cavitation inception while minimum vapour volume criterion is computationally more costly as it demands eulerian cavitation simulation at different operating conditions the simplified uncoupled lagrangian bubble dynamics study clearly show the strong dependency of the cavitation inception on the water quality for the elliptical foil where the cavitation inception measurements of weak and strong water were available the inception prediction by initial nuclei radius of r 2 μ m and r 200 μ m matches very well with experimental measurements for strong and weak water fig 13 respectively the analysis of the tip vortex and trailing vortices at the blade tip region indicates the presence of very small flow dynamics where the interaction of these flow structures determines the pressure field and therefore the cavitation pattern comparison of the q field with experimental high speed recording proves the capability of the current numerical tool in predicting these small flow dynamics for the propeller at 0 8 j 1 0 the cavitation appears on the suction side back side of the propeller as bbc and btv cavitation it is found that at lower j values the btv becomes stronger and consequently the btv cavitation inception is less dependent on the water quality for higher j values 0 9 j 1 0 as the btv becomes weaker the predicted cavitation inception points by weak water and strong water deviates more for future studies it is suggested to include lagrangian equation of motion of bubbles into the inception analysis this helps to consider some important characteristics of a tip vortex cavitation inception such as the nuclei capture property which itself depends on many parameters including the free stream fluctuations the results indicate the capability of the current methodology and numerical setup in predicting the tip vortex flows and tvci it is highlighted that the tvci strongly depends on the water quality and the adapted numerical methods can provide a reasonable estimation of this dependency acknowledgements financial support for this work has been provided by rolls royce marine through the university technology centre in computational hydrodynamics hosted at the department of mechanics and maritime sciences at chalmers the simulations were performed on resources at chalmers centre for computational science and

23093,the current study investigates different cavitation inception prediction methods to characterize tip vortex flows around an elliptical foil and a high skewed low noise propeller adapted inception models cover different levels of complexity including wetted flow eulerian cavitation simulations and rayleigh plesset bubble dynamics models the tip vortex flows are simulated by implicit large eddy simulation on appropriate grid resolutions for tip vortex propagation at least 32 cells per vortex diameter according to previous studies guidelines the results indicate that the cavitation inception predictions by the minimum pressure criterion of the wetted flow analysis are similar to weak water inception measurements in the wetted flow analysis the proposed energy criterion is noted to provide reasonably accurate inception predictions similar to the predictions by eulerian cavitation simulations with much lower computational costs comparison between high speed videos and numerical results of the propeller shows the capability of the numerical methodology in predicting tip vortex structures in different conditions the interaction between vortices and their impact on the pressure field and the cavitation inception are also highlighted the strong dependency of the inception on the initial nuclei sizes are demonstrated and it is shown that for weaker tip vortices this dependency becomes more significant keywords tip vortex inception cavitation elliptical foil propeller les 1 introduction when a fluid passes over a finite span lifting foil close to the tip the pressure differential between the upper and lower surfaces of the wing drives the fluid from the high pressure side on the lower surface to the low pressure side on the upper surface this creates a highly three dimensional rotational vortex flow arndt et al 1991 maines and arndt 1997 souders and platzer 1981 the swirling pattern of the vortex lowers the pressure in the vortex core and therefore in hydrodynamic cases cavitation can incept in the vortex core consequently tip vortex characteristics of a propeller determine its inception behaviour and therefore the boundaries of the cavitation bucket chart of the propeller kuiper 1981 experimental measurements of tip vortex cavitation tvc have revealed that tip vortex cavitation inception tvci is characterized by either the sudden appearance of a continuous cavity or the intermittent appearance of an elongated bubble extending axially over a relatively small portion of the tip vortex higuchi et al 1989 arndt and keller 1992 the parameter determining the inception type of a tip vortex is the nuclei capture property cavitation occurs in the core of a tip vortex only if a nucleus has enough time to reach the core and then trigger cavitation boulon et al 1997 it is well reported that this behaviour of a tip vortex depends on the nuclei radius initial location and the vortex circulation arndt and keller 1992 ligneul and latorre 1993 brianon marjollet and inception 1997 in some of the experimental measurements the effects of nuclei on tvci are addressed in the context of weak water no tensile strength and strong water withstands pressure below the vapour pressure among different forms of cavitation on a blade bubble cavitation and tvc are found to be more sensitive to the nuclei distributions pennings et al 2015a arndt et al 2015 cavitation formation e g tvci depends on the flow reynolds number and the blade geometry arndt and keller 1992 fruman et al 1995 van wijngaarden et al 2005 in correlations or scaling laws the dependency can be represented by a dependency on the lift coefficient measurements of vortex singing on elliptical foils with three different cross sections maines and arndt 1997 showed vortex boundary layer interactions are strongly coupled to the separation characteristics of each foil cross section and lift coefficient for an elliptical foil with naca 66 2 415 cross section the relation is found to be σ i 0 068 c l 2 r e 0 4 in this relation the effects of flow unsteadiness and water quality are neglected the blade load distribution can also contribute to tvc kuiper 2001 baek et al 2015 with a highly loaded tip vorticity is generated in the trailing edge of a propeller blade resulting in a trailing vortex formation at low tip loading separation still occurs close to the tip while the trailing vortex is much weaker leading to a typical local tip vortex formation an unloaded tip forces the loading towards inner radii and at these inner radii dubbioso et al 2014 leading edge separation and therefore a leading edge vortex may be formed non uniform flow field pereira et al 2016 muscari et al 2013 dubbioso et al 2013 and blade surface roughness dreyer 2015 felli and falchi 2011 are the other effective parameters on the type of the tip vortex of a blade the inception point can experimentally be determined either through visual observations of cavitation appearance e g cavitation volume or tip vortex diameter arndt and keller 1992 savio et al 2009 or through acoustic measurements of the noise levels and then signal analysis of bubble bursting lee et al 2013 kim et al 2015 song et al 2017 however as the tip vortex involves small scales of flow dynamics it is very difficult to experimentally measure all relevant flow features e g the pressure at the vortex core where cavitation inception occurs these methods are indirect in this regard numerical simulations can be employed to give further insights on tip vortex properties that experimental tests may not be able to provide shen et al 2001 schot et al 2014 asnaghi et al 2017a 2017b from the numerical simulation perspective tip vortex flows are also known to be challenging flows to study because of the presence of anisotropic turbulence and the large gradients of pressure and velocity in all three directions especially across the vortex core the cavitation inception complicates the flow physics even further as it depends on additional flow parameters such as the nuclei distribution residence time and turbulence fluctuation which are very difficult to control during experimental tests as well as in numerical simulations ligneul and latorre 1993 hsiao and chahine 2005 park et al 2009 shen and dimotakis 1989 guilmineau et al 2017 the co existence of phase change and tip vortex creates a complex flow structure in the tip region of propellers which involves very small scale dynamics both in time and spatial coordinates understanding the physics of these flows is important in finding the tvci speed in order to prevent or control the occurrence of cavitation on propellers bensow and bark 2010 vesting et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 the numerical methods to determine the cavitation inception can generally be classified into three categories wetted flow analysis eulerian cavitation simulations and lagrangian bubble dynamics approaches in the simplest and computationally cheapest approach the wetted flow results are used to determine the inception points through some relations or simplified correlations between inception points and the flow properties in the second approach cavitation simulations have to be conducted to obtain the vapour distribution in each operating condition consequently the method is more costly than the wetted flow approach the approach that includes the nuclei effects and models bubble dynamics behaviours in order to determine inception points is the lagrangian bubble dynamics approach this approach can bring more details on the interactions of the nuclei and tip vortex with an extra cost of modelling the nuclei dynamics in the employed wetted flow approach the minimum pressure criterion is the easiest way to determine the inception point in this method the operating condition when the lowest pressure value of a wetted flow falls below the saturation pressure is considered as the inception point considering the fact that cavitation inception is essentially a wetted flow problem the advantage of the method is its simplicity as it only requires the pressure field of the wetted flow simulation to determine inception points as the method does not include the nuclei contribution on the inception prediction it usually leads to early prediction of cavitation inception the second method of the wetted flow approach is to employ a semi empirical relation in order to determine inception points a semi empirical relation has to be derived based on experimental measurements of the inception behaviour each relation has to be calibrated for a specific geometry e g wing or propeller in order to correctly include the geometry effects the relations may also have some limitations on the range of reynolds number or water quality the third method proposed by the authors is to consider the energy balance between the wetted flow results and corresponding two phase cavitating conditions the model assumes that in the wetted flow results the region with pressure lower than the saturation pressure has a stored energy this stored energy is the energy that is released during the cavitation formation to provide the required energy for the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the vapour phase the model computes this stored energy in the wetted flow simulations and provides an estimated vapour volume that can be generated and through that can determine the inception point in order to determine the inception point by eulerian cavitation simulations the minimum vapour volume detectable during the inception measurements has to be specified the cavitation flow simulation condition that leads to this vapour volume is considered as the inception point the approach that include the nuclei effects and model bubble dynamics behaviour in order to determine the inception point can itself be classified into three different groups according to the level of the complexity kim et al 2014 the most advanced method in this approach considers the coupling between bubbles and the flow field the bubbles are injected upstream and then the lagrangian equations of motion are solved for each bubble to track its path as in this method the two way coupling is considered the sizes and distribution of bubbles affect the velocity and pressure field of the medium flow ma et al 2017 yakubov et al 2013 hsiao chahine in order to include cavitation a separate rayleigh plesset rp equation is solved for each bubble to obtain the bubble radius at each time step since the relation between the bubble motion equation and the medium flow is non linear several inner loops have to be used between the equations to assure the convergence of the results in order to reduce the computational costs of this method multiscale two phase flow eulerian lagrangian approaches are developed to include tracking of micro bubbles in the micro scale along with capturing large cavities at the macro scale hsiao ma chahine the impact of non spherical bubbles can also be considered by modifying the rp equation choi and chahine 2004 2007 however it is reported that the shape of bubbles only becomes important during the bubble collapse time and consequently the collapse pressure pulses and it has a little impact on the cavitation inception prediction the second category so called the uncoupled method only includes effects of the fluid on bubbles and assumes that effects of bubbles on the flow field are negligible thus the paths of the bubbles are computed based on lagrangian equations of motions using the background eulerian flow field this reduces the computational requirements as there is no need for inner loops between the bubbles equations of motion and the medium flow navier stokes equations in the third model adopted in this study paths of bubbles are also defined by the simulation of the wetted flow this removes the requirement for solving bubbles equations of motion and only the rp equation is needed to be solved by considering the surrounding pressure field to determine bubbles radii in this work tip vortex simulations and analysis are conducted on an elliptical foil arndt 1995 2002 and a highly skewed low noise propeller in order to explore the possibility of using cfd to support advanced propeller design work the vortex structures around the elliptical foil resemble the propeller tip vortex behaviour while making it possible to be tested and evaluated in more details both experimentally and numerically the tip vortex at the selected operating conditions is relatively stationary which reduces the computational requirements the experiments used for validation were done by pennings at delft technical university pennings et al 2015a pennings 2016 the selected propeller is from a research series of five bladed highly skewed propellers which has a low effective tip load and is typical for yachts and ro pax vessels where it is very important to suppress and limit propeller induced vibration and noise the propeller was tested in the cavitation tunnel at the hydrodynamics research centre of rolls royce ab kristinehamn sweden here we analyze the tip vortex behaviour of the propeller in wetted and cavitating conditions focusing on the cavitation inception characteristics in the previous studies by the authors the wetted flow analysis of the tip vortex flow including the numerical settings and modelling e g importance of spatial mesh resolution and turbulence modelling are investigated on the elliptical foil asnaghi et al 2017a 2017b the current study extends the research into the tip vortex flows around a high skew propeller and also includes the tip vortex cavitation inception analysis the cavitation inception predictions on the elliptical foil and the propeller are presented and discussed 2 governing equations using the low pass filtering approach the conservation equations of mass and momentum in les models can be written as 1 ρ m t ρ m u i x i 0 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j p x i x j s i j b i j ρ m g i where the over bar denotes low pass filtered quantities and b i j ρ u i u j u i u j is the subgrid stress tensor here ρ m is the mixture density as defined in eq 14 s i j 2 μ d i j is the strain rate tensor and d i j is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient 3 d i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in implicit les iles no explicit model is applied for b i j instead the numerical dissipation is considered enough to mimic the action of b i j fureby 2006 rider 2006 bensow and bark 2010 asnaghi 2015 therefore for the momentum convection term a relatively dissipative scheme should be used to provide appropriate numerical diffusion in the solution procedure for the propeller simulations the detailed inceptions studies are based on iles but additional steady state simulations are performed to cover the full operating range of the propeller the iles model then acts as a laminar steady simulation model 2 1 cavitation inception experimental assessments of cavitation are not straightforward and suffer from large uncertainties pennings et al 2015a arndt et al 2015 this comes from the complex dependency of the tip vortex inception on the reynolds number through the boundary layer development on the blades shear layer vorticity interaction in the blade wake and primarily nuclei distribution and its interactions with the low pressure region of the vortex fruman et al 1995 arndt 2002 schot et al 2014 further there are technical difficulties in distinguishing the actual inception point as a result this makes numerical validation of inception points almost out of reach even though wetted tip vortex flows can be predicted reasonably well by consideration of some simplifications however some methods are proposed to numerically predict inception points including minimum pressure criterion semi empirical relation energy of low pressure region eulerian cavitation simulations and bubble dynamics method although exact validation is difficult the intention is to evaluate the possibility to apply such methods for design considerations when ranking performance between designs 2 1 1 wetted flow based models the minimum pressure criterion is the simplest model of the wetted flow approach where no extra equation needs to be solved and post processing of the results is sufficient the cavitation inception point is obtained from the pressure field of the wetted flow as 4 σ i c p m i n this equation implies that cavitation occurs when the minimum pressure in the flow reaches the saturation pressure the second method is to employ a semi empirical relation obtained from a curve fitted to the experimental data the curve expresses the dependency of the tip vortex cavitation inception on the reynolds number foil geometry and also nuclei distribution for the elliptical foil in weak water arndt et al arndt 1995 suggested the following formula 5 σ i 0 068 c l 2 r e 0 4 in this equation c l is the lift coefficient and r e is the flow reynolds number based on the foil root chord length this method is also a post processing tool once the empirical relation has been established and therefore only wetted flow simulations are required to determine the c l if it is assumed that at the saturation pressure liquid and vapour phases are in an equilibrium state liquid with pressure lower than saturation pressure would have a stored potential energy this stored potential energy which is released during the phase change from liquid to vapour can be roughly estimated as 6 e s t o r e d p s a t p where is the volume of the region with pressure lower than the saturation pressure if the heat transfer and work performed by expansion of this area during the phase change are neglected this stored energy is consumed only to transfer liquid into vapour considering the conservation of energy the following relation between the stored energy and the mass of the transferred liquid into vapour can be achieved 7 p s a t p m l v l where m l v is the mass of the liquid which has been transferred into vapour and l is the mass transfer latent heat knowing that the mass of the generated vapour is equal to m l v the volume of generated vapour is 8 v p s a t p ρ v l this approach will be used as a post processing tool on wetted flow results in order to estimate the vapour volume by eq 8 the estimated vapour volume is compared with the vapour volume visually detectable during the experimental tests to find the cavitation inception point 2 1 2 eulerian cavitation simulations minimum vapour volume criterion this approach assumes that in the visual detection of tip vortex cavitation inception a certain volume of vapour is required in order to be detectable by observers if we assume that the tip vortex cavitation at its inception state has a cylindrical shape with diameter of 1 mm and length of 3 mm the volume of a corresponding cylinder would be 2 365 m m 3 by assuming that the vapour volume fraction of this cylinder is 10 the corresponding vapour volume would be 0 2365 m m 3 then the cavitation inception point would be a condition which leads to this amount of vapour volume in the simulations for this method eulerian cavitation simulations at different conditions i e cavitation numbers are required in order to find the inception point 2 1 3 bubble dynamics the rayleigh plesset rp equation which governs the dynamics of a single spherical bubble is 9 r d 2 r d t 2 3 2 d r d t 2 4 ν l r d r d t 2 s ρ l r p b t p t ρ l where r is the radius of the bubble ν l is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid s is the liquid surface tension ρ l is the liquid density p b t is the pressure inside the bubble and p t is the pressure at the far field the pressure inside the bubble is the summation of the vapour pressure and the non condensable gas pressure 10 p b t p v t p g t at the equilibrium condition the rp equation reduces to 11 p b p 2 s r therefore at the initial condition and by equilibrium condition assumption the gas pressure can be obtained as follows 12 p g 0 p 0 2 s r 0 p v by the ideal gas assumption for the non condensable gas content the gas pressure at any time can be derived from 13 p g p g 0 r 0 r t 3 γ where γ is equal to one for the isothermal bubble expansion the isothermal assumption is valid for bubble dynamics governed mostly by inertia effects e g the cavitation tunnel at temperature 20 c there are basically two ways to include the bubble modelling into the flow simulations uncoupled approach and coupled approach in the coupled approach the lagrangian equations of motion are solved for the bubbles along with the mean flow conservation equations as well as turbulence equations the interacting forces between bubbles and the mean flow can also be included the rp equation is then solved for each bubble at each time instance to recalculate the internal pressure and bubble radius depending on the number of injected bubbles the coupled simulations increases the computational cost in a simplified uncoupled approach it is assumed that due to the small bubble sizes contributions of bubble forces and their presence on the mean flow are negligible therefore the lagrangian equations of motion can be solved for the bubbles as post processing of the mean flow field in this study the uncoupled approach is simplified even further by neglecting the lagrangian equations of motion and assuming that bubbles are travelling through specific paths e g streamlines of the wetted flow or in the core of the tip vortex the rp equation then is solved by considering the surroundings conditions of these paths this simplified approach can be used for cases where the possible cavitation inception paths are known such as the tip vortex trajectory where cavitation incepts primarily in the tip vortex core 2 2 cavitation and mass transfer modelling in order to predict the cavitation inception by employing the minimum vapour volume cavitating flows are needed to be simulated at different operating conditions in this study a transport equation model tem is adopted to simulate the two phase cavitating flow in the eulerian framework where both the vapour and liquid phases are treated as incompressible and the liquid volume fraction function α l is used to specify the distribution of each phase vaz et al 2017 negrato et al 2017 taking advantage of the homogenous mixture model which assumes there is no slip velocity between phases the mixture flow properties can be

description 3 1 elliptical foil the computational domain of the foil which mimics the cavitation tunnel in the laboratory for ship hydrodynamics at delft technical university pennings et al 2015b schot et al 2014 is presented in fig 1 the geometry of the foil is an elliptical planform having the naca 66 2 415 as cross section profile the foil with different scale factors has been tested at different institutes in various operating conditions both in wetted and cavitating conditions arndt et al 1991 arndt and keller 1992 pennings et al 2015b schot et al 2014 the experimental data of the cavitation inception used for comparisons are obtained by visual techniques arndt and keller 1992 arndt 1995 this however involves more uncertainties into the measurements as it depends on the general judgement of the observer the current simulations are conducted for the foil with the angle of attack 9 and at a constant inlet velocity of 6 8 m s and a fixed pressure outlet boundary the reynolds number based on the root chord length c 0 0 1254 m is r e 8 95 10 5 the no slip condition is applied on the foil and bottom surface and other boundaries are treated as a slip condition the cavitation number is defined by 18 σ p p s a t 1 2 ρ u r e f 2 where p s a t is the saturation pressure and u r e f is the reference velocity i e the inlet velocity in order to identify vortical structures the q criterion is employed this criterion represents the local balance between the shear strain rate tensor and the deformation rate tensor hunt et al 1998 kolar 2007 19 q 1 2 ω i j ω i j d i j d i j where 20 ω i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in a mesh dependency study conducted by the authors asnaghi et al 2016 to find appropriate mesh resolutions to predict tip vortex flows using iles in the near field region it is found that the optimum mesh resolution should have at least 32 grid points across the vortex diameter this number is related to the openfoam numerics on this mesh topology using second order schemes with non orthogonality corrections in table 1 specifications of the elliptical foil mesh resolutions are presented p2s2wake is the mesh resolution having 32 grid points across the vortex diameter in the near field region and p1s1 is a coarser mesh having 16 grid points across the vortex diameter the p1s1 is included in this study to evaluate the mesh resolution impact on the tip vortex cavitation inception analysis the computational domain consist of hexahedral cells fig 2 generated by starccm different refinement regions are defined to refine the resolution up to the tip vortex region having 10 mm for the inner refinement cylinder irc and 60 mm for the outer refinement cylinder orc diameters respectively it should be noted that the inner refinement cylinder also covers the tip surface of the foil therefore the surface resolution at that region follows the inner refinement cylinder resolution in the p2s2wake resolution an extra refinement is also applied in the foil wake region the boundary layer in all of the resolutions are fully resolved in the wall normal direction where based on the inlet velocity y 1 the prismatic layers consists of 20 layers having extrusion factor of 1 15 to provide appropriate boundary layer resolution around the foil the baseline mesh resolution on the foil gives both x and z 250 with finer resolutions provided at the leading edge and trailing edge of the blades and where tip refinement is applied 3 2 low noise high skew propeller the basic design of the propeller is from a research series of five bladed highly skewed propellers having low effective tip load and are typical for yachts and ro pax vessels where it is very important to suppress and limit propeller induced vibration and noise the main or first source of noise for this type of propellers is cavitation in the tip region the tip vortex cavitation and therefore the noise and vibration are sensitive to modification of the blade geometry in the tip region in order to investigate the influence of the tip shape and loading on the cavitation behaviour different designs have been suggested and tested at the rrhrc cavitation tunnel the hydrodynamics research centre of rolls royce ab kristinehamn sweden the focus of the current work is on the analysis of the open water performance of one of the propellers and its behaviour in wetted and cavitating conditions the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller is defined by using non dimensional thrust and torque coefficients and the advance ratio equations 21 23 21 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 22 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 23 j v a n d in these equations d is the propeller diameter n is the rotational speed of the propeller in rev sec ρ is the fluid density t is the propeller thrust force q is the propeller shaft torque and v a is mean inflow velocity towards the propeller plane the open water efficiency of a propeller is defined by 24 η o t v a 2 π n q j k t 2 π k q 3 2 1 experimental setup the schematic of the experimental setup and cavitation tunnel used to test the propeller are plotted in fig 3 in this setup the water flows from left to right with a constant velocity after mounting the propeller the operating condition is set by adjusting the water velocity revolution rate of the propeller and the pressure of the tunnel a pitot tube mounted on the lower part of the side wall of the tunnel measures the inflow velocity it is installed far enough from the wall to be sure that it stands outside the boundary layer developed on the walls of the test tunnel there are also a few pressure sensors to measure the pressure at different locations of the tunnel the thrust and torque are also measured in the rotational axis direction the open water ow performance of the propeller is measured and evaluated at different j values and different cavitation numbers in all of the conditions thrust and torque are measured in order to obtain the performance chart of the propeller the cavitation observed in the experiments is sensitive to the nuclei content of the water and since the cavitation tunnel is a free surface tunnel the water becomes de gased after some time running at low cavitation number the gas content was therefore closely monitored and measurements were taken to keep the nuclei content on an acceptable level during the tests the cavitation behaviour observed in the experiment by a high speed video recording 20000 frame per second was relatively intermittent and varied from blade to blade the latter one can be considered to be related to the high sensitivity of the cavitation on these propellers to the pitch adjustment of blade mounting a deviation of 0 01 together with possible manufacturing discrepancy between the blades can result in substantial differences in the amount of cavitation occurring on each blade scale effects and water quality can be other typical reasons for the intermittency of the cavitation by taking advantage of high speed recordings the visual detection of cavitation inception is adopted 3 2 2 numerical setup the computational domain of the propeller is presented in fig 4 in order to model the moving mesh i e relative motion between the propeller and the external domain the computational domain has been decomposed into two regions connected to each other through ami arbitrary mesh interpolation boundaries while the outer region is stationary the rotation of the region close to the propeller has been handled either by solid body motion with sliding mesh for unsteady computations or by mrf for steady computations the domain is simplified to a cylinder extending 4d upstream the propeller and 8d downstream of the propeller where d 0 2543 m is the diameter of the propeller the simulations are conducted at a constant inlet velocity and a fixed pressure outlet boundary the advance ratio of the propeller is then set by adjusting the rotational rate of the propeller the no slip wall boundary condition is used for the propeller and the shaft the outer cylinder boundary is set as a slip boundary to reduce the mesh resolution requirements far from the propeller then the blockage effects are considered in comparing the numerical results with related experimental measurements the distribution of the propeller mesh is presented in fig 5 different refinement boxes are applied to provide finer resolutions around the rotating propeller region fig 5a similar to the elliptical foil mesh description the boundary layer on the propeller blades are fully resolved in the wall normal direction y 1 the prismatic layers consists of 20 layers having extrusion factor of 1 15 similar to the mesh of the elliptical foil the baseline mesh resolution on the foil gives x and z 250 where finer resolutions are provided at the leading edge and trailing edge of the blades further finer resolution is achieved where tip refinement is applied the nominal values given above are calculated based on the inlet velocity and the propeller diameter as the reference length and verified afterwords the tip vortex refinement is applied on one blade only where three helical shape refinement zones are defined based on the primary vortex trajectory fig 6 the refinement zones cover the tip of the blade and therefore provide more refined grid resolutions on the tip of the refined blade fig 5b these helical refinement regions provide spatial resolutions as fine as 0 2 mm 0 1 mm and 0 05 mm in h1 h2 and h3 regions respectively the resolution of the tip region without the tip refinement h0 is set to be equal 0 4 mm details of spatial resolutions are presented in table 2 the tip vortex inception analysis is conduced on the finest resolution propeller h3 and the other resolutions are employed to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis to the grid resolution 4 solution procedure the openfoam 2 3 x package used in this study for numerical simulation is an open source code written in c to model and simulate fluid dynamics and continuum mechanics openfoam 2015 the spatial discretisation is performed using a cell centred collocated finite volume fv method for unstructured meshes with arbitrary cell shapes and a multi step scheme is used for the time derivatives see openfoam 2015 for more details on the discretisation and the numerical schemes used in openfoam the near wall normal resolution y 1 is calculated by considering the reference velocity of the flow i e the inlet velocity therefore spalding wall model is employed to correct the turbulent viscosity at a few cells where the near wall normal resolution may exceed 5 respectively for steady simulations the simple algorithm and for unsteady simulations the pimple algorithm are used to solve the coupling between the velocity and pressure the pimple algorithm is a merge of the simple and piso algorithms where the piso loop is complemented by an outer iteration loop and possible under relaxation of the variables see asnaghi 2015 for further details for good convergence at each time step at least two outer loops are performed and in each loop at least two pressure correction loops are adapted the propeller rotation is handled by mrf approach in steady simulations and by rigid body motion in unsteady simulations for wetted flow simulations and due to the limitation posed by the quality of the cells nearly 10 time steps per degree of rotation is used and for cavitating flow simulations approximately 25 time steps per degree of rotation is used the solver outer loop tolerances based on the residuals of pressure and velocity in each iteration is set equal to 10 6 for the wetted flow simulations and 10 12 for cavitation simulations as the mass transfer source terms in the pressure equation require a higher tolerance for the residuals to guarantee convergence of the pressure the cavitation simulations are started from the developed wetted flow where the cavitation sources are deactivated for the first few time steps to achieve a stabilized pressure field a second order implicit time scheme is used for the time discretisation in unsteady simulations a second order upwinding scheme is employed to compute the navier stokes convection terms the other divergence terms are computed using a second order linear scheme all of the gradients have been corrected to consider the non orthogonality of the computational cells for the eulerian cavitation simulations the first order upwinding scheme is employed at least 3 outer loops are adapted in each time step to improve the convergence between the transport equation and the other equations converted meshes from starccm to openfoam generally contain some highly skewed faces and also show high non orthogonality between neighbouring cells these poor quality cells usually appear either on the interface of the prismatic boundary layer and the volumetric cells or at the interface of the refinement regions and volumetric cells the consequences are stability issues and limitation in adapting high order schemes especially for the propeller case it is noted that the generated mesh contains very high non orthogonal faces at the range of 80 85 and few high skewed faces up to 6 as it was not possible to improve the quality of the meshes at the current status the numerical discretisation schemes and gradient calculations in the openfoam solver are employed with limiters 5 results 5 1 elliptical foil in arndt and keller 1992 the tip vortex cavitation inception dependency on the water quality is investigated in the context of weak water no tensile strength and strong water withstands pressure considerably below the saturation pressure the weak water resembles the instantaneous mass transfer between phases as it contains very large nuclei e g having radii of 200 μ m on the other hand strong water contains very small nuclei e g having radii of 2 μ m which delays the cavitation inception from fig 12 of this reference and for lift coefficient similar to the current study c l 0 67 the interpolated values of cavitation inception for weak and strong water are 5 47 and 2 81 respectively these values estimated by the experimental tests are used in this study to evaluate the numerical results in previous studies asnaghi 2018 the numerical analysis of the tip vortex flow around the elliptical foil is conducted by the authors where the wetted flow tip vortex simulations were successfully compared with the experimental measurements conducted at the laboratory for ship hydrodynamics at delft technical university pennings et al 2015b the tvci analysis reported here extends the study into the evaluation of different inception models and their comparisons with the experimental measurements in fig 7 the distribution of the averaged pressure coefficients on the tip vortex trajectory for p1s1 and p2s2wake resolutions are presented the vortex core is located by assuming that the lowest pressure occurs at the center of the core as it can be observed both of the resolutions predict the lowest pressure to happen at the region z c 0 1 where the minimum c p for p1s1 is equal 5 34 and for p2s2wake is equal to 6 68 considering the minimum pressure criterion the inception points for p1s1 and p2s2wake resolutions respectively are σ i 5 34 and σ i 6 68 the tip vortex and consequently the pressure field depends on interactions of very small flow structures as formation and development of these structures are time dependent the tip vortex becomes time dependent in fig 8 variations of the vortex core pressure coefficient at different sections downstream of the foil are presented the figure clearly shows the large variation of the pressure field over time the variations are not harmonic representing interactions of flow structures with different modes the root mean square of the vortex core pressure coefficient variation fig 9 clarifies that the maximum oscillations happen at the section z c 0 125 where the lowest averaged pressure is found to occur there in table 3 the lift coefficient and the predicted cavitation inception number based on eq 5 are presented the comparison shows that the cavitation inception number is predicted better in p2s2wake resolution as refining the tip region resolution improves the lift coefficient prediction as it can be noticed the application of this approach is very simple and straightforward the limitation is that it requires massive experimental measurements in different operating conditions for one specific foil to derive its corresponding semi empirical formula 5 1 1 energy balance and minimum vapour volume criteria as the energy balance criterion and the minimum vapour volume in cavitating simulations represent similar outcome predictions using energy balance based on the wetted flow simulation are here compared with results of cavitation simulations in fig 10 variations of predicted and simulated vapour volumes versus cavitation number are presented the simulated vapour volume is computed by employing eulerian cavitation simulations and the predicted vapour volume is computed according to eq 8 considering the minimum vapour volume detectable during the tip vortex inception measurements 0 2365 m m 3 the predicted inception points by the energy criterion are σ i 4 53 for p1s1 resolution and σ i 5 85 for p2s2wake resolution it can be observed from fig 10 that at lower σ values e g σ 4 the discrepancy between predicted vapour volume and simulated vapour volume is higher the reason is related to the fact that in the cavitation simulations the appearance of cavitation alters the flow field and consequently the vortex strength while the predicted vapour volume is computed from the wetted flow fields it can be noted that the difference between the predicted vapour volumes for p1s1 resolution and for p2s2wake resolution are also considerable the strength of the predicted tip vortex and consequently the pressure distribution depend on the spatial resolution as also highlighted in fig 7 in the coarser resolution i e p1s1 resolution a weaker tip vortex and higher pressure field are predicted this leads to a lower prediction of the vapour volume in this resolution comparing to the values predicted by p2s2wake resolution in order to find the cavitation inception point based on the minimum vapour volume the cavitation simulations have been conducted at different cavitation numbers ranging from 4 to 6 5 on both p1s1 and p2s2wake resolutions fig 11 as a stronger tip vortex is predicted by p2s2wake resolution comparing to p1s1 resolution a stronger cavitating tip vortex is also obtained from the cavitation simulation on this resolution considering the minimum vapour volume criterion 0 2365 m m 3 the predicted cavitation inception for p1s1 resolution is σ i 4 5 and for p2s2wake resolution is σ i 5 5 5 1 2 simplified uncoupled bubble dynamics from wetted flow results it is possible to obtain vortex core pressure and velocity distributions considering the location and axial velocity of a particle travelling along the vortex trajectory the exerted pressure on the particle over time can be calculated fig 12 as the axial velocity predicted by p2s2wake resolution is higher at the vortex core it takes shorter time for a particle to travel through the vortex trajectory in the p2s2wake case the response of bubbles to lower pressure region strongly depends on their initial gas content and their initial radius as equilibrium condition is assumed for bubbles at the initial condition initial gas pressure and bubble pressure can be related via eq 12 therefore the only variable parameter is the initial bubble radius here different initial bubble radii are considered ranging from 1 μ m till 200 μ m for each initial bubble radius the rp equation is solved according to the exerted pressure on the bubble to obtain the variation of the radius over time since during the experimental measurements the inception point is measured visually in this criterion the conditions that the bubble radius exceeds 0 5 m m is considered as an indicator of cavitation inception it is observed that in some conditions the solution of the rp equation is unstable therefore smaller time steps are employed for these conditions in a few instances that having smaller time step are not helpful it is noted that the pressure variation between neighbouring cells are relatively large therefore some extra points are used between these neighbouring cells to provide a smoother pressure variation the pressure of these points are interpolated from the pressure of the neighbouring cells in fig 13 predicted cavitation inception numbers for different initial bubble radii are presented the figure also includes the values achieved using the minimum pressure criterion and the values derived from eulerian cavitation simulations noted as e s in the figure the figure clearly shows the dependency of the predicted cavitation inception number on the initial bubble radius similar to the experimental measurements where the lack of nuclei delays the cavitation inception at lower bubble radius lower values are predicted for the cavitation inception number as expected by increasing the initial bubble radius the predicted cavitation inception number by the rp model approaches the value predicted by the minimum pressure criterion the minimum pressure criterion implicitly includes the assumption of homogeneous phase change proposing instantaneous mass transfer as the pressure falls below the saturation pressure one reason for having similar inception predictions by larger bubble radii and the minimum pressure criterion is the fact that larger bubbles while experiencing a lower pressure region need lower time to reach to a radius being visible 5 1 3 summary of cavitation inception predictions for the elliptical foil case the summary of predicted inception points by different methods is presented in table 4 the results are classified into three different categories including wetted flow simulations eulerian cavitation simulations and lagrangian simulations each category contains the results of p1s1 and p2s2wake resolutions comparing the measured weak water inception value with the predicted value by c p criterion and eulerian simulations where no tensile strength is assumed in the modelling clearly show that the results of p2s2wake are in a good agreement with the experimental measurements in weak water it can be also noted that the c p criterion and eulerian simulations predict similar values as inception points one advantage of lagrangian bubble dynamics simulations is the capability to include the tensile strength by considering small bubble radii e g 1 μ m as it is presented in fig 13 the results also show a good agreement between the measured value for the strong water inception 2 81 and the predicted value for the bubble radius of 1 μ m however further investigations both numerically and experimentally are required to validate the results and provide the uncertainty of this type of analysis 5 2 low noise high skew propeller the propeller unsteady simulations are conducted at three different j values 0 82 0 933 and 1 26 where the high speed videos are recorded at j 0 82 and 1 26 and the design point is j 0 933 in order to calculate the inception diagram of the propeller several other operating conditions j values are also considered due to computational resource limitations the simulations of these j values are carried out by employing a steady solver e g simplefoam and mrf approach to handle the rotation three different types of propeller cavitation patterns are investigated including back bubble sheet cavitation bbc back tip vortex btv and face tip vortex ftv in fig 14 open water ow performance of the propeller is presented the figure includes the thrust torque and efficiency values at different j conditions for both numerical simulations and experimental measurements the numerical results are calculated in steady conditions due to limitations in computational resources with no turbulence model to have the same modelling as the iles for the transient simulations this corresponds to a laminar flow assumption which in part explains the discrepancy between the numerical results and the experimental measurements 5 2 1 comparisons with high speed videos at j 0 82 at this j value two main vortices are formed at the blade tip region one is the tip vortex and the other is an inward vortex formed on the blade and then separated at the trailing edge r r 0 9 the interactions of these two vortices with each other and also the nuclei and turbulent disturbances contributions determine the tip vortex cavitation feature in fig 15 three different instances are presented for interactions of these two vortices it can be seen that the inward vortex and tip vortex has different inclinations and trajectories in fig 15a the inward vortex cavitates on the blade and extends to the trailing edge as a cavitating trailing vortex while the tip vortex cavitates downstream of the blade tip as the cavitating inward vortex become thicker the tip vortex cavitation extends further upstream fig 15b finally when the inward vortex cavity disappears the tip vortex cavitation starts from the tip of the blade fig 15c the numerical simulations can precisely detect these two vortices and their interactions fig 16 the figure clearly shows that the interactions of the vortices change their strengths and noticeably their trajectories from fig 16 it can be observed that the tip vortex roll up and therefore the tip vortex strength is strongly dependent on the trailing vortices the presence of cavitation in the trailing vortices will change their dynamics and strength and consequently will alter the strength of the tip vortex and its cavitation characteristics as it was observed in the experimental snapshots fig 15 it clearly indicates the presence of very small scale flow dynamics in the tip region of the blade also noted in the experimental observations in fig 17 the cavitation experimental observations are compared with the numerical predictions where the iso surface of pressure equal to the saturation pressure and also the distribution of q criteria are plotted the location of the bubble cavitation and tip vortex have been accurately predicted by numerical simulations the numerical simulations are carried out in wetted flow conditions and thus the predicted cavitating region does not include the probability of nuclei effects the distribution of q clearly shows that the separated vortices at the trailing of the blade contribute to the strength of the main tip vortex in fig 18 the numerical prediction of q and also the experimental observation of one instance of fig 17 are plotted together the figure proves that the trajectory of the tip vortex is predicted very accurately it also provides more insights regarding the interaction of vortices and its effects on the cavitation formation 5 2 2 minimum pressure criterion in fig 19 experimental measurements and numerical predictions of minimum pressure criterion cavitation inception of the propeller in ow conditions are presented the experimental measurements are extrapolated by adapting power trend lines to extend the measurements data to lower and higher j values numerical inception points are calculated by employing the minimum pressure criterion on the steady wetted flow simulations in this criterion the minimum pressure coefficient is considered as the cavitation inception number σ i c p in the range of 0 8 j 1 0 cavitation appears only on the suction side of the blade as bbc and btv due to measurement difficulties the inception measurements are conducted only at the range of 0 9 j 1 0 and for 0 8 j 0 9 a power line extrapolation is employed a formal assessment of discretisation errors is not possible for an les approach as is used here it is not possible to separate modelling and discretisation errors as the subgrid tensor changes with mesh resolution moreover using a coarser resolution will not be fully adequate for les to give an indication of the sensitivity to mesh resolution we will here show how the results are influenced when using a lower resolution fig 20 presents the predicted cavitation inception number at j 0 82 for a series of four resolutions in the tip meshes h0 h3 as given in table 2 it is clear that the coarser resolutions yield a much too low inception point while the two finer resolutions are closer in predictions however it can not be concluded the finest grid is sufficient for a converged prediction 5 2 3 energy balance and minimum vapour volume criteria in fig 21 variations of predicted and simulated tip vortex vapour volumes by cavitation number are presented for j 0 82 the simulated vapour volume is computed by employing eulerian cavitation simulations and the predicted vapour volume is computed according to eq 8 considering the minimum volume detectable during the tip vortex inception measurements 0 2365 m m 3 the predicted suction side tip vortex cavitation inception point at j 0 82 by the energy criterion and by adapting the computed vapour volume is σ i 7 53 in fig 19 the btv and ftv inception predictions at other operating conditions predicted by this criterion is also presented finding the simulated vapour volume corresponding to the cavitation inception condition requires eulerian cavitation simulations at different cavitation numbers in order to keep the computational cost at a reasonable range the evaluation has been conducted only at one j value j 0 82 at this j value cavitation appears on the suction side as the cavitating tip vortex and blade cavitation by keeping the j value constant the cavitation is simulated at different cavitation numbers and for each condition the vapour volume at different parts of the propeller e g tip or on the blades are calculated fig 21 presents variation of the simulated vapour volume for different cavitation numbers ranging from 4 to 8 at j 0 82 the values are calculated at the tip region of the refined blade considering the minimum vapour volume criterion 0 2365 m m 3 the predicted suction side tip vortex cavitation inception for j 0 82 is σ i 7 5 however the minimum vapour volume criterion is calculated based on the assumption that the cavity contains 10 vapour if it is assumed that the cavity is pure vapour the minimum vapour volume criterion would be 2 365 m m 3 and predicted suction side tip vortex cavitating inception would be σ i 6 in fig 22 distribution of the vapour at the cavitation inception condition is presented 5 2 4 simplified uncoupled bubble dynamics similar to the study of the elliptical foil it is possible to obtain vortex core pressure and velocity distributions from wetted flow results consequently the exerted pressure on the particle travelling through the vortex core over time can be calculated fig 23 at lower j values the suction side tip vortex is stronger and therefore the pressure is lower and velocity is higher at the vortex core it should be noted that bubbles travel faster through the vortex trajectory at lower j values due to having higher axial velocity two different initial bubble sizes are considered r 2 μ m and r 200 μ m to include the study of water quality on the inception prediction where r 2 μ m corresponds to the relatively strong water and r 200 μ m corresponds to the weak water analysis for each initial bubble radius the rp equation is solved according to the exerted pressure on the bubble at each operating conditions to obtain the variation of the radius over time where the conditions that the bubble radius exceeds 0 5 m m is considered as an indicator of cavitation inception in fig 24 variation of bubble radii over time for different operating conditions are presented the plots are related for the initial bubble radii of r 2 μ m and r 200 μ m in the conditions that have been selected as the inception condition it is observed that for r 2 μ m the cavitation inception occurs as a sudden expansion of the bubble while for r 200 μ m the variation of the bubble radius contains both the expansion and shrinkage of the bubble these results are similar to the findings of choi et al 2009 where by simulating vortex cavitation bubbles they noted that large nuclei with near zero critical tension will grow in a quasi steady manner while small nuclei which require larger tension to incept can grow explosively when the critical tension is reached in fig 25 predicted cavitation inception numbers for different initial bubble radii are presented along with the values achieved using the minimum pressure criterion similar to the findings of the elliptical foil inception study the figure shows the dependency of the predicted cavitation inception number on the initial bubble radii in weak water which can be represented by r 200 μ m the water cannot withstand tension therefore cavitation incepts almost immediately as the pressure falls below the saturation pressure for strong water and at lower bubble radius e g r 2 μ m the water can tolerate tension consequently lower values are predicted for the cavitation inception number in strong water the results also indicate that at higher j values as the tip vortex is weaker the dependency of the cavitation inception to the initial nuclei radius is higher 6 conclusion the current paper investigates different tip vortex cavitation inception prediction methods and evaluates their performance in predicting the tvci around an elliptical foil and a high skewed propeller the selected models cover different levels of complexity including wetted flow analysis eulerian cavitation simulation and simplified uncoupled lagrangian bubble dynamics model the tip vortex flows around the elliptical foil is measured by pennings at delft university of technology pennings 2016 at different operating conditions the propeller is from a research series of five bladed high skewed propeller designed and tested at the rrhrc cavitation tunnel the hydrodynamics research centre of rolls royce ab kristinehamn sweden the measurements include propeller performance inception chart of the propeller and high speed video recording of cavitation following previous studies conducted by the authors the tip vortex flows are simulated by employing iles where the tip vortex resolution contains at least 32 grid points across the vortex radius for propeller simulations the rotation is handled by solid body motion and sliding mesh in unsteady simulations and by mrf in steady simulations the evaluated inception methods include minimum pressure criterion semi empirical relation energy of low pressure region eulerian cavitation simulation and bubble dynamics method as the cavitation inception strongly depends on the water quality and to follow notation of arndt and keller 1992 the comparison between numerical results and experimental measurements are presented in the context of weak water no tensile strength and strong water considerably withstands pressure below the saturation pressure the following remarks are highlighted from the obtained results the accuracy of the tip vortex simulation and consequently the pressure field prediction affects the cavitation inception predictions for the elliptical foil the finer resolution leads to prediction of a stronger tip vortex and therefore earlier cavitation inception the minimum pressure criterion inception predictions are found to be close to the weak water cavitation inception measurements the semi empirical model was found to be easily applicable and computationally very efficient as the application does not require a precise tip vortex simulations and therefore coarser mesh resolutions can be employed however as semi empirical relations have to be derived based on experimental measurements of the inception behaviour each relation has to be calibrated for a specific wing or propeller by various experimental measurements in order to correctly include the geometry effects energy balance and minimum vapour volume criteria generally predicts similar cavitation inception while minimum vapour volume criterion is computationally more costly as it demands eulerian cavitation simulation at different operating conditions the simplified uncoupled lagrangian bubble dynamics study clearly show the strong dependency of the cavitation inception on the water quality for the elliptical foil where the cavitation inception measurements of weak and strong water were available the inception prediction by initial nuclei radius of r 2 μ m and r 200 μ m matches very well with experimental measurements for strong and weak water fig 13 respectively the analysis of the tip vortex and trailing vortices at the blade tip region indicates the presence of very small flow dynamics where the interaction of these flow structures determines the pressure field and therefore the cavitation pattern comparison of the q field with experimental high speed recording proves the capability of the current numerical tool in predicting these small flow dynamics for the propeller at 0 8 j 1 0 the cavitation appears on the suction side back side of the propeller as bbc and btv cavitation it is found that at lower j values the btv becomes stronger and consequently the btv cavitation inception is less dependent on the water quality for higher j values 0 9 j 1 0 as the btv becomes weaker the predicted cavitation inception points by weak water and strong water deviates more for future studies it is suggested to include lagrangian equation of motion of bubbles into the inception analysis this helps to consider some important characteristics of a tip vortex cavitation inception such as the nuclei capture property which itself depends on many parameters including the free stream fluctuations the results indicate the capability of the current methodology and numerical setup in predicting the tip vortex flows and tvci it is highlighted that the tvci strongly depends on the water quality and the adapted numerical methods can provide a reasonable estimation of this dependency acknowledgements financial support for this work has been provided by rolls royce marine through the university technology centre in

23094,the interaction of linear water waves with an inclined elastic plate as a breakwater is analyzed when it is clamped at the upper end and moored at the lower end the assumption of euler bernoulli beam model for the plate allows to obtain the normal derivative of the potential function across the plate boundary on the other hand using green s integral theorem another expression is evaluated for the same the comparison between these two forms provides a hypersingular integral equation of the first kind in the potential difference across the plate which is solved by the expansion collocation method the solution of the hypersingular integral equation is used to find the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the hydrodynamic force the results are presented for different inclination angle different submergence depth of the plate variable length and different flexural rigidity of the plate keywords water wave scattering inclined elastic plate hypersingular integral equation reflection coefficient 1 introduction problems involving the interaction of water waves with thin obstacles either submerged or floating constitute a major area of research in the context of linear water wave theory the significance of this domain of research lies in its applications in wide range of physical situations including wave interaction with breakwaters very large floating structures vlfs lamas pardo et al 2015 and sea ice in marginal ice zone miz squire 2007 research for developing several types of the breakwater is uplifted to make the most effective use of it the effectiveness can be judged from construction duration and ecological point of view breakwaters are useful in the harbor coastal and marine engineering though the primary requirement of a breakwater is to allow least wave transmission onto its protected side in many locations a minimal reflection of the incident wave is also expected dean 1945 and ursell 1947 initially studied how a vertical barrier influences the wave reflection and transmission phenomena in the deep water using linear water wave theory they considered a fixed structure extended from ocean floor to a height below the water surface and a vertical barrier extended down from the water surface respectively evans 1970 and porter 1972 also determined the explicit solutions for the problems of water wave scattering by a submerged vertical plate and a vertical plate with a finite gap respectively scattering problems in the deep water got much attention due to the availability of exact solutions porter and evans 1995 considered scattering of water waves by vertical barriers in finite depth water and presented an accurate method for solving these problems since then several extensions of barrier problems were explored depending on different construction materials different orientations of the breakwater and various purpose of installation of breakwaters for problems involving elastic plates a number of mathematical approaches have been adopted evans and davies 1968 used wiener hopf technique to determine the exact solution to the problem of water wave scattering by a semi infinite thin floating elastic plate in water of finite depth fox and squire 1994 reconsidered the problem of evans and davies 1968 using eigenfunction expansion and matching method meylan and squire 1994 studied a finite elastic plate an ice floe of finite width problem in finite and infinite depth water however the interaction of water waves with a vertical elastic plate is comparatively a less studied topic in the context of fluid structure interaction using linearised theory of water waves meylan 1995 investigated the nature of the reflection and the transmission coefficients related to the problem of wave scattering by surface piercing vertical elastic plate using a solution methodology outlined in meylan and squire 1994 later peter and meylan 2010 solved the time dependent version of the above problem using eigenfunction expansion chakraborty and mandal 2013 2014 adopted meylan s method to study the vertical elastic plate problem in finite as well as in infinite depth of water chakraborty et al 2016 also presented an alternative method to solve the problem of surface wave scattering by a thin vertical elastic plate using hypersingular integral equation approach in comparison to other forms of breakwaters submerged plate breakwaters provide better water circulation clearer ocean view etc it is cost effective and clear ocean view is essential for constructing breakwaters around large floating structures for entertainment purpose in addition to that submerged breakwaters have minimal impact on ship navigation which is one of the most important factors at the time of designing port porter 2015 demonstrated an approach to solve a general class of problems involving thin submerged horizontal plates under the assumptions of linearised wave theory behera and sahoo 2015 studied the surface wave scattering by a submerged flexible porous plate in the context of small amplitude water wave theory and structural response williams and meylan 2012 presented a study on the interaction of water waves with a submerged elastic plate of semi infinite extent elastic plates are the better models from construction and longevity point of view as mentioned earlier problems on the vertical elastic plate have been considered by meylan 1995 chakraborty and mandal 2013 2014 chakraborty et al 2016 he and kashiwagi 2012 presented a coupled boundary element and finite element method to analyze the interaction of nonlinear waves with a vertical elastic plate plate breakwaters with arbitrary inclinations are expected to be more effective as they penetrate through the layers of water with varying particle velocities and nurture their interactions this brings deformation of particular orbits which will create wave breaking and loss of energy in the wave seminal works on wave scattering by inclined plate can be found in the articles of john 1948 parsons and martin 1992 parsons and mciver 1999 gayen and mondal 2016 mooring is one of the popular ways to serve as a permanent structures keeping system in order to control the movement of floating structures a usual process is to connect it with mooring lines mciver 1985 ren and wang 1994 newman 2008 and several other researchers have analyzed the wave structure interaction problems in presence of moored structures it was concluded that the hydrodynamic forces and reflection increase with increasing mooring stiffness karmakar and soares 2012 2014 in their works also presented the effect of mooring on floating and bottom standing structures in water of finite depth and shallow water in a similar way the clamping on the upper end will prevent the movement and maintain zero slopes of displacement in view of this the present work solves the problem of water wave scattering by a submerged inclined elastic plate clamped at the upper end and moored at the lower end we employ hypersingular integral equation approach to solve the problem whenever neumann boundary condition is applied to reduce a laplace or helmholtz equation to an integral equation one ends up with a hypersingular integral equation it is an efficient way to handle plate problems with arbitrary geometry the use of hypersingular integral equation technique could be found in works of chan et al 2003 davydov et al 2006 maiti and mandal 2010 gayen and mondal 2014 mondal and banerjea 2016 the condition on the plate in our problem arises from euler bernoulli beam equation which is a differential equation of order four in the component of the derived velocity potential ϕ n p in the normal direction of the plate this differential equation is solved by the technique described in the paper of meylan 1995 we then derive an alternative expression for ϕ n p by use of green s integral theorem the two expressions of ϕ n p are compared to develop a hypersingular integral equation of the first kind and expansion collocation method is applied to solve the integral equation the solution is used to find the values of the reflection and the transmission coefficients for various parametric values and to find the value of hydrodynamic force acting on the inclined elastic plate 2 formulation of the problem the problem is analyzed in the two dimensional cartesian coordinate system with the x axis along the mean free surface and y axis pointing vertically downwards an inclined elastic plate see fig 1 γ is submerged in water the plate is of length 2 a inclined at an arbitrary angle θ to the vertical direction we consider a simple harmonic motion in the deep water assumed to be homogeneous inviscid and incompressible and the motion is irrotational also with prescribed angular frequency σ here the thickness of the plate is very small compared to its length and the incident wavelength so that we can consider it as a thin plate then the velocity field is defined by the velocity potential as 2 1 φ x y t r e g 2 σ 3 ϕ x y e i σ t where g is the acceleration due to gravity t is the time ϕ x y denotes the spatial velocity potential and r e stands for real part of the argument then the equations to be satisfied by the complex valued potential function ϕ x y are 2 2 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 0 in the fluid region along with the free surface condition 2 3 k ϕ ϕ y 0 on y 0 where k σ 2 g the condition at the bottom 2 4 ϕ 0 as y ϕ x y also satisfies the radiation conditions 2 5 ϕ x y ϕ i n c x y r ϕ i n c x y as x t ϕ i n c x y as x where ϕ i n c x y denotes the incident wave potential given by ϕ i n c x y e k y i k x and in the above equation r and t denote the reflection and the transmission coefficients the boundary condition on the inclined elastic plate surface can be written as 2 6 d 4 ϕ n p s 4 ε k ϕ n p k ϕ p on γ where p γ d e h 3 12 ρ 1 ν 2 g ε ρ ρ h e represents the young s modulus ν denotes the poisson s ratio and the densities of water and the material of the elastic plate are symbolized by ρ and ρ respectively in the above expressions h indicates the thickness of the plate assumed to be very small and ϕ p ϕ p ϕ p denotes the potential difference across the plate the dimensions of the quantities k ε and d are length 1 length and length 4 respectively the behavior of the potential function at the ends of the plate is directed by the condition cf hassan et al 2009 2 7 ϕ o r 1 2 as r 0 where r denotes the distance of a point in the fluid region from any one end of the plate also if the upper end of the plate is clamped and the lower end is moored then 2 8a ϕ n p s 0 ϕ n p at the upper end of γ 2 8b 2 ϕ n p s 2 0 3 ϕ n p s 3 m u ϕ n p at the lower end of γ here m u 2 k d sin 2 ψ e i cos 3 θ where k d is the spring constant and ψ denotes the mooring angle these edge conditions play crucial roles to solve the above boundary value problem given by equations 2 2 to 2 4 and 2 6 the method of solution is given in the next section 3 method of solution in order to solve the boundary value problem we first need to tackle the fifth order boundary condition 2 6 on the inclined plate in a judicious manner for this we take a new coordinate system x y where y axis is taken along the elastic plate γ and x axis is perpendicular to y the origin of this system is shifted to the mid point of the inclined plate where the depth of the mid point with respect to the previous coordinate system is d the two coordinate systems x y and x y are related by the following equations 3 1 x x cos θ y d sin θ y x sin θ y d cos θ where 0 θ π 2 now in the new coordinate system the boundary condition on the plate surface can be written as 3 2 d 4 ϕ x 0 y d y 4 ε k d ϕ x 0 y k d ϕ 0 y a y a or 3 3 d 4 ϕ x d y 4 α 4 ϕ x k d ϕ p 1 p 1 γ where α 4 ε k d the end conditions 2 8 take the forms 3 4a d ϕ x d y 0 ϕ x y a 3 4b d 2 ϕ x d y 2 0 d 3 ϕ x d y 3 m u ϕ x y a for the clamped moored plate we notice that if the right side of equation 3 3 is known then it represents a fourth order ordinary differential equation for ϕ x which is to be solved subject to the set of boundary conditions 3 4 this is done by the help of green s function technique cf meylan 1995 the green s function g y y satisfies the associated homogeneous boundary value problem given by the differential equation 3 5 d 4 g d y 4 α 4 g δ y y together with the end conditions 3 6a g 0 g y y a 3 6b g y y 0 g y y y m u g y a above mentioned green s function also carries the inherent properties 3 7 g g y g y y to be continuous at y y 3 g y 3 y y 0 3 g y 3 y y 0 1 the general solution of the differential equation 3 5 is of the form 3 8 g y y a 1 e i α y b 1 e i α y c 1 e α y d 1 e α y a y y a a 2 e i α y b 2 e i α y c 2 e α y d 2 e α y a y y a where a 1 b 1 are functions of y only using the end conditions 3 6a and 3 6b together with the properties of green s function the values of a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 are obtained by solving the following matrix equation 3 9 av w here a a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 v e i α a e i α a e α a e α a ie i α a ie i α a e α a e α a e i α a e i α a e α a e α a i α 3 m u e i α a

c 2 d 2 are found as 3 10 a 2 a 1 i 4 α 3 e i α y b 2 b 1 i 4 α 3 e i α y c 2 c 1 1 4 α 3 e α y d 2 d 1 1 4 α 3 e α y now the solution ϕ x to the differential equation 3 3 is expressed in terms of the green s function g y y and the potential difference across the plate as 3 11 ϕ x 0 y k d a a g y y ϕ y d y a y a the above equation represents the normal velocity of fluid at any point on the plate in terms of potential difference across the plate we now proceed to obtain a second expression for the above mentioned normal velocity for which green s integral theorem is applied on the scattered potential ϕ s c p ϕ p ϕ i n c p and the fundamental potential function g p p 2 due to a line source placed at the point p 2 ξ η here p x y is a point in the fluid region an expression for g is given by cf mandal and chakrabarti 2000 image 1 with r r x ξ 2 y η 2 here the path of the integration is along the ve real axis in the complex k plane indented below the pole at k k so that g also satisfies the radiation condition at infinity application of green s integral theorem on ϕ s c and g yields 3 13 ϕ s c p γ ϕ s c p 2 g n p 2 p p 2 d s p 2 where n p 2 represents normal differentiation at p 2 on γ and ϕ s c p 2 is the discontinuity in the scattered potential across the plate at the point p 2 since ϕ i n c 0 we can replace ϕ s c p 2 by ϕ p 2 so we obtain an integral representation of the total potential as 3 14 ϕ p e k y i k x γ ϕ p 2 g n p 2 p p 2 d s p 2 taking normal derivative of the above expression at a point p 1 on γ we get 3 15 ϕ n p 1 n p 1 e k y i k x n p 1 γ ϕ p 2 g n p 2 p 2 p 1 d s p 2 in the above equation if we try to take the normal derivative at p 1 inside the integral sign this would generally lead to a non integrable integrand to overcome this difficulty the integral is interpreted as a hadamard finite part integral cf martin and rizzo 1989 adopting this procedure we find image 2 here the sign denotes that the integral is considered as the hadamard finite part integral next we note that equation 3 11 can be rewritten as 3 17 ϕ n p 1 k d γ g p 1 p 2 ϕ p 2 d s p 2 comparing equations 3 16 and 3 17 we finally obtain a hypersingular integral equation of the first kind as image 4 the technique mentioned above is well established by several researchers cf martin and rizzo 1989 parsons and martin 1992 1994 for investigating various scattering problems of thin plates it can be seen that as d the second term of the kernel in equation 3 18 tends to zero i e as the plate becomes rigid the form of the kernel is similar to that of parsons and martin 1992 to convert the above hypersingular integral equation 3 18 into a compatible form we consider a parametrization the parametrization of the plate for numerical calculation is given by cf gayen and mandal 2003 3 19 x a u sin θ y d a u cos θ 1 u 1 ξ a t sin θ η d a t cos θ 1 t 1 by virtue of the above parametrization and introducing a new unknown function f t ϕ p 2 equation 3 18 can be cast as image 5 where 3 21 k u t cos 2 θ 2 π 2 x 2 a 4 u t 4 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 2 π cos θ sin θ xz x 2 y 2 2 sin 2 θ 2 π 2 y η 2 a 4 u t 4 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 1 π k y x 2 y 2 1 π x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 k 2 i e k y i k x k 2

of the form b u 2 π i k a e k y i k x e i θ a function of the variable u only the hypersingular integral equation 3 20 is to be solved subject to the condition f 1 0 for this we first approximate f t as 3 22 f t 1 t 2 1 2 n n 0 x n u n t where x n s n 0 1 n are the unknown constants to be found u n t is the chebyshev polynomial of the second kind the square root part makes sure that f t satisfies the edge conditions using the expansion 3 22 in equation 3 20 we obtain 3 23 n n 0 x n p n u b u where 3 24 p n u π n 1 u n u 2 π a 2 1 1 1 t 2 1 2 k u t u n t d t to find unknowns x n n 0 1 n we collocate 3 23 at n 1 number of points u u j j 0 1 n and get a system of n 1 linear equations 3 25 p x b where p p n j n 1 n 1 x x n n 1 1 and b b u j n 1 1 n 0 1 n j 0 1 n the expression of p n j is given by p n j π n 1 u n u j 2 π a 2 1 1 1 t 2 1 2 k u j t u n t d t here u j s are the roots of chebyshev polynomials of the first kind given by u j cos 2 j 1 2 n 2 π j 0 1 n the system of equation 3 25 is solved numerically to find the values of x n s these solutions are used to evaluate the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the hydrodynamic force here we should mention that the approximation of f t as given in 3 22 enables us to compute the hypersingular part of equation 3 20 analytically also the convergence of this method is well established cf golberg 1983 1985 3 1 reflection and transmission coefficients the behavior of the green s function at infinity is given by cf mandal and chakrabarti 2000 3 26 g p 2 p 1 i e k y i k x as x in order to determine the expressions of the reflection and the transmission coefficients r and t we first consider x in the expression 3 14 then using the radiation conditions 2 5 and the asymptotic expression of g p 2 p 1 we get 3 27 r k a n 0 n x n 1 1 e i θ e k η i k ξ 1 t 2 u n t d t 3 28 t 1 k a n 0 n x n 1 1 e i θ e k η i k ξ 1 t 2 u n t d t the values of x n s are computed by solving equation 3 25 and are substituted in the above equations to obtain the numeric estimates of r and t here r and t satisfy the energy identity r 2 t 2 1 3 2 hydrodynamic force on the plate the hydrodynamic force acting on the inclined elastic plate is calculated here the pressure p x y t at any point x y in the fluid region is given by the bernoulli s equation as 3 29 p x y t ρ φ x y t t ρ g y r e i ρ g 2 σ 2 ϕ x y e i σ t ρ g y therefore the hydrodynamic force acting on the plate has the form 3 30 ℱ ρ g k r e i a n 0 n x n 1 1 1 t 2 u n t d t at t 0 from the above expression we can write the nondimensional force per unit width on the inclined elastic plate as 3 31 ℱ 1 k ℱ ρ g a r e i n 0 n x n 1 1 1 t 2 u n t d t in the next section we discuss the results of r t ℱ 1 graphically 4 numerical results and discussions in this section we present the numerical results for the absolute values of the reflection and the transmission coefficients r and t and the hydrodynamic force ℱ 1 acting on the inclined elastic plate for different sets of parametric values the submergence depth of the mid point of the plate d half plate length a and the angle of inclination θ satisfy the inequality d a cos θ except fig 2 we compare the values of r computed from our present analysis with those in meylan 1995 for a surface piercing vertical elastic plate with free edges placed in deep water to carry out the comparison we change the end conditions 2 8 as 4 1a 2 ϕ n p s 2 0 3 ϕ n p s 3 at the upper end of γ 4 1b 2 ϕ n p s 2 0 3 ϕ n p s 3 at the lower end of γ also the conditions 3 4 and 3 6 are changed accordingly also we choose the parameters as d a θ 0 k λ 2 π d β λ 4 ε γ λ γ 0 005 and the dimensionless plate length is 0 5 where λ represents the wavelength β and γ are two dimensionless quantities defined in meylan 1995 from fig 2 it is evident that the results in our paper completely agree with those in meylan 1995 this establishes the correctness of our present analysis for figs 3 5 and fig 8 we make all physical quantities dimensionless with respect to the half plate length a we consider the situation when the plate is clamped at the upper end and moored at the lower end for the purpose of numerical computation values of few physical quantities are kept fixed those are mooring angle ψ 30 poisson s ratio ν 0 3 g 9 8 m s2 mooring stiffness 10 6 n m and n 15 in fig 3 we present a comparative view of magnitudes of the reflection and the transmission coefficients with respect to k a for several values of d a the other parameters d a 4 2 ε a 0 02 and θ π 4 remain constant these two figures clarify the fact that with increasing length of the gap between the top edge of the plate and the free surface the reflection coefficient decreases and the transmission coefficient increases this happens as the surface waves find more space to transmit on the other side of the plate in fig 4 we plot the magnitude of the absolute values of the reflection and the transmission coefficients as a function of k a for different values of inclination θ and fixed values of d a 4 and ε a here to present the graphs for different values of inclination we consider d a 1 keeping the fact in mind that the plate is completely submerged even when it is in the vertical position the absolute value of the reflection coefficient decreases and the transmission coefficient increases when the angle of inclination increases thus in those situations where we need a maximum reflection of wave energy the less inclination will serve the purpose better the requirement of the reflection efficiency of the breakwater is not the same in every situation because we need minimal reflection in many places in those cases one can optimize the reflection through maintaining proper inclination of the plate impact of elasticity of the plate during scattering of waves is presented in fig 5 fig 5a and b exhibit the facts that r decreases and t increases with increasing d a 4 stiffness up to a certain level for fixed values of θ d a and ε a therefore we conclude that the elasticity of the plate is a reason behind the reduction in the reflection of the incident wave this characteristic of elastic plate is crucial for breakwaters construction as low reflection provides more stable water surface this result is similar to that given in chakraborty and mandal 2014 in fig 6 we plot the absolute values of the reflection coefficient as a function of dimensionless wave number to show the effect of increasing rigidity of the plate when it varies within a large scale here fixed parametric values are θ π 6 d a 1 1 and ε a 0 02 it is clear from fig 6 that for moderate values of rigidity parameter 1 d a 4 10 the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in the rigidity however the reflection coefficient increases significantly with a large increase in stiffness as the plate becomes sufficiently stiff the reflection coefficient of the flexible plate is getting close to that of a rigid plate which we evaluate from equation 3 27 avoiding the last term from the expression of the kernel 3 21 since as d this term goes to 0 fig 7 represents the results for an elastic plate inclined at a fixed angle θ π 4 and three different plate lengths for these graphs we make all quantities dimensionless with respect to b which is the depth of the lowest point of the plate from undisturbed free surface i e b d a cos θ from fig 7a and b it is clear that the magnitude of the reflection coefficient increases and that of the transmission coefficient decreases with increasing plate length which is quite obvious now the magnitude of the hydrodynamic force acting on the inclined elastic plate is evaluated from the relation 3 31 and presented graphically in fig 8 in fig 8a we consider the changes in hydrodynamic force for different inclinations of the plate with fixed parametric values d a 1 1 ε a 0 02 and d a 4 2 with increasing θ we observe a noticeable decrement in the hydrodynamic force similarly in fig 8b the absolute value of the hydrodynamic force is presented for different values of d a 4 and for fixed values of θ π 4 ε a 0 02 and d a 1 1 the decreasing nature of the hydrodynamic force with increasing stiffness up to a moderate level shows the fact that an elastic barrier is capable of reducing the effect of waves in the sea 5 conclusion in this paper we have applied hypersingular integral equation approach to study the fluid structure interaction problem involving an inclined elastic plate submerged in deep water the plate is clamped at the upper end and moored at the lower end the reflection and the transmission coefficients along with the hydrodynamic force are computed and presented graphically for various parametric values the conclusions drawn from the presented graphs are variations of the reflection r and the transmission t coefficients with the submergence depth of the plate clarify the fact that r increases significantly with decreasing depth of submergence with the increasing angle of inclination r decreases and t increases this fact gives a clear indication that though the vertical plate plays the role of a better reflector the inclined plate is suitable for the situation where less reflection is required so depending on the requirement one can increase or decrease the inclination of the plate the elasticity of the plate affects the reflection and transmission increasing values of d a 4 up to a moderate level indicate the increasing elastic nature of the plate therefore a flexible plate reflects less wave energy which is essential in many cases of breakwater construction same submergence depth with different plate lengths will also affect the reflection and the transmission of water waves as the plate length increases more amount of wave energy is reflected hydrodynamic force exerted on the inclined elastic plate depends on its inclination with increasing angle of inclination the hydrodynamic force decreases representation of hydrodynamic force with the varying stiffness of the plate indicates the fact that elasticity of the plate reduces the effect of hydrodynamic force in the present study we have given emphasis on the determination of the amount of reflected and transmitted waves in presence of an inclined flexible plate our future endeavour will be to study the structural behavior of the elastic plate 
23094,the interaction of linear water waves with an inclined elastic plate as a breakwater is analyzed when it is clamped at the upper end and moored at the lower end the assumption of euler bernoulli beam model for the plate allows to obtain the normal derivative of the potential function across the plate boundary on the other hand using green s integral theorem another expression is evaluated for the same the comparison between these two forms provides a hypersingular integral equation of the first kind in the potential difference across the plate which is solved by the expansion collocation method the solution of the hypersingular integral equation is used to find the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the hydrodynamic force the results are presented for different inclination angle different submergence depth of the plate variable length and different flexural rigidity of the plate keywords water wave scattering inclined elastic plate hypersingular integral equation reflection coefficient 1 introduction problems involving the interaction of water waves with thin obstacles either submerged or floating constitute a major area of research in the context of linear water wave theory the significance of this domain of research lies in its applications in wide range of physical situations including wave interaction with breakwaters very large floating structures vlfs lamas pardo et al 2015 and sea ice in marginal ice zone miz squire 2007 research for developing several types of the breakwater is uplifted to make the most effective use of it the effectiveness can be judged from construction duration and ecological point of view breakwaters are useful in the harbor coastal and marine engineering though the primary requirement of a breakwater is to allow least wave transmission onto its protected side in many locations a minimal reflection of the incident wave is also expected dean 1945 and ursell 1947 initially studied how a vertical barrier influences the wave reflection and transmission phenomena in the deep water using linear water wave theory they considered a fixed structure extended from ocean floor to a height below the water surface and a vertical barrier extended down from the water surface respectively evans 1970 and porter 1972 also determined the explicit solutions for the problems of water wave scattering by a submerged vertical plate and a vertical plate with a finite gap respectively scattering problems in the deep water got much attention due to the availability of exact solutions porter and evans 1995 considered scattering of water waves by vertical barriers in finite depth water and presented an accurate method for solving these problems since then several extensions of barrier problems were explored depending on different construction materials different orientations of the breakwater and various purpose of installation of breakwaters for problems involving elastic plates a number of mathematical approaches have been adopted evans and davies 1968 used wiener hopf technique to determine the exact solution to the problem of water wave scattering by a semi infinite thin floating elastic plate in water of finite depth fox and squire 1994 reconsidered the problem of evans and davies 1968 using eigenfunction expansion and matching method meylan and squire 1994 studied a finite elastic plate an ice floe of finite width problem in finite and infinite depth water however the interaction of water waves with a vertical elastic plate is comparatively a less studied topic in the context of fluid structure interaction using linearised theory of water waves meylan 1995 investigated the nature of the reflection and the transmission coefficients related to the problem of wave scattering by surface piercing vertical elastic plate using a solution methodology outlined in meylan and squire 1994 later peter and meylan 2010 solved the time dependent version of the above problem using eigenfunction expansion chakraborty and mandal 2013 2014 adopted meylan s method to study the vertical elastic plate problem in finite as well as in infinite depth of water chakraborty et al 2016 also presented an alternative method to solve the problem of surface wave scattering by a thin vertical elastic plate using hypersingular integral equation approach in comparison to other forms of breakwaters submerged plate breakwaters provide better water circulation clearer ocean view etc it is cost effective and clear ocean view is essential for constructing breakwaters around large floating structures for entertainment purpose in addition to that submerged breakwaters have minimal impact on ship navigation which is one of the most important factors at the time of designing port porter 2015 demonstrated an approach to solve a general class of problems involving thin submerged horizontal plates under the assumptions of linearised wave theory behera and sahoo 2015 studied the surface wave scattering by a submerged flexible porous plate in the context of small amplitude water wave theory and structural response williams and meylan 2012 presented a study on the interaction of water waves with a submerged elastic plate of semi infinite extent elastic plates are the better models from construction and longevity point of view as mentioned earlier problems on the vertical elastic plate have been considered by meylan 1995 chakraborty and mandal 2013 2014 chakraborty et al 2016 he and kashiwagi 2012 presented a coupled boundary element and finite element method to analyze the interaction of nonlinear waves with a vertical elastic plate plate breakwaters with arbitrary inclinations are expected to be more effective as they penetrate through the layers of water with varying particle velocities and nurture their interactions this brings deformation of particular orbits which will create wave breaking and loss of energy in the wave seminal works on wave scattering by inclined plate can be found in the articles of john 1948 parsons and martin 1992 parsons and mciver 1999 gayen and mondal 2016 mooring is one of the popular ways to serve as a permanent structures keeping system in order to control the movement of floating structures a usual process is to connect it with mooring lines mciver 1985 ren and wang 1994 newman 2008 and several other researchers have analyzed the wave structure interaction problems in presence of moored structures it was concluded that the hydrodynamic forces and reflection increase with increasing mooring stiffness karmakar and soares 2012 2014 in their works also presented the effect of mooring on floating and bottom standing structures in water of finite depth and shallow water in a similar way the clamping on the upper end will prevent the movement and maintain zero slopes of displacement in view of this the present work solves the problem of water wave scattering by a submerged inclined elastic plate clamped at the upper end and moored at the lower end we employ hypersingular integral equation approach to solve the problem whenever neumann boundary condition is applied to reduce a laplace or helmholtz equation to an integral equation one ends up with a hypersingular integral equation it is an efficient way to handle plate problems with arbitrary geometry the use of hypersingular integral equation technique could be found in works of chan et al 2003 davydov et al 2006 maiti and mandal 2010 gayen and mondal 2014 mondal and banerjea 2016 the condition on the plate in our problem arises from euler bernoulli beam equation which is a differential equation of order four in the component of the derived velocity potential ϕ n p in the normal direction of the plate this differential equation is solved by the technique described in the paper of meylan 1995 we then derive an alternative expression for ϕ n p by use of green s integral theorem the two expressions of ϕ n p are compared to develop a hypersingular integral equation of the first kind and expansion collocation method is applied to solve the integral equation the solution is used to find the values of the reflection and the transmission coefficients for various parametric values and to find the value of hydrodynamic force acting on the inclined elastic plate 2 formulation of the problem the problem is analyzed in the two dimensional cartesian coordinate system with the x axis along the mean free surface and y axis pointing vertically downwards an inclined elastic plate see fig 1 γ is submerged in water the plate is of length 2 a inclined at an arbitrary angle θ to the vertical direction we consider a simple harmonic motion in the deep water assumed to be homogeneous inviscid and incompressible and the motion is irrotational also with prescribed angular frequency σ here the thickness of the plate is very small compared to its length and the incident wavelength so that we can consider it as a thin plate then the velocity field is defined by the velocity potential as 2 1 φ x y t r e g 2 σ 3 ϕ x y e i σ t where g is the acceleration due to gravity t is the time ϕ x y denotes the spatial velocity potential and r e stands for real part of the argument then the equations to be satisfied by the complex valued potential function ϕ x y are 2 2 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 0 in the fluid region along with the free surface condition 2 3 k ϕ ϕ y 0 on y 0 where k σ 2 g the condition at the bottom 2 4 ϕ 0 as y ϕ x y also satisfies the radiation conditions 2 5 ϕ x y ϕ i n c x y r ϕ i n c x y as x t ϕ i n c x y as x where ϕ i n c x y denotes the incident wave potential given by ϕ i n c x y e k y i k x and in the above equation r and t denote the reflection and the transmission coefficients the boundary condition on the inclined elastic plate surface can be written as 2 6 d 4 ϕ n p s 4 ε k ϕ n p k ϕ p on γ where p γ d e h 3 12 ρ 1 ν 2 g ε ρ ρ h e represents the young s modulus ν denotes the poisson s ratio and the densities of water and the material of the elastic plate are symbolized by ρ and ρ respectively in the above expressions h indicates the thickness of the plate assumed to be very small and ϕ p ϕ p ϕ p denotes the potential difference across the plate the dimensions of the quantities k ε and d are length 1 length and length 4 respectively the behavior of the potential function at the ends of the plate is directed by the condition cf hassan et al 2009 2 7 ϕ o r 1 2 as r 0 where r denotes the distance of a point in the fluid region from any one end of the plate also if the upper end of the plate is clamped and the lower end is moored then 2 8a ϕ n p s 0 ϕ n p at the upper end of γ 2 8b 2 ϕ n p s 2 0 3 ϕ n p s 3 m u ϕ n p at the lower end of γ here m u 2 k d sin 2 ψ e i cos 3 θ where k d is the spring constant and ψ denotes the mooring angle these edge conditions play crucial roles to solve the above boundary value problem given by equations 2 2 to 2 4 and 2 6 the method of solution is given in the next section 3 method of solution in order to solve the boundary value problem we first need to tackle the fifth order boundary condition 2 6 on the inclined plate in a judicious manner for this we take a new coordinate system x y where y axis is taken along the elastic plate γ and x axis is perpendicular to y the origin of this system is shifted to the mid point of the inclined plate where the depth of the mid point with respect to the previous coordinate system is d the two coordinate systems x y and x y are related by the following equations 3 1 x x cos θ y d sin θ y x sin θ y d cos θ where 0 θ π 2 now in the new coordinate system the boundary condition on the plate surface can be written as 3 2 d 4 ϕ x 0 y d y 4 ε k d ϕ x 0 y k d ϕ 0 y a y a or 3 3 d 4 ϕ x d y 4 α 4 ϕ x k d ϕ p 1 p 1 γ where α 4 ε k d the end conditions 2 8 take the forms 3 4a d ϕ x d y 0 ϕ x y a 3 4b d 2 ϕ x d y 2 0 d 3 ϕ x d y 3 m u ϕ x y a for the clamped moored plate we notice that if the right side of equation 3 3 is known then it represents a fourth order ordinary differential equation for ϕ x which is to be solved subject to the set of boundary conditions 3 4 this is done by the help of green s function technique cf meylan 1995 the green s function g y y satisfies the associated homogeneous boundary value problem given by the differential equation 3 5 d 4 g d y 4 α 4 g δ y y together with the end conditions 3 6a g 0 g y y a 3 6b g y y 0 g y y y m u g y a above mentioned green s function also carries the inherent properties 3 7 g g y g y y to be continuous at y y 3 g y 3 y y 0 3 g y 3 y y 0 1 the general solution of the differential equation 3 5 is of the form 3 8 g y y a 1 e i α y b 1 e i α y c 1 e α y d 1 e α y a y y a a 2 e i α y b 2 e i α y c 2 e α y d 2 e α y a y y a where a 1 b 1 are functions of y only using the end conditions 3 6a and 3 6b together with the properties of green s function the values of a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 are obtained by solving the following matrix equation 3 9 av w here a a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 v e i α a e i α a e α a e α a ie i α a ie i α a e α a e α a e i α a e i α a e α a e α a i α 3 m u e i α a

c 2 d 2 are found as 3 10 a 2 a 1 i 4 α 3 e i α y b 2 b 1 i 4 α 3 e i α y c 2 c 1 1 4 α 3 e α y d 2 d 1 1 4 α 3 e α y now the solution ϕ x to the differential equation 3 3 is expressed in terms of the green s function g y y and the potential difference across the plate as 3 11 ϕ x 0 y k d a a g y y ϕ y d y a y a the above equation represents the normal velocity of fluid at any point on the plate in terms of potential difference across the plate we now proceed to obtain a second expression for the above mentioned normal velocity for which green s integral theorem is applied on the scattered potential ϕ s c p ϕ p ϕ i n c p and the fundamental potential function g p p 2 due to a line source placed at the point p 2 ξ η here p x y is a point in the fluid region an expression for g is given by cf mandal and chakrabarti 2000 image 1 with r r x ξ 2 y η 2 here the path of the integration is along the ve real axis in the complex k plane indented below the pole at k k so that g also satisfies the radiation condition at infinity application of green s integral theorem on ϕ s c and g yields 3 13 ϕ s c p γ ϕ s c p 2 g n p 2 p p 2 d s p 2 where n p 2 represents normal differentiation at p 2 on γ and ϕ s c p 2 is the discontinuity in the scattered potential across the plate at the point p 2 since ϕ i n c 0 we can replace ϕ s c p 2 by ϕ p 2 so we obtain an integral representation of the total potential as 3 14 ϕ p e k y i k x γ ϕ p 2 g n p 2 p p 2 d s p 2 taking normal derivative of the above expression at a point p 1 on γ we get 3 15 ϕ n p 1 n p 1 e k y i k x n p 1 γ ϕ p 2 g n p 2 p 2 p 1 d s p 2 in the above equation if we try to take the normal derivative at p 1 inside the integral sign this would generally lead to a non integrable integrand to overcome this difficulty the integral is interpreted as a hadamard finite part integral cf martin and rizzo 1989 adopting this procedure we find image 2 here the sign denotes that the integral is considered as the hadamard finite part integral next we note that equation 3 11 can be rewritten as 3 17 ϕ n p 1 k d γ g p 1 p 2 ϕ p 2 d s p 2 comparing equations 3 16 and 3 17 we finally obtain a hypersingular integral equation of the first kind as image 4 the technique mentioned above is well established by several researchers cf martin and rizzo 1989 parsons and martin 1992 1994 for investigating various scattering problems of thin plates it can be seen that as d the second term of the kernel in equation 3 18 tends to zero i e as the plate becomes rigid the form of the kernel is similar to that of parsons and martin 1992 to convert the above hypersingular integral equation 3 18 into a compatible form we consider a parametrization the parametrization of the plate for numerical calculation is given by cf gayen and mandal 2003 3 19 x a u sin θ y d a u cos θ 1 u 1 ξ a t sin θ η d a t cos θ 1 t 1 by virtue of the above parametrization and introducing a new unknown function f t ϕ p 2 equation 3 18 can be cast as image 5 where 3 21 k u t cos 2 θ 2 π 2 x 2 a 4 u t 4 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 2 π cos θ sin θ xz x 2 y 2 2 sin 2 θ 2 π 2 y η 2 a 4 u t 4 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 1 π k y x 2 y 2 1 π x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 k 2 i e k y i k x k 2

of the form b u 2 π i k a e k y i k x e i θ a function of the variable u only the hypersingular integral equation 3 20 is to be solved subject to the condition f 1 0 for this we first approximate f t as 3 22 f t 1 t 2 1 2 n n 0 x n u n t where x n s n 0 1 n are the unknown constants to be found u n t is the chebyshev polynomial of the second kind the square root part makes sure that f t satisfies the edge conditions using the expansion 3 22 in equation 3 20 we obtain 3 23 n n 0 x n p n u b u where 3 24 p n u π n 1 u n u 2 π a 2 1 1 1 t 2 1 2 k u t u n t d t to find unknowns x n n 0 1 n we collocate 3 23 at n 1 number of points u u j j 0 1 n and get a system of n 1 linear equations 3 25 p x b where p p n j n 1 n 1 x x n n 1 1 and b b u j n 1 1 n 0 1 n j 0 1 n the expression of p n j is given by p n j π n 1 u n u j 2 π a 2 1 1 1 t 2 1 2 k u j t u n t d t here u j s are the roots of chebyshev polynomials of the first kind given by u j cos 2 j 1 2 n 2 π j 0 1 n the system of equation 3 25 is solved numerically to find the values of x n s these solutions are used to evaluate the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the hydrodynamic force here we should mention that the approximation of f t as given in 3 22 enables us to compute the hypersingular part of equation 3 20 analytically also the convergence of this method is well established cf golberg 1983 1985 3 1 reflection and transmission coefficients the behavior of the green s function at infinity is given by cf mandal and chakrabarti 2000 3 26 g p 2 p 1 i e k y i k x as x in order to determine the expressions of the reflection and the transmission coefficients r and t we first consider x in the expression 3 14 then using the radiation conditions 2 5 and the asymptotic expression of g p 2 p 1 we get 3 27 r k a n 0 n x n 1 1 e i θ e k η i k ξ 1 t 2 u n t d t 3 28 t 1 k a n 0 n x n 1 1 e i θ e k η i k ξ 1 t 2 u n t d t the values of x n s are computed by solving equation 3 25 and are substituted in the above equations to obtain the numeric estimates of r and t here r and t satisfy the energy identity r 2 t 2 1 3 2 hydrodynamic force on the plate the hydrodynamic force acting on the inclined elastic plate is calculated here the pressure p x y t at any point x y in the fluid region is given by the bernoulli s equation as 3 29 p x y t ρ φ x y t t ρ g y r e i ρ g 2 σ 2 ϕ x y e i σ t ρ g y therefore the hydrodynamic force acting on the plate has the form 3 30 ℱ ρ g k r e i a n 0 n x n 1 1 1 t 2 u n t d t at t 0 from the above expression we can write the nondimensional force per unit width on the inclined elastic plate as 3 31 ℱ 1 k ℱ ρ g a r e i n 0 n x n 1 1 1 t 2 u n t d t in the next section we discuss the results of r t ℱ 1 graphically 4 numerical results and discussions in this section we present the numerical results for the absolute values of the reflection and the transmission coefficients r and t and the hydrodynamic force ℱ 1 acting on the inclined elastic plate for different sets of parametric values the submergence depth of the mid point of the plate d half plate length a and the angle of inclination θ satisfy the inequality d a cos θ except fig 2 we compare the values of r computed from our present analysis with those in meylan 1995 for a surface piercing vertical elastic plate with free edges placed in deep water to carry out the comparison we change the end conditions 2 8 as 4 1a 2 ϕ n p s 2 0 3 ϕ n p s 3 at the upper end of γ 4 1b 2 ϕ n p s 2 0 3 ϕ n p s 3 at the lower end of γ also the conditions 3 4 and 3 6 are changed accordingly also we choose the parameters as d a θ 0 k λ 2 π d β λ 4 ε γ λ γ 0 005 and the dimensionless plate length is 0 5 where λ represents the wavelength β and γ are two dimensionless quantities defined in meylan 1995 from fig 2 it is evident that the results in our paper completely agree with those in meylan 1995 this establishes the correctness of our present analysis for figs 3 5 and fig 8 we make all physical quantities dimensionless with respect to the half plate length a we consider the situation when the plate is clamped at the upper end and moored at the lower end for the purpose of numerical computation values of few physical quantities are kept fixed those are mooring angle ψ 30 poisson s ratio ν 0 3 g 9 8 m s2 mooring stiffness 10 6 n m and n 15 in fig 3 we present a comparative view of magnitudes of the reflection and the transmission coefficients with respect to k a for several values of d a the other parameters d a 4 2 ε a 0 02 and θ π 4 remain constant these two figures clarify the fact that with increasing length of the gap between the top edge of the plate and the free surface the reflection coefficient decreases and the transmission coefficient increases this happens as the surface waves find more space to transmit on the other side of the plate in fig 4 we plot the magnitude of the absolute values of the reflection and the transmission coefficients as a function of k a for different values of inclination θ and fixed values of d a 4 and ε a here to present the graphs for different values of inclination we consider d a 1 keeping the fact in mind that the plate is completely submerged even when it is in the vertical position the absolute value of the reflection coefficient decreases and the transmission coefficient increases when the angle of inclination increases thus in those situations where we need a maximum reflection of wave energy the less inclination will serve the purpose better the requirement of the reflection efficiency of the breakwater is not the same in every situation because we need minimal reflection in many places in those cases one can optimize the reflection through maintaining proper inclination of the plate impact of elasticity of the plate during scattering of waves is presented in fig 5 fig 5a and b exhibit the facts that r decreases and t increases with increasing d a 4 stiffness up to a certain level for fixed values of θ d a and ε a therefore we conclude that the elasticity of the plate is a reason behind the reduction in the reflection of the incident wave this characteristic of elastic plate is crucial for breakwaters construction as low reflection provides more stable water surface this result is similar to that given in chakraborty and mandal 2014 in fig 6 we plot the absolute values of the reflection coefficient as a function of dimensionless wave number to show the effect of increasing rigidity of the plate when it varies within a large scale here fixed parametric values are θ π 6 d a 1 1 and ε a 0 02 it is clear from fig 6 that for moderate values of rigidity parameter 1 d a 4 10 the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in the rigidity however the reflection coefficient increases significantly with a large increase in stiffness as the plate becomes sufficiently stiff the reflection coefficient of the flexible plate is getting close to that of a rigid plate which we evaluate from equation 3 27 avoiding the last term from the expression of the kernel 3 21 since as d this term goes to 0 fig 7 represents the results for an elastic plate inclined at a fixed angle θ π 4 and three different plate lengths for these graphs we make all quantities dimensionless with respect to b which is the depth of the lowest point of the plate from undisturbed free surface i e b d a cos θ from fig 7a and b it is clear that the magnitude of the reflection coefficient increases and that of the transmission coefficient decreases with increasing plate length which is quite obvious now the magnitude of the hydrodynamic force acting on the inclined elastic plate is evaluated from the relation 3 31 and presented graphically in fig 8 in fig 8a we consider the changes in hydrodynamic force for different inclinations of the plate with fixed parametric values d a 1 1 ε a 0 02 and d a 4 2 with increasing θ we observe a noticeable decrement in the hydrodynamic force similarly in fig 8b the absolute value of the hydrodynamic force is presented for different values of d a 4 and for fixed values of θ π 4 ε a 0 02 and d a 1 1 the decreasing nature of the hydrodynamic force with increasing stiffness up to a moderate level shows the fact that an elastic barrier is capable of reducing the effect of waves in the sea 5 conclusion in this paper we have applied hypersingular integral equation approach to study the fluid structure interaction problem involving an inclined elastic plate submerged in deep water the plate is clamped at the upper end and moored at the lower end the reflection and the transmission coefficients along with the hydrodynamic force are computed and presented graphically for various parametric values the conclusions drawn from the presented graphs are variations of the reflection r and the transmission t coefficients with the submergence depth of the plate clarify the fact that r increases significantly with decreasing depth of submergence with the increasing angle of inclination r decreases and t increases this fact gives a clear indication that though the vertical plate plays the role of a better reflector the inclined plate is suitable for the situation where less reflection is required so depending on the requirement one can increase or decrease the inclination of the plate the elasticity of the plate affects the reflection and transmission increasing values of d a 4 up to a moderate level indicate the increasing elastic nature of the plate therefore a flexible plate reflects less wave energy which is essential in many cases of breakwater construction same submergence depth with different plate lengths will also affect the reflection and the transmission of water waves as the plate length increases more amount of wave energy is reflected hydrodynamic force exerted on the inclined elastic plate depends on its inclination with increasing angle of inclination the hydrodynamic force decreases representation of hydrodynamic force with the varying stiffness of the plate indicates the fact that elasticity of the plate reduces the effect of hydrodynamic force in the present study we have given emphasis on the determination of the amount of reflected and transmitted waves in presence of an inclined flexible plate our future endeavour will be to study the structural behavior of the elastic plate
