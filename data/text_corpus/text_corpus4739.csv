induced responses floating wind turbines mooring responses 1 introduction in the recent years there is a significant focus on renewable energies the oceans have a role in providing the required resources to meet the clean energy demands in the form of the wind wave and tidal energies out of these three possibilities arguably the wind is in a more mature state and onshore implementations are a common sight in numerous countries offshore wind has also taken its place on fixed bottom platforms for almost two decades in similarity to the history of the oil and gas sector there is now a progression towards deeper waters to explore higher wind speeds as of date multiple floating wind platforms have already been deployed as demo projects the hywind spar was installed in 2009 jonkman 2010 and a semisubmersible platform was towed to position in 2011 cermelli et al 2009 roddier et al 2010 many others are being considered for installation in the coming years bossler 2013 regarding oil platforms the industry has previous experience coming from more than half a century of installations however the loading on the wind turbines is different than that of the oil and gas platforms the presence of the turbine creates thrust and the height of the tower which can reach 90 m acts as a lever that creates a significant rotational force the blade aerodynamics also becomes a factor hence the wave loading is combined with significant aerodynamic loading additionally when the platform is floating mooring lines are required for station keeping imposing another layer of challenge the resulting system dynamics is highly coupled several codes are available to deal with the behaviour of the floating turbines and there have been many developments in this regard two possible approaches help to understand their performance experiment to code comparisons provide a sound basis while uncertainties in the experimental setup also require consideration for these combined systems model testing also represents a challenge for instance separate methodologies need to be developed to deal with different scaling laws that govern wind and waves jain et al 2012 an example of a work around can be described as making a thrust equivalent model of the turbine to replace a geometric model goupee et al 2014 code to code comparisons have also been a part of the progression towards improved numerical models the offshore code comparison collaboration continuation within iea wind task 30 phase ii oc4 robertson et al 2012 is an iteration of a series of similar studies in that work of which the authors were also a part of a semisubmersible platform with identical input parameters was tested to see the correlation between the results of the participants after limiting the variables apart from the user s knowledge of the software and the implementation of mathematical models the difference between the results comes down to the mathematical model itself quantification of these variations the model uncertainty aids in understanding the deviations between the methods this work focuses on one of the load cases of the oc4 phase ii study published in robertson et al 2014 the chosen environmental condition includes no wind to minimise the system complexity and focuses on the hydrodynamics and the mooring ideally before including wind forces all codes should be at a base level of agreement otherwise the added complexity will likely increase the divergence therefore it is important to quantify where the current state of art stands in this regard the study aims to be as inclusive as possible by considering all submitted results of the load case however a mathematical filtering method was applied to identify the outliers that may skew the comparison only the participants that provided data for all required responses i e the surge heave pitch motions and mooring loads are evaluated a preliminary analysis with a limited set of data was published in uzunoglu and guedes soares 2016a the mentioned work is extended here and an evaluation of user errors and the mooring models is added 2 assessment of model uncertainty when an uncertainty can be attributed to the variable nature of physical phenomena it is termed the fundamental intrinsic variability while its presence is acknowledged it cannot be eliminated the ocean waves are an example that represents this category the second type of uncertainty model epistemic uncertainty relates directly to the knowledge about a physical process as opposed to its nature it can be reduced by obtaining additional information about the problem guedes soares 1997 the hydrodynamic and mooring codes in this study are in this group increasingly complex mathematical models can be used to describe an event however with certain drawbacks increased input data and computational times are an example of limiting conditions consider two hypothetical models of higher and lower sophistication both with their associated model uncertainties even if the sophisticated model is better predictive the simpler model may be preferred considering other advantages the decision depends on the problem at hand the allowed error margins and the available resources for this reason model uncertainty does not dictate which method to use it aims to provide an understanding of the deviations then a suitable method can be chosen based on several variables in this regard the uncertainty values are an important factor to consider but they are not the decision therefore it is important to quantify the model uncertainty of all available methods to form a basis of judgment the principles for the quantification of model uncertainty are known for some time and have been used to assess the uncertainty of ship responses to waves guedes soares 1991 guedes soares and moan 1991 and also wave energy devices razenejad and guedes soares 2015 the method described below extends the application to wave induced responses and mooring loads of wind turbine support structures 2 1 description of the initial data set and preliminary considerations the oc4 phase ii comparative study had 24 participants using 19 simulation tools the output set contained 62 channels of platform response data in time series with a fixed step of 0 05 s they can be summarised as the wind and wave characteristics power generation and system loads and responses the entire data set evaluated the platform motions and the forces on the moorings the tower and the rotor from this output this work solely focuses on the motions and the mooring loads the participant who did not submit mooring loads was eliminated reducing the initial number to 23 in head waves the surge heave and pitch modes are prominent hence the sway roll and yaw motions aren t discussed mooring loads at the fairleads were chosen as opposed to the anchors since the time series are difficult to interpret in irregular waves frequency domain data through fourier analysis is used as in robertson et al 2014 when several groups submit results using the same code the effect of the mathematical model is annulled and the participant s approach to the modelling of the structure assumes the deciding role therefore the differences in motions should be attributed to the user s handling of the software and the input data this case is evaluated by comparing differences between identical code results consequently user related variations will be addressed separately 2 2 obtaining the model uncertainty in the presence of experimental values they act as a reference point for comparison in their absence a method of relative evaluation is required there are various ways of exploring the current data set in this manner they are discussed below it is explained in guedes soares 1990 that the knowledge of the rms allows different probabilistic statements to be made about the motions the probability of exceedance and the largest maximum expected to occur in n maxima in narrow banded spectra are examples similarly the model uncertainty of the responses can be directly related to the root mean square a response spectrum s sr ω root mean square rms is calculated by 1 r m s 0 s r ω d ω consider that the true rms of responses is known if a theoretical mathematical model returns rmsc a direct relation can be written to reveal the model uncertainty 2 r m s b r m s c in this case the variable b becomes the indicator of the model uncertainty longuet higgins 1952 guedes soares and moan 1985 in the absence of experimental data the rms in the uncertainty equation 2 becomes an unknown itself to remedy the problem instead of checking each model against the true rms value an alternative can be devised by providing a relative comparison of the entire group this approach was used by guedes soares 1999 on wave induced loads on ships the coefficient of variance cov was utilised as a standardised measure of dispersion in sets of discreet values as opposed to that study the current data presents a larger set due to the number of points to be evaluated throughout the response spectrum there are two possibilities to applying the cov approach in this case the first option is to compare the value at each frequency alternatively the rms values representing the full spectra of each participant can be utilised to provide an overall comparison each approach has associated advantages and disadvantages when applied to the entirety of the spectrum rms values will fail to capture the problem regions where the codes show greater dispersion conversely the interpretation is easier for this reason comparisons of cov values at each frequency were first used as a method to determine the regions of disagreement then for the selected regions the rms values of the range were used in this type of an approach the formulation of the model uncertainty for an arbitrary section of the spectrum becomes 3 b c o v r m s r 1 n σ r m s r μ r m s r in the equation above the standard deviation and the mean value are represented with σ and μ the rmsr refers to the root mean square values of a spectral range of n participants this formulation is used to represent the model uncertainty in tabular data for the upcoming sections 2 3 filtering the data set the coefficient of variance imposes a difficulty for smaller sample sizes to understand the problem consider its mathematical definition given as the standard deviation divided by the mean 4 c o v σ μ in a set of approximately 20 numbers when a rogue value that deviates by magnitudes is present the mean and the standard deviation will change significantly when multiple codes that use closely related numerical models exist these extremes may hint at possible errors to clarify the problem table 1 presents the results for the surge motion of the platform between 0 and 0 5 hz to avoid bias each participant is given a number from 1 to 23 p1 to p23 after shuffling the data a quick glance states that the values are below 10 except for p8 and p5 who have reported 104 and 16 respectively an inclusive comparison with all participants has a mean value of 6 7 excluding the p8 and the p5 lowers it to 1 6 in the absence of experimental data this type of filtering is challenging and always partially arbitrary however it is also true that the presence of experiments does not explain how codes fare against each other in that regard the arbitrary nature does not present a problem for the fundamental question in this work still the level of subjectivity can be reduced by implementing a mathematical filter and setting its criteria to be as inclusive as possible the initial values have the indicators for the definition of a possible range of acceptable results when a set is revised by removing the upper and lower 10 percent of the highest and the lowest values its extremes are eliminated however the reduced set is also likely to overlook valid results albeit this new set can still serve to deliver an acceptable range if a normal distribution is fitted to the reduced data through its the mean and standard deviation values then using a large confidence interval i e 98 in this case a new maximum and minimum of a range can be defined consequently the original set can be assessed to identify the values that lay outside these boundaries consider the values in table 1 to serve as an example removing the top and bottom 10th percentile removes 15 of the participants from the list p5 and p8 are the top 10 continuing to extract the bottom 10 leaves only nine values i e p3 p6 p9 p11 p16 p17 p18 p19 p21 this restrictive set provides the new mean μc and the standard variation σc of 3 41 and 2 90 respectively obtaining the 98 percent confidence interval with the critical value vc 2 33 results in an acceptable range rc of 3 35 10 17 the formulation is as follows 5 r c μ v c σ c μ c v c σ c checking the rms values in table 1 identifies p5 and p8 to be outside these limits the remaining results are kept and those two are eliminated the example given above was limited to the surge mode a participant needs to comply with this filter in all studied output channels to be included repeating the filter in a second iteration is possible but it may run the risk of high bias hence only a single pass was used 3 numerical model the load case and the final participants the model uses the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 mounted on the oc3 hywind spar tower jonkman 2010 the tower s total weight and the distribution are slightly altered and the details are available in the definition document robertson et al 2012 in a continuation of the previous code comparison studies oc3 jonkman and musial 2010 the platform is replaced with a semisubmersible composed of four columns three buoyancy columns help to stabilise the structure and the central column houses the tower turbine assembly a set of cross braces provides structural integrity as seen in fig 1 three catenary mooring lines situated at 0 120 and 240 with respect to the head wave direction provide the station keeping capabilities a summary of the platform and the mooring properties are listed in table 2 the viscous damping values in table 3 were assessed in an experimental programme coulling et al 2013 and updated subsequently in the oc4 project despite showing slight deviations participants of the oc4 phase ii have reported almost identical natural frequencies for the system robertson et al 2014 the surge sway and yaw frequencies are 0 01 hz the roll and pitch frequencies are 0 04 hz the heave frequency is 0 06 hz the platform eigenfrequencies are close to the lower end of the wave excitation region accepted to be as 0 04 hz 0 25 hz in dnv det norske veritas dnv 2013 surge mode is an exception and it is situated much lower the load case 2 6 is explained in the description document robertson et al 2012 as an inverted pendulum under the influence of wave loads the nacelle the drivetrain and the rotor are considered rigid and the generator is locked having no wind removes the complexity of the aerodynamic responses and focuses the study solely on the hydrodynamics the moorings the platform and the tower are allowed to respond in their respective degrees of freedom the waves are defined with a white noise spectrum limited to 1 m2 hz between 0 05 and 0 25 hz ideally choosing a flat spectrum would limit the discrepancies caused by generating the wave time series however there were certain differences in that regard which are also addressed later in the text the results were submitted as time series for the oc4 phase ii and here they are studied through the spectral densities and response amplitude operators table 4 presents the filtered list of participants with their codes and numerical models regarding hydrodynamics there are three primary models the morrison equation me morrison equation combined with the potential flow theory me pf and the potential flow theory combined with quadratic damping pf qd some codes alter these models through additions such as the instantaneous water level iwl and the instantaneous position ip in table 4 the primary approaches are given without parenthesis while the alterations are marked in parenthesis the mooring line models are quasi static qs finite elements fe dyn and lumped mass dynamic lm dyn 4 hydrodynamic models before presenting the tabular results in the sections below a few points are discussed here using figures to identify certain topics fig 2 verifies that all participants comply with the prerequisite of a wave spectra with 1 m2 hz amplitude between 0 05 and 0 25 hz compared to a theoretical white noise signal between 0 and 0 5 hz the rms values were approximately 20 higher than required however when compared between themselves their deviation did not surpass 3 of their mean rms the increase from the theoretical value can be explained by the differences outside the excitation ranges on both the lower and higher ends of the spectrum there is a small 10 3 and less amount of energy represented when summed throughout the entire range the discrepancy increases the rounding also needs to be addressed when comparing the coefficient of variance of the motions on a frequency basis calculating the cov of negligible numbers e g 10 9 to 10 4 will result in inevitably large values although they merely represent rounding errors to remedy this issue the response amplitude operators raos were preferred to obtain the cov in place of spectral densities this alteration makes it possible to take advantage of the physical interpretation of the raos for the translational modes of surge and heave 1 cm of motion was used as the cut off amplitude similarly 0 1 was utilised for the rotational mode of pitch this approach results in zero cov in areas that show responses below the threshold to set the focus only on the relevant information examining the spectral density of pitch in this light fig 3 illustrates the emergence of 3 separate groups up to 0 05 hz from there on the results tend to consolidate particularly in the central regions between 0 10 and 0 15 hz at the pitching eigenfrequency of 0 04 hz all codes detect the dynamic amplification albeit at different amplitudes this data is easier to see from the cov values of the pitch response amplitude operators in fig 4 the low frequency region between 0 and 0 05 separates itself from the rest therefore the model uncertainty study is divided into two parts the first part examines the full range of responses between zero and 0 25 hz and the second part evaluates the wave excitation range of 0 05 0 25 hz this approach helps to understand the reflection of different models in low frequency ranges where non linear effects are prominent in minimal wave excitation fig 5 shows that the behaviour is not limited to pitch and it is almost identical in the surge mode the results are very consistent inside the wave frequency region while there is a divergence in the estimation of the peak resonant response in low frequencies heave mode in fig 6 is a particular case where the natural frequency of the mode is inside the wave excitation range the drop off from the peak is different in this case along with the low frequency responses hence in heave mode there are differences throughout the entire range 4 1 combined low frequency and wave frequency ranges in scope of this work the combined frequency range is defined as zero to 0 25 hz it is evaluated in three classifications initially the comparison considers only the groups that utilise the same primary hydrodynamic approach i e the morrison equation me a hybrid method combining the potential flow theory with the morrison equation me pf and potential flow with added quadratic damping pf qd next these primary approaches are compared against each other the third classification details a one on one comparison of each hydrodynamic model including the alterations such as the instantaneous position table 5 lists the cov and rms values of the primary models only one participant depends solely on the morison equation hence no associated coefficient of variance is given in this case the mean rms value is the only indicator and it is notable that me responses are significantly higher than the other two groups the cov values of the pf qd and me pf that include potential flow point out that the alterations in the same approach can make a significant difference the codes that utilise me pf show a cov of 0 41 in heave responses the surge and pitch modes show significantly higher values i e 1 38 and 1 12 respectively the differences reduce in pf qd when the drag from the morison equation is replaced with the quadratic damping coefficient 0 14 0 22 and 0 17 for the surge heave and pitch it is also important to note that all codes in the pf qd group rely on hydrodynamics module of nrel s fast hydrodyn for motions which may cause this consolidation however there are individual differences in the implementation such as the inclusion or exclusion of the quadratic transfer function the data in table 6 focuses on comparing the primary models a clear outcome is that morrison equation is set apart from the alternatives for all modes what is also notable is that the me pf and the pf qd deviate similarly from the me approach both in the surge and heave modes including potential flow seems to consolidate the variation in this case lowering the cov to 46 10 and 36 percent for surge heave and pitch while broader grouping serves to understand the overall behaviour it disregards the alterations in each code when the combinations are evaluated a total of 28 possibilities of individual comparisons arises from the entire group they are detailed in table 7 the morison only approach utilises instantaneous water line and instantaneous position me iwl ip it continues to be highly divergent comparing pf me to pf me ip shows that adding instantaneous position into the equation causes changes between 6 and 16 percent a similar statement holds true for the instantaneous water line in pf me iwl the prominent difference is in the heave mode reaching 22 percent replacing quadratic drag with the morison equation results in differences of 5 percent in other modes and 10 percent in pitch pf me vs pf qd this data repeats the finding that inclusion of potential flow mostly consolidates the results the pf me qtf na ip iwl model requires attention considering that most results in the pf me section are below 20 the sudden increase to over 100 percent hints at an implementation error rather than a significant effect of the qtf na addition this statement can be reasoned through the results of pf me md na ip iwl which is very similar except for the omission of the quadratic transfer function and the inclusion of mean drift the data set points out that the primary indicator seems to be the inclusion of potential flow in calculations alterations such as instantaneous position and instantaneous water line do seem to produce differences while not being as prominent as the omission of potential flow the theoretical limits of the morison equation are respected some parts of the spectrum while disregarded in others this case is a likely cause of its divergence from the other models however the comparison of the pf me to pf qd also shows that a hybrid model that considers the morison drag can be useful when the quadratic drag cannot be estimated 4 2 wave frequency range when the frequency range is reduced to 0 05 0 25 hz the motions become a direct result of the wave excitation fig 4 describing the cov of the pitch raos had shown that excluding low frequency ranges increases the consistency of motion estimations significantly the change also means that the surge and pitch resonant responses are eliminated from the motions a similar order to the previous section is followed below to present the model uncertainty in this limited range the data regarding the primary groups are summarised in table 8 it can be related directly to table 5 the most noticeable change is in me pf which shows a significant decrease regarding their disagreement in the surge and pitch modes the pf qd results show smaller changes regarding the cov values since the pf qd results rely on the same hydrodynamics module it is as expected the behaviour is similar in tables 5 and 8 table 9 reveals that the disagreement between models drops significantly when low frequency responses are not considered surge fares better than heave and pitch modes for morison based models the cause may be the distance of the surge eigenfrequency from the wave excitation range the discrepancy in heave may be reasoned from the resonant responses coinciding with the wave excitation range the heave motion in fig 6 had already noted differences in model behaviour on each side of the resonance peak which happens at the eigenfrequency of heave at 0 06 hz similarly pitch mode resonates close to the lower edge of the wave excitation it can be estimated from this table that excluding the potential flow theory makes a notable difference around the resonant regions if the potential flow theory is included in the model i e me pf and pf qd the disagreement does not exceed 10 percent the cov drop of 0 46 to 0 06 is remarkable in the surge mode the likely cause of this change is removing the resonant amplitudes at 0 01 hz and disregarding the differences in the estimation of the peak value pitch similarly drops from 0 37 to 0 09 this set of results points out that the major disagreement regarding motion responses occur at lower frequencies and there is higher consistency in the estimations due to wave excitation the one on one evaluation of all models in table 10 shows that the uncertainty is significantly reduced from the detailed assessment in table 7 that represented the combined frequency range the comparisons to the morison model also reduces to approximately 20 percent in the surge mode in heave and pitch the values are significantly higher therefore the estimation of responses around resonant areas can be identified as a primary source of disagreement between models the implementation of pf me qtf na ip iwl may still be doubtful since it is highly divergent from the rest of the pf me group 4 3 user errors and differences in modelling practices the set of users that preferred nrel s fast allow to consider another perspective on the data when focused on a single code with identical mathematics the uncertainty is limited to the user s knowledge and the modelling practices theoretically in this type of a study where all input data is fixed there should be no differences in practice this is not the case as shown in table 11 the data reveals that slight variations were present in the wave spectrum it is likely that this detail has reflected in the estimation of motions where 15 percent cov values is an average the takeaway from this set is that the human factor in modelling practices and code usage cannot be neglected a method of reducing this type of errors would be to provide a detailed documentation to clarify doubts an alternative is to automate most parts of the process to leave no room for error as discussed in uzunoglu and guedes soares 2016b a very high number of variables come together to produce the results of a load case for this reason it s hard to point out the root of the variations however user errors in complex codes remain a factor that needs to be considered 5 mooring models the mooring models of the participants are limited to three approaches a quasi static qs model and two dynamic models based on finite elements dyn fe and lumped mass dyn lm are used only one dynamic code depends on the lumped mass model while others prefer finite elements there is a distribution of 6 dynamic and 5 quasi static codes fig 7 shows the spectral densities of the mooring line tension located at the incoming wave direction fairline 1 the behaviour tends to show two distinct groups the lf and wf regions do not appear to be the main concern unlike the motions in this case the divergence of estimations inside the wave excitation region is even more apparent than in low frequency regions table 12 compares the rms and cov values in this aspect there is a significant difference between the dynamic and quasi static models however an interesting finding is that the lumped mass dynamic approach delivers results almost identical to quasi static codes the coefficient of variance is 8 when compared to the qs approach the difference between the finite elements dynamic and the quasi static estimations reach 56 since both models include potential flow for hydrodynamics see table 4 the divergence is unlikely to stem from the hydrodynamic models it was clarified before that including the pf in calculations reduces the overall disagreement between codes the elastic behaviour of the mooring lines is affected by their total length which is approximately 835 m for the semisubmersible this information coupled with the experimental comparison of the quasi static mooring calculations previously published coulling et al 2013 uzunoglu and guedes soares 2015 may suggest that the qs model might be failing to capture the full extent of the mooring line dynamics 6 conclusions a quantitative evaluation of the motion and mooring load estimation of the oc4 phase ii participants was provided for a semi submersible wind turbine platform the study employed a mathematical filtering method to avoid skewing the data with outliers the load case was given as a white noise spectrum with only head waves and no wind the motions prominent in head waves i e surge heave and pitch were compared based on the hydrodynamics model used for obtaining them it was clarified that the agreement between the results relates to the region of the wave spectrum for this reason separate evaluations were carried out in the wave frequency range and the combined range of the low frequency and wave frequency regions inside each section initially the groups that use similar primary approaches were compared within themselves then a comparison of the groups that base their approach on the same primary model was given finally alterations to the main models were also examined by providing all possible combinations of the hydrodynamic models the inclusion of potential flow theory seemed to consolidate results however alterations to the models affected the behaviour the data pointed out that removing resonant areas resulted in the morison equation performing closer to the potential flow theory the differences in results due to user errors and modelling practices was briefly discussed a similar methodology was utilised to extract the uncertainty in mooring models unlike the hydrodynamics it was clarified that the mooring spectral densities did not seem to be significantly affected by the frequency range but depended on the approach taken quasi static and finite elements dynamic methods emerged as two main groups with a disagreement between themselves the lumped mass dynamic method provided results closer to a quasi static approach acknowledgements this work was performed within the

narrow banded spectra are examples similarly the model uncertainty of the responses can be directly related to the root mean square a response spectrum s sr ω root mean square rms is calculated by 1 r m s 0 s r ω d ω consider that the true rms of responses is known if a theoretical mathematical model returns rmsc a direct relation can be written to reveal the model uncertainty 2 r m s b r m s c in this case the variable b becomes the indicator of the model uncertainty longuet higgins 1952 guedes soares and moan 1985 in the absence of experimental data the rms in the uncertainty equation 2 becomes an unknown itself to remedy the problem instead of checking each model against the true rms value an alternative can be devised by providing a relative comparison of the entire group this approach was used by guedes soares 1999 on wave induced loads on ships the coefficient of variance cov was utilised as a standardised measure of dispersion in sets of discreet values as opposed to that study the current data presents a larger set due to the number of points to be evaluated throughout the response spectrum there are two possibilities to applying the cov approach in this case the first option is to compare the value at each frequency alternatively the rms values representing the full spectra of each participant can be utilised to provide an overall comparison each approach has associated advantages and disadvantages when applied to the entirety of the spectrum rms values will fail to capture the problem regions where the codes show greater dispersion conversely the interpretation is easier for this reason comparisons of cov values at each frequency were first used as a method to determine the regions of disagreement then for the selected regions the rms values of the range were used in this type of an approach the formulation of the model uncertainty for an arbitrary section of the spectrum becomes 3 b c o v r m s r 1 n σ r m s r μ r m s r in the equation above the standard deviation and the mean value are represented with σ and μ the rmsr refers to the root mean square values of a spectral range of n participants this formulation is used to represent the model uncertainty in tabular data for the upcoming sections 2 3 filtering the data set the coefficient of variance imposes a difficulty for smaller sample sizes to understand the problem consider its mathematical definition given as the standard deviation divided by the mean 4 c o v σ μ in a set of approximately 20 numbers when a rogue value that deviates by magnitudes is present the mean and the standard deviation will change significantly when multiple codes that use closely related numerical models exist these extremes may hint at possible errors to clarify the problem table 1 presents the results for the surge motion of the platform between 0 and 0 5 hz to avoid bias each participant is given a number from 1 to 23 p1 to p23 after shuffling the data a quick glance states that the values are below 10 except for p8 and p5 who have reported 104 and 16 respectively an inclusive comparison with all participants has a mean value of 6 7 excluding the p8 and the p5 lowers it to 1 6 in the absence of experimental data this type of filtering is challenging and always partially arbitrary however it is also true that the presence of experiments does not explain how codes fare against each other in that regard the arbitrary nature does not present a problem for the fundamental question in this work still the level of subjectivity can be reduced by implementing a mathematical filter and setting its criteria to be as inclusive as possible the initial values have the indicators for the definition of a possible range of acceptable results when a set is revised by removing the upper and lower 10 percent of the highest and the lowest values its extremes are eliminated however the reduced set is also likely to overlook valid results albeit this new set can still serve to deliver an acceptable range if a normal distribution is fitted to the reduced data through its the mean and standard deviation values then using a large confidence interval i e 98 in this case a new maximum and minimum of a range can be defined consequently the original set can be assessed to identify the values that lay outside these boundaries consider the values in table 1 to serve as an example removing the top and bottom 10th percentile removes 15 of the participants from the list p5 and p8 are the top 10 continuing to extract the bottom 10 leaves only nine values i e p3 p6 p9 p11 p16 p17 p18 p19 p21 this restrictive set provides the new mean μc and the standard variation σc of 3 41 and 2 90 respectively obtaining the 98 percent confidence interval with the critical value vc 2 33 results in an acceptable range rc of 3 35 10 17 the formulation is as follows 5 r c μ v c σ c μ c v c σ c checking the rms values in table 1 identifies p5 and p8 to be outside these limits the remaining results are kept and those two are eliminated the example given above was limited to the surge mode a participant needs to comply with this filter in all studied output channels to be included repeating the filter in a second iteration is possible but it may run the risk of high bias hence only a single pass was used 3 numerical model the load case and the final participants the model uses the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 mounted on the oc3 hywind spar tower jonkman 2010 the tower s total weight and the distribution are slightly altered and the details are available in the definition document robertson et al 2012 in a continuation of the previous code comparison studies oc3 jonkman and musial 2010 the platform is replaced with a semisubmersible composed of four columns three buoyancy columns help to stabilise the structure and the central column houses the tower turbine assembly a set of cross braces provides structural integrity as seen in fig 1 three catenary mooring lines situated at 0 120 and 240 with respect to the head wave direction provide the station keeping capabilities a summary of the platform and the mooring properties are listed in table 2 the viscous damping values in table 3 were assessed in an experimental programme coulling et al 2013 and updated subsequently in the oc4 project despite showing slight deviations participants of the oc4 phase ii have reported almost identical natural frequencies for the system robertson et al 2014 the surge sway and yaw frequencies are 0 01 hz the roll and pitch frequencies are 0 04 hz the heave frequency is 0 06 hz the platform eigenfrequencies are close to the lower end of the wave excitation region accepted to be as 0 04 hz 0 25 hz in dnv det norske veritas dnv 2013 surge mode is an exception and it is situated much lower the load case 2 6 is explained in the description document robertson et al 2012 as an inverted pendulum under the influence of wave loads the nacelle the drivetrain and the rotor are considered rigid and the generator is locked having no wind removes the complexity of the aerodynamic responses and focuses the study solely on the hydrodynamics the moorings the platform and the tower are allowed to respond in their respective degrees of freedom the waves are defined with a white noise spectrum limited to 1 m2 hz between 0 05 and 0 25 hz ideally choosing a flat spectrum would limit the discrepancies caused by generating the wave time series however there were certain differences in that regard which are also addressed later in the text the results were submitted as time series for the oc4 phase ii and here they are studied through the spectral densities and response amplitude operators table 4 presents the filtered list of participants with their codes and numerical models regarding hydrodynamics there are three primary models the morrison equation me morrison equation combined with the potential flow theory me pf and the potential flow theory combined with quadratic damping pf qd some codes alter these models through additions such as the instantaneous water level iwl and the instantaneous position ip in table 4 the primary approaches are given without parenthesis while the alterations are marked in parenthesis the mooring line models are quasi static qs finite elements fe dyn and lumped mass dynamic lm dyn 4 hydrodynamic models before presenting the tabular results in the sections below a few points are discussed here using figures to identify certain topics fig 2 verifies that all participants comply with the prerequisite of a wave spectra with 1 m2 hz amplitude between 0 05 and 0 25 hz compared to a theoretical white noise signal between 0 and 0 5 hz the rms values were approximately 20 higher than required however when compared between themselves their deviation did not surpass 3 of their mean rms the increase from the theoretical value can be explained by the differences outside the excitation ranges on both the lower and higher ends of the spectrum there is a small 10 3 and less amount of energy represented when summed throughout the entire range the discrepancy increases the rounding also needs to be addressed when comparing the coefficient of variance of the motions on a frequency basis calculating the cov of negligible numbers e g 10 9 to 10 4 will result in inevitably large values although they merely represent rounding errors to remedy this issue the response amplitude operators raos were preferred to obtain the cov in place of spectral densities this alteration makes it possible to take advantage of the physical interpretation of the raos for the translational modes of surge and heave 1 cm of motion was used as the cut off amplitude similarly 0 1 was utilised for the rotational mode of pitch this approach results in zero cov in areas that show responses below the threshold to set the focus only on the relevant information examining the spectral density of pitch in this light fig 3 illustrates the emergence of 3 separate groups up to 0 05 hz from there on the results tend to consolidate particularly in the central regions between 0 10 and 0 15 hz at the pitching eigenfrequency of 0 04 hz all codes detect the dynamic amplification albeit at different amplitudes this data is easier to see from the cov values of the pitch response amplitude operators in fig 4 the low frequency region between 0 and 0 05 separates itself from the rest therefore the model uncertainty study is divided into two parts the first part examines the full range of responses between zero and 0 25 hz and the second part evaluates the wave excitation range of 0 05 0 25 hz this approach helps to understand the reflection of different models in low frequency ranges where non linear effects are prominent in minimal wave excitation fig 5 shows that the behaviour is not limited to pitch and it is almost identical in the surge mode the results are very consistent inside the wave frequency region while there is a divergence in the estimation of the peak resonant response in low frequencies heave mode in fig 6 is a particular case where the natural frequency of the mode is inside the wave excitation range the drop off from the peak is different in this case along with the low frequency responses hence in heave mode there are differences throughout the entire range 4 1 combined low frequency and wave frequency ranges in scope of this work the combined frequency range is defined as zero to 0 25 hz it is evaluated in three classifications initially the comparison considers only the groups that utilise the same primary hydrodynamic approach i e the morrison equation me a hybrid method combining the potential flow theory with the morrison equation me pf and potential flow with added quadratic damping pf qd next these primary approaches are compared against each other the third classification details a one on one comparison of each hydrodynamic model including the alterations such as the instantaneous position table 5 lists the cov and rms values of the primary models only one participant depends solely on the morison equation hence no associated coefficient of variance is given in this case the mean rms value is the only indicator and it is notable that me responses are significantly higher than the other two groups the cov values of the pf qd and me pf that include potential flow point out that the alterations in the same approach can make a significant difference the codes that utilise me pf show a cov of 0 41 in heave responses the surge and pitch modes show significantly higher values i e 1 38 and 1 12 respectively the differences reduce in pf qd when the drag from the morison equation is replaced with the quadratic damping coefficient 0 14 0 22 and 0 17 for the surge heave and pitch it is also important to note that all codes in the pf qd group rely on hydrodynamics module of nrel s fast hydrodyn for motions which may cause this consolidation however there are individual differences in the implementation such as the inclusion or exclusion of the quadratic transfer function the data in table 6 focuses on comparing the primary models a clear outcome is that morrison equation is set apart from the alternatives for all modes what is also notable is that the me pf and the pf qd deviate similarly from the me approach both in the surge and heave modes including potential flow seems to consolidate the variation in this case lowering the cov to 46 10 and 36 percent for surge heave and pitch while broader grouping serves to understand the overall behaviour it disregards the alterations in each code when the combinations are evaluated a total of 28 possibilities of individual comparisons arises from the entire group they are detailed in table 7 the morison only approach utilises instantaneous water line and instantaneous position me iwl ip it continues to be highly divergent comparing pf me to pf me ip shows that adding instantaneous position into the equation causes changes between 6 and 16 percent a similar statement holds true for the instantaneous water line in pf me iwl the prominent difference is in the heave mode reaching 22 percent replacing quadratic drag with the morison equation results in differences of 5 percent in other modes and 10 percent in pitch pf me vs pf qd this data repeats the finding that inclusion of potential flow mostly consolidates the results the pf me qtf na ip iwl model requires attention considering that most results in the pf me section are below 20 the sudden increase to over 100 percent hints at an implementation error rather than a significant effect of the qtf na addition this statement can be reasoned through the results of pf me md na ip iwl which is very similar except for the omission of the quadratic transfer function and the inclusion of mean drift the data set points out that the primary indicator seems to be the inclusion of potential flow in calculations alterations such as instantaneous position and instantaneous water line do seem to produce differences while not being as prominent as the omission of potential flow the theoretical limits of the morison equation are respected some parts of the spectrum while disregarded in others this case is a likely cause of its divergence from the other models however the comparison of the pf me to pf qd also shows that a hybrid model that considers the morison drag can be useful when the quadratic drag cannot be estimated 4 2 wave frequency range when the frequency range is reduced to 0 05 0 25 hz the motions become a direct result of the wave excitation fig 4 describing the cov of the pitch raos had shown that excluding low frequency ranges increases the consistency of motion estimations significantly the change also means that the surge and pitch resonant responses are eliminated from the motions a similar order to the previous section is followed below to present the model uncertainty in this limited range the data regarding the primary groups are summarised in table 8 it can be related directly to table 5 the most noticeable change is in me pf which shows a significant decrease regarding their disagreement in the surge and pitch modes the pf qd results show smaller changes regarding the cov values since the pf qd results rely on the same hydrodynamics module it is as expected the behaviour is similar in tables 5 and 8 table 9 reveals that the disagreement between models drops significantly when low frequency responses are not considered surge fares better than heave and pitch modes for morison based models the cause may be the distance of the surge eigenfrequency from the wave excitation range the discrepancy in heave may be reasoned from the resonant responses coinciding with the wave excitation range the heave motion in fig 6 had already noted differences in model behaviour on each side of the resonance peak which happens at the eigenfrequency of heave at 0 06 hz similarly pitch mode resonates close to the lower edge of the wave excitation it can be estimated from this table that excluding the potential flow theory makes a notable difference around the resonant regions if the potential flow theory is included in the model i e me pf and pf qd the disagreement does not exceed 10 percent the cov drop of 0 46 to 0 06 is remarkable in the surge mode the likely cause of this change is removing the resonant amplitudes at 0 01 hz and disregarding the differences in the estimation of the peak value pitch similarly drops from 0 37 to 0 09 this set of results points out that the major disagreement regarding motion responses occur at lower frequencies and there is higher consistency in the estimations due to wave excitation the one on one evaluation of all models in table 10 shows that the uncertainty is significantly reduced from the detailed assessment in table 7 that represented the combined frequency range the comparisons to the morison model also reduces to approximately 20 percent in the surge mode in heave and pitch the values are significantly higher therefore the estimation of responses around resonant areas can be identified as a primary source of disagreement between models the implementation of pf me qtf na ip iwl may still be doubtful since it is highly divergent from the rest of the pf me group 4 3 user errors and differences in modelling practices the set of users that preferred nrel s fast allow to consider another perspective on the data when focused on a single code with identical mathematics the uncertainty is limited to the user s knowledge and the modelling practices theoretically in this type of a study where all input data is fixed there should be no differences in practice this is not the case as shown in table 11 the data reveals that slight variations were present in the wave spectrum it is likely that this detail has reflected in the estimation of motions where 15 percent cov values is an average the takeaway from this set is that the human factor in modelling practices and code usage cannot be neglected a method of reducing this type of errors would be to provide a detailed documentation to clarify doubts an alternative is to automate most parts of the process to leave no room for error as discussed in uzunoglu and guedes soares 2016b a very high number of variables come together to produce the results of a load case for this reason it s hard to point out the root of the variations however user errors in complex codes remain a factor that needs to be considered 5 mooring models the mooring models of the participants are limited to three approaches a quasi static qs model and two dynamic models based on finite elements dyn fe and lumped mass dyn lm are used only one dynamic code depends on the lumped mass model while others prefer finite elements there is a distribution of 6 dynamic and 5 quasi static codes fig 7 shows the spectral densities of the mooring line tension located at the incoming wave direction fairline 1 the behaviour tends to show two distinct groups the lf and wf regions do not appear to be the main concern unlike the motions in this case the divergence of estimations inside the wave excitation region is even more apparent than in low frequency regions table 12 compares the rms and cov values in this aspect there is a significant difference between the dynamic and quasi static models however an interesting finding is that the lumped mass dynamic approach delivers results almost identical to quasi static codes the coefficient of variance is 8 when compared to the qs approach the difference between the finite elements dynamic and the quasi static estimations reach 56 since both models include potential flow for hydrodynamics see table 4 the divergence is unlikely to stem from the hydrodynamic models it was clarified before that including the pf in calculations reduces the overall disagreement between codes the elastic behaviour of the mooring lines is affected by their total length which is approximately 835 m for the semisubmersible this information coupled with the experimental comparison of the quasi static mooring calculations previously published coulling et al 2013 uzunoglu and guedes soares 2015 may suggest that the qs model might be failing to capture the full extent of the mooring line dynamics 6 conclusions a quantitative evaluation of the motion and mooring load estimation of the oc4 phase ii participants was provided for a semi submersible wind turbine platform the study employed a mathematical filtering method to avoid skewing the data with outliers the load case was given as a white noise spectrum with only head waves and no wind the motions prominent in head waves i e surge heave and pitch were compared based on the hydrodynamics model used for obtaining them it was clarified that the agreement between the results relates to the region of the wave spectrum for this reason separate evaluations were carried out in the wave frequency range and the combined range of the low frequency and wave frequency regions inside each section initially the groups that use similar primary approaches were compared within themselves then a comparison of the groups that base their approach on the same primary model was given finally alterations to the main models were also examined by providing all possible combinations of the hydrodynamic models the inclusion of potential flow theory seemed to consolidate results however alterations to the models affected the behaviour the data pointed out that removing resonant areas resulted in the morison equation performing closer to the potential flow theory the differences in results due to user errors and modelling practices was briefly discussed a similar methodology was utilised to extract the uncertainty in mooring models unlike the hydrodynamics it was clarified that the mooring spectral densities did not seem to be significantly affected by the frequency range but depended on the approach taken quasi static and finite elements dynamic methods emerged as two main groups with a disagreement between themselves the lumped mass dynamic method provided results closer to a quasi static approach acknowledgements this work was performed within the

23696,peridynamic theory has been applied satisfactorily to crack and damage in massive materials and structures the use of peridynamics to calculate ice loads and simulate the ship ice interaction process is introduced the ice material property ice rubble model and the ship ice contact model for the calculation program are investigated several cases are studied in terms of different ice rubble sizes concentrations of ice rubble and sailing speeds major characteristics can be obtained including dynamic crack generation and propagation of ice rubble and sliding rotation and accumulation of broken ice these are observed commonly in polar and arctic activities crack generation and propagation are obtained naturally without setting extra criteria for crack extension pre existing crack routes or crack branching the capability of this approach is validated by comparison with available experimental results for calculating ice load and the ice breaking process keywords peridynamics ice load ice breaking ship ice interaction ice rubble voronoi diagram 1 introduction arctic activities increasingly frequent global warming has made the arctic regions more attractive for oil and gas exploitation the shrinking arctic ice cover will soon make resources more accessible kwok and cunningham 2012 shipping lanes in arctic regions are opening reducing costs and the risks of access this is advantageous not only for energy companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production but also for shipping and ship building offshore plants companies producing icebreakers and ice going vessels kim et al 2013 the investigation ice load exerted on ice going vessels and offshore structures is a key part of polar and arctic activity and it is also important in ship design kujala 1991 jia et al 2009 matlock et al 1969 proposed a model of ice structure interaction and eranti 1991 1992 later improved the model aksnes 2010 proposed a simplified model of a ship in level ice decomposing the ice force into destructive overturning and slip forces a full scale test is currently the fastest method to identify the ice load on icebreakers this produces reliable and accurate data but it is costly and unrepeatable making it unrealistic as a general approach to calculate ice load correlation studies between experimental results with refrigerated ice and synthetic ice have been conducted song et al 2007 kim et al 2009 and good agreement has been found model tests in ice tanks are most commonly used to deal with the ice loads but they are time consuming and expensive especially for the development of optimum hull forms kim et al 2013 fortunately ice ship interaction modeling using numerical methods has been shown to be both efficient and accurate both in theoretical research and engineering application the ls dyna finite element program has been successfully applied to structural and flow analysis problems derradji aouat and wang 2010 a numerical model for real time simulation of ship ice interaction developed by lubbad and løset 2011 shows the accuracy of numerical models correlation studies extend to comparisons between experimental results and numerical analysis based on the fluid structure interaction method used by kim et al 2013 despite the development of many important concepts to predict crack initiation and its growth in materials and structures it is still a major challenge within the framework of classical continuum mechanics the main difficulty lies in the mathematical formulation which assumes that a body remains continuous as it deforms therefore the basic mathematical structure of the formulation breaks down whenever a discontinuity appears in a body mathematically the classical theory is formulated using spatial partial differential equations and these spatial derivatives are undefined at discontinuities this introduces an inherent limitation to the classical theory as the spatial derivatives in the governing equations by definition lose their meaning in the presence of a discontinuity such as a crack madenci and oterkus 2014 because traditional numerical methods such as the finite element and boundary methods rarely obtain solutions to these problems a mesh free method seems more appropriate to develop an accurate numerical model and obtain reliable results in numerical simulation the material failure model should satisfy two main criteria das et al 2014 first the model must be able to predict the correct stresses and strains in failure second the predicted failure mechanism and fracture pattern must be in accordance with those found in experiments the finite element method as the leading numerical method was first used to simulate the fracture of ice but the difference between the continuity assumption and the real fracture model of the ice caused the difficulty in dealing with the generation and extension cracks daley et al 1998 a discrete method has advantages for modeling the discontinuous phase of the fracture process but accuracy problems during the continuous phase make it unreliable for modeling the whole process from continuous to discontinuous due to its independence from element grids during computation a mesh free method is suitable in the calculation of ice load and modeling ice ship interactions a new mesh free method called peridynamics was coined by silling in 1998 this theory is a reformulation of the classical continuum mechanics that employs a nonlocal model to describe material properties silling 1998 2000 silling and askari 2005 it assumes that particles in a continuum interact across a finite distance and it formulates problems in terms of integral equations rather than partial differential equations peridynamics manifests its unique superiority in addressing discontinuous problems which can be introduced to the calculation and simulation of ice loads and ice ship interactions in the present investigation peridynamics is applied for the first time in the calculation of ice loads and the simulation of the ice ship interaction process the basic peridynamics theory is introduced including the peridynamics model of a continuum and constitutive modeling that obtains the microscopic parameters and the description of failure a uniaxial compression test and three point bending test have been conducted to achieve the appropriate micro parameters ice rubble is produced using a voronoi diagram algorithm a ship ice contact model is developed in this work and a technique for peridynamics family members search is introduced finally several numerical simulations are conducted to validate the feasibility of this approach 2 bond based peridynamics peridynamics was proposed by silling in 1998 as a reformulation of elasticity theory for discontinuities and long range forces which are like molecular dynamics in the continuum situation silling 2000 in bond based peridynamics the kinetic equation of particle at x in the reference configuration at time t is 1 ρ x ü x t h x f u u x x t d v x b x t where h x is a neighborhood of x u is the displacement vector field b is a prescribed body force density field ρ is the mass density in the reference configuration and f is a pairwise force density function whose value is the force vector that material point x exerts on material point x to simplify the notation we denote ξ as the relative position which is 2 ξ x x and their relative displacement is denoted by η 3 η u x t u x t here the vector ξ η describes the relative position of the particles x and x in the current configuration peridynamics is analogous to molecular dynamics where the interaction between material points x and x is called a bond which one can view as a spring in the case of elastic interaction the property of a bond that shows interaction over a finite distance is a fundamental difference between peridynamics theory and classical theory the horizon δ a positive constant for a specific case is an essential concept of peridynamics the equation 4 ξ δ f η ξ 0 shows that when the distance between material points x and x is greater than δ i e material point x is beyond the horizon of x the interaction linking x and x vanishes as shown in fig 1 h x denotes the spherical neighborhood of x with radius δ to simulate spontaneous fracture in a deformation body bond failure is introduced in the material model presented above it will be assumed for simplicity that the scalar bond force f depends only on the bond stretch defined by 5 s ξ η ξ ξ y ξ ξ note that s is positive while the bond is in tension and such a material is isotropic since there is no dependence on the direction of ξ the simplest way to define failure into a constitutive model is by making bonds to fail as their deformation i e stretching or compressing is beyond a predetermined value once failure is occurs there will be no force in the bond permanently in other words when a bond fails it is dead forever so the model is history dependent considering the prototype micro elastic brittle pmb material silling and askari 2005 the bond force can be defined by 6 f y t ξ g s t ξ μ t ξ where g is the linear scalar valued function given by 7 g s c s where c is a constant and μ is a history dependent scalar valued function that takes on values of either 1 or 0 8 μ t ξ 1 i f s t ξ s 0 0 otherwise where s 0 is the extreme stretch for a broken bond whose value for the moment can be seen as a constant one advantage of introducing failure at the bond level is that it leads to an unambiguous notion of local damage at a point which is defined as 9 φ x t 1 h μ x t ξ d v ξ h d v ξ 3 micro parameters determined the elasticity modulus poisson s ratio viscosity factor ultimate bending and compression strength are crucial in numerical simulation to define the physical mechanical properties in peridynamics these properties are defined by special micro parameters such as bond constant and critical stretch model testing is an efficient approach to determine these parameters for the ice where micro parameters are adjusted to cater to the macro property of the specimens to achieve more accurate numerical models for subsequent research two typical model tests the uniaxial compression and three point bending tests which ware conducted by wang et al 2014 and ji et al 2011 for bohai sea ice in winter are simulated under the assumption that ice is an isotropic pmb material as described in bond based peridynamics the relationship between strain and stress is defined by the bond constant while the compression and bending strengths are reflected by the ultimate stretch of the bond the uniaxial compression model test is shown in fig 2 in which the size of specimen is 70 70 175 m m and the load is performed by a plate loading indenter aided by a hydro cylinder force is measured during the loading process and the compression strength takes the value of the maximum stress when the fracture occurs 10 σ c f max a 2 the result of the simulation of the uniaxial compression test is shown in fig 3 the numerical model of the specimen is established by 14 14 35 uniformly sized particles the loading indenter is built up by three levels of particles moving at a constant velocity 0 02 m s to model the compression effect the summation of the bond forces that exert on the indenter model is outputted as the loading force from which we can get the compression strength by eq 10 in the situation of compression the failure mode of the bond is only in terms of compression failure which is governed by the ultimate deformation in compression multi groups of micro parameters are attempted the typical stress strain curves from a model test and a simulation are plotted in fig 4 a three point bending model test is shown in fig 5 in which the size of the specimen is 75 75 700 m m with a 5 m m spacing between material points in accordance with the mechanical characteristics of a simply supported beam the loading force is denoted by p which is determined by the maximum normal stress 11 σ f 3 p l 0 2 b h 2 fracture occurs when bending normal stress reaches a maximum which is accepted as bending strength unlike compression two kinds of bond deformations simultaneously exist in the three point bending test considering that the bending strength and compression strength are unequal another micro parameter ultimate stretch in tension is introduced the typical stress time curves from a model test and numerical simulation are plotted in figs 6 and 7 respectively fig 6 shows the load time plot for this simulation it is observed that once the damage commences the load carrying capacity of the beam drops very sharply to zero indicating an elastic brittle damage type of response fig 7 displays the spatial distribution of the damage variable over the beam with the loading indenter particles moving at a constant velocity 0 02 m s from the contour plot shown in this figure it can be seen that damage initiation takes place in the tension zone at bottom also simultaneously with development of compression damage at the top ultimately combining the results of the uniaxial compression and three point bending tests a sufficient numerical model of ice material is established with two different ultimate stretches of bonds the bond force as a function of bond deformation in the ice material model is shown in fig 8 with micro parameters e 1 8gpa s 0c 0 003133 and s 0b 0 000625 these parameters are used in the subsequent study and they imply that the compression strength and bending strength are 5 6 m p a and 1 125 m p a respectively we have now developed the constitutive relation we sought and we will investigate it in a numerical example the possible range of parameters is collected and the characteristics which can be only described ice in bohai sea at 9 1 c or ice in some other regions with similar mechanical properties to further validate the deformation response of the model mentioned above with fem uniaxial and cantilever beam tests subjected to a quasi static tension loading of f 500 n and f 5 n are studied respectively the peridynamic discretization parameters are the same as before except for the applied loading and time integration scheme with adaptive dynamic relaxation the external applied loading is introduced in the form of a body force density in the boundary layer region the results are plot in figs 9 and 10 4 preparation for ship ice contact 4 1 ice rubble model voronoi diagram classification is used for polygon segmentation which is similar to the distribute the ice rubble in a channel in a two dimensional space the voronoi diagram is for a plane with n discrete points the plane is divided into n zones each consisting of a point and the zone occupied by the points is a set of the closest points imelińska et al 2000 it is defined as follows p i v v p 1 p 2 p n we have 12 v o r p i x r 2 d x p i d x p j j i 1 j n where d p x p 1 x 1 2 p 2 x 2 2 is the distance from point p p 1 p 2 to point x x 1 x 2 also the voronoi diagram for three dimensions is 13 v o r p i x r 3 d x p i d x p j j i 1 j n the method is applied to scatter some random points to a given region a convex polygon with the same edges as the number of the random points can also be generated according to the voronoi diagram algorithm the area of a given channel is known and the distribution density and the average scale of ice rubble can be obtained from statistical data then the amount of ice rubble can be obtained and the number of random points which is the same as the quantity of ice rubble and the polygon of ice rubble can be obtained using the voronoi diagram algorithm the corresponding ice rubble model can then be obtained by filling each zone with the material points fig 11 shows a model of a channel covered with ice rubble with concentration of 0 8 the average size of ice rubble is 30 m 2 with 51 200 material points and the volume of each material point is 0 015625 m 2 the different colors of the ice rubble represent the different material numbers produced by the voronoi diagram algorithm 4 2 the gravity and buoyancy of ice rubble the gravity is balanced with the buoyancy of an ice block in calm water and when a ship is considered the ice block deviates from its equilibrium position causing an imbalance of gravity and buoyancy and therefore having a further impact on the ice block movement in this investigation the buoyancy acting on ice block is approximately linearity affect the point s position consequently the result δ f of gravitational force density g and volume force density b of a material point changes linearly with the change of the position if the material point is completely below the waterline we have 14 δ f g ρ i g ρ w if the material point is completely above the waterline we have 15 δ f g ρ i for other circumstances we have 16 δ f g ρ i g ρ w l w δ where ρ i is the density of ice ρ w is the density of water l w is the length of material point immersion water and δ is the scale of a material point 4 3 ship ice contact model a new material points contact algorithm improved from di 2015 is introduced in peridynamics using points contact triangle elements a triangle element has three material points a b and c as its vertices as shown in fig 12 the contact process is divided into two stages called the first contact judgment and the second contact judgment the first judgment is to judge whether particle p and triangle abc contact when the distance between particle p and the plane of triangle abc is less than the particle radius whose value is equal to d x 2 contact occurs assuming the particle is spherical the distance of the particle p and the plane abc is defined in eq 17 and the critical distance is defined in eq 18 17 p p a b a c b b a c b 18 p d x where d x is the radius of the material point p p q if the first judgment cannot be satisfied the particle has no chance to contact the plane in which the triangle unit is located and the particle definitely does not contact the unit when the first contact judgment is satisfied it is necessary to further judge whether the particle has contact with the unit which is the second contact judgment this step is to determine whether the projection point q of the particle p is inside triangle abc if point q is inside triangular region abc the contact occurs and otherwise it will not touch it in this paper the center of gravity method is used to determine whether the projection point q is inside the triangular element for any point in the plane q must have the following relations 19 d u a v b where d a q a a c b a b and u and v are coefficients defined by eqs 20 and 21 respectively 20 u b b p a b a p b b b a a b a a b 21 v a a p b a b p a a a b b a b b a if projection point q is in the interior of the triangle abc the two coefficients must satisfy the following conditions 22 u 0 v 0 u v 1 when contact occurs the contact force is defined by the repelling short range force silling 2000 the force between two particles can be expressed as 23 f p p c s h p r s h 1 where c s h is the short range force constant and r s h is the critical distance beyond which the short range force does not exist the values of c s h and r s h can be chosen as c s h 5 c and r s h δ 2 madenci and oterkus 2014 4 4 family member search with link list a family member search for each main material point can be made very effectively while partitioning the body into many regions doing this can dramatically reduce the time spent in search of family members such a significant time reduction allows us to model very complex three dimensional structures in peridynamics madenci and oterkus 2014 taking two dimensions as an example to achieving this time reduction a body which consists of many material points should first be partitioned into many grids with sides that are 3 0 times d x as shown in fig 13 generally the horizon value is set to δ 3 015 d x showing acceptable accuracy and efficiency silling and askari 2005 if material point n in grid 7 searches its family member points the search process need only cover grid 7 and its neighboring grids i e 1 2 3 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 rather than searching all the material points that make up the body 5 validation of numerical cases 5 1 simulation of ship navigation in ice rubble the selected ship sailing in ice rubble with thickness of 0 5 m or navigating after an icebreaker sailing in level ice with thickness of 0 5 m is an ice strengthened container ship a resistance test using a model ship was carried out by guo et al 2016 in a towing tank the main parameters of this standard container ship and the model are shown in table 1 the first case is for a channel covered with ice rubble with concentration of 0 8 and average size of 30 m 2 the container ship has a speed of 7 knots the result and the historical force time curve are shown in figs 14 16 respectively to simplify the calculations the bow model is set up only for the section of the ship ice contact zone by continuously arranged particles the interaction is formulated by means of the bow model moving at a uniform velocity then the ice load f t is the summation of the short range forces exerted on bow material points a historical force time curve can be achieved by outputting the summation 24 f t 1 n s 1 n i t f s h v where f t is the ice load in t t h time step n s is the number of ship material points n i t is the number of ice material points that interact with the ship in the t t h time step f s h is the contact force density obtained by eq 23 and v is the volume of the ice material point figs 14 and 15 show that this method successfully simulated the container ship sailing in the ice rubble at the beginning the ice rubble moved forward in the horizontal direction owing to contact with the ship it is apparent that some ice rubble has accumulated in the bow of the ship as the long term effect of the ship ice contact process accompanied by this process broken ice has overturned due to the vertical force these pack ice fully in contact with the bow surface and broken ice blocks slip from the bow to the outside where they can move freely such as the bottom and sides far from the hull resulting from the relative motion between the ice and the hull s surface it is worth noting that in the process of ice contacts with the hull because the speed is high enough and the size of some ice rubble is large the rotation of ice rubble is insufficient to offset the overturning response of ship ice contact so some large ice blocks will be broken further however the amplitude of breaking ice blocks movement is larger than practice observed in ice tank this is partly because the effect of water is not considered enough compared with the continuously breaking ice in level ice although there is ice broken in both patterns sailing in a channel covered with ice rubble shows more continuous and stochastic characteristics additionally the red particles in the above pictures are a non physical phenomenon in peridynamic numerical simulation which has not yet been solved with a reasonable approach the authors hold believe these red particles are natural phenomena because many segments are tiny or invisible to the naked eye when an ice block is broken the historical force time curve for continuous breaking mode is shown in fig 16 the result plotted in fig 16 shows that the ice force during the process of ice breaking in ice rubble is distinct from the ice force in the process of continuous ice breaking in level ice it has an obvious periodic characteristic but it shows more randomness and relative continuity at a concentration of 80 the average size of the crushed ice is 30 m 2 the ice thickness is 0 5 m and the ship is sailing at 7 knots the maximum ice force reaches 0 85813 m n and the peak value of the ice force interval appears in pulse form the peak value shows random characteristics with the randomness of ice rubble the ice force in the x axis and z axis shown in fig 16 a and c show a similar trend with the total ice force in fig 16 d while the horizontal ice force in the y axis shown in fig 16 b shows asymmetry on both sides which is a result of the random arrangement of ice rubble the frequency maps of ice force obtained by numerical simulation and experiment are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively the overall trends of frequency in figs 17 and 18 are consistent but the frequency peak is offset we believe a reason for that lies in the difference resulting from the real ice and synthetic ice the magnitude of the horizontal ice force reaches the order of 10 5 n which shows a good agreement with the full scale result predicted result by guo et al 2016 5 2 influence of speed on ice load of ice breaking we examined the case of a channel covered with ice rubble with a concentration of 60 ice thickness of 0 5 m and an average size of ice rubble of 10 m 2 four computational conditions were established with speeds of 3 5 7 and 9 knots the resulting historical force time curve is shown in fig 19 fig 19 shows that as the speed increases so does the frequency of ice load the ice force at a speed of 9 knots is almost continuously in contact with the hull in addition when the speed increases the maximum ice load is increases fig 20 shows that the trend of maximum ice force of these four groups varies with the speed as the speed increases the time of interaction between the hull and the ice rubble is less and the kinetic energy of ice rubble is greater which is why the ice force increases with the speed the maximum ice force at 9 knots is 1 8 times that at a speed of 3 knots which differs from the result predicted by guo et al 2016 which was about 3 6 but showing good agreement with the work done by kim et al 2009 further increasing the speed will increase the ice force to a dangerous level so a reasonable speed should be guaranteed during ice breaking 5 3 influence of concentration on ice load of ice breaking in this case the container ship sails at a speed of 3 knots the channel is covered with ice rubble of average size 30 m 2 and the thickness of the ice is 0 5 m a comparative analysis was performed of the effect of different concentrations of ice rubble on ice load in a channel with concentration of 40 60 and 80 channels covered with different concentrations are shown in fig 21 the historical fore time curves are shown in fig 22 the concentration of ice rubble has a significant effect on the frequency of ice force and the maximun ice load the frequency of ice load shows an increase as the concentration of ice rubble rises the amplitude of ice force greater than 10 5 n with concentration of 80 60 and 40 is 31 22 and 13 times respectively this phenomenon occurs because the probability of collision between ship and ice decreases as the concentration decreases in these three cases the maximum ice forces are 473280 401510 and 305400 n respectively fig 23 shows that the tendency of the maximum ice force varies according to concentration and the maximum ice force sailing in a concentration of 80 is 1 55 times that in a concentration of 60 which agrees with the result of guo et al 2016 in a certain range 5 4 influence of average size of ice rubble on ice load of ice breaking in this case the container ship sails with a speed of 7 knots in a channel covered with ice rubble with a concentration of 80 and the thickness of the ice is 0 5 m we comparatively analyze the effect of average size of ice rubble on the ice load with values of 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 m 2 respectively the diagrams of different average sizes of ice rubble are shown in fig 24 the historical force time curves of sailing in different average sizes of ice rubble are shown in fig 25 the maximum ice force of sailing in different average sizes is shown in fig 26 fig 25 shows that as the average size of ice rubble rises the frequency of ice force decreases which can be intercepted as the amount of ice rubble growing as its average size drops fig 26 shows that with the concentration of ice rubble fixed the maximun ice force fluctuates in a certain range with different average sizes of ice rubble for example with a concentration of 80 the maximum ice force of different average sizes of ice rubble on the ship is between 51829 n and 85813 n with a mean value of 665740 n which shows good agreement with the result by guo et al 2016 6 conclusions peridynamics is first introduced to model ship ice contact and the ice rubble is modeled using a voronoi diagram algorithm ice load and the characteristics of the ice breaking process are successfully captured while sailing in a channel with different concentrations and average sizes of ice rubble although the gravity and buoyancy of ice are not given enough consideration from simulation results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the critical bond length s 0 c 0 003133 and s 0 b 0 000625 obtained by choosing as an empirical value which is modified along with a set of parameters to calibrate the experiment results of compression and bending respectively can describe the mechanical characteristics of ice 2 velocity shows a significant influence on the ice load with increases in speed the frequency of the ice load rose significantly and the maximum ice force at a speed of 9 knots was 1 8 times that with a speed of 3 knots for an ice thickness of 0 5 m 3 concentration shows considerable influence on the frequency and magnitude of the ice force the frequency of ice load shows an upward trend as the concentration of ice rubble rises so does the magnitude of ice load the maximum ice force sailing in concentration of 80 is 1 55 times that in a concentration of 60 for ice thickness of 0 5 m 4 the average size of ice rubble has a noticeable influence on the frequency of the ice load as the average size of ice rubble rises the frequency of the ice force becomes lower however with a fixed concentration of ice rubble the maximum ice force fluctuates in a certain range with different average sizes of ice rubble acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos 51579054

23696,peridynamic theory has been applied satisfactorily to crack and damage in massive materials and structures the use of peridynamics to calculate ice loads and simulate the ship ice interaction process is introduced the ice material property ice rubble model and the ship ice contact model for the calculation program are investigated several cases are studied in terms of different ice rubble sizes concentrations of ice rubble and sailing speeds major characteristics can be obtained including dynamic crack generation and propagation of ice rubble and sliding rotation and accumulation of broken ice these are observed commonly in polar and arctic activities crack generation and propagation are obtained naturally without setting extra criteria for crack extension pre existing crack routes or crack branching the capability of this approach is validated by comparison with available experimental results for calculating ice load and the ice breaking process keywords peridynamics ice load ice breaking ship ice interaction ice rubble voronoi diagram 1 introduction arctic activities increasingly frequent global warming has made the arctic regions more attractive for oil and gas exploitation the shrinking arctic ice cover will soon make resources more accessible kwok and cunningham 2012 shipping lanes in arctic regions are opening reducing costs and the risks of access this is advantageous not only for energy companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production but also for shipping and ship building offshore plants companies producing icebreakers and ice going vessels kim et al 2013 the investigation ice load exerted on ice going vessels and offshore structures is a key part of polar and arctic activity and it is also important in ship design kujala 1991 jia et al 2009 matlock et al 1969 proposed a model of ice structure interaction and eranti 1991 1992 later improved the model aksnes 2010 proposed a simplified model of a ship in level ice decomposing the ice force into destructive overturning and slip forces a full scale test is currently the fastest method to identify the ice load on icebreakers this produces reliable and accurate data but it is costly and unrepeatable making it unrealistic as a general approach to calculate ice load correlation studies between experimental results with refrigerated ice and synthetic ice have been conducted song et al 2007 kim et al 2009 and good agreement has been found model tests in ice tanks are most commonly used to deal with the ice loads but they are time consuming and expensive especially for the development of optimum hull forms kim et al 2013 fortunately ice ship interaction modeling using numerical methods has been shown to be both efficient and accurate both in theoretical research and engineering application the ls dyna finite element program has been successfully applied to structural and flow analysis problems derradji aouat and wang 2010 a numerical model for real time simulation of ship ice interaction developed by lubbad and løset 2011 shows the accuracy of numerical models correlation studies extend to comparisons between experimental results and numerical analysis based on the fluid structure interaction method used by kim et al 2013 despite the development of many important concepts to predict crack initiation and its growth in materials and structures it is still a major challenge within the framework of classical continuum mechanics the main difficulty lies in the mathematical formulation which assumes that a body remains continuous as it deforms therefore the basic mathematical structure of the formulation breaks down whenever a discontinuity appears in a body mathematically the classical theory is formulated using spatial partial differential equations and these spatial derivatives are undefined at discontinuities this introduces an inherent limitation to the classical theory as the spatial derivatives in the governing equations by definition lose their meaning in the presence of a discontinuity such as a crack madenci and oterkus 2014 because traditional numerical methods such as the finite element and boundary methods rarely obtain solutions to these problems a mesh free method seems more appropriate to develop an accurate numerical model and obtain reliable results in numerical simulation the material failure model should satisfy two main criteria das et al 2014 first the model must be able to predict the correct stresses and strains in failure second the predicted failure mechanism and fracture pattern must be in accordance with those found in experiments the finite element method as the leading numerical method was first used to simulate the fracture of ice but the difference between the continuity assumption and the real fracture model of the ice caused the difficulty in dealing with the generation and extension cracks daley et al 1998 a discrete method has advantages for modeling the discontinuous phase of the fracture process but accuracy problems during the continuous phase make it unreliable for modeling the whole process from continuous to discontinuous due to its independence from element grids during computation a mesh free method is suitable in the calculation of ice load and modeling ice ship interactions a new mesh free method called peridynamics was coined by silling in 1998 this theory is a reformulation of the classical continuum mechanics that employs a nonlocal model to describe material properties silling 1998 2000 silling and askari 2005 it assumes that particles in a continuum interact across a finite distance and it formulates problems in terms of integral equations rather than partial differential equations peridynamics manifests its unique superiority in addressing discontinuous problems which can be introduced to the calculation and simulation of ice loads and ice ship interactions in the present investigation peridynamics is applied for the first time in the calculation of ice loads and the simulation of the ice ship interaction process the basic peridynamics theory is introduced including the peridynamics model of a continuum and constitutive modeling that obtains the microscopic parameters and the description of failure a uniaxial compression test and three point bending test have been conducted to achieve the appropriate micro parameters ice rubble is produced using a voronoi diagram algorithm a ship ice contact model is developed in this work and a technique for peridynamics family members search is introduced finally several numerical simulations are conducted to validate the feasibility of this approach 2 bond based peridynamics peridynamics was proposed by silling in 1998 as a reformulation of elasticity theory for discontinuities and long range forces which are like molecular dynamics in the continuum situation silling 2000 in bond based peridynamics the kinetic equation of particle at x in the reference configuration at time t is 1 ρ x ü x t h x f u u x x t d v x b x t where h x is a neighborhood of x u is the displacement vector field b is a prescribed body force density field ρ is the mass density in the reference configuration and f is a pairwise force density function whose value is the force vector that material point x exerts on material point x to simplify the notation we denote ξ as the relative position which is 2 ξ x x and their relative displacement is denoted by η 3 η u x t u x t here the vector ξ η describes the relative position of the particles x and x in the current configuration peridynamics is analogous to molecular dynamics where the interaction between material points x and x is called a bond which one can view as a spring in the case of elastic interaction the property of a bond that shows interaction over a finite distance is a fundamental difference between peridynamics theory and classical theory the horizon δ a positive constant for a specific case is an essential concept of peridynamics the equation 4 ξ δ f η ξ 0 shows that when the distance between material points x and x is greater than δ i e material point x is beyond the horizon of x the interaction linking x and x vanishes as shown in fig 1 h x denotes the spherical neighborhood of x with radius δ to simulate spontaneous fracture in a deformation body bond failure is introduced in the material model presented above it will be assumed for simplicity that the scalar bond force f depends only on the bond stretch defined by 5 s ξ η ξ ξ y ξ ξ note that s is positive while the bond is in tension and such a material is isotropic since there is no dependence on the direction of ξ the simplest way to define failure into a constitutive model is by making bonds to fail as their deformation i e stretching or compressing is beyond a predetermined value once failure is occurs there will be no force in the bond permanently in other words when a bond fails it is dead forever so the model is history dependent considering the prototype micro elastic brittle pmb material silling and askari 2005 the bond force can be defined by 6 f y t ξ g s t ξ μ t ξ where g is the linear scalar valued function given by 7 g s c s where c is a constant and μ is a history dependent scalar valued function that takes on values of either 1 or 0 8 μ t ξ 1 i f s t ξ s 0 0 otherwise where s 0 is the extreme stretch for a broken bond whose value for the moment can be seen as a constant one advantage of introducing failure at the bond level is that it leads to an unambiguous notion of local damage at a point which is defined as 9 φ x t 1 h μ x t ξ d v ξ h d v ξ 3 micro parameters determined the elasticity modulus poisson s ratio viscosity factor ultimate bending and compression strength are crucial in numerical simulation to define the physical mechanical properties in peridynamics these properties are defined by special micro parameters such as bond constant and critical stretch model testing is an efficient approach to determine these parameters for the ice where micro parameters are adjusted to cater to the macro property of the specimens to achieve more accurate numerical models for subsequent research two typical model tests the uniaxial compression and three point bending tests which ware conducted by wang et al 2014 and ji et al 2011 for bohai sea ice in winter are simulated under the assumption that ice is an isotropic pmb material as described in bond based peridynamics the relationship between strain and stress is defined by the bond constant while the compression and bending strengths are reflected by the ultimate stretch of the bond the uniaxial compression model test is shown in fig 2 in which the size of specimen is 70 70 175 m m and the load is performed by a plate loading indenter aided by a hydro cylinder force is measured during the loading process and the compression strength takes the value of the maximum stress when the fracture occurs 10 σ c f max a 2 the result of the simulation of the uniaxial compression test is shown in fig 3 the numerical model of the specimen is established by 14 14 35 uniformly sized particles the loading indenter is built up by three levels of particles moving at a constant velocity 0 02 m s to model the compression effect the summation of the bond forces that exert on the indenter model is outputted as the loading force from which we can get the compression strength by eq 10 in the situation of compression the failure mode of the bond is only in terms of compression failure which is governed by the ultimate deformation in compression multi groups of micro parameters are attempted the typical stress strain curves from a model test and a simulation are plotted in fig 4 a three point bending model test is shown in fig 5 in which the size of the specimen is 75 75 700 m m with a 5 m m spacing between material points in accordance with the mechanical characteristics of a simply supported beam the loading force is denoted by p which is determined by the maximum normal stress 11 σ f 3 p l 0 2 b h 2 fracture occurs when bending normal stress reaches a maximum which is accepted as bending strength unlike compression two kinds of bond deformations simultaneously exist in the three point bending test considering that the bending strength and compression strength are unequal another micro parameter ultimate stretch in tension is introduced the typical stress time curves from a model test and numerical simulation are plotted in figs 6 and 7 respectively fig 6 shows the load time plot for this simulation it is observed that once the damage commences the load carrying capacity of the beam drops very sharply to zero indicating an elastic brittle damage type of response fig 7 displays the spatial distribution of the damage variable over the beam with the loading indenter particles moving at a constant velocity 0 02 m s from the contour plot shown in this figure it can be seen that damage initiation takes place in the tension zone at bottom also simultaneously with development of compression damage at the top ultimately combining the results of the uniaxial compression and three point bending tests a sufficient numerical model of ice material is established with two different ultimate stretches of bonds the bond force as a function of bond deformation in the ice material model is shown in fig 8 with micro parameters e 1 8gpa s 0c 0 003133 and s 0b 0 000625 these parameters are used in the subsequent study and they imply that the compression strength and bending strength are 5 6 m p a and 1 125 m p a respectively we have now developed the constitutive relation we sought and we will investigate it in a numerical example the possible range of parameters is collected and the characteristics which can be only described ice in bohai sea at 9 1 c or ice in some other regions with similar mechanical properties to further validate the deformation response of the model mentioned above with fem uniaxial and cantilever beam tests subjected to a quasi static tension loading of f 500 n and f 5 n are studied respectively the peridynamic discretization parameters are the same as before except for the applied loading and time integration scheme with adaptive dynamic relaxation the external applied loading is introduced in the form of a body force density in the boundary layer region the results are plot in figs 9 and 10 4 preparation for ship ice contact 4 1 ice rubble model voronoi diagram classification is used for polygon segmentation which is similar to the distribute the ice rubble in a channel in a two dimensional space the voronoi diagram is for a plane with n discrete points the plane is divided into n zones each consisting of a point and the zone occupied by the points is a set of the closest points imelińska et al 2000 it is defined as follows p i v v p 1 p 2 p n we have 12 v o r p i x r 2 d x p i d x p j j i 1 j n where d p x p 1 x 1 2 p 2 x 2 2 is the distance from point p p 1 p 2 to point x x 1 x 2 also the voronoi diagram for three dimensions is 13 v o r p i x r 3 d x p i d x p j j i 1 j n the method is applied to scatter some random points to a given region a convex polygon with the same edges as the number of the random points can also be generated according to the voronoi diagram algorithm the area of a given channel is known and the distribution density and the average scale of ice rubble can be obtained from statistical data then the amount of ice rubble can be obtained and the number of random points which is the same as the quantity of ice rubble and the polygon of ice rubble can be obtained using the voronoi diagram algorithm the corresponding ice rubble model can then be obtained by filling each zone with the material points fig 11 shows a model of a channel covered with ice rubble with concentration of 0 8 the average size of ice rubble is 30 m 2 with 51 200 material points and the volume of each material point is 0 015625 m 2 the different colors of the ice rubble represent the different material numbers produced by the voronoi diagram algorithm 4 2 the gravity and buoyancy of ice rubble the gravity is balanced with the buoyancy of an ice block in calm water and when a ship is considered the ice block deviates from its equilibrium position causing an imbalance of gravity and buoyancy and therefore having a further impact on the ice block movement in this investigation the buoyancy acting on ice block is approximately linearity affect the point s position consequently the result δ f of gravitational force density g and volume force density b of a material point changes linearly with the change of the position if the material point is completely below the waterline we have 14 δ f g ρ i g ρ w if the material point is completely above the waterline we have 15 δ f g ρ i for other circumstances we have 16 δ f g ρ i g ρ w l w δ where ρ i is the density of ice ρ w is the density of water l w is the length of material point immersion water and δ is the scale of a material point 4 3 ship ice contact model a new material points contact algorithm improved from di 2015 is introduced in peridynamics using points contact triangle elements a triangle element has three material points a b and c as its vertices as shown in fig 12 the contact process is divided into two stages called the first contact judgment and the second contact judgment the first judgment is to judge whether particle p and triangle abc contact when the distance between particle p and the plane of triangle abc is less than the particle radius whose value is equal to d x 2 contact occurs assuming the particle is spherical the distance of the particle p and the plane abc is defined in eq 17 and the critical distance is defined in eq 18 17 p p a b a c b b a c b 18 p d x where d x is the radius of the material point p p q if the first judgment cannot be satisfied the particle has no chance to contact the plane in which the triangle unit is located and the particle definitely does not contact the unit when the first contact judgment is satisfied it is necessary to further judge whether the particle has contact with the unit which is the second contact judgment this step is to determine whether the projection point q of the particle p is inside triangle abc if point q is inside triangular region abc the contact occurs and otherwise it will not touch it in this paper the center of gravity method is used to determine whether the projection point q is inside the triangular element for any point in the plane q must have the following relations 19 d u a v b where d a q a a c b a b and u and v are coefficients defined by eqs 20 and 21 respectively 20 u b b p a b a p b b b a a b a a b 21 v a a p b a b p a a a b b a b b a if projection point q is in the interior of the triangle abc the two coefficients must satisfy the following conditions 22 u 0 v 0 u v 1 when contact occurs the contact force is defined by the repelling short range force silling 2000 the force between two particles can be expressed as 23 f p p c s h p r s h 1 where c s h is the short range force constant and r s h is the critical distance beyond which the short range force does not exist the values of c s h and r s h can be chosen as c s h 5 c and r s h δ 2 madenci and oterkus 2014 4 4 family member search with link list a family member search for each main material point can be made very effectively while partitioning the body into many regions doing this can dramatically reduce the time spent in search of family members such a significant time reduction allows us to model very complex three dimensional structures in peridynamics madenci and oterkus 2014 taking two dimensions as an example to achieving this time reduction a body which consists of many material points should first be partitioned into many grids with sides that are 3 0 times d x as shown in fig 13 generally the horizon value is set to δ 3 015 d x showing acceptable accuracy and efficiency silling and askari 2005 if material point n in grid 7 searches its family member points the search process need only cover grid 7 and its neighboring grids i e 1 2 3 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 rather than searching all the material points that make up the body 5 validation of numerical cases 5 1 simulation of ship navigation in ice rubble the selected ship sailing in ice rubble with thickness of 0 5 m or navigating after an icebreaker sailing in level ice with thickness of 0 5 m is an ice strengthened container ship a resistance test using a model ship was carried out by guo et al 2016 in a towing tank the main parameters of this standard container ship and the model are shown in table 1 the first case is for a channel covered with ice rubble with concentration of 0 8 and average size of 30 m 2 the container ship has a speed of 7 knots the result and the historical force time curve are shown in figs 14 16 respectively to simplify the calculations the bow model is set up only for the section of the ship ice contact zone by continuously arranged particles the interaction is formulated by means of the bow model moving at a uniform velocity then the ice load f t is the summation of the short range forces exerted on bow material points a historical force time curve can be achieved by outputting the summation 24 f t 1 n s 1 n i t f s h v where f t is the ice load in t t h time step n s is the number of ship material points n i t is the number of ice material points that interact with the ship in the t t h time step f s h is the contact force density obtained by eq 23 and v is the volume of the ice material point figs 14 and 15 show that this method successfully simulated the container ship sailing in the ice rubble at the beginning the ice rubble moved forward in the horizontal direction owing to contact with the ship it is apparent that some ice rubble has accumulated in the bow of the ship as the long term effect of the ship ice contact process accompanied by this process broken ice has overturned due to the vertical force these pack ice fully in contact with the bow surface and broken ice blocks slip from the bow to the outside where they can move freely such as the bottom and sides far from the hull resulting from the relative motion between the ice and the hull s surface it is worth noting that in the process of ice contacts with the hull because the speed is high enough and the size of some ice rubble is large the rotation of ice rubble is insufficient to offset the overturning response of ship ice contact so some large ice blocks will be broken further however the amplitude of breaking ice blocks movement is larger than practice observed in ice tank this is partly because the effect of water is not considered enough compared with the continuously breaking ice in level ice although there is ice broken in both patterns sailing in a channel covered with ice rubble shows more continuous and stochastic characteristics additionally the red particles in the above pictures are a non physical phenomenon in peridynamic numerical simulation which has not yet been solved with a reasonable approach the authors hold believe these red particles are natural phenomena because many segments are tiny or invisible to the naked eye when an ice block is broken the historical force time curve for continuous breaking mode is shown in fig 16 the result plotted in fig 16 shows that the ice force during the process of ice breaking in ice rubble is distinct from the ice force in the process of continuous ice breaking in level ice it has an obvious periodic characteristic but it shows more randomness and relative continuity at a concentration of 80 the average size of the crushed ice is 30 m 2 the ice thickness is 0 5 m and the ship is sailing at 7 knots the maximum ice force reaches 0 85813 m n and the peak value of the ice force interval appears in pulse form the peak value shows random characteristics with the randomness of ice rubble the ice force in the x axis and z axis shown in fig 16 a and c show a similar trend with the total ice force in fig 16 d while the horizontal ice force in the y axis shown in fig 16 b shows asymmetry on both sides which is a result of the random arrangement of ice rubble the frequency maps of ice force obtained by numerical simulation and experiment are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively the overall trends of frequency in figs 17 and 18 are consistent but the frequency peak is offset we believe a reason for that lies in the difference resulting from the real ice and synthetic ice the magnitude of the horizontal ice force reaches the order of 10 5 n which shows a good agreement with the full scale result predicted result by guo et al 2016 5 2 influence of speed on ice load of ice breaking we examined the case of a channel covered with ice rubble with a concentration of 60 ice thickness of 0 5 m and an average size of ice rubble of 10 m 2 four computational conditions were established with speeds of 3 5 7 and 9 knots the resulting historical force time curve is shown in fig 19 fig 19 shows that as the speed increases so does the frequency of ice load the ice force at a speed of 9 knots is almost continuously in contact with the hull in addition when the speed increases the maximum ice load is increases fig 20 shows that the trend of maximum ice force of these four groups varies with the speed as the speed increases the time of interaction between the hull and the ice rubble is less and the kinetic energy of ice rubble is greater which is why the ice force increases with the speed the maximum ice force at 9 knots is 1 8 times that at a speed of 3 knots which differs from the result predicted by guo et al 2016 which was about 3 6 but showing good agreement with the work done by kim et al 2009 further increasing the speed will increase the ice force to a dangerous level so a reasonable speed should be guaranteed during ice breaking 5 3 influence of concentration on ice load of ice breaking in this case the container ship sails at a speed of 3 knots the channel is covered with ice rubble of average size 30 m 2 and the thickness of the ice is 0 5 m a comparative analysis was performed of the effect of different concentrations of ice rubble on ice load in a channel with concentration of 40 60 and 80 channels covered with different concentrations are shown in fig 21 the historical fore time curves are shown in fig 22 the concentration of ice rubble has a significant effect on the frequency of ice force and the maximun ice load the frequency of ice load shows an increase as the concentration of ice rubble rises the amplitude of ice force greater than 10 5 n with concentration of 80 60 and 40 is 31 22 and 13 times respectively this phenomenon occurs because the probability of collision between ship and ice decreases as the concentration decreases in these three cases the maximum ice forces are 473280 401510 and 305400 n respectively fig 23 shows that the tendency of the maximum ice force varies according to concentration and the maximum ice force sailing in a concentration of 80 is 1 55 times that in a concentration of 60 which agrees with the result of guo et al 2016 in a certain range 5 4 influence of average size of ice rubble on ice load of ice breaking in this case the container ship sails with a speed of 7 knots in a channel covered with ice rubble with a concentration of 80 and the thickness of the ice is 0 5 m we comparatively analyze the effect of average size of ice rubble on the ice load with values of 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 m 2 respectively the diagrams of different average sizes of ice rubble are shown in fig 24 the historical force time curves of sailing in different average sizes of ice rubble are shown in fig 25 the maximum ice force of sailing in different average sizes is shown in fig 26 fig 25 shows that as the average size of ice rubble rises the frequency of ice force decreases which can be intercepted as the amount of ice rubble growing as its average size drops fig 26 shows that with the concentration of ice rubble fixed the maximun ice force fluctuates in a certain range with different average sizes of ice rubble for example with a concentration of 80 the maximum ice force of different average sizes of ice rubble on the ship is between 51829 n and 85813 n with a mean value of 665740 n which shows good agreement with the result by guo et al 2016 6 conclusions peridynamics is first introduced to model ship ice contact and the ice rubble is modeled using a voronoi diagram algorithm ice load and the characteristics of the ice breaking process are successfully captured while sailing in a channel with different concentrations and average sizes of ice rubble although the gravity and buoyancy of ice are not given enough consideration from simulation results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the critical bond length s 0 c 0 003133 and s 0 b 0 000625 obtained by choosing as an empirical value which is modified along with a set of parameters to calibrate the experiment results of compression and bending respectively can describe the mechanical characteristics of ice 2 velocity shows a significant influence on the ice load with increases in speed the frequency of the ice load rose significantly and the maximum ice force at a speed of 9 knots was 1 8 times that with a speed of 3 knots for an ice thickness of 0 5 m 3 concentration shows considerable influence on the frequency and magnitude of the ice force the frequency of ice load shows an upward trend as the concentration of ice rubble rises so does the magnitude of ice load the maximum ice force sailing in concentration of 80 is 1 55 times that in a concentration of 60 for ice thickness of 0 5 m 4 the average size of ice rubble has a noticeable influence on the frequency of the ice load as the average size of ice rubble rises the frequency of the ice force becomes lower however with a fixed concentration of ice rubble the maximum ice force fluctuates in a certain range with different average sizes of ice rubble acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos 51579054

23697,fishing is one of the most risky occupations worldwide many accidents are due to stability failures and dynamic stability phenomena in waves are among the possible causes due to time cost and regulatory lacks these phenomena are not addressed during design of fishing vessels high fidelity six degrees of freedom 6 dof codes can cope with these phenomena but their complexity cost and time of application limit their use to high end vessels the use of less demanding approaches appears more suited for the fishing sector the scope of this paper is to compare a 6 dof blended code 1 dof nonlinear roll models and simplified analytical formulae in order to assess the level of dispersion of the obtained roll motion predictions among tools with different levels of complexity the roll response for a medium sized stern trawler is investigated in regular beam and longitudinal waves at zero speed results from the simplified models are in fair agreement with those from the 6 dof code at least for moderate wave steepnesses simplified models could provide a valuable tool for the assessment of fishing vessels behaviour at the early design stage considering also their ease of implementation within typical existing naval architecture software keywords fishing vessels stability parametric roll dead ship condition safety 1 introduction fishing sector is the one within the maritime industry with the largest fleet worldwide the total number of engine powered fishing vessels is over 2 900 000 according to the latest fao statistics fao 2016a 80 of these units are from asian countries 7 from latin american countries 6 from african ones 3 of this fleet belongs to europe another 3 to the u s and finally 1 to oceania one characteristic of the fishing fleet is its vast heterogeneity different regulatory frameworks distance to the fishing ground caught species regional tradition or even meteorological characteristics of their area of operation lead to many different designs which make it difficult to categorize fishing vessels into a limited set of typologies however a classification according to the ship length is usually done based on the applicability limits of the different imo and fao instruments on the one hand there are vessels of 24 m in length and over which should be under the regulatory framework of the torremolinos protocol imo 1993 the cape town agreement imo 2012 the part b of the code of safety for fishermen and fishing vessels fao ilo imo 2005a and the 2008 intact stability code imo 2008a on the other hand there are medium sized fishing vessels with lengths between 12 m and over and up to 24 m to which the voluntary guidelines for the design construction and equipment of small fishing vessels fao ilo imo 2005b are of application and finally there are small vessels of under 12 m length which are within the scope of the safety recommendations for decked fishing vessels of less than 12 m in length and undecked fishing vessels fao ilo imo 2012 in addition it has to be said that none of the previous international regulations regarding fishing vessel safety are nowadays of mandatory application these vessels are only required to fulfil regional regulations or agreements which are in fact quite variable depending on the flag state of the ship according to this categorization latest data fao 2016a show that most of the worldwide fleet 85 of the vessels belongs to the under 12 m group while 13 belongs to the group with length between 12 and 24 m and only 2 of the fleet has a length of 24 m and over this distribution fits quite well the distribution of the regional fleets such as for example the e u one e u 2016 regarding the economic importance of the sector it employs more than 37 million direct workers worldwide not including aquaculture or processing industries from these 29 million are from southeast asian countries more than 280 000 are from the u s and 150 000 are from the e u fishing influence is especially relevant in the less developed countries where primary sectors have a prevalent role globally fish trade activities have grown in the last years with exports rising from 72 billion dollars in 2004 to 148 billion dollars in 2014 and imports rising from 76 billion dollars in 2004 to 140 billion dollars in 2014 china is the top exporter 13 while the u s is the top importer 14 if the case of the e u is used as an example of the situation of fishing in the more developed countries it could be seen that although fishing does not have a great impact on the economics of a whole country it can have a big impact in some regions where the local economy can be really fishing dependent while the gross value added gva of fishing and aquaculture to the total gross domestic product gdp of the e u is a 0 1 and in spain this relationship is a 0 2 in galicia one of this high dependant areas in spain this value rises up to a 1 3 regarding employment more than 25 of all the workers within fishing of the e u are from just certain high dependant regions of spain greece portugal and italy if the case of galicia is again mentioned it accounts for 7 5 of the e u workers 5 2 of the ships 8 8 of the gt s and 14 5 of the value of the total e u catches e u 2016 fao 2016a 2016b meixide vecino 2015 despite these facts safety is still one of the biggest problems affecting fishing sector and fishing is still considered as one of the most dangerous industrial sectors not only in the developing economies but also in the fully developed ones fao estimates in more than 24 000 the number of casualties per year which directly affect fishing worldwide gudmundsson 2013 in the case of countries like the usa bls 2014 uk roberts 2010 or spain mess 2014 although this number is sensibly lower fishing is placed among the activities with largest fatal incident rates in jensen et al 2014 a review of figures and trends of fatal accident incidence rates for different european countries norway denmark iceland uk and poland usa and canada can be found showing the aforementioned high casualty rates if data from jensen et al 2014 and those from other sources ciaim 2014 lincoln 2010 maib 2016 are analysed it can be appreciated that a large percentage of the casualties occur in the small medium range of the fleet vessels under 24 m length and that many of them are due to stability failures capsizing or bad weather large wave struck these accidents usually lead to the complete loss of the vessel in a sudden and fast way making it very difficult for the crew to save themselves mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2014 this high percentage of stability related accidents in the small segment of the fleet could be explained by different reasons one reason is to be associated with the human factor crews of medium small fishing vessels lack the training that those of larger vessels have due to this fact they are not usually able to determine the risk level of their ship in a given operational situation or to understand the typically few stability information they have onboard womack 2001 as a result the crew on fishing vessels often base their judgement criteria just on their subjective experience this lack of awareness together with some occasional factors such as not ensuring the vessel weather tightness or the overloading of the vessel is a major cause of these types of accidents míguez gonzález et al 2012 spitzer 1999 wolfson unit 2004 an additional aspect is the regulatory framework as it has been already mentioned the international mandatory regulations applicable to vessels of over 24 m length torremolinos protocol and cape town agreement have not entered into force yet and with the exception of those countries which have ratified any of them only regional regulations are of application in the case of vessels under 24 m no international requirements are mandatory and again flag states are responsible of establishing the regulatory framework francescutto 2013 gudmundsson 2013 in some cases especially in the under 24 m range these regional requirements do not reach the same safety levels as those of the imo instruments gudmundsson 2013 kaplan and kite powell 2000 spitzer 1999 wolfson unit 2004 a further factor affecting the low safety score of fishing vessels are the environmental conditions fishermen are usually forced to sail in very harsh weather conditions as their incomes are fully dependant on catches taking into account that with the notable exception of the icelandic approach viggosson 2009 there is no regulation which determines which weather conditions a given fishing vessel is allowed to sail in as a function of her size or stability levels crews of smaller vessels usually face relatively worse conditions than those of the larger vessels spitzer 1999 compared to larger vessels small and medium sized fishing vessels sail in relatively more severe weather conditions which can induce large amplitude motions and other dynamic effects particularly roll in fact roll motion can significantly contribute in deteriorating the operability of the vessel mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2014 tello et al 2011 and is among all ship degrees of freedom the one which can mostly compromise its safety moreover in addition to stability failures associated to static quasi static effects e g mantari et al 2011 nonlinear dynamic roll instabilities are known to be among the causes of accidents involving fishing vessels mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2013 the evaluation of merchant and naval vessel vulnerability to the aforementioned instabilities has traditionally been done by using experimental tests complex mathematical tools or both of these alternatives which turned out to be a quite expensive and long process in the case of fishing vessels especially the smaller ones their design process is usually very limited not only in cost but also in time this is partially associated with the fact that profit margins of this activity are very low an average of a 6 from 2010 to 2013 in the e u 2016 and long design and construction periods limit the vessel profitability in case of eu countries in addition the need to shorten the design and construction time is due to the fact that current regulations require the decommissioning of one vessel in order to build another one with the same tonnage mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2013 these limitations in cost and time have made it very rare to have dynamic stability analysis carried out within design stages in the case of fishing vessels at the same time however the need for taking into account dynamic stability phenomena in waves has been already acknowledged by researchers and regulators and different published recommendations to skippers try to provide some information about how to avoid or at least reduce the inception of such phenomena dfohs 2014 gudmundsson 2009 imo 2008a wolfson unit 2004 womack and johnson 2003 in order to take into account these phenomena within the imo intact stability regulatory framework the imo second generation intact stability criteria sgisc are under development sdc 2 wp 4 2015 sdc 3 wp 5 2016 sdc 4 5 1 2016 sdc 4 inf 4 2016 sdc 4 wp 4 2017 the sgisc framework considers five different possible failure modes parametric roll resonance dead ship condition pure loss of stability surf riding broaching and excessive accelerations francescutto 2016 however such new criteria are not planned to be applied to fishing vessels hence the development of sgisc is not considering fishing vessels in the tuning of standards still the operational scheme of fishing vessels makes them potentially vulnerable to some of these phenomena typically while reeling in these vessels could spend a long time sailing at very low speeds even at zero speed in head trawlers and purse seiners or beam seas longliners and purse seiners this reduced speed condition also takes place during the periods when catches are processed after the recovery of the fishing gear and nets in addition they could also sail at slow speeds in low manoeuvrability situations and with a catch dependant heading letting out purse seiners letting out or trawling trawlers or at moderate speeds with some more steering capabilities as is the case of letting out longliners this operational profile makes fishing vessels prone to experiencing parametric roll resonance in head seas or pure roll resonance in beam seas equivalent to the dead ship condition considered in the sgisc on a normal sailing at cruise speed and as a consequence of the relatively small absolute dimensions fishing vessels could also experience pure loss of stability and surf riding broaching mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2014 míguez gonzález et al 2015 perez rojas et al 2006 the operational requirements which in some conditions reduce the possibility of modifying the speed or heading make the potential vulnerability of fishing vessels to dynamic stability phenomena in waves even higher however it is also worth highlighting that in some of these situations especially in the trawling condition the effect of fishing nets on ship motions could be remarkable nowadays a variety of mathematical models exist for the prediction of the aforementioned dynamic stability phenomena which can be considered to be potentially applicable at design stage these go from the more complex and accurate nonlinear time domain 6 degrees of freedom 6 dof blended models to the simplest nonlinear time domain 1 degree of freedom 1 dof ones blended or hybrid simulation models use different assumptions and approximations in order to arrive at practical simulation tools for nonlinear ship motions in waves which balance accuracy and computational time the scope of the approximations introduced in these tools is basically to embed the major forcing terms which drive nonlinear ship motions in waves without exactly solving the fluid structure interaction problem in time domain a number of examples of such tools can be found in literature as mentioned also by peters et al 2012 examples are fredyn de kat and paulling 1989 mctaggart and de kat 2000 laidyn matusiak 2007 lamp liut et al 2002 shin et al 2003 spyrou et al 2009 nmriw ogawa 2009 shixdof bulian and francescutto 2013 tempest belknap and reed 2010 and the tools developed by ayaz et al 2006 greco and lugni 2012 2013 grochowalski et al 1998 and liu and papanikolaou 2016 among others blended tools were also discussed by beck and reed 2001 and more recently in the review by bačkalov et al 2016 in the case of parametric roll resonance it is also well worth mentioning also 3 dof models which include the dynamic coupling effects of pitch and heave on roll motion which are of paramount importance for the correct evaluation of the phenomenon munif and umeda 2006 taguchi et al 2011 an example of this alternative was presented by neves and rodríguez 2006 which has been applied to the evaluation of the behaviour of parametric roll in regular longitudinal waves for the case of fishing vessels neves and rodríguez 2009 and other cargo ships rodríguez et al 2007 however although 3 dof models are far simpler than 6 dof ones they are still much more complex than the 1 dof alternatives as the number of parameters required for their setting up is much larger and which include added mass damping and excitation terms for heave pitch and roll motions together with coupling among them as a result from the above 6 dof can be considered to represent the state of the art regarding nonlinear ship motion simulation with a view to application in ship design while 1 dof alternatives are characterised by a more tailored applicability to specific phenomena and an expected reduced accuracy compared to more complex models 3 dof models are herein considered to be as a too complex option for vulnerability assessment at design stage of fishing vessels an extensive review in this respect has recently been given by bačkalov et al 2016 where a detailed analysis of most of the available alternatives can be found in some cases 1 dof models can also be further simplified by developing specific analytical formulae which might partially avoid the necessity of going through time domain simulations it is also worth noting that this mentioned range of modelling correspond to that embedded within the sgisc framework at different assessment levels from the above discussion considering the fast cheap requirements implicit within the fishing vessel design sector it is evident that 1 dof or even simpler roll models likely represent the most practically feasible option for the assessment of possible vulnerability of a fishing vessel to potentially dangerous dynamic stability phenomena in waves proposals in this respect were already put forward in the past by e g bulian and francescutto 2006 it is however known that reduced dof models have limitations induced by their inherent simplifications in this context it is therefore important to investigate how the predictions from simplified models compare with those from higher fidelity tools in order to verify whether the two approaches provide vulnerability indications which are sufficiently in line for an application of simplified models as a design tool this is in fact the problem addressed by the paper i e a comparative investigation among models with different levels of complexity in the past conceptually similar investigations were carried out by munif and umeda 2006 who compared a 1 dof model for parametric roll with a 6 dof model with linearized heave and pitch for an icelandic trawler in a small set of longitudinal regular waves at zero speed and by somayajula and falzarano 2017 who compared the results from a 6 dof tool with those obtained by different simplified 1 dof models for the case of parametric rolling in irregular waves for a c11 containership also bulian et al 2012 compared predictions from simplified 1 dof nonlinear roll models with those obtained from the same 6 dof tool used herein for a series 60 hull form but for the case of bi chromatic beam waves at zero speed this paper focuses on fishing vessels and addresses parametric roll 2 1 subharmonic resonance in longitudinal regular waves and 1 1 roll resonance in beam regular sea waves at zero speed considering a wide range of wave conditions results from a high fidelity 6 dof blended model bulian and francescutto 2013 bulian et al 2012 2015 2016 cercos pita et al 2016 moro et al 2015 which has the main characteristics for application at the envisioned direct stability assessment level of imo second generation intact stability criteria slf 52 wp 1 annex 2 2010 annex 1 in sdc 4 wp 4 2017 are compared with outcomes from simpler 1 dof nonlinear roll models for the two considered conditions bulian 2006 bulian and francescutto 2006 bulian et al 2012 predictions based on simplified approximate prediction formulae derived from the proposed 1 dof roll models are also considered for the analysis a mid sized stern trawler which could be considered to be representative of the spanish fishing fleet has been selected it is recognised that in principle the effect of nets should also be taken into account for the prediction of actual fishing vessel behaviour at sea however herein the focus is on the relative comparison between the different types of dynamical models in nominal regular waves as a result the inclusion of effects of nets on ship motions has not been considered it is also underlined that including such effects is associated with a significant complexity with clear difficulties in the introduction of such effects particularly in the 1 dof models the paper is structured as follows first the mathematical models used in the comparative study are presented together with the simplified approximate formulae derived from the 1 dof models next the numerical experiments that have been carried out are described this section provides a description of the characteristics of the considered fishing vessel the description of the tests and the analysis of the obtained results roll motion amplitude is reported for different regular wave steepnesses and frequencies in head and beam seas and zero speed using the different considered approaches finally some conclusions regarding the possible applicability of the considered simplified models at the vessel design stage are reported 2 description of mathematical models 2 1 1 dof models 1 dof nonlinear models used in this study for the analysis of roll behaviour in case of 1 1 resonance in regular beam waves and in case of 2 1 parametric roll resonance in longitudinal regular waves are typical 1 dof models employed in the field of nonlinear roll motion dynamics see e g belenky and sevastianov 2007 or bačkalov et al 2016 and references therein each model however will be studied in two variants as described in details in the following sections moreover for each model a simplified analytical formulation for the determination of an approximate maximum roll response will also be provided in this respect considering the target of the study the simplified formulae will be considered at the maximum possible level of simplification in the present work two different alternatives for the simple 1 dof model have been studied in both the head and beam sea cases in the head seas case a nonlinear model of roll motion based on the look up table approach for obtaining the gz in waves has been selected considering the vessel both as free to trim in waves in the computations of gz or with a fixed constant trim in the case of beam waves two options have been applied for implementing the wave excitation within the model the absolute angle model which considers wave moments as an external excitation term which is separate from the restoring term and the relative angle model where wave excitation is included within the nonlinear restoring term it is underlined that both models considered herein describe the dynamics of the absolute roll angle and the wordings absolute and relative are meant to identify the type of approach which is used for the modelling of the moment exerted on the inclined vessel in presence of waves 2 1 1 beam waves in this work two different 1 dof models are considered for analysing the roll motion response in regular beam waves in both cases the inherent nonlinearities of large amplitude roll motion are taken into account through nonlinear restoring and nonlinear damping terms the first model is the most frequently used 1 dof nonlinear roll model for describing the absolute roll angle ϕ in the beam sea condition bulian and francescutto 2006 francescutto and contento 1999 spyrou et al 2002 wu and mccue 2008 among others and see also references in bačkalov et al 2016 1 ϕ 2 ν ω 0 ϕ β ϕ ϕ δ ϕ 3 ω 0 2 g z ϕ g m t ω 0 2 α e f f t in this model the righting lever curve in still water as a function of the absolute roll angle g z ϕ is considered in the nonlinear restoring term and roll damping comprises linear and nonlinear terms coefficients ν β and δ the calm water metacentric height is indicated as g m t while ω 0 is the roll natural frequency it is noted that the wave excitation term appears on the right hand side of the equation as a separate term with respect to the restoring which appears on the left hand side in the excitation term the wave moment is implemented using the effective wave slope α e f f approach as follows 2 α e f f t π r s w cos ω e t ψ where s w is the wave steepness ω e is the encounter wave frequency ψ is a generic phase and r is the effective wave slope coefficient in case drifting is not explicitly accounted for the encounter wave frequency corresponds to the physical wave frequency moreover the phase ψ can be taken as zero considering an appropriate translation of the origin of time the effective wave slope coefficient is assumed to depend on the ship geometry and on considered wave it is worth underlining that modelling of the type in 1 2 has been accepted by the imo in the framework of the alternative assessment of weather criterion on an experimental basis through msc 1 circ 1200 francescutto et al 2004 imo 2006 in particular msc 1 circ 1200 allows using a parameter identification technique pit based on a modelling of the type 1 2 where the model parameters are determined from model scale experiments in beam waves and the 1 dof model is then used to predict roll motion in the required conditions for the weather criterion the absolute angle model however has been shown to present some consistency issues bulian and francescutto 2009 2011 and a thinking to the actual physics of the fluid structure interaction would suggest that a model accounting for a corrected relative angle between the ship and the wave could be more appropriate as second model therefore the partially relative angle approach from bulian and francescutto 2009 2011 is applied where the wave excitation is included within the restoring term this alternative which can be referred to as effective relative angle approach still describes the dynamics of the absolute roll angle ϕ as the previous absolute angle approach however in contrast to the previous model it tries to take into account the effect of relative angle between the ship and the wave for the computation of fluid structure interaction moment more precisely this alternative tries to take into account the fact that differently from the linear case in a nonlinear framework it is not possible to separate the restoring from the wave excitation since these two effects are both included in the moment exerted on the vessel due to the total pressure on the hull this second 1 dof alternative for the beam sea condition takes the following form 3 ϕ 2 ν ω 0 ϕ β ϕ ϕ δ ϕ 3 ω 0 2 g z ϕ α e f f t g m t 0 it can be noted that as anticipated the equation still describes the dynamics of the absolute roll angle ϕ however now the instantaneous effective wave slope α e f f t is embedded in the calm water restoring using the idea of the effective relative angle ϕ α e f f it is noted that when the roll restoring is linear i e g z ξ g m t ξ or when the angle for the calculation of the restoring is small enough i e g z ξ g m t ξ then the two models 1 and 3 reduce to the same model historically the idea of describing roll motion dynamics using a reasoning based on the concept of relative angle can be dated back to froude 1861 who used a long wave approximation i e r 1 and a linear restoring however in the literature it is possible to find different approaches based on the relative angle modelling for instance wellicome 1975 and wright and marshfield 1980 used an approach where all terms in the dynamic equation added inertia damping restoring combined with forcing are based on the relative angle ϕ α and appropriate corresponding derivatives neglecting the effective wave slope coefficient under the assumption of long waves and they considered nonlinear damping and nonlinear restoring instead tamiya 1975 for instance used a mathematical model where the added inertia and the damping terms are based respectively on the first and on the second derivative of the absolute roll angle the restoring and excitation are combined using a corrected restoring lever of the type r g z ϕ α i e using the nominal relative angle between the ship and the wave ϕ α and using the effective wave slope as a global corrective multiplicative factor moreover eventually also tamiya 1975 used the long wave approximation assuming r 1 these mentioned models differ from 3 since in the model presented herein the added inertia and the damping term are based on the absolute roll angle like tamiya 1975 but the restoring plus forcing term g z ϕ r α is based on an effective relative angle where the effective wave slope is used as a correction factor only for the wave slope specific discussions regarding the use of absolute versus relative angle for the modelling of roll motion have been provided by belenky and sevastianov 2007 and by bulian and francescutto 2011 the frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient r which is included in the forcing term in both models can be predicted by using different methodologies one approach for its computation is based on a decoupling of the linear hydrodynamics seakeeping equations bulian and francescutto 2009 2011 naciri and lledo 2001 a second simpler approach which does not require the hydrodynamic solution of the fluid structure interaction problem is based on the determination of r by direct computation of roll moment induced by the froude krylov forces with respect to the vessel centre of gravity e g umeda and tsukamoto 2008 finally two simplified semi empirical methods exist as proposed by blume 1979 and as available in the imo weather criterion imo 2008a in these two latter cases however the effective wave slope is provided only for a value of wave frequency corresponding to the vessel natural roll frequency in this work although some comparisons will be provided considering the four mentioned alternatives only the first approach has been selected for the time domain calculations and comparisons with results from the 6 dof model for both models 1 and 3 an approximate solution for the maximum roll amplitude can be obtained by means of a straightforward simplified analytical approach if nonlinearities in damping are retained but those in restoring are neglected in this case the maximum expected roll amplitude for a given wave of steepness s w and a given effective wave slope coefficient r can be obtained by solving the following equation for the roll amplitude a r o l l 4 a r o l l π r s w 2 ν e a r o l l where ν e a r o l l is the dimensionless linear equivalent roll damping coefficient at the roll natural frequency and it can be calculated as himeno 1981 ikeda et al 1978 5 ν e a r o l l ν 4 3 π β a r o l l 3 8 δ ω 0 a r o l l 2 the combination of 4 and 5 leads to a polynomial equation for a r o l l which in general can be solved through simple numerical methods it is also worth mentioning that the formula for the roll amplitude in the present weather criterion imo 2008a basically corresponds to what is obtained from 4 and 5 when only a pure quadratic damping is considered however the formula in the weather criterion also contains a semi empirical 30 reduction in roll amplitude with respect to that which would be observed in regular beam waves see imo 2006 2008b for the considered fishing vessel results from the two mentioned 1 dof models as well as results from the simplified approach 4 5 will be compared with outcomes from the 6 dof model which will be described later 2 1 2 longitudinal waves the 1 dof model considered herein for the analysis of parametrically excited roll motion response in regular longitudinal waves is what can be considered to be the most commonly used simplified model similarly to the beam sea case inherent nonlinearities of large amplitude roll motion which are of paramount importance to accurately compute the rolling amplitude are taken into account through nonlinear restoring and nonlinear damping terms in this case nonlinear roll restoring is calculated as a function of both the heeling angle and of the wave crest position in time along the hull the used 1 dof non linear roll model takes the following form 6 ϕ 2 ν ω 0 ϕ β ϕ ϕ δ ϕ 3 ω 0 2 g z ϕ t g m t 0 where as in 4 ν β and δ are linear and nonlinear damping coefficients ω 0 is the natural roll frequency of the ship g m t is the still water metacentric height but now g z ϕ t is the time varying nonlinear heeling lever as a function of roll angle and time and it depends on the wave length and steepness considered in the simulation regarding damping it is here underlined that the linear term is dominant at small rolling amplitudes and it governs together with the variation of the linear term of g z ϕ t i e g m t t the parametric roll inception boundary on the other hand nonlinearities of damping and restoring affect large amplitude motions the 1 dof model in 6 has been used in the past for different types of vessels see e g references in bačkalov et al 2016 including also fishing vessels bulian and francescutto 2006 munif and umeda 2006 moreover this type of model has been also adopted in class rules as a sufficient tool for addressing the vessel vulnerability to parametric roll abs 2004 and it has been used in the development of parametric roll vulnerability criteria in imo sgisc in particular at level 2 check 2 vulnerability assessment sdc 3 wp 5 2016 tompuri et al 2014 the time wave and roll angle dependent restoring term the g z ϕ t is computed by using a standard hydrostatic software under the quasi static assumption to this end two different approaches have been considered one where the vessel is free to trim and sink as a function of the wave crest position and heel fixed trim approach and another alternative where the vessel trim is fixed while letting the sinkage free free trim approach this model considers that the equilibrium of the vessel is obtained in a quasi static way although this approach misses the dynamic effects of heave and pitch it has shown to provide reasonably accurate results in various cases bulian 2006 similarly to the case of 1 1 resonance in beam regular waves also in case of 2 1 subharmonic resonance in longitudinal regular waves a simplified expression for the maximum amplitude of parametrically excited roll motion a r o l l can be obtained if the restoring is approximated to be linear and if only nonlinearities in damping are retained to this end first the amplitude of parametric excitation is defined as 7 h 0 δ g m t g m t f 1 λ w s w 2 g m t where λ w and s w are respectively the length and steepness of the considered wave δ g m t is the variation of vertical position of metacentre for the considered wave and f 1 is the coefficient playing the role of an approximate transfer function of g m t variation in waves similar to that proposed by dunwoody 1989 then if the condition of frequency of encounter equal twice the natural roll frequency is fulfilled for the considered wave the maximum amplitude of parametrically excited roll motion a r o l l can be obtained by solving the following equation 8 h 0 4 ν e a r o l l where ν e a r o l l is the dimensionless linear equivalent roll damping coefficient in 5 also in this case the combination of 8 and 5 leads to a polynomial equation for a r o l l which in general can be solved through simple numerical methods equation 8 can be obtained as a simplification of the more general approximate expressions in bulian 2004 moreover the same type of simplified expression has been considered in the development of level 1 vulnerability assessment criteria for parametric roll in sgisc sdc 4 5 1 2016 it shall be noted however that the approximation 8 does not account for the effect of nonlinear restoring which in case of parametrically excited roll motion can be significant formulations involving nonlinear restoring at different levels of approximations and depending on cases with or without nonlinear damping can be found in bulian 2004 ittc 2006 and sdc 4 5 1 2016 2 2 6 dof blended code direct nonlinear analysis of fluid structure interaction through cfd codes with moving overlapping meshes presently represents the most advanced approach for simulation of ship motions in waves e g sadat hosseini et al 2010 however as outlined by bačkalov et al 2016 such tools are still too time consuming for a systematic application such as that which is required in the framework of ship design where a large number of different scenarios need to be investigated as a result in the framework of nonlinear ship motions simulations the state of the art are the so called hybrid or blended 6 dof models which are considered to represent reference high fidelity tools the aim of these tools is the simulation of nonlinear motions of a vessel possibly manoeuvring and self propelled in waves taking into account the main sources of nonlinearities which could cause dangerous dynamic stability phenomena in waves the model underlying such simulation codes typically blends linear hydrodynamics nonlinear froude krylov effects semi empirical models for manoeuvring additional roll damping dissipation terms semi empirical models for wind loads etc hybrid models have been considered to represent a potentially viable tool for the so called direct stability assessment level and for the development of ship specific operational guidance in the framework of imo second generation intact stability criteria slf 52 wp 1 annex 2 2010 annex 1 in sdc 4 wp 4 2017 as anticipated also in the introduction of the paper due to the partial semi empiricism which is inherent in hybrid models different implementation variants are available in

matusiak 2007 mctaggart and de kat 2000 ogawa 2009 shin et al 2003 spyrou et al 2009 recent developments in this respect are reported by bačkalov et al 2016 the 6 dof model used herein is shixdof bulian and francescutto 2013 bulian et al 2012 2015 2016 cercos pita et al 2016 moro et al 2015 shixdof integrates the 6 dof nonlinear rigid body equations of motions projected as usual to the ship

primes indicate time derivatives carried out in the ship fixed reference system the first two equations are the equations of 6 dof nonlinear rigid body dynamics projected in the ship fixed reference system and therefore all involved vectors are considered to be represented in such reference system the ship fixed reference system is right handed and it has the x axis longitudinal directed from stern to bow the y axis transversal directed from starboard to port side and the z axis vertical directed upwards from bottom to top m is the mass of the ship the vector u o u v w t is the speed vector of the chosen centre o of the ship fixed reference system for the simulations ω p q r t is the rigid body angular velocity x g x g y g z g t is the position vector of the centre of gravity g i

o vector m e x t o t m e x t o x t m e x t o y t m e x t o z t t such external actions comprise the fluid structure interaction the possible effect of wind propellers restrain systems etc as usual the first two equations representing rigid body dynamics are supplemented by the third and fourth equations in order to properly position and orient the vessel in the earth fixed reference system at each time instant the third equation which allows translating the vessel in the earth fixed reference system represents the relation between the speed u o expressed in components with respect to the ship fixed reference system and the time derivative of the position vector ξ o ξ o η o ζ o t of the point o expressed in the earth fixed reference system the matrix r s σ which depends on the euler angles of roll ϕ pitch ϑ and yaw ψ is the transformation matrix from the ship fixed to the earth fixed reference system finally the fourth equation links the angular velocity ω expressed in components with respect to the ship fixed reference system to the time derivative of the vector of euler angles ε ϕ ϑ ψ t and it allows to properly orient the vessel in the earth fixed reference system the convention used for the order of the euler angles is the classical one used in naval architecture namely first yaw then pitch and finally roll with specific reference to the target of the present study a description is given in the following of the modelling for the most relevant actions froude krylov force and moment are determined by direct pressure integration on the instantaneous wetted hull based on the undisturbed wave profile s h t i e 10 f f k t s h t p t x t n x d s m f k o t s h t x p t x t n x d s where p t x t is the total instantaneous undisturbed wave pressure comprising also the hydrostatic term and n x is the local outward normal vector the total pressure is based on airy linear theory however in order to guarantee zero pressure at the free surface a stretching technique is applied to the linear field matusiak 2010 wheeler 1969 the integration is numerically carried out using a discretisation of the hull in triangular panels forces associated to the linear hydrodynamic modelling are split into two parts namely radiation and diffraction scattering radiation forces are determined instantaneously by means of convolution integrals using memory functions cummins 1962 derived from linear hydrodynamic pre calculations and herein the implementation is as follows 11 f r a d t m r a d o t a o h 0 t k o t τ h τ d τ k o τ 2 π 0 b o ω cos ω τ d ω h u o ω in 11 a o and b o ω are respectively the 6 6 matrices of infinite frequency added masses and frequency dependent damping both with respect to the point o while k o τ is the 6 6 matrix of memory functions depending on the time lag τ also the diffraction scattering force f d i f t and moment m d i f o t with respect to o are based on linear hydrodynamic frequency domain pre computations and they are determined at each time instant of the simulation by making direct use of the force moment transfer functions in particular at each time instant the heading of the vessel with respect to the wave and the relative position of the vessel point o with respect to the wave crest are determined from these two variables the instantaneous diffraction force and moment with respect to the point o are obtained using the amplitude and phase information from the available pre computed database of diffraction forces hydrodynamic coefficients a o and b o ω as well as transfer functions of diffraction forces are calculated for zero speed drag effects are modelled by means of a cross flow approach based on the local relative lateral speed between the vessel accounting for nonlinear rigid body motions and the undisturbed wave particles velocity field with stretching examples of approaches for modelling cross flow with specific attention to large amplitude ship motions in waves have been described in the past by de kat and paulling 1989 grochowalski et al 1998 and hughes et al 2011 in the present tool the force and moment due to cross flow effects are obtained at each time instant by integration of local contributions on the instantaneous portion of the ship centreplane which is below water considering the undisturbed wave profile s c p t 12 f d r a g t s c p t 1 2 ρ w a t e r c d x u r e l w y

the local component along the ship fixed y axis of the relative velocity of water with respect to the vessel and y ˆ is the versor of the y axis the local relative speed accounts for the effect of the wave velocity field when c d x on the ship centreplane does not depend on the vertical ship fixed coordinate the model reduces to a sectional cross flow model for the numerical determination of drag force and moment the centreplane of the vessel is discretised into small panels and for each panel the local contribution to the drag force and moment are determined and eventually summed up semi empirical nonlinear roll damping contributions can also be added and actually in general they need to be added in order to tune the model with respect to roll dissipation while in principle any general functional form can be used the following one is typically applied for tuning purposes 13 m a d d d a m p o t b 44 l a d d o p b 44 q a d d o p p b 44 c a d d o p 3 x ˆ in 13 x ˆ is the versor

less relevant for the cases addressed in this study are also present in the modelling as described by bulian and francescutto 2013 and bulian et al 2012 2016 3 numerical experiments numerical experiments have been carried out on a sample vessel in the two considered conditions beam and longitudinal regular waves at zero speed in longitudinal waves the head sea condition has been considered the mentioned models have been used and compared with the intention of analysing the level of agreement between predictions from the 6 dof modelling and from the 1 dof modelling 3 1 sample ship the selected ship is a spanish medium sized stern trawler sailing in the great sole bank area in southern ireland it is a two decked vessel with a stern ramp for letting out and reeling in the nets the spanish medium sized trawling fleet is composed of vessels sailing both in spanish atlantic grounds and in e u grounds in irish and u k waters great sole bank area in both cases vessels are similar in size and arrangement being the latter slightly larger vessels according to the latest 2016 spanish fishing fleet statistics published by the spanish ministry of agriculture and fishing mapama 2017 the spanish trawling coastal fleet sailing in atlantic waters is composed of 80 vessels with an average overall length of 28 29 m and an overage gross tonnage of 227 3 gt in the case of the spanish trawling fleet operating in e u grounds great sole bank there are 55 vessels with an average overall length of 32 68 m and an overage gross tonnage of 295 8 gt considering that the vessel selected in this work has an overall length of 34 50 m and a gross tonnage of 332 gt and although it is on the upper range of overall length and gross tonnage values it could be said that it adequately represents the spanish mid sized trawling fleet the typical operation of these vessels include cruising to and from the fishing area and letting out the nets trawling and reeling in at slow speeds no more than 3 to 4 knots headings usually only depend on maximising the amount of possible catches trying to limit weathervaning only to very severe weather conditions this fact makes these vessels potentially prone to experience 2 1 parametric roll resonance in head seas and large roll motions due to 1 1 resonance in beam seas at near zero speeds due to the limited possibility of corrective actions in order to set up the mesh needed for the 6 dof model a 3d model of the vessel was prepared for the sake of better resemblance to the real vessel the rudder and the different superstructures were also included in the geometrical model the vessel bodyplan together with a view of the 3d model are presented in fig 1 the main characteristics of the vessel and the studied loading condition are presented in table 1 the draught under analysis is obtained as a mean of the operational draught range of the vessel while metacentric height was set to the minimum required value 350 mm according to imo 1993 2008a fig 2 shows the still water righting lever curve for the loading condition under analysis computed under the free to trim assumption and taking into account the superstructures shown in fig 1 in addition in fig 2 the euler pitch angle corresponding to each heeling angle is also included in order to set up the nonlinear damping model data from zero speed roll decay tests of a similar vessel have been used although in principle semi empirical methods could be considered for this purpose e g ikeda s method himeno 1981 ikeda et al 1978 kawahara et al 2009 results from realistic data seem to be more reliable than those obtained from these approximations at least for these type of vessels míguez gonzález et al 2015 the applied damping model is of the purely quadratic type and coefficients are reported in table 2 such damping coefficients correspond to a configuration of the vessel without bilge keels which is the configuration used in the present study these coefficients have been directly used in the 1 dof models however in the 6 dof model due to the presence of couplings among different degrees of freedom and due to the presence of multiple sub models a tuning process is necessary in order to fit the numerical roll decay to the target dissipation level to this end the drag coefficient c d x see 12 in the 6 dof cross flow model was assumed to have a uniform value of 0 8 on the centreplane afterwards the linear b 44 l a d d o and quadratic b 44 q a d d o roll damping coefficients of the additional roll damping moment see 13 were manually modified whereas the cubic damping coefficient b 44 c a d d o was not used in the tuning for each couple of tentative coefficients a roll decay was simulated and analysed to obtain the corresponding coefficients μ β and δ such coefficients were then used together with the natural roll frequency ω 0 to analytically calculate ν e a r o l l according to 5 and to compare it with the target value obtained from 5 using the damping coefficients in table 2 fig 3 shows a roll decay and the corresponding dimensionless linear equivalent roll damping coefficient ν e a r o l l compared to the target one after the tuning process as it can be appreciated the results from the tuned numerical roll decay well match the target values regarding the computation of the effective wave slope coefficient to be used in the beam seas 1 dof model four different alternatives have been applied as it has been previously mentioned these include a computation based on linear hydrodynamics bulian and francescutto 2009 2011 accounting for yaw coupling a calculation based on froude krylov roll moment with respect to the centre of gravity and the simplified semi empirical methods proposed by blume 1979 and by the imo weather criterion imo 2008a in fig 4 the results obtained from these four methodologies are presented the first two approaches naturally account for the frequency dependence of the effective wave slope which is therefore reported for the range ω w 0 r a d s to ω w 2 r a d s for the cases of the blume and the imo approaches the effective wave slope coefficient is computed only for the natural roll frequency of the vessel ω 0 0 563 r a d s however while the imo weather criterion method provides a single value the blume method also provides a range around the estimated value it can be noticed that while the effective wave slope coefficient as predicted by the blume method and by using the formulation from the imo weather criterion are close each other the two predictions are sensibly smaller than what can be obtained from the application of a linear hydrodynamic computation finally it is worth underlining that for the considered range of frequencies the froude krylov approach provides a conservative estimation of the effective wave slope coefficient compared to the other tested approaches 3 2 beam sea this section presents and compares roll motion results in regular beam seas as obtained from the considered models three values of wave steepness have been studied for a range of wave frequencies that includes the worst expected situations which will occur in the vicinity of the 1 1 ratio of wave to natural roll frequency in table 3 the tested conditions are presented in fig 5 the results of the expected maximum roll amplitude values obtained by applying the simplified analytical approach according to 4 and using the four different alternatives for the estimation of the effective wave slope coefficient are shown observing the results in fig 5 an estimation of the importance of the methodology chosen for the computation of the effective wave slope coefficient can be made as it can be appreciated the difference in the maximum roll amplitude predicted by the different approximations is quite small in absolute terms for the lowest wave steepness the divergence between the different alternatives starts becoming more noticeable for values of wave steepness over s w 1 50 however the difference is within only 1 6 deg at a steepness s w 1 30 and within only 1 9 deg even at a steepness s w 1 20 it can be also appreciated that roll amplitudes predicted by using the effective wave slope from the blume and imo weather criterion alternatives are almost coincident the same happens among the linear hydrodynamics and the froude krylov approaches this is in line with results reported in fig 4 since damping is the same in all cases fig 5 could therefore be considered to represent a sensitivity analysis of the expected outcome in terms of predicted roll amplitude by the simplified method taking into account the variability of effective wave slope coefficient depending on its prediction method in fig 6 the results of roll motion response are presented the maximum roll amplitude as a function of the frequency ratio obtained for the three different wave steepness with the 1 dof model both absolute and relative angle alternatives and the 6 dof model are reported while in the 1 dof models drifting effects are naturally not taken into account in the 6 dof simulations the vessel was restrained as it is common to do by soft springs and to avoid dynamic interference natural frequencies induced by the soft springs were checked to be well below the tested frequencies from the analysis of these response curves some comments can be made if the response curves corresponding to the minimum analysed wave steepness left figure s w 1 100 are observed it can be appreciated that the predicted amplitudes from the three alternatives are very close each other although those obtained with the 6 dof model are slightly larger than the others in terms of frequency ratio the three models reproduce the larger motions at the same frequency value slightly above ω w ω 0 1 0 with no appreciable response curve bending as the wave steepness is increased s w 1 50 roll motion consequently increases and the differences between the three models also become more noticeable as it can be seen in the central plot in fig 6 the results from the 6 dof model present a slightly higher and broader peak than those from the 1 dof model from the two 1 dof alternatives the absolute angle approach predicts the lowest amplitude while the relative angle approach is between the other two models regarding the shape of the response curve a bending to higher frequencies can be clearly observed in this test case which was not significant in the previous one however differences among the three different models both in amplitude and position of the peak are in the range of 10 and can be considered as relatively small in absolute terms finally in the right plot in fig 6 the results for the largest wave steepness s w 1 30 are presented as it can be appreciated the differences between the three models become much more noticeable now especially between the 6 dof model and the other two not only in the peak amplitude but also in its position and width the bending of the response curve is also larger in the case of the 6 dof the differences between the two alternatives of the 1 dof model although slightly larger than in the previous tests cases are still not very significant overall it is worth underlining that among the 1 dof models the relative angle one shows a tendency closer to the behaviour shown by the 6 dof model in fig 7 the maximum roll amplitudes as obtained from the response curves computed with each model as a function of wave steepness are shown in order to better highlight nonlinear effects the same figure also shows the maximum roll amplitude in radians normalised by the wave slope π s w this summary plot is useful in those cases where the maximum roll amplitude of the vessel is of interest for varying wave steepness and regardless of the frequency ratio at which it occurs like in the weather criterion in addition to the results from the time domain mathematical models results obtained from the analytical approach 4 using the effective wave slope coefficient calculated through linear hydrodynamics are also presented as it can be appreciated for the lowest steepness under consideration the predictions obtained by the three studied alternatives are very close each other moreover also the simplified analytical approximation provides very close results however as the wave steepness increases the difference between the three alternatives increases as well in accordance of course with results in fig 6 among the 1 dof models the one better matching 6 dof results is the relative angle one since the two 1 dof models share the same damping term the observed difference among them can therefore be directly linked with the differences in the restoring forcing terms in fact the 1 dof absolute angle model applies the nonlinear g z function in the restoring term only to the absolute roll angle ϕ keeping the wave forcing as an external sinusoidal forcing ω 0 2 α e f f t see 1 on the other hand in the relative angle model the nonlinear g z function is applied to the difference ϕ α e f f t see 3 if for the sake of explanation it is imagined that g z is described by a polynomial representation it can be immediately understood that the relative angle model implicitly introduces additional terms in the equation of motion compared to the absolute angle model these additional terms eventually influence the dynamics of the system and are the source of the observed differences belenky and sevastianov 2007 and bulian and francescutto 2011 presented in the past discussions following this line of reasoning from a general perspective results in figs 6 and 7 highlight that the 6 dof model tends to show systematically larger peak rolling amplitudes compared to the 1 dof models at all tested steepnesses with differences which increase as the wave steepness increases considering that the peak amplitude of the roll response is loosely speaking the result of the combination of a forcing action and a dissipation action the systematic effect observed from the simulations could be due to the fact that the overall level of dissipation in the 6 dof model during simulations in waves is smaller than the level of dissipation of the 1 dof models due to the fact that the overall forcing due to waves in the 6 dof simulation model is larger than the forcing in the 1 dof models or a combination of these two effects in addition looking at the fact that also the two 1 dof models which are characterised by the same damping term show different outcomes it could also be conjectured that part of the observed differences between the 6 dof model and the 1 dof model could come from the effect of nonlinear froude krylov forces looking at fig 7 it is also interesting to comment that the results from the 1 dof relative angle model are practically coincident with those obtained from the simplified analytical approach for the whole range of studied wave steepnesses this fact is very relevant if some of the proposed approaches are intended to be used during the early design stage of the considered type of vessels in fact whenever only an indication of the largest expected roll motion in regular beam waves is needed for a given design then the use of a simplified analytical approach such as the one used in this case could be almost equivalent to the use of a more complex alternative such as the 1 dof relative angle model on the other hand if the whole frequency response is of interest for a given design a more complex approach shall be used and the observed dispersion of results for the largest tested steepness indicate that caution should be exercised when predicting roll amplitudes for too severe approaches since prediction uncertainty could be non negligible 3 3 longitudinal sea in this section the results of roll motion obtained by using the considered different models in regular head waves are reported six different wave steepness values have been tested with frequency ratios ranging from ω w ω 0 1 5 to ω w ω 0 3 0 and corresponding wave to ship length ratio λ l p p between 0 745 and 2 980 table 4 presents an overview of the tested conditions as it is well known the phenomenon of parametric roll resonance is generated by the effect that wave passing has on the underwater hull geometry of the vessel and subsequently on her righting lever curves and initial stability the typical conditions in which parametric roll resonance is more severe is in wave frequency to natural roll frequency ratios of around ω w ω 0 2 0 and in wavelengths similar to the ship length λ w l p p these conditions are those in which wave passing is typically more effective in promoting the inception of parametric roll as a consequence of the combination of the frequency condition with a sufficiently large magnitude of the restoring variations the magnitude of the parametric roll phenomenon is directly related to the amplitude of the variation of the vessel roll restoring parameters also known as parametric excitation when these occur with the appropriate frequency fig 8 shows the variation of the vessel metacentric height gm t as a function of the longitudinal coordinate of the wave crest along the hull x c for different wave steepness and a wave length λ w l p p in this figure x app represents the longitudinal coordinate of the aft perpendicular of the vessel and l pp is the ship length between perpendiculars fig 9 provides the same information for a wave corresponding to a frequency ratio of ω w ω 0 2 0 the presented data have been obtained applying the two methodologies which have been implemented for the determination of the righting lever in the 1 dof model free trim and fixed trim calculations in case of a wavelength equal to the vessel length fig 8 the maximum metacentric height values coincide with wave crest placed in the vessel perpendiculars i e through amidships while minima occur while wave crest is near amidships in addition the expected relationship between the amplitude of gm t variation and wave steepness can be observed with an increase of the parametric excitation as the wave steepness increases if the results obtained by using the free trim and the fixed trim approach for the calculation of the vessel righting lever in waves are compared it can be appreciated that in terms of amplitude both results are quite similar for the lower steepnesses and variations obtained from the fixed trim approach are slightly larger for the largest steepnesses if the position of the peaks is analysed a light bending and displacement to the right can be noticed in the fixed trim case which is not present in the free trim calculations in any case both alternatives provide very similar outcomes however the similarities among the two calculation approaches reduce if the wavelength under study is increased fig 9 in this case the results obtained for the wavelength λ w 48 615 m corresponding to a frequency ratio of ω w ω 0 2 0 in free and fixed trim conditions are noticeably different on the one hand fixed trim variations of metacentric height are larger than free trim ones for all wave steepnesses on the other hand regarding the peak positions a large shift to the right can be observed in the fixed trim case finally and especially for the largest steepnesses fixed trim curves of gm t as a function of the wave crest position present wider peaks than those obtained from the free trim calculations in addition to the gm t variation due to wave passing for a fixed wave length and different wave crest positions and steepnesses as shown in figs 8 and 9 in fig 10 the variation of gm t due to the effect of waves as a function of wavelength and frequency ratio for the different values of wave steepness and for the free to trim and fixed trim methodologies is presented moreover in fig 11 the mean gm t in waves as a function of wavelength and frequency ratio for the different wave steepnesses and for the free to trim and fixed trim methodologies is included as it can be appreciated from these figures the variation of gm t in waves tend to be larger in the fixed trim case and this difference becomes more noticeable as wavelength is increased regarding mean gm t in waves a similar behaviour could be observed and the difference between the fixed trim approach and the free trim one becomes very large as wave length and wave steepness increase the patterns shown in figs 8 and 9 for the metacentric height are reflected by the righting lever curves in waves as an example the gz curves both free and fixed trim for the wave condition with largest steepness and wavelength equal to ship length λ w l p p s w 1 15 are shown in fig 12 as colour plots as a function of wave crest position and roll angle as it can be appreciated in the case of free trim the maximum gz values are associated to a wave crest position close to the vessel perpendiculars wave through amidships while minimum values are placed when it is around a 40 of the wavelength from the aft perpendicular these wave crest positions basically coincide with those observed for minimum and maximum metacentric height in fig 8 in the case of fixed trim larger values of maximum gz are observed in comparison to the free trim case although the positions of these maxima are similar to those on the free trim case the minimum values are shifted up to a position at around 60 of the ship length from the aft perpendicular this pattern could also be observed in fig 8 where the presence of a bending to the right of the gm t curves as a function of the wave crest position was already highlighted in addition to this a shifting of the minimum values to wave crest positions closer to the aft perpendicular at large roll angles can be observed this behaviour is not present in the free trim calculations where minima occur approximately at the same position almost independently of roll angle in addition to gm t and gz data in waves which have been described fig 13 shows the normalised variation of km t due to wave passing for different values of wavelength and steepness in the free trim case these curves provide information regarding the amplitude of the variation of the transverse stability characteristics of the vessel for given wave condition normalised by using the wave amplitude these values can be considered to represent a sort of approximate numerical transfer function between wave excitation and parametric excitation while a semi analytical approach for their calculation was presented in the past by dunwoody 1989 as it can be observed the influence of wave steepness on the magnitude of normalised km t variation is noticeable only in the vicinity of a wavelength similar to vessel length that is where maximum values occur it is noted that additional relative maxima also take place at wavelengths close to 12 m around 40 of the ship length between perpendiculars although their amplitude is noticeably lower than that of the absolute ones it is however to point out that for the vessel used in this study the observed almost linear dependence of the variation of km t from the wave steepness for the considered waves could be associated with the fact that the considered vessel has a large freeboard however in case of fishing vessels characterised by small freeboard and depending on the considered wave amplitudes the linear modelling could fail to properly represent the variation of km t in waves in such cases a more general nonlinear dependence based on direct calculations should be accounted for fig 13 also reports the largest value of normalised km t variation for a wave frequency of ω w 2 ω 0 λ w 48 615 m which corresponds to the lowest wave steepness s w 1 200 this value has been conservatively taken to correspond to the f 1 factor in the simplified methodology see 8 for predicting roll motion amplitude under parametric roll conditions in head seas results from the application of the simplified methodology are shown in fig 14 the figure shows the predicted rolling amplitude as a function of wave steepness for a wave frequency ω w 2 ω 0 as it can be observed roll motion under parametric roll starts developing above the inception threshold which in this case corresponds to a wave steepness slightly higher than s w 1 200 for larger steepnesses the roll motion amplitude grows up linearly with the steepness up to more than 50 degrees at s w 1 20 the linear increase of roll as predicted by the simplified methodology is a direct consequence of the assumption of linear plus quadratic roll damping model if a cubic roll damping term was added the predicted roll amplitude would show a reduced grow rate for larger steepnesses it is also important to recall that the simplified methodology 8 neglects the effect of nonlinearities in the restoring term since nonlinearities of the restoring typically lead to a shifting of the peak of the parametrically excited roll response curve as the excitation and thus the amplitude of roll increases this effect is not captured by the simplified methodology 8 comparisons of predicted roll motion in regular head seas obtained by using the 6 dof and the 1 dof models free and fixed trim gz calculation are presented in fig 15 where the roll amplitude is plotted against ω w ω 0 ratio for the six tested wave steepness similarly to the case of beam waves also in this case the 1 dof naturally enforce the zero speed mean zero yaw condition in order to achieve a similar situation also in case of 6 dof simulations soft restraints were added in particular the ship is restrained by two elastic lines connected on one end at the ship bow at the calm water draught and fixed to the earth fixed reference frame on the other end in a v shaped configuration the elastic lines produce force when in traction but do not produce force in case of compression similarly to elastic lines used in real experiments similar elastic lines where not connected at the stern since due to the zero speed and head sea condition this was found not necessary and it was therefore preferred to reduce at minimum the number and thus the influence of the restrain system as it can be appreciated from fig 15 in the s w 1 200 case the only model which shows appreciable roll motion is the 1 dof fixed trim one mainly due to the fact that the parametric excitation in this case as was shown in figs 9 and 10 is larger almost doubled than that of the 1 dof free trim model it can also be noted that the peak amplitude occurs at ω w ω 0 2 due to the fact that for small rolling amplitude gz is well approximated by its linear approximation and hence no roll response bending occurs as the wave steepness is increased the roll amplitudes predicted by the three models increase as well up to a wave steepness of s w 1 50 the response curves obtained from the 1 dof model with free trim and the 6 dof model are almost coincident on the other hand the amplitudes predicted by the 1 dof fixed trim model are systematically larger and the unstable area in this case is also wider than for the 6 dof and 1 dof free trim models these are consequences of the larger parametric excitation in the fixed trim 1 dof model as can be observed also in fig 10 as the predicted roll amplitudes increase the effect of the gz nonlinearities can be appreciated in the bending to the right higher wave frequencies of the response curves this is a characteristic which is obtained with all the models which is in line with the hardening calm water restoring and which increases with the roll amplitude as gz nonlinearities become more relevant if the wave steepness is further increased s w 1 30 a different behaviour is observed for each of the models in the low frequency long waves range left part of the plot the inception of parametric roll starts nearly at the same frequency ratio for the three models and the predicted roll amplitudes remain very similar up to a frequency ratio of approximately ω w ω 0 2 0 for larger frequencies the predicted roll amplitudes start diverging being the highest those predicted by the 1 dof fixed trim model and the smallest those from the 6 dof model finally a third different behaviour is observed for the highest wave steepnesses s w 1 20 and s w 1 15 in these cases although the inception frequency ratios of parametric roll are quite similar in the 6 dof model and 1 dof model with free trim the parametric roll inception range is sensibly shifted to higher frequencies in the 1 dof fixed trim case and this is particularly noticeable for the highest tested wave steepness up to a frequency ratio around ω w ω 0 2 0 the response curves for the 6 dof model and the 1 dof free trim model remain quite close similarly to what has been previously observed however also in this case response curves start to diverge for higher frequencies while the 6 dof model tends to saturate and the maximum roll amplitude does not increase much as the wave steepness is increased the roll amplitude predicted by the 1 dof free trim model continues increasing with wave steepness at the same time the maximum roll predicted by the 1 dof fixed trim model tends to show a stronger saturation effect compared to the free trim one eventually the response curves of both alternatives of the 1 dof model reach similar maxima and have approximately the same shape in the region of frequencies from around ω w ω 0 2 3 and above regarding the instability areas they are similar in width when comparing the 6 dof and the 1 dof free trim models although that of the latter is slightly shifted to higher frequencies however the instability area obtained using the 1 dof fixed trim model is noticeably narrower at the largest wave steepness such behaviour however is associated with the indirect effect of the variation of mean gm t in waves the variation of mean gm t in waves gm t m e a n w if compared to the nominal one in calm water can be considered to basically correspond to a change of the reference natural frequency of the vessel which is relevant for the determination of the tuning ratio this reference natural frequency when wave effects are taken into consideration ω 0 w becomes 14 ω 0 w ω 0 g m t m e a n w g m t as a result the nominal tuning ratio ω w ω 0 which is normally used for plotting the results is no longer a good approximation of the actual tuning ratio in waves ω w ω 0 w it is also to be noted that the actual amplitude of parametric excitation is δ gm t gm t m e a n w and this quantity depends on both the wave length and the wave steepness which is further affecting the observed behaviour finally again the effect of gz nonlinearity can be observed in the bending to higher frequencies of the roll amplitude curves from the three models in fig 16 the maximum roll amplitudes obtained with the three models for the six tested wave steepnesses are compared this figure is useful for analysing the maximum expected roll amplitudes in head waves without focussing on the wave frequency at which this maximum occurs for sake of comparison the results obtained with the simplified analytical approach based on the mathieu equation with nonlinear damping have also been included observing the results reported in fig 16 it can be seen that the values obtained with the fixed trim 1 dof model are the highest from the three approaches in the whole range of wave steepness as it has been already mentioned regarding the other two models the results obtained with the free trim 1 dof model are very similar to those obtained with the 6 dof in the lowest range of wave steepnesses however the difference between these two models becomes larger as wave steepness increases and for the highest values of wave steepness the results from the free trim 1 dof model are in line with those of the fixed trim approach the simplified approximation accurately tracks the results of the more complex models in the low range of wave steepnesses especially those of the 1 dof free trim one as the applied f 1 transfer function has been determined in line with this model for low steepnesses due to the increased level of parametric excitation the 1 dof fixed trim model shows instead an earlier build up of roll however as wave steepness increases the simplified methodology which neglects the nonlinearities of roll restoring predicts much larger amplitudes than those obtained by any of the proposed models this confirms the importance of restoring nonlinearities in determining the amplitude of parametrically excited roll motion in regular waves it is interesting to note that contrary to what was observed in the beam sea case compare with fig 7 here in the head sea case the 6 dof model tends to show the smallest maximum roll amplitudes with the exception of the two smallest tested wave steepnesses where however the 6 dof model shows results which are only marginally larger than the 1 dof free trim model although it was not possible to identify a clear source for the observed behaviour of the 6 dof model with respect to the 1 dof ones some aspects could be linked with the observed outcomes one point is that the 6 dof model takes into account the actual dynamics of heave and pitch whereas the 1 dof free trim model considers them quasi statically and the 1 dof fixed trim model considers only heave quasi statically and fixes the trim another source of differences could be the fact that the 6 dof model provides an explicit dynamic coupling between all relevant degrees of freedom instead in the 1 dof models this dynamic coupling effect is neglected or it is approximately accounted for in an implicit way coupling between sway roll and yaw it is also possible that as a result of the differences in modelling and as a result of coupling the 6 dof approach in the simulations in waves is associated with a dissipation level which eventually differs from that of the 1 dof models 4 discussion and final remarks the limitations in cost time and a simplified regulatory framework usually limit the application of too complex tools within the design process of fishing vessels however the inception of parametric roll in longitudinal waves or excessive roll motions in beam seas are well known phenomena which could affect the operational safety of this type of vessels the application of simple models could therefore help in addressing the risk stemming from these phenomena within the mentioned practical constraints the main objective of this paper was therefore to compare the performance of simplified 1 dof models as well as very simplified analytical formulations with respect to outcomes from more complex 6 dof high fidelity blended modelling for analysing the vulnerability of the vessel to parametric roll resonance and large motions in beam seas such comparison was carried out to analyse the suitability of the former methods to be used during the early design stages where the application of any stability analysis tool should fulfil some requirements of reduced cost time and complexity and 6 dof codes are therefore out of the scope this is particularly true in the case of fishing vessels which are the specific target of the present study to this end the roll motion response of a mid sized trawler at zero speed and for regular beam and head waves with different steepness and frequencies was analysed by applying a state of the art 6 dof model and different simplified nonlinear 1 dof models for the 1 dof modelling two methodologies were applied in the beam waves case absolute and relative angle modelling for the excitation and restoring terms and another two in the longitudinal waves case based on fixed trim and free trim calculation of righting lever in waves in addition to this two very simplified analytical expressions to compute the maximum expected roll amplitude both in longitudinal and beam regular waves have been also applied 4 1 beam waves condition harmonic resonance the obtained results show that for the case of beam seas even the simplest fully analytical approach which was applied based on linear restoring and nonlinear damping could be considered as well reproducing the outcomes from the most complex alternative if only an estimation of the maximum roll amplitude is needed the estimation of the maximum roll amplitude could be very useful for example to reduce the risk of flooding through open doors or through progressive flooding points which are known to be very likely causes of fishing vessel accidents ciaim 2014 wolfson unit 2004 in this case the use of the simplified analytical approach could already help in applying possible corrective measures to the vessel design aimed at avoiding or at least reducing these issues this approach is also in line with the background theory of the existing weather criterion if the whole response curve is of interest then the 1 dof model based on a relative angle approach provided the closest results to the 6 dof model the differences in the predictions were larger as the forcing wave steepness increased in addition to the above it is worth making some comments regarding the estimation of the effective wave slope coefficient which is needed in both of the simplified methodologies the main approach applied in this work for the determination of such coefficient which has been proved in the past to be effective and theoretically justifiable is based on linear hydrodynamics however such methodology requires linear hydrodynamic data which might not available in case of typical fishing vessels design unless seakeeping calculations are carried out simplified alternatives have also been investigated which are based on direct froude krylov pressure integration or semi empirical formulae for the tested case the froude krylov approach could be a good balance between simplicity and accuracy in fact it allows providing a frequency dependent effective wave slope function and in the range of frequencies of interest for the study it was conservative with respect to the approach based on linear hydrodynamics on the other hand semi empirical methodologies provided effective wave slope coefficients only at the roll natural frequency which were also non conservative with respect to the other tested methodologies 4 2 longitudinal waves condition parametric roll regarding parametric roll resonance the situation is different with respect to that discussed above for the beam sea case the very simplified analytical approach used herein based on linear time dependent roll restoring and accounting for nonlinearities only in damping proved to be unsuitable for predicting the rolling amplitudes above parametric roll threshold apart from regions of very small steepnesses for moderate large wave steepness the use of at least a 1 dof model was necessary for the tested case if only the maximum roll amplitudes are needed the use of the 1 dof fixed trim model represented for the tested case a conservative and thus on the safe side approach compared to the 6 dof model in fact the former overpredicted roll motion in comparison to the latter in the whole range of wave steepnesses if the details of the roll response curve are of interest the 1 dof free trim model showed closer results to the blended 6 dof code although the observed differences increased for larger wave steepnesses 4 3 practical implementation from the point of view of implementation some comments can be made for the beam sea case if the 1 dof time domain methodology is considered the implementation of the model requires the computation of the gz curves in still water the prediction of the effective wave slope coefficient and the vessel roll damping the 1 dof approach is of course much more affordable in terms of required technical skills time and cost if compared to the use of blended 6 dof tools the implementation of the fully analytical simplified approach is even simpler only needing the effective wave slope coefficient and the equivalent roll damping although the computation of effective wave slope coefficient through linear hydrodynamics is likely too complex considering the typical fishing vessel design routine the use of the simplified froude krylov approach is a much easier alternative once the hull geometry and the vessel loading condition are available as it is always the case during design stages following these considerations it can then be stated that the implementation of these models 1 dof time domain model and fully analytical method within typical existing tools does not present any serious difficulty and will be a very straightforward process for the longitudinal sea case the evaluation of parametric roll on the basis of the 1 dof model requires the computation of several surfaces of gz for different waves although these are relatively simple computations they require a naval architecture software which is capable of performing them in a properly automated way this is a level of complexity higher than the calculations of righting lever in calm water as it is not usually built in in standard software and therefore makes the whole process of setting up the 1 dof model for parametric roll more time consuming than that for the beam waves case although the implementation of the analytical approach is much simpler its performance as it has been already discussed is far from satisfactory for most of the tested conditions 4 4 final remarks considering the envisioned practical application of the proposed alternatives it could therefore be concluded that simple models can provide reasonable predictions with much lower effort compared to the use of the more complex 6 dof tool in the initial stages of the vessel design however their real applicability as typical is largely dependent on their implementation in a self contained software application with a user friendly interface and high level of automation simplifying therefore the process of model setting up and use this is an aspect which is particularly important in the case of fishing vessels design for obtaining realistic roll predictions accurate roll damping information is necessary and this is valid of course for both the beam sea case as well as for the longitudinal sea case use of damping coefficients from a similar vessel application of analytical methods or even the use of a real vessel roll decay test could be different alternatives for obtaining these data at the moment however there seems to be no widespread and accepted methodologies for this purpose which are applicable to fishing vessels and research is therefore needed in this respect finally it has to be indicated that this study is limited to one single vessel and therefore its conclusions cannot be extended to the whole fishing fleet where different typologies and sizes may be found nevertheless in case the maritime authorities would undertake a major review of the fishing vessels stability regulatory framework to incorporate direct assessment approaches the basis established in this work would be of direct application acknowledgements part of the present work was carried out during a research visit at

23697,fishing is one of the most risky occupations worldwide many accidents are due to stability failures and dynamic stability phenomena in waves are among the possible causes due to time cost and regulatory lacks these phenomena are not addressed during design of fishing vessels high fidelity six degrees of freedom 6 dof codes can cope with these phenomena but their complexity cost and time of application limit their use to high end vessels the use of less demanding approaches appears more suited for the fishing sector the scope of this paper is to compare a 6 dof blended code 1 dof nonlinear roll models and simplified analytical formulae in order to assess the level of dispersion of the obtained roll motion predictions among tools with different levels of complexity the roll response for a medium sized stern trawler is investigated in regular beam and longitudinal waves at zero speed results from the simplified models are in fair agreement with those from the 6 dof code at least for moderate wave steepnesses simplified models could provide a valuable tool for the assessment of fishing vessels behaviour at the early design stage considering also their ease of implementation within typical existing naval architecture software keywords fishing vessels stability parametric roll dead ship condition safety 1 introduction fishing sector is the one within the maritime industry with the largest fleet worldwide the total number of engine powered fishing vessels is over 2 900 000 according to the latest fao statistics fao 2016a 80 of these units are from asian countries 7 from latin american countries 6 from african ones 3 of this fleet belongs to europe another 3 to the u s and finally 1 to oceania one characteristic of the fishing fleet is its vast heterogeneity different regulatory frameworks distance to the fishing ground caught species regional tradition or even meteorological characteristics of their area of operation lead to many different designs which make it difficult to categorize fishing vessels into a limited set of typologies however a classification according to the ship length is usually done based on the applicability limits of the different imo and fao instruments on the one hand there are vessels of 24 m in length and over which should be under the regulatory framework of the torremolinos protocol imo 1993 the cape town agreement imo 2012 the part b of the code of safety for fishermen and fishing vessels fao ilo imo 2005a and the 2008 intact stability code imo 2008a on the other hand there are medium sized fishing vessels with lengths between 12 m and over and up to 24 m to which the voluntary guidelines for the design construction and equipment of small fishing vessels fao ilo imo 2005b are of application and finally there are small vessels of under 12 m length which are within the scope of the safety recommendations for decked fishing vessels of less than 12 m in length and undecked fishing vessels fao ilo imo 2012 in addition it has to be said that none of the previous international regulations regarding fishing vessel safety are nowadays of mandatory application these vessels are only required to fulfil regional regulations or agreements which are in fact quite variable depending on the flag state of the ship according to this categorization latest data fao 2016a show that most of the worldwide fleet 85 of the vessels belongs to the under 12 m group while 13 belongs to the group with length between 12 and 24 m and only 2 of the fleet has a length of 24 m and over this distribution fits quite well the distribution of the regional fleets such as for example the e u one e u 2016 regarding the economic importance of the sector it employs more than 37 million direct workers worldwide not including aquaculture or processing industries from these 29 million are from southeast asian countries more than 280 000 are from the u s and 150 000 are from the e u fishing influence is especially relevant in the less developed countries where primary sectors have a prevalent role globally fish trade activities have grown in the last years with exports rising from 72 billion dollars in 2004 to 148 billion dollars in 2014 and imports rising from 76 billion dollars in 2004 to 140 billion dollars in 2014 china is the top exporter 13 while the u s is the top importer 14 if the case of the e u is used as an example of the situation of fishing in the more developed countries it could be seen that although fishing does not have a great impact on the economics of a whole country it can have a big impact in some regions where the local economy can be really fishing dependent while the gross value added gva of fishing and aquaculture to the total gross domestic product gdp of the e u is a 0 1 and in spain this relationship is a 0 2 in galicia one of this high dependant areas in spain this value rises up to a 1 3 regarding employment more than 25 of all the workers within fishing of the e u are from just certain high dependant regions of spain greece portugal and italy if the case of galicia is again mentioned it accounts for 7 5 of the e u workers 5 2 of the ships 8 8 of the gt s and 14 5 of the value of the total e u catches e u 2016 fao 2016a 2016b meixide vecino 2015 despite these facts safety is still one of the biggest problems affecting fishing sector and fishing is still considered as one of the most dangerous industrial sectors not only in the developing economies but also in the fully developed ones fao estimates in more than 24 000 the number of casualties per year which directly affect fishing worldwide gudmundsson 2013 in the case of countries like the usa bls 2014 uk roberts 2010 or spain mess 2014 although this number is sensibly lower fishing is placed among the activities with largest fatal incident rates in jensen et al 2014 a review of figures and trends of fatal accident incidence rates for different european countries norway denmark iceland uk and poland usa and canada can be found showing the aforementioned high casualty rates if data from jensen et al 2014 and those from other sources ciaim 2014 lincoln 2010 maib 2016 are analysed it can be appreciated that a large percentage of the casualties occur in the small medium range of the fleet vessels under 24 m length and that many of them are due to stability failures capsizing or bad weather large wave struck these accidents usually lead to the complete loss of the vessel in a sudden and fast way making it very difficult for the crew to save themselves mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2014 this high percentage of stability related accidents in the small segment of the fleet could be explained by different reasons one reason is to be associated with the human factor crews of medium small fishing vessels lack the training that those of larger vessels have due to this fact they are not usually able to determine the risk level of their ship in a given operational situation or to understand the typically few stability information they have onboard womack 2001 as a result the crew on fishing vessels often base their judgement criteria just on their subjective experience this lack of awareness together with some occasional factors such as not ensuring the vessel weather tightness or the overloading of the vessel is a major cause of these types of accidents míguez gonzález et al 2012 spitzer 1999 wolfson unit 2004 an additional aspect is the regulatory framework as it has been already mentioned the international mandatory regulations applicable to vessels of over 24 m length torremolinos protocol and cape town agreement have not entered into force yet and with the exception of those countries which have ratified any of them only regional regulations are of application in the case of vessels under 24 m no international requirements are mandatory and again flag states are responsible of establishing the regulatory framework francescutto 2013 gudmundsson 2013 in some cases especially in the under 24 m range these regional requirements do not reach the same safety levels as those of the imo instruments gudmundsson 2013 kaplan and kite powell 2000 spitzer 1999 wolfson unit 2004 a further factor affecting the low safety score of fishing vessels are the environmental conditions fishermen are usually forced to sail in very harsh weather conditions as their incomes are fully dependant on catches taking into account that with the notable exception of the icelandic approach viggosson 2009 there is no regulation which determines which weather conditions a given fishing vessel is allowed to sail in as a function of her size or stability levels crews of smaller vessels usually face relatively worse conditions than those of the larger vessels spitzer 1999 compared to larger vessels small and medium sized fishing vessels sail in relatively more severe weather conditions which can induce large amplitude motions and other dynamic effects particularly roll in fact roll motion can significantly contribute in deteriorating the operability of the vessel mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2014 tello et al 2011 and is among all ship degrees of freedom the one which can mostly compromise its safety moreover in addition to stability failures associated to static quasi static effects e g mantari et al 2011 nonlinear dynamic roll instabilities are known to be among the causes of accidents involving fishing vessels mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2013 the evaluation of merchant and naval vessel vulnerability to the aforementioned instabilities has traditionally been done by using experimental tests complex mathematical tools or both of these alternatives which turned out to be a quite expensive and long process in the case of fishing vessels especially the smaller ones their design process is usually very limited not only in cost but also in time this is partially associated with the fact that profit margins of this activity are very low an average of a 6 from 2010 to 2013 in the e u 2016 and long design and construction periods limit the vessel profitability in case of eu countries in addition the need to shorten the design and construction time is due to the fact that current regulations require the decommissioning of one vessel in order to build another one with the same tonnage mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2013 these limitations in cost and time have made it very rare to have dynamic stability analysis carried out within design stages in the case of fishing vessels at the same time however the need for taking into account dynamic stability phenomena in waves has been already acknowledged by researchers and regulators and different published recommendations to skippers try to provide some information about how to avoid or at least reduce the inception of such phenomena dfohs 2014 gudmundsson 2009 imo 2008a wolfson unit 2004 womack and johnson 2003 in order to take into account these phenomena within the imo intact stability regulatory framework the imo second generation intact stability criteria sgisc are under development sdc 2 wp 4 2015 sdc 3 wp 5 2016 sdc 4 5 1 2016 sdc 4 inf 4 2016 sdc 4 wp 4 2017 the sgisc framework considers five different possible failure modes parametric roll resonance dead ship condition pure loss of stability surf riding broaching and excessive accelerations francescutto 2016 however such new criteria are not planned to be applied to fishing vessels hence the development of sgisc is not considering fishing vessels in the tuning of standards still the operational scheme of fishing vessels makes them potentially vulnerable to some of these phenomena typically while reeling in these vessels could spend a long time sailing at very low speeds even at zero speed in head trawlers and purse seiners or beam seas longliners and purse seiners this reduced speed condition also takes place during the periods when catches are processed after the recovery of the fishing gear and nets in addition they could also sail at slow speeds in low manoeuvrability situations and with a catch dependant heading letting out purse seiners letting out or trawling trawlers or at moderate speeds with some more steering capabilities as is the case of letting out longliners this operational profile makes fishing vessels prone to experiencing parametric roll resonance in head seas or pure roll resonance in beam seas equivalent to the dead ship condition considered in the sgisc on a normal sailing at cruise speed and as a consequence of the relatively small absolute dimensions fishing vessels could also experience pure loss of stability and surf riding broaching mata álvarez santullano and souto iglesias 2014 míguez gonzález et al 2015 perez rojas et al 2006 the operational requirements which in some conditions reduce the possibility of modifying the speed or heading make the potential vulnerability of fishing vessels to dynamic stability phenomena in waves even higher however it is also worth highlighting that in some of these situations especially in the trawling condition the effect of fishing nets on ship motions could be remarkable nowadays a variety of mathematical models exist for the prediction of the aforementioned dynamic stability phenomena which can be considered to be potentially applicable at design stage these go from the more complex and accurate nonlinear time domain 6 degrees of freedom 6 dof blended models to the simplest nonlinear time domain 1 degree of freedom 1 dof ones blended or hybrid simulation models use different assumptions and approximations in order to arrive at practical simulation tools for nonlinear ship motions in waves which balance accuracy and computational time the scope of the approximations introduced in these tools is basically to embed the major forcing terms which drive nonlinear ship motions in waves without exactly solving the fluid structure interaction problem in time domain a number of examples of such tools can be found in literature as mentioned also by peters et al 2012 examples are fredyn de kat and paulling 1989 mctaggart and de kat 2000 laidyn matusiak 2007 lamp liut et al 2002 shin et al 2003 spyrou et al 2009 nmriw ogawa 2009 shixdof bulian and francescutto 2013 tempest belknap and reed 2010 and the tools developed by ayaz et al 2006 greco and lugni 2012 2013 grochowalski et al 1998 and liu and papanikolaou 2016 among others blended tools were also discussed by beck and reed 2001 and more recently in the review by bačkalov et al 2016 in the case of parametric roll resonance it is also well worth mentioning also 3 dof models which include the dynamic coupling effects of pitch and heave on roll motion which are of paramount importance for the correct evaluation of the phenomenon munif and umeda 2006 taguchi et al 2011 an example of this alternative was presented by neves and rodríguez 2006 which has been applied to the evaluation of the behaviour of parametric roll in regular longitudinal waves for the case of fishing vessels neves and rodríguez 2009 and other cargo ships rodríguez et al 2007 however although 3 dof models are far simpler than 6 dof ones they are still much more complex than the 1 dof alternatives as the number of parameters required for their setting up is much larger and which include added mass damping and excitation terms for heave pitch and roll motions together with coupling among them as a result from the above 6 dof can be considered to represent the state of the art regarding nonlinear ship motion simulation with a view to application in ship design while 1 dof alternatives are characterised by a more tailored applicability to specific phenomena and an expected reduced accuracy compared to more complex models 3 dof models are herein considered to be as a too complex option for vulnerability assessment at design stage of fishing vessels an extensive review in this respect has recently been given by bačkalov et al 2016 where a detailed analysis of most of the available alternatives can be found in some cases 1 dof models can also be further simplified by developing specific analytical formulae which might partially avoid the necessity of going through time domain simulations it is also worth noting that this mentioned range of modelling correspond to that embedded within the sgisc framework at different assessment levels from the above discussion considering the fast cheap requirements implicit within the fishing vessel design sector it is evident that 1 dof or even simpler roll models likely represent the most practically feasible option for the assessment of possible vulnerability of a fishing vessel to potentially dangerous dynamic stability phenomena in waves proposals in this respect were already put forward in the past by e g bulian and francescutto 2006 it is however known that reduced dof models have limitations induced by their inherent simplifications in this context it is therefore important to investigate how the predictions from simplified models compare with those from higher fidelity tools in order to verify whether the two approaches provide vulnerability indications which are sufficiently in line for an application of simplified models as a design tool this is in fact the problem addressed by the paper i e a comparative investigation among models with different levels of complexity in the past conceptually similar investigations were carried out by munif and umeda 2006 who compared a 1 dof model for parametric roll with a 6 dof model with linearized heave and pitch for an icelandic trawler in a small set of longitudinal regular waves at zero speed and by somayajula and falzarano 2017 who compared the results from a 6 dof tool with those obtained by different simplified 1 dof models for the case of parametric rolling in irregular waves for a c11 containership also bulian et al 2012 compared predictions from simplified 1 dof nonlinear roll models with those obtained from the same 6 dof tool used herein for a series 60 hull form but for the case of bi chromatic beam waves at zero speed this paper focuses on fishing vessels and addresses parametric roll 2 1 subharmonic resonance in longitudinal regular waves and 1 1 roll resonance in beam regular sea waves at zero speed considering a wide range of wave conditions results from a high fidelity 6 dof blended model bulian and francescutto 2013 bulian et al 2012 2015 2016 cercos pita et al 2016 moro et al 2015 which has the main characteristics for application at the envisioned direct stability assessment level of imo second generation intact stability criteria slf 52 wp 1 annex 2 2010 annex 1 in sdc 4 wp 4 2017 are compared with outcomes from simpler 1 dof nonlinear roll models for the two considered conditions bulian 2006 bulian and francescutto 2006 bulian et al 2012 predictions based on simplified approximate prediction formulae derived from the proposed 1 dof roll models are also considered for the analysis a mid sized stern trawler which could be considered to be representative of the spanish fishing fleet has been selected it is recognised that in principle the effect of nets should also be taken into account for the prediction of actual fishing vessel behaviour at sea however herein the focus is on the relative comparison between the different types of dynamical models in nominal regular waves as a result the inclusion of effects of nets on ship motions has not been considered it is also underlined that including such effects is associated with a significant complexity with clear difficulties in the introduction of such effects particularly in the 1 dof models the paper is structured as follows first the mathematical models used in the comparative study are presented together with the simplified approximate formulae derived from the 1 dof models next the numerical experiments that have been carried out are described this section provides a description of the characteristics of the considered fishing vessel the description of the tests and the analysis of the obtained results roll motion amplitude is reported for different regular wave steepnesses and frequencies in head and beam seas and zero speed using the different considered approaches finally some conclusions regarding the possible applicability of the considered simplified models at the vessel design stage are reported 2 description of mathematical models 2 1 1 dof models 1 dof nonlinear models used in this study for the analysis of roll behaviour in case of 1 1 resonance in regular beam waves and in case of 2 1 parametric roll resonance in longitudinal regular waves are typical 1 dof models employed in the field of nonlinear roll motion dynamics see e g belenky and sevastianov 2007 or bačkalov et al 2016 and references therein each model however will be studied in two variants as described in details in the following sections moreover for each model a simplified analytical formulation for the determination of an approximate maximum roll response will also be provided in this respect considering the target of the study the simplified formulae will be considered at the maximum possible level of simplification in the present work two different alternatives for the simple 1 dof model have been studied in both the head and beam sea cases in the head seas case a nonlinear model of roll motion based on the look up table approach for obtaining the gz in waves has been selected considering the vessel both as free to trim in waves in the computations of gz or with a fixed constant trim in the case of beam waves two options have been applied for implementing the wave excitation within the model the absolute angle model which considers wave moments as an external excitation term which is separate from the restoring term and the relative angle model where wave excitation is included within the nonlinear restoring term it is underlined that both models considered herein describe the dynamics of the absolute roll angle and the wordings absolute and relative are meant to identify the type of approach which is used for the modelling of the moment exerted on the inclined vessel in presence of waves 2 1 1 beam waves in this work two different 1 dof models are considered for analysing the roll motion response in regular beam waves in both cases the inherent nonlinearities of large amplitude roll motion are taken into account through nonlinear restoring and nonlinear damping terms the first model is the most frequently used 1 dof nonlinear roll model for describing the absolute roll angle ϕ in the beam sea condition bulian and francescutto 2006 francescutto and contento 1999 spyrou et al 2002 wu and mccue 2008 among others and see also references in bačkalov et al 2016 1 ϕ 2 ν ω 0 ϕ β ϕ ϕ δ ϕ 3 ω 0 2 g z ϕ g m t ω 0 2 α e f f t in this model the righting lever curve in still water as a function of the absolute roll angle g z ϕ is considered in the nonlinear restoring term and roll damping comprises linear and nonlinear terms coefficients ν β and δ the calm water metacentric height is indicated as g m t while ω 0 is the roll natural frequency it is noted that the wave excitation term appears on the right hand side of the equation as a separate term with respect to the restoring which appears on the left hand side in the excitation term the wave moment is implemented using the effective wave slope α e f f approach as follows 2 α e f f t π r s w cos ω e t ψ where s w is the wave steepness ω e is the encounter wave frequency ψ is a generic phase and r is the effective wave slope coefficient in case drifting is not explicitly accounted for the encounter wave frequency corresponds to the physical wave frequency moreover the phase ψ can be taken as zero considering an appropriate translation of the origin of time the effective wave slope coefficient is assumed to depend on the ship geometry and on considered wave it is worth underlining that modelling of the type in 1 2 has been accepted by the imo in the framework of the alternative assessment of weather criterion on an experimental basis through msc 1 circ 1200 francescutto et al 2004 imo 2006 in particular msc 1 circ 1200 allows using a parameter identification technique pit based on a modelling of the type 1 2 where the model parameters are determined from model scale experiments in beam waves and the 1 dof model is then used to predict roll motion in the required conditions for the weather criterion the absolute angle model however has been shown to present some consistency issues bulian and francescutto 2009 2011 and a thinking to the actual physics of the fluid structure interaction would suggest that a model accounting for a corrected relative angle between the ship and the wave could be more appropriate as second model therefore the partially relative angle approach from bulian and francescutto 2009 2011 is applied where the wave excitation is included within the restoring term this alternative which can be referred to as effective relative angle approach still describes the dynamics of the absolute roll angle ϕ as the previous absolute angle approach however in contrast to the previous model it tries to take into account the effect of relative angle between the ship and the wave for the computation of fluid structure interaction moment more precisely this alternative tries to take into account the fact that differently from the linear case in a nonlinear framework it is not possible to separate the restoring from the wave excitation since these two effects are both included in the moment exerted on the vessel due to the total pressure on the hull this second 1 dof alternative for the beam sea condition takes the following form 3 ϕ 2 ν ω 0 ϕ β ϕ ϕ δ ϕ 3 ω 0 2 g z ϕ α e f f t g m t 0 it can be noted that as anticipated the equation still describes the dynamics of the absolute roll angle ϕ however now the instantaneous effective wave slope α e f f t is embedded in the calm water restoring using the idea of the effective relative angle ϕ α e f f it is noted that when the roll restoring is linear i e g z ξ g m t ξ or when the angle for the calculation of the restoring is small enough i e g z ξ g m t ξ then the two models 1 and 3 reduce to the same model historically the idea of describing roll motion dynamics using a reasoning based on the concept of relative angle can be dated back to froude 1861 who used a long wave approximation i e r 1 and a linear restoring however in the literature it is possible to find different approaches based on the relative angle modelling for instance wellicome 1975 and wright and marshfield 1980 used an approach where all terms in the dynamic equation added inertia damping restoring combined with forcing are based on the relative angle ϕ α and appropriate corresponding derivatives neglecting the effective wave slope coefficient under the assumption of long waves and they considered nonlinear damping and nonlinear restoring instead tamiya 1975 for instance used a mathematical model where the added inertia and the damping terms are based respectively on the first and on the second derivative of the absolute roll angle the restoring and excitation are combined using a corrected restoring lever of the type r g z ϕ α i e using the nominal relative angle between the ship and the wave ϕ α and using the effective wave slope as a global corrective multiplicative factor moreover eventually also tamiya 1975 used the long wave approximation assuming r 1 these mentioned models differ from 3 since in the model presented herein the added inertia and the damping term are based on the absolute roll angle like tamiya 1975 but the restoring plus forcing term g z ϕ r α is based on an effective relative angle where the effective wave slope is used as a correction factor only for the wave slope specific discussions regarding the use of absolute versus relative angle for the modelling of roll motion have been provided by belenky and sevastianov 2007 and by bulian and francescutto 2011 the frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient r which is included in the forcing term in both models can be predicted by using different methodologies one approach for its computation is based on a decoupling of the linear hydrodynamics seakeeping equations bulian and francescutto 2009 2011 naciri and lledo 2001 a second simpler approach which does not require the hydrodynamic solution of the fluid structure interaction problem is based on the determination of r by direct computation of roll moment induced by the froude krylov forces with respect to the vessel centre of gravity e g umeda and tsukamoto 2008 finally two simplified semi empirical methods exist as proposed by blume 1979 and as available in the imo weather criterion imo 2008a in these two latter cases however the effective wave slope is provided only for a value of wave frequency corresponding to the vessel natural roll frequency in this work although some comparisons will be provided considering the four mentioned alternatives only the first approach has been selected for the time domain calculations and comparisons with results from the 6 dof model for both models 1 and 3 an approximate solution for the maximum roll amplitude can be obtained by means of a straightforward simplified analytical approach if nonlinearities in damping are retained but those in restoring are neglected in this case the maximum expected roll amplitude for a given wave of steepness s w and a given effective wave slope coefficient r can be obtained by solving the following equation for the roll amplitude a r o l l 4 a r o l l π r s w 2 ν e a r o l l where ν e a r o l l is the dimensionless linear equivalent roll damping coefficient at the roll natural frequency and it can be calculated as himeno 1981 ikeda et al 1978 5 ν e a r o l l ν 4 3 π β a r o l l 3 8 δ ω 0 a r o l l 2 the combination of 4 and 5 leads to a polynomial equation for a r o l l which in general can be solved through simple numerical methods it is also worth mentioning that the formula for the roll amplitude in the present weather criterion imo 2008a basically corresponds to what is obtained from 4 and 5 when only a pure quadratic damping is considered however the formula in the weather criterion also contains a semi empirical 30 reduction in roll amplitude with respect to that which would be observed in regular beam waves see imo 2006 2008b for the considered fishing vessel results from the two mentioned 1 dof models as well as results from the simplified approach 4 5 will be compared with outcomes from the 6 dof model which will be described later 2 1 2 longitudinal waves the 1 dof model considered herein for the analysis of parametrically excited roll motion response in regular longitudinal waves is what can be considered to be the most commonly used simplified model similarly to the beam sea case inherent nonlinearities of large amplitude roll motion which are of paramount importance to accurately compute the rolling amplitude are taken into account through nonlinear restoring and nonlinear damping terms in this case nonlinear roll restoring is calculated as a function of both the heeling angle and of the wave crest position in time along the hull the used 1 dof non linear roll model takes the following form 6 ϕ 2 ν ω 0 ϕ β ϕ ϕ δ ϕ 3 ω 0 2 g z ϕ t g m t 0 where as in 4 ν β and δ are linear and nonlinear damping coefficients ω 0 is the natural roll frequency of the ship g m t is the still water metacentric height but now g z ϕ t is the time varying nonlinear heeling lever as a function of roll angle and time and it depends on the wave length and steepness considered in the simulation regarding damping it is here underlined that the linear term is dominant at small rolling amplitudes and it governs together with the variation of the linear term of g z ϕ t i e g m t t the parametric roll inception boundary on the other hand nonlinearities of damping and restoring affect large amplitude motions the 1 dof model in 6 has been used in the past for different types of vessels see e g references in bačkalov et al 2016 including also fishing vessels bulian and francescutto 2006 munif and umeda 2006 moreover this type of model has been also adopted in class rules as a sufficient tool for addressing the vessel vulnerability to parametric roll abs 2004 and it has been used in the development of parametric roll vulnerability criteria in imo sgisc in particular at level 2 check 2 vulnerability assessment sdc 3 wp 5 2016 tompuri et al 2014 the time wave and roll angle dependent restoring term the g z ϕ t is computed by using a standard hydrostatic software under the quasi static assumption to this end two different approaches have been considered one where the vessel is free to trim and sink as a function of the wave crest position and heel fixed trim approach and another alternative where the vessel trim is fixed while letting the sinkage free free trim approach this model considers that the equilibrium of the vessel is obtained in a quasi static way although this approach misses the dynamic effects of heave and pitch it has shown to provide reasonably accurate results in various cases bulian 2006 similarly to the case of 1 1 resonance in beam regular waves also in case of 2 1 subharmonic resonance in longitudinal regular waves a simplified expression for the maximum amplitude of parametrically excited roll motion a r o l l can be obtained if the restoring is approximated to be linear and if only nonlinearities in damping are retained to this end first the amplitude of parametric excitation is defined as 7 h 0 δ g m t g m t f 1 λ w s w 2 g m t where λ w and s w are respectively the length and steepness of the considered wave δ g m t is the variation of vertical position of metacentre for the considered wave and f 1 is the coefficient playing the role of an approximate transfer function of g m t variation in waves similar to that proposed by dunwoody 1989 then if the condition of frequency of encounter equal twice the natural roll frequency is fulfilled for the considered wave the maximum amplitude of parametrically excited roll motion a r o l l can be obtained by solving the following equation 8 h 0 4 ν e a r o l l where ν e a r o l l is the dimensionless linear equivalent roll damping coefficient in 5 also in this case the combination of 8 and 5 leads to a polynomial equation for a r o l l which in general can be solved through simple numerical methods equation 8 can be obtained as a simplification of the more general approximate expressions in bulian 2004 moreover the same type of simplified expression has been considered in the development of level 1 vulnerability assessment criteria for parametric roll in sgisc sdc 4 5 1 2016 it shall be noted however that the approximation 8 does not account for the effect of nonlinear restoring which in case of parametrically excited roll motion can be significant formulations involving nonlinear restoring at different levels of approximations and depending on cases with or without nonlinear damping can be found in bulian 2004 ittc 2006 and sdc 4 5 1 2016 2 2 6 dof blended code direct nonlinear analysis of fluid structure interaction through cfd codes with moving overlapping meshes presently represents the most advanced approach for simulation of ship motions in waves e g sadat hosseini et al 2010 however as outlined by bačkalov et al 2016 such tools are still too time consuming for a systematic application such as that which is required in the framework of ship design where a large number of different scenarios need to be investigated as a result in the framework of nonlinear ship motions simulations the state of the art are the so called hybrid or blended 6 dof models which are considered to represent reference high fidelity tools the aim of these tools is the simulation of nonlinear motions of a vessel possibly manoeuvring and self propelled in waves taking into account the main sources of nonlinearities which could cause dangerous dynamic stability phenomena in waves the model underlying such simulation codes typically blends linear hydrodynamics nonlinear froude krylov effects semi empirical models for manoeuvring additional roll damping dissipation terms semi empirical models for wind loads etc hybrid models have been considered to represent a potentially viable tool for the so called direct stability assessment level and for the development of ship specific operational guidance in the framework of imo second generation intact stability criteria slf 52 wp 1 annex 2 2010 annex 1 in sdc 4 wp 4 2017 as anticipated also in the introduction of the paper due to the partial semi empiricism which is inherent in hybrid models different implementation variants are available in literature e g ayaz et al 2006 belknap and reed 2010 bulian and francescutto 2013 de kat and paulling 1989 greco and lugni 2012 2013 grochowalski et al 1998 liu and papanikolaou 2016 liut et al 2002 matusiak 2007 mctaggart and de kat 2000 ogawa 2009 shin et al 2003 spyrou et al 2009 recent developments in this respect are reported by bačkalov et al 2016 the 6 dof model used herein is shixdof bulian and francescutto 2013 bulian et al 2012 2015 2016 cercos pita et al 2016 moro et al 2015 shixdof integrates the 6 dof nonlinear rigid body equations of motions projected as usual to the ship

primes indicate time derivatives carried out in the ship fixed reference system the first two equations are the equations of 6 dof nonlinear rigid body dynamics projected in the ship fixed reference system and therefore all involved vectors are considered to be represented in such reference system the ship fixed reference system is right handed and it has the x axis longitudinal directed from stern to bow the y axis transversal directed from starboard to port side and the z axis vertical directed upwards from bottom to top m is the mass of the ship the vector u o u v w t is the speed vector of the chosen centre o of the ship fixed reference system for the simulations ω p q r t is the rigid body angular velocity x g x g y g z g t is the position vector of the centre of gravity g i o is the tensor of inertia with respect to o external actions on the ship at the generic time t are represented by the force vector f e x t t f e x t x t f e x t y t f e x t z t t and the moment w r t o vector m e x t o t m e x t o x t m e x t o y t m e x t o z t t such external actions comprise the fluid structure interaction the possible effect of wind propellers restrain systems etc as usual the first two equations representing rigid body dynamics are supplemented by the third and fourth equations in order to properly position and orient the vessel in the earth fixed reference system at each time instant the third equation which allows translating the vessel in the earth fixed reference system represents the relation between the speed u o expressed in components with respect to the ship fixed reference system and the time derivative of the position vector ξ o ξ o η o ζ o t of the point o expressed in the earth fixed reference system the matrix r s σ which depends on the euler angles of roll ϕ pitch ϑ and yaw ψ is the transformation matrix from the ship fixed to the earth fixed reference system finally the fourth equation links the angular velocity ω expressed in components with respect to the ship fixed reference system to the time derivative of the vector of euler angles ε ϕ ϑ ψ t and it allows to properly orient the vessel in the earth fixed reference system the convention used for the order of the euler angles is the classical one used in naval architecture namely first yaw then pitch and finally roll with specific reference to the target of the present study a description is given in the following of the modelling for the most relevant actions froude krylov force and moment are determined by direct pressure integration on the instantaneous wetted hull based on the undisturbed wave profile s h t i e 10 f f k t s h t p t x t n x d s m f k o t s h t x p t x t n x d s where p t x t is the total instantaneous undisturbed wave pressure comprising also the hydrostatic term and n x is the local outward normal vector the total pressure is based on airy linear theory however in order to guarantee zero pressure at the free surface a stretching technique is applied to the linear field matusiak 2010 wheeler 1969 the integration is numerically carried out using a discretisation of the hull in triangular panels forces associated to the linear hydrodynamic modelling are split into two parts namely radiation and diffraction scattering radiation forces are determined instantaneously by means of convolution integrals using memory functions cummins 1962 derived from linear hydrodynamic pre calculations and herein the implementation is as follows 11 f r a d t m r a d o t a o h 0 t k o t τ h τ d τ k o τ 2 π 0 b o ω cos ω τ d ω h u o ω in 11 a o and b o ω are respectively the 6 6 matrices of infinite frequency added masses and frequency dependent damping both with respect to the point o while k o τ is the 6 6 matrix of memory functions depending on the time lag τ also the diffraction scattering force f d i f t and moment m d i f o t with respect to o are based on linear hydrodynamic frequency domain pre computations and they are determined at each time instant of the simulation by making direct use of the force moment transfer functions in particular at each time instant the heading of the vessel with respect to the wave and the relative position of the vessel point o with respect to the wave crest are determined from these two variables the instantaneous diffraction force and moment with respect to the point o are obtained using the amplitude and phase information from the available pre computed database of diffraction forces hydrodynamic coefficients a o and b o ω as well as transfer functions of diffraction forces are calculated for zero speed drag effects are modelled by means of a cross flow approach based on the local relative lateral speed between the vessel accounting for nonlinear rigid body motions and the undisturbed wave particles velocity field with stretching examples of approaches for modelling cross flow with specific attention to large amplitude ship motions in waves have been described in the past by de kat and paulling 1989 grochowalski et al 1998 and hughes et al 2011 in the present tool the force and moment due to cross flow effects are obtained at each time instant by integration of local contributions on the instantaneous portion of the ship centreplane which is below water considering the undisturbed wave profile s c p t 12 f d r a g t s c p t 1 2 ρ w a t e r c d x u r e l w y

the local component along the ship fixed y axis of the relative velocity of water with respect to the vessel and y ˆ is the versor of the y axis the local relative speed accounts for the effect of the wave velocity field when c d x on the ship centreplane does not depend on the vertical ship fixed coordinate the model reduces to a sectional cross flow model for the numerical determination of drag force and moment the centreplane of the vessel is discretised into small panels and for each panel the local contribution to the drag force and moment are determined and eventually summed up semi empirical nonlinear roll damping contributions can also be added and actually in general they need to be added in order to tune the model with respect to roll dissipation while in principle any general functional form can be used the following one is typically applied for tuning purposes 13 m a d d d a m p o t b 44 l a d d o p b 44 q a d d o p p b 44 c a d d o p 3 x ˆ in 13 x ˆ is the versor of the longitudinal ship axis and b 44 l a d d o b 44 q a d d o and b 44 c a d d o are respectively linear quadratic and cubic additional roll damping coefficients additional forces which are however less relevant for the cases addressed in this study are also present in the modelling as described by bulian and francescutto 2013 and bulian et al 2012 2016 3 numerical experiments numerical experiments have been carried out on a sample vessel in the two considered conditions beam and longitudinal regular waves at zero speed in longitudinal waves the head sea condition has been considered the mentioned models have been used and compared with the intention of analysing the level of agreement between predictions from the 6 dof modelling and from the 1 dof modelling 3 1 sample ship the selected ship is a spanish medium sized stern trawler sailing in the great sole bank area in southern ireland it is a two decked vessel with a stern ramp for letting out and reeling in the nets the spanish medium sized trawling fleet is composed of vessels sailing both in spanish atlantic grounds and in e u grounds in irish and u k waters great sole bank area in both cases vessels are similar in size and arrangement being the latter slightly larger vessels according to the latest 2016 spanish fishing fleet statistics published by the spanish ministry of agriculture and fishing mapama 2017 the spanish trawling coastal fleet sailing in atlantic waters is composed of 80 vessels with an average overall length of 28 29 m and an overage gross tonnage of 227 3 gt in the case of the spanish trawling fleet operating in e u grounds great sole bank there are 55 vessels with an average overall length of 32 68 m and an overage gross tonnage of 295 8 gt considering that the vessel selected in this work has an overall length of 34 50 m and a gross tonnage of 332 gt and although it is on the upper range of overall length and gross tonnage values it could be said that it adequately represents the spanish mid sized trawling fleet the typical operation of these vessels include cruising to and from the fishing area and letting out the nets trawling and reeling in at slow speeds no more than 3 to 4 knots headings usually only depend on maximising the amount of possible catches trying to limit weathervaning only to very severe weather conditions this fact makes these vessels potentially prone to experience 2 1 parametric roll resonance in head seas and large roll motions due to 1 1 resonance in beam seas at near zero speeds due to the limited possibility of corrective actions in order to set up the mesh needed for the 6 dof model a 3d model of the vessel was prepared for the sake of better resemblance to the real vessel the rudder and the different superstructures were also included in the geometrical model the vessel bodyplan together with a view of the 3d model are presented in fig 1 the main characteristics of the vessel and the studied loading condition are presented in table 1 the draught under analysis is obtained as a mean of the operational draught range of the vessel while metacentric height was set to the minimum required value 350 mm according to imo 1993 2008a fig 2 shows the still water righting lever curve for the loading condition under analysis computed under the free to trim assumption and taking into account the superstructures shown in fig 1 in addition in fig 2 the euler pitch angle corresponding to each heeling angle is also included in order to set up the nonlinear damping model data from zero speed roll decay tests of a similar vessel have been used although in principle semi empirical methods could be considered for this purpose e g ikeda s method himeno 1981 ikeda et al 1978 kawahara et al 2009 results from realistic data seem to be more reliable than those obtained from these approximations at least for these type of vessels míguez gonzález et al 2015 the applied damping model is of the purely quadratic type and coefficients are reported in table 2 such damping coefficients correspond to a configuration of the vessel without bilge keels which is the configuration used in the present study these coefficients have been directly used in the 1 dof models however in the 6 dof model due to the presence of couplings among different degrees of freedom and due to the presence of multiple sub models a tuning process is necessary in order to fit the numerical roll decay to the target dissipation level to this end the drag coefficient c d x see 12 in the 6 dof cross flow model was assumed to have a uniform value of 0 8 on the centreplane afterwards the linear b 44 l a d d o and quadratic b 44 q a d d o roll damping coefficients of the additional roll damping moment see 13 were manually modified whereas the cubic damping coefficient b 44 c a d d o was not used in the tuning for each couple of tentative coefficients a roll decay was simulated and analysed to obtain the corresponding coefficients μ β and δ such coefficients were then used together with the natural roll frequency ω 0 to analytically calculate ν e a r o l l according to 5 and to compare it with the target value obtained from 5 using the damping coefficients in table 2 fig 3 shows a roll decay and the corresponding dimensionless linear equivalent roll damping coefficient ν e a r o l l compared to the target one after the tuning process as it can be appreciated the results from the tuned numerical roll decay well match the target values regarding the computation of the effective wave slope coefficient to be used in the beam seas 1 dof model four different alternatives have been applied as it has been previously mentioned these include a computation based on linear hydrodynamics bulian and francescutto 2009 2011 accounting for yaw coupling a calculation based on froude krylov roll moment with respect to the centre of gravity and the simplified semi empirical methods proposed by blume 1979 and by the imo weather criterion imo 2008a in fig 4 the results obtained from these four methodologies are presented the first two approaches naturally account for the frequency dependence of the effective wave slope which is therefore reported for the range ω w 0 r a d s to ω w 2 r a d s for the cases of the blume and the imo approaches the effective wave slope coefficient is computed only for the natural roll frequency of the vessel ω 0 0 563 r a d s however while the imo weather criterion method provides a single value the blume method also provides a range around the estimated value it can be noticed that while the effective wave slope coefficient as predicted by the blume method and by using the formulation from the imo weather criterion are close each other the two predictions are sensibly smaller than what can be obtained from the application of a linear hydrodynamic computation finally it is worth underlining that for the considered range of frequencies the froude krylov approach provides a conservative estimation of the effective wave slope coefficient compared to the other tested approaches 3 2 beam sea this section presents and compares roll motion results in regular beam seas as obtained from the considered models three values of wave steepness have been studied for a range of wave frequencies that includes the worst expected situations which will occur in the vicinity of the 1 1 ratio of wave to natural roll frequency in table 3 the tested conditions are presented in fig 5 the results of the expected maximum roll amplitude values obtained by applying the simplified analytical approach according to 4 and using the four different alternatives for the estimation of the effective wave slope coefficient are shown observing the results in fig 5 an estimation of the importance of the methodology chosen for the computation of the effective wave slope coefficient can be made as it can be appreciated the difference in the maximum roll amplitude predicted by the different approximations is quite small in absolute terms for the lowest wave steepness the divergence between the different alternatives starts becoming more noticeable for values of wave steepness over s w 1 50 however the difference is within only 1 6 deg at a steepness s w 1 30 and within only 1 9 deg even at a steepness s w 1 20 it can be also appreciated that roll amplitudes predicted by using the effective wave slope from the blume and imo weather criterion alternatives are almost coincident the same happens among the linear hydrodynamics and the froude krylov approaches this is in line with results reported in fig 4 since damping is the same in all cases fig 5 could therefore be considered to represent a sensitivity analysis of the expected outcome in terms of predicted roll amplitude by the simplified method taking into account the variability of effective wave slope coefficient depending on its prediction method in fig 6 the results of roll motion response are presented the maximum roll amplitude as a function of the frequency ratio obtained for the three different wave steepness with the 1 dof model both absolute and relative angle alternatives and the 6 dof model are reported while in the 1 dof models drifting effects are naturally not taken into account in the 6 dof simulations the vessel was restrained as it is common to do by soft springs and to avoid dynamic interference natural frequencies induced by the soft springs were checked to be well below the tested frequencies from the analysis of these response curves some comments can be made if the response curves corresponding to the minimum analysed wave steepness left figure s w 1 100 are observed it can be appreciated that the predicted amplitudes from the three alternatives are very close each other although those obtained with the 6 dof model are slightly larger than the others in terms of frequency ratio the three models reproduce the larger motions at the same frequency value slightly above ω w ω 0 1 0 with no appreciable response curve bending as the wave steepness is increased s w 1 50 roll motion consequently increases and the differences between the three models also become more noticeable as it can be seen in the central plot in fig 6 the results from the 6 dof model present a slightly higher and broader peak than those from the 1 dof model from the two 1 dof alternatives the absolute angle approach predicts the lowest amplitude while the relative angle approach is between the other two models regarding the shape of the response curve a bending to higher frequencies can be clearly observed in this test case which was not significant in the previous one however differences among the three different models both in amplitude and position of the peak are in the range of 10 and can be considered as relatively small in absolute terms finally in the right plot in fig 6 the results for the largest wave steepness s w 1 30 are presented as it can be appreciated the differences between the three models become much more noticeable now especially between the 6 dof model and the other two not only in the peak amplitude but also in its position and width the bending of the response curve is also larger in the case of the 6 dof the differences between the two alternatives of the 1 dof model although slightly larger than in the previous tests cases are still not very significant overall it is worth underlining that among the 1 dof models the relative angle one shows a tendency closer to the behaviour shown by the 6 dof model in fig 7 the maximum roll amplitudes as obtained from the response curves computed with each model as a function of wave steepness are shown in order to better highlight nonlinear effects the same figure also shows the maximum roll amplitude in radians normalised by the wave slope π s w this summary plot is useful in those cases where the maximum roll amplitude of the vessel is of interest for varying wave steepness and regardless of the frequency ratio at which it occurs like in the weather criterion in addition to the results from the time domain mathematical models results obtained from the analytical approach 4 using the effective wave slope coefficient calculated through linear hydrodynamics are also presented as it can be appreciated for the lowest steepness under consideration the predictions obtained by the three studied alternatives are very close each other moreover also the simplified analytical approximation provides very close results however as the wave steepness increases the difference between the three alternatives increases as well in accordance of course with results in fig 6 among the 1 dof models the one better matching 6 dof results is the relative angle one since the two 1 dof models share the same damping term the observed difference among them can therefore be directly linked with the differences in the restoring forcing terms in fact the 1 dof absolute angle model applies the nonlinear g z function in the restoring term only to the absolute roll angle ϕ keeping the wave forcing as an external sinusoidal forcing ω 0 2 α e f f t see 1 on the other hand in the relative angle model the nonlinear g z function is applied to the difference ϕ α e f f t see 3 if for the sake of explanation it is imagined that g z is described by a polynomial representation it can be immediately understood that the relative angle model implicitly introduces additional terms in the equation of motion compared to the absolute angle model these additional terms eventually influence the dynamics of the system and are the source of the observed differences belenky and sevastianov 2007 and bulian and francescutto 2011 presented in the past discussions following this line of reasoning from a general perspective results in figs 6 and 7 highlight that the 6 dof model tends to show systematically larger peak rolling amplitudes compared to the 1 dof models at all tested steepnesses with differences which increase as the wave steepness increases considering that the peak amplitude of the roll response is loosely speaking the result of the combination of a forcing action and a dissipation action the systematic effect observed from the simulations could be due to the fact that the overall level of dissipation in the 6 dof model during simulations in waves is smaller than the level of dissipation of the 1 dof models due to the fact that the overall forcing due to waves in the 6 dof simulation model is larger than the forcing in the 1 dof models or a combination of these two effects in addition looking at the fact that also the two 1 dof models which are characterised by the same damping term show different outcomes it could also be conjectured that part of the observed differences between the 6 dof model and the 1 dof model could come from the effect of nonlinear froude krylov forces looking at fig 7 it is also interesting to comment that the results from the 1 dof relative angle model are practically coincident with those obtained from the simplified analytical approach for the whole range of studied wave steepnesses this fact is very relevant if some of the proposed approaches are intended to be used during the early design stage of the considered type of vessels in fact whenever only an indication of the largest expected roll motion in regular beam waves is needed for a given design then the use of a simplified analytical approach such as the one used in this case could be almost equivalent to the use of a more complex alternative such as the 1 dof relative angle model on the other hand if the whole frequency response is of interest for a given design a more complex approach shall be used and the observed dispersion of results for the largest tested steepness indicate that caution should be exercised when predicting roll amplitudes for too severe approaches since prediction uncertainty could be non negligible 3 3 longitudinal sea in this section the results of roll motion obtained by using the considered different models in regular head waves are reported six different wave steepness values have been tested with frequency ratios ranging from ω w ω 0 1 5 to ω w ω 0 3 0 and corresponding wave to ship length ratio λ l p p between 0 745 and 2 980 table 4 presents an overview of the tested conditions as it is well known the phenomenon of parametric roll resonance is generated by the effect that wave passing has on the underwater hull geometry of the vessel and subsequently on her righting lever curves and initial stability the typical conditions in which parametric roll resonance is more severe is in wave frequency to natural roll frequency ratios of around ω w ω 0 2 0 and in wavelengths similar to the ship length λ w l p p these conditions are those in which wave passing is typically more effective in promoting the inception of parametric roll as a consequence of the combination of the frequency condition with a sufficiently large magnitude of the restoring variations the magnitude of the parametric roll phenomenon is directly related to the amplitude of the variation of the vessel roll restoring parameters also known as parametric excitation when these occur with the appropriate frequency fig 8 shows the variation of the vessel metacentric height gm t as a function of the longitudinal coordinate of the wave crest along the hull x c for different wave steepness and a wave length λ w l p p in this figure x app represents the longitudinal coordinate of the aft perpendicular of the vessel and l pp is the ship length between perpendiculars fig 9 provides the same information for a wave corresponding to a frequency ratio of ω w ω 0 2 0 the presented data have been obtained applying the two methodologies which have been implemented for the determination of the righting lever in the 1 dof model free trim and fixed trim calculations in case of a wavelength equal to the vessel length fig 8 the maximum metacentric height values coincide with wave crest placed in the vessel perpendiculars i e through amidships while minima occur while wave crest is near amidships in addition the expected relationship between the amplitude of gm t variation and wave steepness can be observed with an increase of the parametric excitation as the wave steepness increases if the results obtained by using the free trim and the fixed trim approach for the calculation of the vessel righting lever in waves are compared it can be appreciated that in terms of amplitude both results are quite similar for the lower steepnesses and variations obtained from the fixed trim approach are slightly larger for the largest steepnesses if the position of the peaks is analysed a light bending and displacement to the right can be noticed in the fixed trim case which is not present in the free trim calculations in any case both alternatives provide very similar outcomes however the similarities among the two calculation approaches reduce if the wavelength under study is increased fig 9 in this case the results obtained for the wavelength λ w 48 615 m corresponding to a frequency ratio of ω w ω 0 2 0 in free and fixed trim conditions are noticeably different on the one hand fixed trim variations of metacentric height are larger than free trim ones for all wave steepnesses on the other hand regarding the peak positions a large shift to the right can be observed in the fixed trim case finally and especially for the largest steepnesses fixed trim curves of gm t as a function of the wave crest position present wider peaks than those obtained from the free trim calculations in addition to the gm t variation due to wave passing for a fixed wave length and different wave crest positions and steepnesses as shown in figs 8 and 9 in fig 10 the variation of gm t due to the effect of waves as a function of wavelength and frequency ratio for the different values of wave steepness and for the free to trim and fixed trim methodologies is presented moreover in fig 11 the mean gm t in waves as a function of wavelength and frequency ratio for the different wave steepnesses and for the free to trim and fixed trim methodologies is included as it can be appreciated from these figures the variation of gm t in waves tend to be larger in the fixed trim case and this difference becomes more noticeable as wavelength is increased regarding mean gm t in waves a similar behaviour could be observed and the difference between the fixed trim approach and the free trim one becomes very large as wave length and wave steepness increase the patterns shown in figs 8 and 9 for the metacentric height are reflected by the righting lever curves in waves as an example the gz curves both free and fixed trim for the wave condition with largest steepness and wavelength equal to ship length λ w l p p s w 1 15 are shown in fig 12 as colour plots as a function of wave crest position and roll angle as it can be appreciated in the case of free trim the maximum gz values are associated to a wave crest position close to the vessel perpendiculars wave through amidships while minimum values are placed when it is around a 40 of the wavelength from the aft perpendicular these wave crest positions basically coincide with those observed for minimum and maximum metacentric height in fig 8 in the case of fixed trim larger values of maximum gz are observed in comparison to the free trim case although the positions of these maxima are similar to those on the free trim case the minimum values are shifted up to a position at around 60 of the ship length from the aft perpendicular this pattern could also be observed in fig 8 where the presence of a bending to the right of the gm t curves as a function of the wave crest position was already highlighted in addition to this a shifting of the minimum values to wave crest positions closer to the aft perpendicular at large roll angles can be observed this behaviour is not present in the free trim calculations where minima occur approximately at the same position almost independently of roll angle in addition to gm t and gz data in waves which have been described fig 13 shows the normalised variation of km t due to wave passing for different values of wavelength and steepness in the free trim case these curves provide information regarding the amplitude of the variation of the transverse stability characteristics of the vessel for given wave condition normalised by using the wave amplitude these values can be considered to represent a sort of approximate numerical transfer function between wave excitation and parametric excitation while a semi analytical approach for their calculation was presented in the past by dunwoody 1989 as it can be observed the influence of wave steepness on the magnitude of normalised km t variation is noticeable only in the vicinity of a wavelength similar to vessel length that is where maximum values occur it is noted that additional relative maxima also take place at wavelengths close to 12 m around 40 of the ship length between perpendiculars although their amplitude is noticeably lower than that of the absolute ones it is however to point out that for the vessel used in this study the observed almost linear dependence of the variation of km t from the wave steepness for the considered waves could be associated with the fact that the considered vessel has a large freeboard however in case of fishing vessels characterised by small freeboard and depending on the considered wave amplitudes the linear modelling could fail to properly represent the variation of km t in waves in such cases a more general nonlinear dependence based on direct calculations should be accounted for fig 13 also reports the largest value of normalised km t variation for a wave frequency of ω w 2 ω 0 λ w 48 615 m which corresponds to the lowest wave steepness s w 1 200 this value has been conservatively taken to correspond to the f 1 factor in the simplified methodology see 8 for predicting roll motion amplitude under parametric roll conditions in head seas results from the application of the simplified methodology are shown in fig 14 the figure shows the predicted rolling amplitude as a function of wave steepness for a wave frequency ω w 2 ω 0 as it can be observed roll motion under parametric roll starts developing above the inception threshold which in this case corresponds to a wave steepness slightly higher than s w 1 200 for larger steepnesses the roll motion amplitude grows up linearly with the steepness up to more than 50 degrees at s w 1 20 the linear increase of roll as predicted by the simplified methodology is a direct consequence of the assumption of linear plus quadratic roll damping model if a cubic roll damping term was added the predicted roll amplitude would show a reduced grow rate for larger steepnesses it is also important to recall that the simplified methodology 8 neglects the effect of nonlinearities in the restoring term since nonlinearities of the restoring typically lead to a shifting of the peak of the parametrically excited roll response curve as the excitation and thus the amplitude of roll increases this effect is not captured by the simplified methodology 8 comparisons of predicted roll motion in regular head seas obtained by using the 6 dof and the 1 dof models free and fixed trim gz calculation are presented in fig 15 where the roll amplitude is plotted against ω w ω 0 ratio for the six tested wave steepness similarly to the case of beam waves also in this case the 1 dof naturally enforce the zero speed mean zero yaw condition in order to achieve a similar situation also in case of 6 dof simulations soft restraints were added in particular the ship is restrained by two elastic lines connected on one end at the ship bow at the calm water draught and fixed to the earth fixed reference frame on the other end in a v shaped configuration the elastic lines produce force when in traction but do not produce force in case of compression similarly to elastic lines used in real experiments similar elastic lines where not connected at the stern since due to the zero speed and head sea condition this was found not necessary and it was therefore preferred to reduce at minimum the number and thus the influence of the restrain system as it can be appreciated from fig 15 in the s w 1 200 case the only model which shows appreciable roll motion is the 1 dof fixed trim one mainly due to the fact that the parametric excitation in this case as was shown in figs 9 and 10 is larger almost doubled than that of the 1 dof free trim model it can also be noted that the peak amplitude occurs at ω w ω 0 2 due to the fact that for small rolling amplitude gz is well approximated by its linear approximation and hence no roll response bending occurs as the wave steepness is increased the roll amplitudes predicted by the three models increase as well up to a wave steepness of s w 1 50 the response curves obtained from the 1 dof model with free trim and the 6 dof model are almost coincident on the other hand the amplitudes predicted by the 1 dof fixed trim model are systematically larger and the unstable area in this case is also wider than for the 6 dof and 1 dof free trim models these are consequences of the larger parametric excitation in the fixed trim 1 dof model as can be observed also in fig 10 as the predicted roll amplitudes increase the effect of the gz nonlinearities can be appreciated in the bending to the right higher wave frequencies of the response curves this is a characteristic which is obtained with all the models which is in line with the hardening calm water restoring and which increases with the roll amplitude as gz nonlinearities become more relevant if the wave steepness is further increased s w 1 30 a different behaviour is observed for each of the models in the low frequency long waves range left part of the plot the inception of parametric roll starts nearly at the same frequency ratio for the three models and the predicted roll amplitudes remain very similar up to a frequency ratio of approximately ω w ω 0 2 0 for larger frequencies the predicted roll amplitudes start diverging being the highest those predicted by the 1 dof fixed trim model and the smallest those from the 6 dof model finally a third different behaviour is observed for the highest wave steepnesses s w 1 20 and s w 1 15 in these cases although the inception frequency ratios of parametric roll are quite similar in the 6 dof model and 1 dof model with free trim the parametric roll inception range is sensibly shifted to higher frequencies in the 1 dof fixed trim case and this is particularly noticeable for the highest tested wave steepness up to a frequency ratio around ω w ω 0 2 0 the response curves for the 6 dof model and the 1 dof free trim model remain quite close similarly to what has been previously observed however also in this case response curves start to diverge for higher frequencies while the 6 dof model tends to saturate and the maximum roll amplitude does not increase much as the wave steepness is increased the roll amplitude predicted by the 1 dof free trim model continues increasing with wave steepness at the same time the maximum roll predicted by the 1 dof fixed trim model tends to show a stronger saturation effect compared to the free trim one eventually the response curves of both alternatives of the 1 dof model reach similar maxima and have approximately the same shape in the region of frequencies from around ω w ω 0 2 3 and above regarding the instability areas they are similar in width when comparing the 6 dof and the 1 dof free trim models although that of the latter is slightly shifted to higher frequencies however the instability area obtained using the 1 dof fixed trim model is noticeably narrower at the largest wave steepness such behaviour however is associated with the indirect effect of the variation of mean gm t in waves the variation of mean gm t in waves gm t m e a n w if compared to the nominal one in calm water can be considered to basically correspond to a change of the reference natural frequency of the vessel which is relevant for the determination of the tuning ratio this reference natural frequency when wave effects are taken into consideration ω 0 w becomes 14 ω 0 w ω 0 g m t m e a n w g m t as a result the nominal tuning ratio ω w ω 0 which is normally used for plotting the results is no longer a good approximation of the actual tuning ratio in waves ω w ω 0 w it is also to be noted that the actual amplitude of parametric excitation is δ gm t gm t m e a n w and this quantity depends on both the wave length and the wave steepness which is further affecting the observed behaviour finally again the effect of gz nonlinearity can be observed in the bending to higher frequencies of the roll amplitude curves from the three models in fig 16 the maximum roll amplitudes obtained with the three models for the six tested wave steepnesses are compared this figure is useful for analysing the maximum expected roll amplitudes in head waves without focussing on the wave frequency at which this maximum occurs for sake of comparison the results obtained with the simplified analytical approach based on the mathieu equation with nonlinear damping have also been included observing the results reported in fig 16 it can be seen that the values obtained with the fixed trim 1 dof model are the highest from the three approaches in the whole range of wave steepness as it has been already mentioned regarding the other two models the results obtained with the free trim 1 dof model are very similar to those obtained with the 6 dof in the lowest range of wave steepnesses however the difference between these two models becomes larger as wave steepness increases and for the highest values of wave steepness the results from the free trim 1 dof model are in line with those of the fixed trim approach the simplified approximation accurately tracks the results of the more complex models in the low range of wave steepnesses especially those of the 1 dof free trim one as the applied f 1 transfer function has been determined in line with this model for low steepnesses due to the increased level of parametric excitation the 1 dof fixed trim model shows instead an earlier build up of roll however as wave steepness increases the simplified methodology which neglects the nonlinearities of roll restoring predicts much larger amplitudes than those obtained by any of the proposed models this confirms the importance of restoring nonlinearities in determining the amplitude of parametrically excited roll motion in regular waves it is interesting to note that contrary to what was observed in the beam sea case compare with fig 7 here in the head sea case the 6 dof model tends to show the smallest maximum roll amplitudes with the exception of the two smallest tested wave steepnesses where however the 6 dof model shows results which are only marginally larger than the 1 dof free trim model although it was not possible to identify a clear source for the observed behaviour of the 6 dof model with respect to the 1 dof ones some aspects could be linked with the observed outcomes one point is that the 6 dof model takes into account the actual dynamics of heave and pitch whereas the 1 dof free trim model considers them quasi statically and the 1 dof fixed trim model considers only heave quasi statically and fixes the trim another source of differences could be the fact that the 6 dof model provides an explicit dynamic coupling between all relevant degrees of freedom instead in the 1 dof models this dynamic coupling effect is neglected or it is approximately accounted for in an implicit way coupling between sway roll and yaw it is also possible that as a result of the differences in modelling and as a result of coupling the 6 dof approach in the simulations in waves is associated with a dissipation level which eventually differs from that of the 1 dof models 4 discussion and final remarks the limitations in cost time and a simplified regulatory framework usually limit the application of too complex tools within the design process of fishing vessels however the inception of parametric roll in longitudinal waves or excessive roll motions in beam seas are well known phenomena which could affect the operational safety of this type of vessels the application of simple models could therefore help in addressing the risk stemming from these phenomena within the mentioned practical constraints the main objective of this paper was therefore to compare the performance of simplified 1 dof models as well as very simplified analytical formulations with respect to outcomes from more complex 6 dof high fidelity blended modelling for analysing the vulnerability of the vessel to parametric roll resonance and large motions in beam seas such comparison was carried out to analyse the suitability of the former methods to be used during the early design stages where the application of any stability analysis tool should fulfil some requirements of reduced cost time and complexity and 6 dof codes are therefore out of the scope this is particularly true in the case of fishing vessels which are the specific target of the present study to this end the roll motion response of a mid sized trawler at zero speed and for regular beam and head waves with different steepness and frequencies was analysed by applying a state of the art 6 dof model and different simplified nonlinear 1 dof models for the 1 dof modelling two methodologies were applied in the beam waves case absolute and relative angle modelling for the excitation and restoring terms and another two in the longitudinal waves case based on fixed trim and free trim calculation of righting lever in waves in addition to this two very simplified analytical expressions to compute the maximum expected roll amplitude both in longitudinal and beam regular waves have been also applied 4 1 beam waves condition harmonic resonance the obtained results show that for the case of beam seas even the simplest fully analytical approach which was applied based on linear restoring and nonlinear damping could be considered as well reproducing the outcomes from the most complex alternative if only an estimation of the maximum roll amplitude is needed the estimation of the maximum roll amplitude could be very useful for example to reduce the risk of flooding through open doors or through progressive flooding points which are known to be very likely causes of fishing vessel accidents ciaim 2014 wolfson unit 2004 in this case the use of the simplified analytical approach could already help in applying possible corrective measures to the vessel design aimed at avoiding or at least reducing these issues this approach is also in line with the background theory of the existing weather criterion if the whole response curve is of interest then the 1 dof model based on a relative angle approach provided the closest results to the 6 dof model the differences in the predictions were larger as the forcing wave steepness increased in addition to the above it is worth making some comments regarding the estimation of the effective wave slope coefficient which is needed in both of the simplified methodologies the main approach applied in this work for the determination of such coefficient which has been proved in the past to be effective and theoretically justifiable is based on linear hydrodynamics however such methodology requires linear hydrodynamic data which might not available in case of typical fishing vessels design unless seakeeping calculations are carried out simplified alternatives have also been investigated which are based on direct froude krylov pressure integration or semi empirical formulae for the tested case the froude krylov approach could be a good balance between simplicity and accuracy in fact it allows providing a frequency dependent effective wave slope function and in the range of frequencies of interest for the study it was conservative with respect to the approach based on linear hydrodynamics on the other hand semi empirical methodologies provided effective wave slope coefficients only at the roll natural frequency which were also non conservative with respect to the other tested methodologies 4 2 longitudinal waves condition parametric roll regarding parametric roll resonance the situation is different with respect to that discussed above for the beam sea case the very simplified analytical approach used herein based on linear time dependent roll restoring and accounting for nonlinearities only in damping proved to be unsuitable for predicting the rolling amplitudes above parametric roll threshold apart from regions of very small steepnesses for moderate large wave steepness the use of at least a 1 dof model was necessary for the tested case if only the maximum roll amplitudes are needed the use of the 1 dof fixed trim model represented for the tested case a conservative and thus on the safe side approach compared to the 6 dof model in fact the former overpredicted roll motion in comparison to the latter in the whole range of wave steepnesses if the details of the roll response curve are of interest the 1 dof free trim model showed closer results to the blended 6 dof code although the observed differences increased for larger wave steepnesses 4 3 practical implementation from the point of view of implementation some comments can be made for the beam sea case if the 1 dof time domain methodology is considered the implementation of the model requires the computation of the gz curves in still water the prediction of the effective wave slope coefficient and the vessel roll damping the 1 dof approach is of course much more affordable in terms of required technical skills time and cost if compared to the use of blended 6 dof tools the implementation of the fully analytical simplified approach is even simpler only needing the effective wave slope coefficient and the equivalent roll damping although the computation of effective wave slope coefficient through linear hydrodynamics is likely too complex considering the typical fishing vessel design routine the use of the simplified froude krylov approach is a much easier alternative once the hull geometry and the vessel loading condition are available as it is always the case during design stages following these considerations it can then be stated that the implementation of these models 1 dof time domain model and fully analytical method within typical existing tools does not present any serious difficulty and will be a very straightforward process for the longitudinal sea case the evaluation of parametric roll on the basis of the 1 dof model requires the computation of several surfaces of gz for different waves although these are relatively simple computations they require a naval architecture software which is capable of performing them in a properly automated way this is a level of complexity higher than the calculations of righting lever in calm water as it is not usually built in in standard software and therefore makes the whole process of setting up the 1 dof model for parametric roll more time consuming than that for the beam waves case although the implementation of the analytical approach is much simpler its performance as it has been already discussed is far from satisfactory for most of the tested conditions 4 4 final remarks considering the envisioned practical application of the proposed alternatives it could therefore be concluded that simple models can provide reasonable predictions with much lower effort compared to the use of the more complex 6 dof tool in the initial stages of the vessel design however their real applicability as typical is largely dependent on their implementation in a self contained software application with a user friendly interface and high level of automation simplifying therefore the process of model setting up and use this is an aspect which is particularly important in the case of fishing vessels design for obtaining realistic roll predictions accurate roll damping information is necessary and this is valid of course for both the beam sea case as well as for the longitudinal sea case use of damping coefficients from a similar vessel application of analytical methods or even the use of a real vessel roll decay test could be different alternatives for obtaining these data at the moment however there seems to be no widespread and accepted methodologies for this purpose which are applicable to fishing vessels and research is therefore needed in this respect finally it has to be indicated that this study is limited to one single vessel and therefore its conclusions cannot be extended to the whole fishing fleet where different typologies and sizes may be found nevertheless in case the maritime authorities would undertake a major review of the fishing vessels stability regulatory framework to incorporate direct assessment approaches the basis established in this work would be of direct application acknowledgements part of the present work was carried out during a research visit at

23698,this paper studies the dynamic stability of a positively buoyant autonomous underwater vehicle auv in vertical plane for a level flight dynamic stability of underwater vehicles is estimated by using the linearized equations of motion about an equilibrium position auv is a slow moving and positively buoyant vehicle that enhances the stabilizing effect of the restoring forces hence a more general approach is required for the evaluation of stability a 3 dof model for trajectory simulation for level depth trajectories is used to study the effect of positive buoyancy on vehicle trajectory at different speeds the relative importance of the damping restoring and control forces acting on the vehicle is established the stability analysis is undertaken using linearized equations of motion considering the nonlinearities due to positive buoyancy numerical studies are carried out to estimate the fixed points of the system and eigenvalues at different forward speeds metacentric heights and positive buoyancy for a level depth the study shows that the stability changes from oscillatory to a steady node at a transition speed that depends on the metacentric height the positive buoyancy has

the eigen values of j λi indicate the stability of the system the system is stable if re λi 0 and unstable if re λi 0 further if im λi 0 the system would oscillate and approach the equilibrium the formulations stated above were applied on the flatfish auv whose particulars are given in table 1 the hydrodynamic coefficients of the vehicle are given in table 2 considering that the effect of restoring forces are more pronounced at lower speeds the calculations were undertaken for a nominal x velocity of 0 5 1 5 m s metacentric height bg 5 25 mm and positive buoyancy b of 2 8 kg the pitch sternplane angle and eigen values of the jacobian are plotted for different forward speeds the pitch of the vehicle for different speeds are presented in figs 8 23 and sternplane angle is presented in figs 24 39 the values obtained by trajectory simulation model described in section 2 model 1 is compared with the values obtained by the stability analysis model presented in section 4 model 2 the values show reasonable agreement the eigenvalues of the jacobian representing the stability of the vehicle is presented in figs 40 55 5 discussions of the results a trajectory simulation model available in literature is applied to a flatfish auv for constant depth trajectory the simulation results compare well with the free running trials of the vehicle as presented in fig 2 fig 3 the simulation results for a speed of 0 99 m s up to the limit of the sternplane angle of 20 deg fig 4 present a similar result for a speed of 1 5 m s fig 5 presents the steady state pitch angle as the pitch is non zero a force would be generated and is represented as the damping force zww fig 6 indicates the steady sternplane angle for different buoyancies the sternplane angle reaches 18 deg for a speed of 0 99 m s at a positive buoyancy of 10 kgs while it is 14 kg at 1 5 m s this shows that there is a speed dependent limit for the positive buoyancy of an underwater vehicle for level flight considering the limitations of the control surface angles fig 5 indicates that the limits of the control surface are reached faster at lower speeds fig 7 a j present the coriolis and centripetal damping restoring and control forces for two speeds and up to the maximum practical positive buoyancy the estimates indicate that the significant forces are the damping restoring and control forces as the damping and control forces are speed dependent the stabilizing effect of the restoring forces are more pronounced particularly at lower speeds further as presented in fig 4 it is observed that the pitch of the vehicle is small and the variation in pitch with speed has a marginal effect on the restoring forces stability analysis is undertaken using the linearized model presented in section 4 the steady state pitch and sternplane angle for different speeds and buoyancies and bg is presented in figs 8 23 and figs 24 39 respectively the values show a good agreement with the values obtained from trajectory simulation presented in section 2 fig 56 shows the sternplane for different bg and buoyancies while fig 57 shows the steady state pitch for a nominal speed of 0 5 m s it can be observed that a higher positive buoyancy would result in a higher sternplane angle and higher pitch further for the same buoyancy and nominal speed it can be observed that a higher metacentric height reduces the sternplane angle and increases the pitch angle figs 40 55 present the real and imaginary eigenvalues for various forward speeds at different bg and buoyancies as seen in the figures the real part of the eigenvalues is negative indicating stability however as the forward speed increases a pair of real eigenvalues branch out while the imaginary values converge to zero at a transition forward speed ut this indicates that the nature of stability changes i e for speeds less than the transition speed any perturbation would result in an oscillatory behaviour before reaching a stable equilibrium while for speeds greater than the transition speed any deviation from the critical speed would result in a stiff approach to the equilibrium from fig 58 it can be observed that the positive buoyancy has marginal effect on the transition speed thus for the requirement of a higher positive buoyancy with the same limits of the sternplane angle the metacentric height has to be increased 6 conclusions this work discusses the stability of a positively buoyant underwater vehicle travelling at a constant forward speed and depth a steady depth path can be achieved by a positively buoyant vehicle by the balance of the restoring control and damping force a simulation for a flatfish auv undertaken using 3 dof equations of motion indicate the control forces contribute more to the force balance than the damping force at low speeds further considering the limiting angle of the sternplane of 20 it is possible to establish a limit for maximum positive buoyancy that is speed dependent for the vehicle under study for the speeds considered i e 0 99 m s and 1 5 m s the maximum positive buoyancy were 10 kgs and 14 kgs respectively the stability of the system can be undertaken by eigenvalue analysis of the system of equations considering heave pitch coupling with positive buoyancy and nonzero bg for the specific case under study a calculation undertaken at positive buoyancies up to 8 kgs and metacetric height of 5 25 mm show that a pair of complex eigen values collapse into real values and three negative distinct real values appear at a transition speed in this case 0 6 0 70 and 0 78 m s for a bg of 15 20 and 25 mm respectively this indicate that in case of a perturbation from equilibrium beyond this speed the nature of stability changes from oscillatory to a steady approach to the equilibrium condition as shown above this speed is influenced by the metacentric height while buoyancy has only a marginal influence on the speed on conclusion it is surmised that for slow moving underwater vehicle typical of auvs the buoyancy influences the speed at which the control surfaces approach their limiting angle within that speed the vehicle is stable further examining the nature of stability at lower speeds the study indicates that the stability changes from oscillatory to steady approach to equilibrium at a certain speed which is higher for a higher metacentric height a model with nonlinearities arising due to positive buoyancy is only used for stability analysis future work may involve validation of the analysis by trials and stability analysis considering nonlinearities of damping coefficients

using the linearized equations of motion about an equilibrium position auv is a slow moving and positively buoyant vehicle that enhances the stabilizing effect of the restoring forces hence a more general approach is required for the evaluation of stability a 3 dof model for trajectory simulation for level depth trajectories is used to study the effect of positive buoyancy on vehicle trajectory at different speeds the relative importance of the damping restoring and control forces acting on the vehicle is established the stability analysis is undertaken using linearized equations of motion considering the nonlinearities due to positive buoyancy numerical studies are carried out to estimate the fixed points of the system and eigenvalues at different forward speeds metacentric heights and positive buoyancy for a level depth the study shows that the stability changes from oscillatory to a steady node at a transition speed that depends on the metacentric height the positive buoyancy has marginal effect on the transition speed but influences the sternplane angles and pitch of the vehicle keywords underwater vehicle positive buoyancy simulation stability eigen value analysis

challenges in stability evaluation as they are reconfigurable slow moving and positively buoyant many auvs have freely floodable spaces enabling reconfiguration of the vehicle for different mission specific payloads these results in variation of buoyancy and metacentric height of the vehicle further they move at very low speeds of 0 5 6 knots this makes the velocity related damping forces smaller making the contribution of the buoyancy dependent restoring forces important hence any stability evaluation has to account for the restoring forces due to positive buoyancy and variation in metacentric height further the practical limitation of the angle of incidence of the sternplanes for depth control limit the maximum control forces available in the system to compensate for the

surfaces for a given speed to analyse the stability of the system the speed is taken constant and two degrees of freedom i e heave and pitch is considered a stability analysis of the system considering the forces due to buoyancy is presented in this section consider an auv moving with a constant forward velocity u the linearized form of the auv equations of motion for two degrees of

the eigen values of j λi indicate the stability of the system the system is stable if re λi 0 and unstable if re λi 0 further if im λi 0 the system would oscillate and approach the equilibrium the formulations stated above were applied on the flatfish auv whose particulars are given in table 1 the hydrodynamic coefficients of the vehicle are given in table 2 considering that the effect of restoring forces are more pronounced at lower speeds the calculations were undertaken for a nominal x velocity of 0 5 1 5 m s metacentric height bg 5 25 mm and positive buoyancy b of 2 8 kg the pitch sternplane angle and eigen values of the jacobian are plotted for different forward speeds the pitch of the vehicle for different speeds are presented in figs 8 23 and sternplane angle is presented in figs 24 39 the values obtained by trajectory simulation model described in section 2 model 1 is compared with the values obtained by the stability analysis model presented in section 4 model 2 the values show reasonable agreement the eigenvalues of the jacobian representing the stability of the vehicle is presented in figs 40 55 5 discussions of the results a trajectory simulation model available in literature is applied to a flatfish auv for constant depth trajectory the simulation results compare well with the free running trials of the vehicle as presented in fig 2 fig 3 the simulation results for a speed of 0 99 m s up to the limit of the sternplane angle of 20 deg fig 4 present a similar result for a speed of 1 5 m s fig 5 presents the steady state pitch angle as the pitch is non zero a force would be generated and is represented as the damping force zww fig 6 indicates the steady sternplane angle for different buoyancies the sternplane angle reaches 18 deg for a speed of 0 99 m s at a positive buoyancy of 10 kgs while it is 14 kg at 1 5 m s this shows that there is a speed dependent limit for the positive buoyancy of an underwater vehicle for level flight considering the limitations of the control surface angles fig 5 indicates that the limits of the control surface are reached faster at lower speeds fig 7 a j present the coriolis and centripetal damping restoring and control forces for two speeds and up to the maximum practical positive buoyancy the estimates indicate that the significant forces are the damping restoring and control forces as the damping and control forces are speed dependent the stabilizing effect of the restoring forces are more pronounced particularly at lower speeds further as presented in fig 4 it is observed that the pitch of the vehicle is small and the variation in pitch with speed has a marginal effect on the restoring forces stability analysis is undertaken using the linearized model presented in section 4 the steady state pitch and sternplane angle for different speeds and buoyancies and bg is presented in figs 8 23 and figs 24 39 respectively the values show a good agreement with the values obtained from trajectory simulation presented in section 2 fig 56 shows the sternplane for different bg and buoyancies while fig 57 shows the steady state pitch for a nominal speed of 0 5 m s it can be observed that a higher positive buoyancy would result in a higher sternplane angle and higher pitch further for the same buoyancy and nominal speed it can be observed that a higher metacentric height reduces the sternplane angle and increases the pitch angle figs 40 55 present the real and imaginary eigenvalues for various forward speeds at different bg and buoyancies as seen in the figures the real part of the eigenvalues is negative indicating stability however as the forward speed increases a pair of real eigenvalues branch out while the imaginary values converge to zero at a transition forward speed ut this indicates that the nature of stability changes i e for speeds less than the transition speed any perturbation would result in an oscillatory behaviour before reaching a stable equilibrium while for speeds greater than the transition speed any deviation from the critical speed would result in a stiff approach to the equilibrium from fig 58 it can be observed that the positive buoyancy has marginal effect on the transition speed thus for the requirement of a higher positive buoyancy with the same limits of the sternplane angle the metacentric height has to be increased 6 conclusions this work discusses the stability of a positively buoyant underwater vehicle travelling at a constant forward speed and depth a steady depth path can be achieved by a positively buoyant vehicle by the balance of the restoring control and damping force a simulation for a flatfish auv undertaken using 3 dof equations of motion indicate the control forces contribute more to the force balance than the damping force at low speeds further considering the limiting angle of the sternplane of 20 it is possible to establish a limit for maximum positive buoyancy that is speed dependent for the vehicle under study for the speeds considered i e 0 99 m s and 1 5 m s the maximum positive buoyancy were 10 kgs and 14 kgs respectively the stability of the system can be undertaken by eigenvalue analysis of the system of equations considering heave pitch coupling with positive buoyancy and nonzero bg for the specific case under study a calculation undertaken at positive buoyancies up to 8 kgs and metacetric height of 5 25 mm show that a pair of complex eigen values collapse into real values and three negative distinct real values appear at a transition speed in this case 0 6 0 70 and 0 78 m s for a bg of 15 20 and 25 mm respectively this indicate that in case of a perturbation from equilibrium beyond this speed the nature of stability changes from oscillatory to a steady approach to the equilibrium condition as shown above this speed is influenced by the metacentric height while buoyancy has only a marginal influence on the speed on conclusion it is surmised that for slow moving underwater vehicle typical of auvs the buoyancy influences the speed at which the control surfaces approach their limiting angle within that speed the vehicle is stable further examining the nature of stability at lower speeds the study indicates that the stability changes from oscillatory to steady approach to equilibrium at a certain speed which is higher for a higher metacentric height a model with nonlinearities arising due to positive buoyancy is only used for stability analysis future work may involve validation of the analysis by trials and stability analysis considering nonlinearities of damping coefficients 
23699,the paper focuses on design and selection of mooring systems for floating offshore wind turbines fowts for intermediate and deep water depths based on ultimate accidental and fatigue limit state design conditions with reference to power production parked wind turbine and mooring line fault conditions platform static and dynamic offsets are determined by a purposely developed 6dof programme in the frequency domain accounting for first and second order motions the dutch tri floater platform together with the well known 5 mw nrel wind turbine is assumed as reference design besides two sites the one in the southern north sea near dogger bank on water depths ranging from 50 up to 80 m the other one in the northern north sea near the troll field area on water depths ranging from 200 up to 350 m are assumed as candidate deployment areas to investigate the effect of i line number ii platform admissible offset and line scope iii offshore onshore planned maintenance inspections and iv mooring technology on relevant installation and maintenance costs a preliminary cost analysis is also performed and some recommendations are given to correctly choice the most suitable mooring configuration as a function of water depth keywords floating offshore wind turbines mooring system design chain cables southern and northern north sea 1 introduction during the last decade offshore wind energy was one of the fastest growing maritime sectors with a total installed capacity expected to reach 40 gw by 2020 and 150 gw by 2030 meeting 4 and 14 of the eu total electricity consumption ewea 2013 the trend leads to increase both power and number of wind turbines moving production farms from shallow to intermediate deep waters requiring specialized substructures to harvest the promising offshore market potential provided that current commercial substructures such as monopiles gravity based foundations tripods and jackets are economically limited to 40 50 m water depths nevertheless even if intermediate deep water offshore designs are expected to be competitive in terms of levelised cost of energy lcoe with bottom fixed support structures current technology is still in a pre commercial phase as research activities in the field started in the mid 1990s and the first two full scale floating offshore wind turbine fowt prototypes have been deployed only recently the former off the island of karmøy north of stavanger the latter 5 km off the portuguese coast of aguçadoura currently fowts exhibit different configurations mainly depending on water depth in intermediate water depths from 50 up to 120 m tension leg platforms and semi submersible support structures are the most common designs while in deep waters beyond 120 m spar type configurations seem to represent the most feasible choice even if semisubmersible structures have been in any case proposed as an alternative design as concerns the semi submersible configuration for intermediate water depths one of the first comprehensive studies was carried out within the drijfwind project bulder et al 2002 with the main aim of developing a preliminary design for a candidate deployment site in the southern north sea on 50 m water depth off the netherland continental shelf the structure with a tri floater configuration was provided with large heave plates at the bottom of each column and a conventional hybrid six line mooring system recently principle power roddier et al 2010 and deepcwind consortium robertson et al 2014 developed similarly shaped configurations with 3 line conventional moorings for two candidate deployment sites on intermediate and deep water depths respectively in the same years several feasibility studies have been performed to investigate the economic viability of offshore wind power production and optimize the design of both support structures and mooring systems in this respect sclavounos et al 2008 carried out a parametric study focusing on different mooring technologies for several candidate designs namely tension leg platforms spar type and barge configurations on different water depths fylling and berthelsen 2011 proposed an integrated tool to optimize the design of spar type support structures including mooring systems and power take off cables brommundt et al 2012 developed a new tool devoted to the optimization of catenary mooring systems for semi submersible structures deployed at two candidate sites located in the north sea namely greater ekofirsk area and troll field on 75 and 330 m water depths respectively benassai et al 2014a b 2015 optimized the catenary mooring systems of fowts with tri floater support structure for three candidate sites in the southern mediterranean sea at different water depths from 50 up to 300 m focusing on symmetric and asymmetric patterns and different mooring technologies namely chain cables and steel wire ropes finally hall et al 2014 developed an alternative form of support structure optimization problem abstracting from geometry details and focusing on hydrodynamic performance coefficients to provide a more complete and intuitive exploration of the design space the growing interest in exploiting offshore wind resources on intermediate and deep water depths is also proved by the variety of rules and guidelines provided in the last years by several classification societies namely american bureau of shipping abs 2015 bureau veritas bv 2015 and det norske veritas dnv 2014 among others particularly current rules for the offshore wind energy sector furnish criteria for design construction installation and survey of permanently sited installations focusing on three main topics i support structures ii station keeping systems and iii onboard machinery and equipment including safety and lifesaving appliances besides despite of current codes for the offshore oil and gas industry the so called environmental class approach is applied as fowts are expected to be mass produced units which implies that several locations with fairly similar metocean conditions can be grouped together reducing design installation and maintenance costs furthermore structural safety is ensured by the so called safety class method so as all structural elements including mooring system are designed to meet assigned target safety levels defined in terms of collapse consequences and annual failure probabilities due to the novelty of this research field the paper focuses on design and selection criteria of mooring systems for fowts with semi submersible support structure on intermediate and deep water depths in this respect following the main outcomes of past researches the choice of i line type number and scope ii platform admissible offset and iii type of planned maintenance inspections that in turn influence the expected mooring lifetime represents a basic issue to minimize the mooring weight and reduce the overall installation costs hence in the paper the following main subjects are fully investigated and discussed i the incidence of platform admissible offset line number and offshore onshore maintenance inspections on mooring scantlings is systematically investigated at different water depths as various design strategies for mooring systems of fowts have been applied in the past by different researchers bulder et al 2002 sclavounos et al 2008 fylling and berthelsen 2011 brommundt et al 2012 benassai et al 2014a b 2015 in this respect it must be pointed out that the choice of platform admissible offset and line number strongly differs from the common design procedure generally applied for semisubmersible offshore structures in the oil gas industry due to the greater incidence of wind loads in harsh weather conditions and couplings between wave and wind components hence the choice of proper design parameters reveals to be quite challenging as mooring weight and stationkeeping redundancy in case of failure of one mooring line mainly depend on platform admissible offset and line number respectively furthermore offshore onshore maintenance inspections also play a fundamental role in the assessment of mooring life which has not been fully investigated till now provided that fowts are devoted to mass production differently from offshore structures operating into the oil gas sector which implies that all strategies devoted to possible savings of maintenance activities have to be undertaken ii minimum weight configurations are identified and a preliminary cost analysis is performed to investigate the incidence of water depth on mooring installation costs as the levelised cost of energy of fowts mainly depends on installation expenses related to support structure wind turbine and mooring system in this respect no many theoretical works have been performed on the argument and the topic needs to be further analysed to investigate the incidence of different design strategies on mooring scantling and installation costs iii some recommendations are provided to speed up the design and selection process of mooring systems for fowts and detect the minimum weight configuration as a function of water depth particularly it must be pointed out that no many research activities have been carried out in the past to provide some guidelines for mooring design of fowts that generally differs from the design procedure commonly applied for semisubmersible offshore structures operating in the oil gas industry mainly due to different issues related to mass production and wave wind load couplings the dutch tri floater platform bulder et al 2002 coupled with the 5 mw nrel wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 is assumed as reference design for two candidate deployment sites the former located in the southern north sea west of dogger bank on water depths ranging from 50 up to 80 m the latter in the northern north sea near the troll field area on water depths ranging from 200 up to 350 m finally platform motion analysis is carried out in the frequency domain by a dedicated programme developed in matlab mathworks 2014 and mainly based on de coupling of static wave and low frequency motions 2 mooring design criteria 2 1 station keeping requirements in current analysis ultimate uls accidental als and fatigue fls limit state design criteria provided by the offshore standard dnv os j103 dnv 2013 and mainly based on the safety class approach are applied for design and selection of mooring systems for fowts in this respect redundant station keeping systems shall be designed according to normal safety class requirements based on 10 4 annual failure probability while non redundant configurations shall comply with high safety class levels corresponding to 10 5 annual failure probability reflecting the increased risk should the support structure face to disengage from its position in case of failure of one mooring line dnv 2013 mean tc mean and dynamic tc dyn components of total tension td in each mooring line are determined based on quasi static analysis in the frequency domain even if a coupled analysis of platform mooring lines in the time domain is generally needed to correctly estimate both line tension and nonlinear effects in the dynamic response of floating offshore structures in deep water depths nevertheless in the early design stage the quasi static analysis is still practical and feasible as stressed by lim et al 2016 who compared the results obtained by quasi static and coupled analysis in frequency and time domains respectively founding a reasonable agreement between the two analysis methods furthermore by the comparative study between an uncoupled analysis in the frequency domain and a coupled aero hydro servo elastic simulation in the time domain carried out by huijs et al 2014 with reference to the gustomsc tri floater support structure equipped with the nrel 5 mw wind turbine it is gathered that i in the wave frequency range between 0 3 and 2 0 rad s motions and accelerations are rather well predicted by the frequency domain motion analysis ii in the low frequency range 0 3 rad s the coupled simulations show considerable response around the structure natural frequencies respect to the frequency domain analysis and iii the high frequency components 2 0 rad s are in both cases almost negligible hence they concluded that the uncoupled frequency domain analysis can be applied in the early design stage when optimization of hull shape and main dimensions for minimal wave frequency motions is performed as it is also currently carried out with reference to mooring design and selection hence denoting by sc the line characteristic capacity equal to 95 of the catalogue breaking strength the following inequality shall be satisfied to comply with uls and als design criteria provided by the recently developed standard design of floating wind turbine structures dnv 2013 which extends the common design approach for mooring systems of oil gas platforms to fowts 1 t d γ mean t c mean γ dyn t c dyn s c having denoted by γmean and γdyn the partial safety factors of mean and dynamic load components respectively depending on safety class levels and limit state design conditions as listed in table 1 dnv 2013 besides in all performed calculations the corrosion rate of chain cables is taken equal to 0 4 mm year according to rule values dnv 2008 dnv 2013 so yielding to 10 mm corrosion allowance based on 25 year wind farm lifetime in this respect it must be pointed out that current corrosion rate could be reduced by one half if at least 25 of mooring lines would be included in periodic visual inspections at suitable offshore or onshore facilities as concerns the fls design check the characteristic cumulative fatigue damage dc is assessed by the combined spectrum approach dnv 2010a based on 50 corrosion allowance 25 year wind farm lifetime with slope m and intercept ad parameters of s n curve equal to 3 0 and 1 2 1011 for stud link chain cables according to the following formula 2 d c i 1 n ν i t i a d 2 2 σ i m γ m 2 1 having denoted by ti the duration of the i th environmental state in the lifetime by νi and σi two parameters defined on the basis of stress spectrum dnv 2010a in eq 2 n represents the number of environmental states that in current analysis consist of 8 directions each one represented by 10 reference sea states each one associated with proper values of significant wave height spectral peak period current and mean wind speed finally the fls design criterion is fulfilled if the design cumulative fatigue damage dd is less than one according to the following equation 3 d d γ f d c 1 where γf is the fls safety factor equal to 5 0 and 3 0 dnv 2010a if mooring systems are periodically inspected at sea by means of rovs or at onshore facilities as it usually happens for mobile offshore units 2 2 load cases environmental loads on fowts vary in magnitude and direction during normal operations and accidental conditions and are mainly related to i wind forces ii hydrodynamic loads due to waves and current iii earthquake loads iv tidal effects v marine growth vi snow and ice loads wind loads may account for directly generated components due to aerodynamic blade loads and drag forces on tower and nacelle as well as indirectly produced loads due to centrifugal coriolis and gyroscopic effects furthermore as wind forces occur simultaneously with other environmental loads specific combinations of at least wind wave and current loads need to be detailed in this respect the offshore standard dnv os j101 dnv 2014 provides 31 design scenarios for different load conditions related to power production power production plus occurrence of fault start up normal shutdown emergency shutdown parked standing still or idling wind turbine and parked wind turbine plus occurrence of fault nevertheless load cases shall be in any case defined to capture i the 50 year return period loads based on uls design criteria ii all contributions due to fatigue damage for the fls design condition and finally iii abnormal conditions associated with severe fault situations such as breaking of wind turbine flooding conditions of support structure and failure of one mooring line to comply with als design criteria in current analysis mooring design and selection are carried out based on the load cases listed in table 2 and selected from the 31 scenarios provided by rules dnv 2014 as they are expected to represent the most severe conditions for uls and als design of station keeping systems with reference to i power production ii parked wind turbine and iii mooring line fault situations respectively as concerns power production wind turbine loads are represented by the normal turbulence model ntm based on 10 min wind speed at hub height u10 hub and a characteristic standard deviation defined as the 90 quantile of relevant probability distribution wave climate is represented by the severe sea state sss model characterized by the 50 year significant wave height conditional on 10 min wind speed at hub height hs 50 yr u10 hub that in turn mainly depends on fetch length at deployment site and topography of nearby coastlines besides current loads are wind generated which implies that relevant velocity is estimated as a fraction ranging between 0 015 and 0 030 of 1 h wind speed at 10 m above sea water level dnv 2014 as concerns parked wind turbine and mooring line fault conditions wind loads are represented by the extreme turbulence model etm based on 10 min wind speed at hub height with 50 year u10 50 yr and 1 year u10 1 yr return periods respectively coupled with a standard deviation equal to 0 11 times the wind speed besides the extreme sea state ess model is applied to represent the wave climate with 50 year hs 50 yr and 1 year hs 1 yr return periods respectively while wind generated current velocities are always estimated as a fraction of wind speed finally in all cases wind and wave loads are assumed codirectional as this condition is expected to furnish the highest loads in the mooring lines and relevant reference periods namely 10 min for wind speeds and 3 h for wave heights have been selected according to current standards for fowts dnv 2014 3 theoretical model 3 1 frequency domain analysis platform motion analysis is performed in the frequency domain considering separately mean wave and low frequency components as reported in fig 1 with a typical load displacement curve of a mooring line mean platform offset δmean is assessed based on static equilibrium equations in the horizontal plane between steady environmental loads and mooring system restoring forces at rest while wave and low frequency motion amplitudes are separately determined and combined to yield the maximum platform motion response δmax based on the following equation api 2005 4 δ max δ mean δ dyn δ mean max δ wf sig δ lf max δ wf max δ lf sig δ adm having denoted by δadm the platform admissible offset and by δwf sig δlf sig and δwf max δlf max the significant and maximum wave low frequency motion amplitudes respectively furthermore both wave and low frequency motions are assumed to be narrow banded gaussian processes with rayleigh distributed peaks so as maximum amplitudes can be assessed based on a typical 3 h storm duration and an average motion period equal to the moored platform surge sway natural period tn and the wave zero crossing period tz for low and wave frequency components respectively api 2005 fossen 2011 5 δ wf max δ wf sig 1 2 ln 10800 t z δ lf max δ lf sig 1 2 ln 10800 t n in this respect it must be pointed out that pitch roll natural periods of the tri floater support structure are equal to about 25 s while surge sway ones are expected to be about twice as much depending on water depth and selected mooring configuration so as the incidence of resonant pitch roll motions on maximum amplitudes of surge sway low frequency components based on eq 5 is expected to be almost negligible finally details about mean wave and low frequency significant motion amplitudes are furnished in sub sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 respectively 3 2 mean platform response mooring stiffnesses are preliminarily determined according to al solihat and nahon 2016 who derived the full restoring matrixes for suspended slack and taut line systems in this respect starting from the fully developed catenary configuration for any assigned water depth d and line scope length to water depth ratio s d mooring stiffnesses at rest are determined based on station keeping pattern and platform maximum admissible offset δadm hence the platform static displacement δmean is determined by solving the coupled surge sway and yaw equilibrium equations among mooring restoring forces and steady environmental loads due to i steady wind forces ii steady drift forces iii current forces first order steady wind loads f w 1 due to drag forces on the emerged parts of support structure tower and nacelle are determined based on frøya wind profile dnv 2014 and a 0 70 drag coefficient dnv 2010b while the wind turbine maximum thrust at rated speed is assumed for power production as concerns the second order contribution f w 2 due to the fluctuating part of wind loads kaimal spectrum dnv 2014 is applied to represent the upstream wind field in front of wind turbine neglecting the additional turbulence due to rotation of rotor blades hence denoting by m0 w the wind speed zero order spectral moment and by u10 10 the 10 min speed at 10 m above sea water the total steady wind force fw is determined as follows feikema and wichers 1991 fossen 2011 wichers 2011 6 f w f w 1 f w 2 f w 1 1 m 0 w

j n 1 and y n y n 1 denote the firs order derivatives of first and second kind bessel functions of order n n 1 with argument kdc 2 finally current forces acting on the submerged part of support structure are determined assuming a unitary drag coefficient that is a typical value for rough circular cylinders operating in the post critical regime with a surface roughness of 0 05 m to account for marine growth between two consecutive scheduled maintenance operations 3 3 wave frequency platform response platform motion response in the wave frequency domain is assessed based on a 6 dof model of the tri floater support structure added mass and wave damping of linear and rotational motions are determined representing radiation potentials as the sum of progressing and local waves kim 1993 accounting for interactions among multiple bodies a similar procedure is applied to estimate diffraction potentials when determining in plane forces and moments kim 1993 heave added mass is assessed disregarding possible interferences between the cylinders and the attached heave plates tao et al 2007 while for heave force computation bottom pressure is evaluated disregarding wave interactions among multiple bodies as carried out by kim 1993 for the issc tension leg platform eatock taylor and jefferys 1986 besides roll pitch added masses and forces are increased to account for moments of heave added mass entrapped by bottom damping plates as regards the platform longitudinal and transverse planes faltinsen and demirbilek 1989 finally viscous dampings are added to the hydrodynamic model based on free decay tests carried out by shin et al 2013 on the 1 80 scale down model of the similarly shaped tri floater oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible platform robertson et al 2014 hence damping ratios for surge sway heave and roll pitch motions are assumed equal to 0 20 0 10 and 0 20 respectively while yaw damping ratio is assumed equal to 0 05 as suggested by fossen 2011 and confirmed by the numerical simulations carried out by kim et al 2014 finally the in plane platform significant motion amplitude δwf sig is determined based on rayleigh distribution for narrow band response spectra 9 δ wf sig 2 0 h ω 2 s ς ω dω having denoted by h ω the surge sway transfer function 3 4 low frequency platform response low frequency platform motion is assessed combining low

of dogger bank and characterized by water depths ranging from 50 up to 80 m paramor et al 2009 is assumed as first reference site for possible deployment of a wind farm the second site located in the northern north sea near the troll field area is characterized by water depths ranging from 200 up to 350 m significant wave heights and wind speeds are assessed based on metocean statistics around the british isles provided by the english health safety executive hse 2001 as concerns power production the omnidirectional 50 year significant wave height hs 50 yr u10 hub conditional on 10 min wind speed at hub height u10 hub is determined based on relevant marginal distribution with reference to the wind turbine rated speed of 11 4 m s corresponding to maximum thrust as detailed in sub section 4 2 hence environmental data for power production are reported for southern and northern north sea areas in tables 3 a and 3 b where the 50 year wave peak period tp 50 yr the wind speed standard deviation σu c and the current velocity uc are also listed data reported in tables 3 a and 3 b are mainly independent of wave and wind direction despite of extreme loads for parked wind turbine and mooring line fault conditions for which polar plots of 50 year continuous line and 1 year dashed line significant wave heights and 10 min wind speeds are reported in figs 2 a b and 3 a b for southern and northern north sea areas respectively further details are reported in tables 4 a and 4 b based on current results the north west sector is characterized by the highest significant wave heights confirming the main outcomes of feld et al 2015 who investigated the directional and seasonal variabilities of metocean conditions for the north sea area finally as concerns the fls strength check 8 reference directions are investigated on the basis of wave statistics around the british isles provided by the english health safety executive hse 2001 as a function of significant wave height hs classes with 0 50 m step in this respect remaining environmental data namely i wave peak period tp ii 10 min wind speed at 10 m above sea water level u10 10 with standard deviation σu c and iii wind generated current velocity uc are the most probable values conditional on significant wave height in all cases a minimum design life of 25 years is assumed for selected mooring configurations to avoid replacements of mooring lines during the wind farm lifetime finally table 5 also provides the probabilities of occurrence of selected sea states for southern sns and northern north sea nns areas based on the marginal distribution relative to the 8 reference directions it is noticed that sea states with significant wave heights higher than 4 75 m and 6 25 m are characterized by a very low probability of occurrence in the sns and nsn areas respectively so as they are not considered in the assessment of mooring fatigue life 4 2 support structure and wind turbine data the semisubmersible tri floater support structure reported in fig 4 bulder et al 2002 and developed within the drijfwind project is taken as reference design in conjunction with the well known 5 mw offshore wind turbine developed by the national renewable energy laboratory jonkman et al 2009 in fig 4 a 6 line spread mooring system is also represented together with relevant fairlead and anchoring points the platform whose main dimensions are listed in table 6 consists of three vertical columns interconnected by bracings and equipped with 18 m circular flat plates at bottom to increase added masses and damping effects the columns are characterized by a spar type configuration with vertical stiffeners horizontal ring webs and a watertight diaphragm located at 4 m above the bottom and constituting the ceil of a ballast tank partly emptied in moored condition to balance the catenary line suspended weight and keep unchanged the platform design draught the structure designed for the southern north sea on 50 m water depth was initially equipped with a conventional six line hybrid mooring system consisting of 225 m stud less chain cables and 225 m high grade steel wire ropes while in current analysis the entire design space of chain cable catenary mooring systems is investigated varying the line number and scope to detect the minimum weight configuration as a function of environmental data at candidate deployment site on different water depths the main data of the three bladed nrel 5 mw offshore wind turbine are listed in table 7 the converter with an overall mass of about 700 t develops a maximum thrust of 800 kn at the rated speed of 11 4 m s jonkman et al 2009 5 mooring design and selection 5 1 incidence of platform admissible offset and line scope line number and scope as well as platform admissible offset represent the key factors affecting mooring design and selection for fowts in this respect it must be preliminarily pointed out that current offshore rules do not prescribe mandatory values for maximum displacements of fowts provided that operational capabilities of power connection systems may be properly tuned based on support structure maximum admissible offset furthermore a variety of admissible displacement to water depth ratios δadm d is also recognized among different designs proposed by several researchers in fact while the ratio δadm d was taken equal to 0 20 by bulder et al 2002 and lefebvre and collu 2012 on 50 m water depth it was set equal to 0 43 and 0 15 by brommundt et al 2012 at great ekofirsk area and troll field on 75 and 330 m water depths respectively finally benassai et al 2014a b 2015 concluded that the platform admissible displacement has to be properly tuned accounting for i environmental loads at deployment site ii water depth iii line number and iv mooring technology in current analysis two candidate deployment sites the former located in the southern north sea west of dogger bank on water depths ranging from 50 up to 80 m the latter in the northern north sea near the troll field area on water depths ranging from 200 up to 350 m have been selected for possible deployment of a wind farm in both cases r3 stud link chain cables have been chosen as candidate mooring technology in this respect it must pointed out that wire ropes are not suitable for the southern north sea characterized by intermediate water depths nor for the northern north sea as in the latter case relevant minimum weight configurations would be characterized by too high scopes ranging from 9 to 10 so resulting in excessively long mooring lines up to 3000 m length and too wide spacings between adjacent fowts that may be generally limited to 10 times the rotor diameter namely about 1250 m in current analysis furthermore based on the main outcomes of benassai et al 2014a b 2015 6 and 9 line mooring configurations have been selected for both southern and northern north sea areas while the 3 line mooring system has not been analysed as it may cause large drifts of the turbine support structure in case of failure of one mooring line in both cases spread mooring systems with equally spaced lines have been selected as also depicted in fig 4 where a reference 6 line mooring configuration is reported hence for each water depth the platform admissible offset to water depth ratio δadm d has been systematically increased with 0 01 step and the line scope s d was properly tuned to detect the minimum weight configuration according to the flow chart reported in fig 5 ryu et al 2008 and mainly based on three subsequent steps i global analysis of intact load case conditions according to uls criteria ii global analysis of damage load case conditions according to als criteria iii analysis of fatigue life according to fls design criteria particularly after selecting the line number and the water depth for any platform admissible offset to water depth ratio and line scope the chain diameter is iteratively varied until minimum weight configuration contemporarily satisfying uls als and fls design check criteria is obtained hence the minimum weight configuration among all candidate designs complying with the above mentioned criteria is detected in any case candidate mooring configurations have been preliminarily detected based on a fatigue life safety factor γf equal to 5 0 in compliance with offshore planned maintenance inspections by means of rovs nevertheless the incidence of onshore maintenance inspections γf 3 0 has been subsequently investigated with reference to minimum weight configurations 5 2 mooring design and selection for the southern north sea main data of 6 and 9 line minimum weight configurations for dogger bank in the southern north sea detected in compliance with the flow chart reported in fig 5 are listed in tables 8 a and 8 b respectively where the chain diameter dc the platform admissible offset to water depth ratio δadm d and the line scope s d are reported in both cases mooring weight platform admissible offset to water depth ratio and line scope decrease for increasing water depths even if with a gradient that diminishes too as gathered from fig 6 a where distributions of minimum weight configurations versus water depth are reported based on current results the 6 line mooring system can be selected as candidate configuration for the southern north sea as it is always lighter than the 9 line one further weight reductions may be achieved if mooring systems would be regularly inspected at onshore facilities as gathered from fig 6 b where a comparative analysis among minimum weight configurations of 6 line mooring systems designed in compliance with offshore γf 5 0 and onshore γf 3 0 planned maintenance inspections is performed in this respect the incidence of inspection type is almost negligible on 50 m water depth while a percentage decrease ranging from about 2 up to 4 is recognized between 60 and 80 m water depths resulting in a weight reduction ranging from 20 up to 35 t 5 3 mooring design and selection for the northern north sea as for previous deployment site the incidence of line number scope and platform admissible offset is systematically investigated for a wind farm deployed at troll field area located in the northern north sea varying the water depth from 200 up to 350 m with 50 m step in this respect main data of 6 and 9 line minimum weight configurations are reported in tables 9 a and 9 b respectively unlike the previous case mooring weight increases moving towards higher water depths as reported in fig 7 a while both platform admissible offset to water depth ratio and line scope decrease anyway the 6 line mooring configuration still reveals to be slightly lower than the 9 line one so as it may be selected as candidate configuration for further investigation hence in fig 7 b a comparative analysis among offshore and onshore maintenance inspections is performed as predictable latter mooring configurations are slightly lighter than the former with a 7 reduction independently of water depth nevertheless considering that fowts in the northern north sea would be deployed in deep water depths onshore inspections are in any case expected to produce consistently higher maintenance costs during the entire wind farm lifetime as regards offshore maintenance activities which implies that also in this case they do not represent an economically viable choice hence 6 line mooring systems designed in compliance with offshore planned inspections represent the most suitable configuration also for the northern north sea area on deep water depths 5 4 preliminary cost analysis it is well known that the main barriers for mass production and installation of fowts are mainly due to high capital and operating expenditures myhr et al 2014 in this respect as moorings represent a considerable part of installation and maintenance costs proper design and selection of station keeping systems are a basic issue to minimize the wind farm levelised cost of energy lcoe particularly the cost of chains on the international market has been quite volatile in the last decade so as a proper estimate of installation expenses for mooring systems is not a simple issue nevertheless the unit cost of 2keuro t proposed by myhr et al 2014 within a wide analysis devoted to the lcoe assessment for different types of fowts in a life cycle perspective seems to be a reasonable value for fabrication expenses in this respect it must be pointed out that installation costs expected to be a relatively small fraction of fabrication ones are currently not considered as they are quite difficult to assess at least in a preliminary project phase provided that day rates of anchor handling tug and supply ahts vessels and crew daily labour costs are quite volatile on the international market hence based on minimum weight configurations reported in tables 8 a and 9 a for the southern and northern north sea areas respectively relevant costs are reported in fig 8 a where the red interpolating line represents the best fit cost curve in the water depth range from 50 up to 350 m based on current results the cost curve is characterized by a left descending and a right ascending branch with a minimum located at 80 m water depth hence it is conceivable that while in the southern north sea possible cost reductions may be achieved moving the wind farm towards higher water depths compatibly with the site bathymetry namely 80 m in the examined case the opposite holds true for the northern north sea area where wind farms may be located at deployment sites with as low as possible water depths namely 200 m in current analysis finally possible cost reductions as regards the reference values reported in fig 8 a can be achieved if maintenance inspections of mooring systems are scheduled at onshore facilities as reported in fig 8 b from which it is gathered that possible savings lie between 20 and 160 keuro for fowts deployed on 50 and 350 m water depths and that cost reductions between offshore and onshore maintenance inspections increase with a decreasing rate nevertheless it is predictable that in case of visual inspections of mooring systems at onshore facilities increased maintenance expenses mainly due to i detachment of mooring lines ii towing of fowts to shore iii re towing to the wind farm deployment site and iv re attachment of mooring lines are expected to be widely higher than initial savings provided that daily rates including fuel consumption of anchor handling tug supply ahts vessels and tug boats are equal to about 90 and 17 keuro myhr et al 2014 respectively hence based on current results maintenance inspections at onshore facilities may be avoided as far as possible so as 6 line mooring systems designed in compliance with offshore inspections and high fatigue life safety factors represent the most feasible choice for wind farm installations in both southern and northern north sea areas 6 recommendations for mooring design of fowts current results allow suggesting some general recommendations for proper design and selection of mooring systems for fowts that are mainly related to i line number ii platform admissible offset and line scope iii type of scheduled maintenance inspections iv mooring technology i as concerns the line number 6 line mooring systems represent the most suitable design for both southern and northern north sea in the water depth range from 50 up to 350 m provided that they maintain proper station keeping performances in case of failure of one mooring line in this respect 3 line configurations should be avoided at least in authors opinion as they are non redundant and may cause large offsets of the support structure in case of failure of one mooring line ii platform admissible offset and line scope have to be properly tuned to minimize mooring scantlings and installation costs in this respect in fig 9 a and 9 b current values of platform admissible offset to water depth ratio δadm d and line scope s d listed in tables 8 a and 9 a for the southern and northern north sea areas respectively are plotted versus the water depth together with red interpolating curves representing the best fit functions in the analysed water depth range hence based on actual results platform admissible offset and line scope may be chosen accordingly to minimize mooring weights iii as concerns the choice of offshore onshore maintenance inspections obtained results and the preliminary cost analysis suggest that initial savings due to scheduled visual inspections at onshore facilities instead of offshore activities by means of rovs will be certainly overtaken by the increased maintenance costs during the entire wind farm lifetime in this respect it is suggested to design mooring systems complying with high fatigue life safety factors to avoid as far as possible maintenance activities at onshore sites iv finally as the mooring system footprint could influence the distance between adjacent fowts chain cables represent the most suitable technology to avoid excessively large spacings between adjacent wind turbines provided that they would be generally spaced between 6 and 10 times the rotor diameter i e 750 and 1250 m if the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is installed hence minimum distances at analysed water depths and best fit red interpolating curve with lower and upper bound values of spacings between fowts black dotted lines are reported in fig 10 based on current results minimum spacings between fowts due to mooring system footprint are below the suggested lower bound value on intermediate water depths while the opposite holds true on deep water depths where minimum spacings are beyond the suggested upper bound in this respect it is gathered that mooring system footprint doesn t represent a mandatory design restraint for wind farms on intermediate water depths up to about 100 m while it has to be taken into due consideration on deep water depths even becoming a mandatory value to be satisfied beyond 250 m hence it is conceivable that wire ropes do not represent the proper technology on deep water depths as they would be characterized by higher line scopes as regards chain cables so yielding to minimum spacings between adjacent fowts up to 5 km on the contrary it is well known that they are generally not suitable in a standalone configuration on intermediate water depths where in any cases hybrid chain cable wire rope configurations could represent a suitable choice to be further investigated 7 conclusions design and selection of mooring systems for fowts to be deployed in southern and northern north sea areas the former near dogger bank on intermediate water depths the latter at troll field on deep water depths have been analysed to investigate the incidence of station keeping main design parameters on mooring installation and maintenance costs as well as on the overall wind farm design in this respect the dutch tri floater support structure together with the well known 5 mw nrel wind turbine have been chosen as reference design first and second order platform motions have been assessed in the frequency domain by a 6dof dedicated programme developed in matlab mathworks 2014 accounting for drift forces and non stationary loads due to wind turbulence the following main results have been achieved i line number and scope platform admissible offset and offshore onshore scheduled inspections represent a basic issue for a proper mooring design mainly depending on water depth as it has been verified for the two candidate deployment sites in this respect 6 line mooring systems represent the most suitable configuration for fowts deployed in southern and northern north sea areas on water depths ranging from 50 up to 350 m as they assure redundancy of station keeping system in case of failure of one mooring line despite of the commonly applied 3 line configuration and are slightly lighter than 9 line configurations that in turn are characterized by higher installation costs due to the increased line number furthermore it was verified that wire ropes don t represent a feasible design choice for fowts in the examined water depth range as they are characterized by higher line scopes as regards chain cables so resulting in too wide horizontal separations between adjacent wind turbines required to avoid possible overlapping between mooring lines of different support structures this outcome represents one of the basic differences between the mooring design for fowts and the offshore structures for the oil gas industry ii a preliminary cost analysis has been performed from which it has been verified that mooring installation cost decreases from 50 up to 80 m water depth while it increases again beyond it furthermore it was checked that installation savings due to onshore maintenance inspections are overtaken by the increased expenses due to higher maintenance costs during the wind farm lifetime so as visual onshore activities need to be avoided as far as possible hence based on current results a clear dependence of mooring weight on water depth and maintenance inspections is detected from which it is gathered that possible savings due to reduced scantlings are counterbalanced by the increased costs due to onshore maintenance inspections differently from the oil gas offshore structures where in some cases the opposite holds true iii some recommendations for proper design and selection of mooring systems have been provided mainly focusing on line number platform admissible offset and line scope offshore onshore maintenance inspections minimum spacings between adjacent fowts in this respect recommendations for mooring design of fowts reported in section 7 represent one of the first attempts towards a cost based design of mooring systems and allow assessing already in a preliminary project phase the optimal stationkeeping configuration expected to minimize the total installation costs nevertheless current outcomes need to be further investigated analysing the candidate mooring configurations at different water depths by more refined models in the time domain focusing on hybrid chain cable wire rope configurations on intermediate water depths and more accurately evaluating the overall mooring installations and maintenance costs in a life cycle perspective also with reference to relevant incidence on the wind farm levelised cost of energy acknowledgements the paper has been partly financed by the individual research programme supported by the university of naples parthenope for the year 2016 
23699,the paper focuses on design and selection of mooring systems for floating offshore wind turbines fowts for intermediate and deep water depths based on ultimate accidental and fatigue limit state design conditions with reference to power production parked wind turbine and mooring line fault conditions platform static and dynamic offsets are determined by a purposely developed 6dof programme in the frequency domain accounting for first and second order motions the dutch tri floater platform together with the well known 5 mw nrel wind turbine is assumed as reference design besides two sites the one in the southern north sea near dogger bank on water depths ranging from 50 up to 80 m the other one in the northern north sea near the troll field area on water depths ranging from 200 up to 350 m are assumed as candidate deployment areas to investigate the effect of i line number ii platform admissible offset and line scope iii offshore onshore planned maintenance inspections and iv mooring technology on relevant installation and maintenance costs a preliminary cost analysis is also performed and some recommendations are given to correctly choice the most suitable mooring configuration as a function of water depth keywords floating offshore wind turbines mooring system design chain cables southern and northern north sea 1 introduction during the last decade offshore wind energy was one of the fastest growing maritime sectors with a total installed capacity expected to reach 40 gw by 2020 and 150 gw by 2030 meeting 4 and 14 of the eu total electricity consumption ewea 2013 the trend leads to increase both power and number of wind turbines moving production farms from shallow to intermediate deep waters requiring specialized substructures to harvest the promising offshore market potential provided that current commercial substructures such as monopiles gravity based foundations tripods and jackets are economically limited to 40 50 m water depths nevertheless even if intermediate deep water offshore designs are expected to be competitive in terms of levelised cost of energy lcoe with bottom fixed support structures current technology is still in a pre commercial phase as research activities in the field started in the mid 1990s and the first two full scale floating offshore wind turbine fowt prototypes have been deployed only recently the former off the island of karmøy north of stavanger the latter 5 km off the portuguese coast of aguçadoura currently fowts exhibit different configurations mainly depending on water depth in intermediate water depths from 50 up to 120 m tension leg platforms and semi submersible support structures are the most common designs while in deep waters beyond 120 m spar type configurations seem to represent the most feasible choice even if semisubmersible structures have been in any case proposed as an alternative design as concerns the semi submersible configuration for intermediate water depths one of the first comprehensive studies was carried out within the drijfwind project bulder et al 2002 with the main aim of developing a preliminary design for a candidate deployment site in the southern north sea on 50 m water depth off the netherland continental shelf the structure with a tri floater configuration was provided with large heave plates at the bottom of each column and a conventional hybrid six line mooring system recently principle power roddier et al 2010 and deepcwind consortium robertson et al 2014 developed similarly shaped configurations with 3 line conventional moorings for two candidate deployment sites on intermediate and deep water depths respectively in the same years several feasibility studies have been performed to investigate the economic viability of offshore wind power production and optimize the design of both support structures and mooring systems in this respect sclavounos et al 2008 carried out a parametric study focusing on different mooring technologies for several candidate designs namely tension leg platforms spar type and barge configurations on different water depths fylling and berthelsen 2011 proposed an integrated tool to optimize the design of spar type support structures including mooring systems and power take off cables brommundt et al 2012 developed a new tool devoted to the optimization of catenary mooring systems for semi submersible structures deployed at two candidate sites located in the north sea namely greater ekofirsk area and troll field on 75 and 330 m water depths respectively benassai et al 2014a b 2015 optimized the catenary mooring systems of fowts with tri floater support structure for three candidate sites in the southern mediterranean sea at different water depths from 50 up to 300 m focusing on symmetric and asymmetric patterns and different mooring technologies namely chain cables and steel wire ropes finally hall et al 2014 developed an alternative form of support structure optimization problem abstracting from geometry details and focusing on hydrodynamic performance coefficients to provide a more complete and intuitive exploration of the design space the growing interest in exploiting offshore wind resources on intermediate and deep water depths is also proved by the variety of rules and guidelines provided in the last years by several classification societies namely american bureau of shipping abs 2015 bureau veritas bv 2015 and det norske veritas dnv 2014 among others particularly current rules for the offshore wind energy sector furnish criteria for design construction installation and survey of permanently sited installations focusing on three main topics i support structures ii station keeping systems and iii onboard machinery and equipment including safety and lifesaving appliances besides despite of current codes for the offshore oil and gas industry the so called environmental class approach is applied as fowts are expected to be mass produced units which implies that several locations with fairly similar metocean conditions can be grouped together reducing design installation and maintenance costs furthermore structural safety is ensured by the so called safety class method so as all structural elements including mooring system are designed to meet assigned target safety levels defined in terms of collapse consequences and annual failure probabilities due to the novelty of this research field the paper focuses on design and selection criteria of mooring systems for fowts with semi submersible support structure on intermediate and deep water depths in this respect following the main outcomes of past researches the choice of i line type number and scope ii platform admissible offset and iii type of planned maintenance inspections that in turn influence the expected mooring lifetime represents a basic issue to minimize the mooring weight and reduce the overall installation costs hence in the paper the following main subjects are fully investigated and discussed i the incidence of platform admissible offset line number and offshore onshore maintenance inspections on mooring scantlings is systematically investigated at different water depths as various design strategies for mooring systems of fowts have been applied in the past by different researchers bulder et al 2002 sclavounos et al 2008 fylling and berthelsen 2011 brommundt et al 2012 benassai et al 2014a b 2015 in this respect it must be pointed out that the choice of platform admissible offset and line number strongly differs from the common design procedure generally applied for semisubmersible offshore structures in the oil gas industry due to the greater incidence of wind loads in harsh weather conditions and couplings between wave and wind components hence the choice of proper design parameters reveals to be quite challenging as mooring weight and stationkeeping redundancy in case of failure of one mooring line mainly depend on platform admissible offset and line number respectively furthermore offshore onshore maintenance inspections also play a fundamental role in the assessment of mooring life which has not been fully investigated till now provided that fowts are devoted to mass production differently from offshore structures operating into the oil gas sector which implies that all strategies devoted to possible savings of maintenance activities have to be undertaken ii minimum weight configurations are identified and a preliminary cost analysis is performed to investigate the incidence of water depth on mooring installation costs as the levelised cost of energy of fowts mainly depends on installation expenses related to support structure wind turbine and mooring system in this respect no many theoretical works have been performed on the argument and the topic needs to be further analysed to investigate the incidence of different design strategies on mooring scantling and installation costs iii some recommendations are provided to speed up the design and selection process of mooring systems for fowts and detect the minimum weight configuration as a function of water depth particularly it must be pointed out that no many research activities have been carried out in the past to provide some guidelines for mooring design of fowts that generally differs from the design procedure commonly applied for semisubmersible offshore structures operating in the oil gas industry mainly due to different issues related to mass production and wave wind load couplings the dutch tri floater platform bulder et al 2002 coupled with the 5 mw nrel wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 is assumed as reference design for two candidate deployment sites the former located in the southern north sea west of dogger bank on water depths ranging from 50 up to 80 m the latter in the northern north sea near the troll field area on water depths ranging from 200 up to 350 m finally platform motion analysis is carried out in the frequency domain by a dedicated programme developed in matlab mathworks 2014 and mainly based on de coupling of static wave and low frequency motions 2 mooring design criteria 2 1 station keeping requirements in current analysis ultimate uls accidental als and fatigue fls limit state design criteria provided by the offshore standard dnv os j103 dnv 2013 and mainly based on the safety class approach are applied for design and selection of mooring systems for fowts in this respect redundant station keeping systems shall be designed according to normal safety class requirements based on 10 4 annual failure probability while non redundant configurations shall comply with high safety class levels corresponding to 10 5 annual failure probability reflecting the increased risk should the support structure face to disengage from its position in case of failure of one mooring line dnv 2013 mean tc mean and dynamic tc dyn components of total tension td in each mooring line are determined based on quasi static analysis in the frequency domain even if a coupled analysis of platform mooring lines in the time domain is generally needed to correctly estimate both line tension and nonlinear effects in the dynamic response of floating offshore structures in deep water depths nevertheless in the early design stage the quasi static analysis is still practical and feasible as stressed by lim et al 2016 who compared the results obtained by quasi static and coupled analysis in frequency and time domains respectively founding a reasonable agreement between the two analysis methods furthermore by the comparative study between an uncoupled analysis in the frequency domain and a coupled aero hydro servo elastic simulation in the time domain carried out by huijs et al 2014 with reference to the gustomsc tri floater support structure equipped with the nrel 5 mw wind turbine it is gathered that i in the wave frequency range between 0 3 and 2 0 rad s motions and accelerations are rather well predicted by the frequency domain motion analysis ii in the low frequency range 0 3 rad s the coupled simulations show considerable response around the structure natural frequencies respect to the frequency domain analysis and iii the high frequency components 2 0 rad s are in both cases almost negligible hence they concluded that the uncoupled frequency domain analysis can be applied in the early design stage when optimization of hull shape and main dimensions for minimal wave frequency motions is performed as it is also currently carried out with reference to mooring design and selection hence denoting by sc the line characteristic capacity equal to 95 of the catalogue breaking strength the following inequality shall be satisfied to comply with uls and als design criteria provided by the recently developed standard design of floating wind turbine structures dnv 2013 which extends the common design approach for mooring systems of oil gas platforms to fowts 1 t d γ mean t c mean γ dyn t c dyn s c having denoted by γmean and γdyn the partial safety factors of mean and dynamic load components respectively depending on safety class levels and limit state design conditions as listed in table 1 dnv 2013 besides in all performed calculations the corrosion rate of chain cables is taken equal to 0 4 mm year according to rule values dnv 2008 dnv 2013 so yielding to 10 mm corrosion allowance based on 25 year wind farm lifetime in this respect it must be pointed out that current corrosion rate could be reduced by one half if at least 25 of mooring lines would be included in periodic visual inspections at suitable offshore or onshore facilities as concerns the fls design check the characteristic cumulative fatigue damage dc is assessed by the combined spectrum approach dnv 2010a based on 50 corrosion allowance 25 year wind farm lifetime with slope m and intercept ad parameters of s n curve equal to 3 0 and 1 2 1011 for stud link chain cables according to the following formula 2 d c i 1 n ν i t i a d 2 2 σ i m γ m 2 1 having denoted by ti the duration of the i th environmental state in the lifetime by νi and σi two parameters defined on the basis of stress spectrum dnv 2010a in eq 2 n represents the number of environmental states that in current analysis consist of 8 directions each one represented by 10 reference sea states each one associated with proper values of significant wave height spectral peak period current and mean wind speed finally the fls design criterion is fulfilled if the design cumulative fatigue damage dd is less than one according to the following equation 3 d d γ f d c 1 where γf is the fls safety factor equal to 5 0 and 3 0 dnv 2010a if mooring systems are periodically inspected at sea by means of rovs or at onshore facilities as it usually happens for mobile offshore units 2 2 load cases environmental loads on fowts vary in magnitude and direction during normal operations and accidental conditions and are mainly related to i wind forces ii hydrodynamic loads due to waves and current iii earthquake loads iv tidal effects v marine growth vi snow and ice loads wind loads may account for directly generated components due to aerodynamic blade loads and drag forces on tower and nacelle as well as indirectly produced loads due to centrifugal coriolis and gyroscopic effects furthermore as wind forces occur simultaneously with other environmental loads specific combinations of at least wind wave and current loads need to be detailed in this respect the offshore standard dnv os j101 dnv 2014 provides 31 design scenarios for different load conditions related to power production power production plus occurrence of fault start up normal shutdown emergency shutdown parked standing still or idling wind turbine and parked wind turbine plus occurrence of fault nevertheless load cases shall be in any case defined to capture i the 50 year return period loads based on uls design criteria ii all contributions due to fatigue damage for the fls design condition and finally iii abnormal conditions associated with severe fault situations such as breaking of wind turbine flooding conditions of support structure and failure of one mooring line to comply with als design criteria in current analysis mooring design and selection are carried out based on the load cases listed in table 2 and selected from the 31 scenarios provided by rules dnv 2014 as they are expected to represent the most severe conditions for uls and als design of station keeping systems with reference to i power production ii parked wind turbine and iii mooring line fault situations respectively as concerns power production wind turbine loads are represented by the normal turbulence model ntm based on 10 min wind speed at hub height u10 hub and a characteristic standard deviation defined as the 90 quantile of relevant probability distribution wave climate is represented by the severe sea state sss model characterized by the 50 year significant wave height conditional on 10 min wind speed at hub height hs 50 yr u10 hub that in turn mainly depends on fetch length at deployment site and topography of nearby coastlines besides current loads are wind generated which implies that relevant velocity is estimated as a fraction ranging between 0 015 and 0 030 of 1 h wind speed at 10 m above sea water level dnv 2014 as concerns parked wind turbine and mooring line fault conditions wind loads are represented by the extreme turbulence model etm based on 10 min wind speed at hub height with 50 year u10 50 yr and 1 year u10 1 yr return periods respectively coupled with a standard deviation equal to 0 11 times the wind speed besides the extreme sea state ess model is applied to represent the wave climate with 50 year hs 50 yr and 1 year hs 1 yr return periods respectively while wind generated current velocities are always estimated as a fraction of wind speed finally in all cases wind and wave loads are assumed codirectional as this condition is expected to furnish the highest loads in the mooring lines and relevant reference periods namely 10 min for wind speeds and 3 h for wave heights have been selected according to current standards for fowts dnv 2014 3 theoretical model 3 1 frequency domain analysis platform motion analysis is performed in the frequency domain considering separately mean wave and low frequency components as reported in fig 1 with a typical load displacement curve of a mooring line mean platform offset δmean is assessed based on static equilibrium equations in the horizontal plane between steady environmental loads and mooring system restoring forces at rest while wave and low frequency motion amplitudes are separately determined and combined to yield the maximum platform motion response δmax based on the following equation api 2005 4 δ max δ mean δ dyn δ mean max δ wf sig δ lf max δ wf max δ lf sig δ adm having denoted by δadm the platform admissible offset and by δwf sig δlf sig and δwf max δlf max the significant and maximum wave low frequency motion amplitudes respectively furthermore both wave and low frequency motions are assumed to be narrow banded gaussian processes with rayleigh distributed peaks so as maximum amplitudes can be assessed based on a typical 3 h storm duration and an average motion period equal to the moored platform surge sway natural period tn and the wave zero crossing period tz for low and wave frequency components respectively api 2005 fossen 2011 5 δ wf max δ wf sig 1 2 ln 10800 t z δ lf max δ lf sig 1 2 ln 10800 t n in this respect it must be pointed out that pitch roll natural periods of the tri floater support structure are equal to about 25 s while surge sway ones are expected to be about twice as much depending on water depth and selected mooring configuration so as the incidence of resonant pitch roll motions on maximum amplitudes of surge sway low frequency components based on eq 5 is expected to be almost negligible finally details about mean wave and low frequency significant motion amplitudes are furnished in sub sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 respectively 3 2 mean platform response mooring stiffnesses are preliminarily determined according to al solihat and nahon 2016 who derived the full restoring matrixes for suspended slack and taut line systems in this respect starting from the fully developed catenary configuration for any assigned water depth d and line scope length to water depth ratio s d mooring stiffnesses at rest are determined based on station keeping pattern and platform maximum admissible offset δadm hence the platform static displacement δmean is determined by solving the coupled surge sway and yaw equilibrium equations among mooring restoring forces and steady environmental loads due to i steady wind forces ii steady drift forces iii current forces first order steady wind loads f w 1 due to drag forces on the emerged parts of support structure tower and nacelle are determined based on frøya wind profile dnv 2014 and a 0 70 drag coefficient dnv 2010b while the wind turbine maximum thrust at rated speed is assumed for power production as concerns the second order contribution f w 2 due to the fluctuating part of wind loads kaimal spectrum dnv 2014 is applied to represent the upstream wind field in front of wind turbine neglecting the additional turbulence due to rotation of rotor blades hence denoting by m0 w the wind speed zero order spectral moment and by u10 10 the 10 min speed at 10 m above sea water the total steady wind force fw is determined as follows feikema and wichers 1991 fossen 2011 wichers 2011 6 f w f w 1 f w 2 f w 1 1 m 0 w

j n 1 and y n y n 1 denote the firs order derivatives of first and second kind bessel functions of order n n 1 with argument kdc 2 finally current forces acting on the submerged part of support structure are determined assuming a unitary drag coefficient that is a typical value for rough circular cylinders operating in the post critical regime with a surface roughness of 0 05 m to account for marine growth between two consecutive scheduled maintenance operations 3 3 wave frequency platform response platform motion response in the wave frequency domain is assessed based on a 6 dof model of the tri floater support structure added mass and wave damping of linear and rotational motions are determined representing radiation potentials as the sum of progressing and local waves kim 1993 accounting for interactions among multiple bodies a similar procedure is applied to estimate diffraction potentials when determining in plane forces and moments kim 1993 heave added mass is assessed disregarding possible interferences between the cylinders and the attached heave plates tao et al 2007 while for heave force computation bottom pressure is evaluated disregarding wave interactions among multiple bodies as carried out by kim 1993 for the issc tension leg platform eatock taylor and jefferys 1986 besides roll pitch added masses and forces are increased to account for moments of heave added mass entrapped by bottom damping plates as regards the platform longitudinal and transverse planes faltinsen and demirbilek 1989 finally viscous dampings are added to the hydrodynamic model based on free decay tests carried out by shin et al 2013 on the 1 80 scale down model of the similarly shaped tri floater oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible platform robertson et al 2014 hence damping ratios for surge sway heave and roll pitch motions are assumed equal to 0 20 0 10 and 0 20 respectively while yaw damping ratio is assumed equal to 0 05 as suggested by fossen 2011 and confirmed by the numerical simulations carried out by kim et al 2014 finally the in plane platform significant motion amplitude δwf sig is determined based on rayleigh distribution for narrow band

1960 10 s d μ 8 0 qtf ω ω μ 2 s ς ω s ς ω μ dω where qtf is the quadratic transfer function at frequencies ω and ω μ hence based on eq 10 and newman approximation the drift force spectrum of a single

of dogger bank and characterized by water depths ranging from 50 up to 80 m paramor et al 2009 is assumed as first reference site for possible deployment of a wind farm the second site located in the northern north sea near the troll field area is characterized by water depths ranging from 200 up to 350 m significant wave heights and wind speeds are assessed based on metocean statistics around the british isles provided by the english health safety executive hse 2001 as concerns power production the omnidirectional 50 year significant wave height hs 50 yr u10 hub conditional on 10 min wind speed at hub height u10 hub is determined based on relevant marginal distribution with reference to the wind turbine rated speed of 11 4 m s corresponding to maximum thrust as detailed in sub section 4 2 hence environmental data for power production are reported for southern and northern north sea areas in tables 3 a and 3 b where the 50 year wave peak period tp 50 yr the wind speed standard deviation σu c and the current velocity uc are also listed data reported in tables 3 a and 3 b are mainly independent of wave and wind direction despite of extreme loads for parked wind turbine and mooring line fault conditions for which polar plots of 50 year continuous line and 1 year dashed line significant wave heights and 10 min wind speeds are reported in figs 2 a b and 3 a b for southern and northern north sea areas respectively further details are reported in tables 4 a and 4 b based on current results the north west sector is characterized by the highest significant wave heights confirming the main outcomes of feld et al 2015 who investigated the directional and seasonal variabilities of metocean conditions for the north sea area finally as concerns the fls strength check 8 reference directions are investigated on the basis of wave statistics around the british isles provided by the english health safety executive hse 2001 as a function of significant wave height hs classes with 0 50 m step in this respect remaining environmental data namely i wave peak period tp ii 10 min wind speed at 10 m above sea water level u10 10 with standard deviation σu c and iii wind generated current velocity uc are the most probable values conditional on significant wave height in all cases a minimum design life of 25 years is assumed for selected mooring configurations to avoid replacements of mooring lines during the wind farm lifetime finally table 5 also provides the probabilities of occurrence of selected sea states for southern sns and northern north sea nns areas based on the marginal distribution relative to the 8 reference directions it is noticed that sea states with significant wave heights higher than 4 75 m and 6 25 m are characterized by a very low probability of occurrence in the sns and nsn areas respectively so as they are not considered in the assessment of mooring fatigue life 4 2 support structure and wind turbine data the semisubmersible tri floater support structure reported in fig 4 bulder et al 2002 and developed within the drijfwind project is taken as reference design in conjunction with the well known 5 mw offshore wind turbine developed by the national renewable energy laboratory jonkman et al 2009 in fig 4 a 6 line spread mooring system is also represented together with relevant fairlead and anchoring points the platform whose main dimensions are listed in table 6 consists of three vertical columns interconnected by bracings and equipped with 18 m circular flat plates at bottom to increase added masses and damping effects the columns are characterized by a spar type configuration with vertical stiffeners horizontal ring webs and a watertight diaphragm located at 4 m above the bottom and constituting the ceil of a ballast tank partly emptied in moored condition to balance the catenary line suspended weight and keep unchanged the platform design draught the structure designed for the southern north sea on 50 m water depth was initially equipped with a conventional six line hybrid mooring system consisting of 225 m stud less chain cables and 225 m high grade steel wire ropes while in current analysis the entire design space of chain cable catenary mooring systems is investigated varying the line number and scope to detect the minimum weight configuration as a function of environmental data at candidate deployment site on different water depths the main data of the three bladed nrel 5 mw offshore wind turbine are listed in table 7 the converter with an overall mass of about 700 t develops a maximum thrust of 800 kn at the rated speed of 11 4 m s jonkman et al 2009 5 mooring design and selection 5 1 incidence of platform admissible offset and line scope line number and scope as well as platform admissible offset represent the key factors affecting mooring design and selection for fowts in this respect it must be preliminarily pointed out that current offshore rules do not prescribe mandatory values for maximum displacements of fowts provided that operational capabilities of power connection systems may be properly tuned based on support structure maximum admissible offset furthermore a variety of admissible displacement to water depth ratios δadm d is also recognized among different designs proposed by several researchers in fact while the ratio δadm d was taken equal to 0 20 by bulder et al 2002 and lefebvre and collu 2012 on 50 m water depth it was set equal to 0 43 and 0 15 by brommundt et al 2012 at great ekofirsk area and troll field on 75 and 330 m water depths respectively finally benassai et al 2014a b 2015 concluded that the platform admissible displacement has to be properly tuned accounting for i environmental loads at deployment site ii water depth iii line number and iv mooring technology in current analysis two candidate deployment sites the former located in the southern north sea west of dogger bank on water depths ranging from 50 up to 80 m the latter in the northern north sea near the troll field area on water depths ranging from 200 up to 350 m have been selected for possible deployment of a wind farm in both cases r3 stud link chain cables have been chosen as candidate mooring technology in this respect it must pointed out that wire ropes are not suitable for the southern north sea characterized by intermediate water depths nor for the northern north sea as in the latter case relevant minimum weight configurations would be characterized by too high scopes ranging from 9 to 10 so resulting in excessively long mooring lines up to 3000 m length and too wide spacings between adjacent fowts that may be generally limited to 10 times the rotor diameter namely about 1250 m in current analysis furthermore based on the main outcomes of benassai et al 2014a b 2015 6 and 9 line mooring configurations have been selected for both southern and northern north sea areas while the 3 line mooring system has not been analysed as it may cause large drifts of the turbine support structure in case of failure of one mooring line in both cases spread mooring systems with equally spaced lines have been selected as also depicted in fig 4 where a reference 6 line mooring configuration is reported hence for each water depth the platform admissible offset to water depth ratio δadm d has been systematically increased with 0 01 step and the line scope s d was properly tuned to detect the minimum weight configuration according to the flow chart reported in fig 5 ryu et al 2008 and mainly based on three subsequent steps i global analysis of intact load case conditions according to uls criteria ii global analysis of damage load case conditions according to als criteria iii analysis of fatigue life according to fls design criteria particularly after selecting the line number and the water depth for any platform admissible offset to water depth ratio and line scope the chain diameter is iteratively varied until minimum weight configuration contemporarily satisfying uls als and fls design check criteria is obtained hence the minimum weight configuration among all candidate designs complying with the above mentioned criteria is detected in any case candidate mooring configurations have been preliminarily detected based on a fatigue life safety factor γf equal to 5 0 in compliance with offshore planned maintenance inspections by means of rovs nevertheless the incidence of onshore maintenance inspections γf 3 0 has been subsequently investigated with reference to minimum weight configurations 5 2 mooring design and selection for the southern north sea main data of 6 and 9 line minimum weight configurations for dogger bank in the southern north sea detected in compliance with the flow chart reported in fig 5 are listed in tables 8 a and 8 b respectively where the chain diameter dc the platform admissible offset to water depth ratio δadm d and the line scope s d are reported in both cases mooring weight platform admissible offset to water depth ratio and line scope decrease for increasing water depths even if with a gradient that diminishes too as gathered from fig 6 a where distributions of minimum weight configurations versus water depth are reported based on current results the 6 line mooring system can be selected as candidate configuration for the southern north sea as it is always lighter than the 9 line one further weight reductions may be achieved if mooring systems would be regularly inspected at onshore facilities as gathered from fig 6 b where a comparative analysis among minimum weight configurations of 6 line mooring systems designed in compliance with offshore γf 5 0 and onshore γf 3 0 planned maintenance inspections is performed in this respect the incidence of inspection type is almost negligible on 50 m water depth while a percentage decrease ranging from about 2 up to 4 is recognized between 60 and 80 m water depths resulting in a weight reduction ranging from 20 up to 35 t 5 3 mooring design and selection for the northern north sea as for previous deployment site the incidence of line number scope and platform admissible offset is systematically investigated for a wind farm deployed at troll field area located in the northern north sea varying the water depth from 200 up to 350 m with 50 m step in this respect main data of 6 and 9 line minimum weight configurations are reported in tables 9 a and 9 b respectively unlike the previous case mooring weight increases moving towards higher water depths as reported in fig 7 a while both platform admissible offset to water depth ratio and line scope decrease anyway the 6 line mooring configuration still reveals to be slightly lower than the 9 line one so as it may be selected as candidate configuration for further investigation hence in fig 7 b a comparative analysis among offshore and onshore maintenance inspections is performed as predictable latter mooring configurations are slightly lighter than the former with a 7 reduction independently of water depth nevertheless considering that fowts in the northern north sea would be deployed in deep water depths onshore inspections are in any case expected to produce consistently higher maintenance costs during the entire wind farm lifetime as regards offshore maintenance activities which implies that also in this case they do not represent an economically viable choice hence 6 line mooring systems designed in compliance with offshore planned inspections represent the most suitable configuration also for the northern north sea area on deep water depths 5 4 preliminary cost analysis it is well known that the main barriers for mass production and installation of fowts are mainly due to high capital and operating expenditures myhr et al 2014 in this respect as moorings represent a considerable part of installation and maintenance costs proper design and selection of station keeping systems are a basic issue to minimize the wind farm levelised cost of energy lcoe particularly the cost of chains on the international market has been quite volatile in the last decade so as a proper estimate of installation expenses for mooring systems is not a simple issue nevertheless the unit cost of 2keuro t proposed by myhr et al 2014 within a wide analysis devoted to the lcoe assessment for different types of fowts in a life cycle perspective seems to be a reasonable value for fabrication expenses in this respect it must be pointed out that installation costs expected to be a relatively small fraction of fabrication ones are currently not considered as they are quite difficult to assess at least in a preliminary project phase provided that day rates of anchor handling tug and supply ahts vessels and crew daily labour costs are quite volatile on the international market hence based on minimum weight configurations reported in tables 8 a and 9 a for the southern and northern north sea areas respectively relevant costs are reported in fig 8 a where the red interpolating line represents the best fit cost curve in the water depth range from 50 up to 350 m based on current results the cost curve is characterized by a left descending and a right ascending branch with a minimum located at 80 m water depth hence it is conceivable that while in the southern north sea possible cost reductions may be achieved moving the wind farm towards higher water depths compatibly with the site bathymetry namely 80 m in the examined case the opposite holds true for the northern north sea area where wind farms may be located at deployment sites with as low as possible water depths namely 200 m in current analysis finally possible cost reductions as regards the reference values reported in fig 8 a can be achieved if maintenance inspections of mooring systems are scheduled at onshore facilities as reported in fig 8 b from which it is gathered that possible savings lie between 20 and 160 keuro for fowts deployed on 50 and 350 m water depths and that cost reductions between offshore and onshore maintenance inspections increase with a decreasing rate nevertheless it is predictable that in case of visual inspections of mooring systems at onshore facilities increased maintenance expenses mainly due to i detachment of mooring lines ii towing of fowts to shore iii re towing to the wind farm deployment site and iv re attachment of mooring lines are expected to be widely higher than initial savings provided that daily rates including fuel consumption of anchor handling tug supply ahts vessels and tug boats are equal to about 90 and 17 keuro myhr et al 2014 respectively hence based on current results maintenance inspections at onshore facilities may be avoided as far as possible so as 6 line mooring systems designed in compliance with offshore inspections and high fatigue life safety factors represent the most feasible choice for wind farm installations in both southern and northern north sea areas 6 recommendations for mooring design of fowts current results allow suggesting some general recommendations for proper design and selection of mooring systems for fowts that are mainly related to i line number ii platform admissible offset and line scope iii type of scheduled maintenance inspections iv mooring technology i as concerns the line number 6 line mooring systems represent the most suitable design for both southern and northern north sea in the water depth range from 50 up to 350 m provided that they maintain proper station keeping performances in case of failure of one mooring line in this respect 3 line configurations should be avoided at least in authors opinion as they are non redundant and may cause large offsets of the support structure in case of failure of one mooring line ii platform admissible offset and line scope have to be properly tuned to minimize mooring scantlings and installation costs in this respect in fig 9 a and 9 b current values of platform admissible offset to water depth ratio δadm d and line scope s d listed in tables 8 a and 9 a for the southern and northern north sea areas respectively are plotted versus the water depth together with red interpolating curves representing the best fit functions in the analysed water depth range hence based on actual results platform admissible offset and line scope may be chosen accordingly to minimize mooring weights iii as concerns the choice of offshore onshore maintenance inspections obtained results and the preliminary cost analysis suggest that initial savings due to scheduled visual inspections at onshore facilities instead of offshore activities by means of rovs will be certainly overtaken by the increased maintenance costs during the entire wind farm lifetime in this respect it is suggested to design mooring systems complying with high fatigue life safety factors to avoid as far as possible maintenance activities at onshore sites iv finally as the mooring system footprint could influence the distance between adjacent fowts chain cables represent the most suitable technology to avoid excessively large spacings between adjacent wind turbines provided that they would be generally spaced between 6 and 10 times the rotor diameter i e 750 and 1250 m if the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is installed hence minimum distances at analysed water depths and best fit red interpolating curve with lower and upper bound values of spacings between fowts black dotted lines are reported in fig 10 based on current results minimum spacings between fowts due to mooring system footprint are below the suggested lower bound value on intermediate water depths while the opposite holds true on deep water depths where minimum spacings are beyond the suggested upper bound in this respect it is gathered that mooring system footprint doesn t represent a mandatory design restraint for wind farms on intermediate water depths up to about 100 m while it has to be taken into due consideration on deep water depths even becoming a mandatory value to be satisfied beyond 250 m hence it is conceivable that wire ropes do not represent the proper technology on deep water depths as they would be characterized by higher line scopes as regards chain cables so yielding to minimum spacings between adjacent fowts up to 5 km on the contrary it is well known that they are generally not suitable in a standalone configuration on intermediate water depths where in any cases hybrid chain cable wire rope configurations could represent a suitable choice to be further investigated 7 conclusions design and selection of mooring systems for fowts to be deployed in southern and northern north sea areas the former near dogger bank on intermediate water depths the latter at troll field on deep water depths have been analysed to investigate the incidence of station keeping main design parameters on mooring installation and maintenance costs as well as on the overall wind farm design in this respect the dutch tri floater support structure together with the well known 5 mw nrel wind turbine have been chosen as reference design first and second order platform motions have been assessed in the frequency domain by a 6dof dedicated programme developed in matlab mathworks 2014 accounting for drift forces and non stationary loads due to wind turbulence the following main results have been achieved i line number and scope platform admissible offset and offshore onshore scheduled inspections represent a basic issue for a proper mooring design mainly depending on water depth as it has been verified for the two candidate deployment sites in this respect 6 line mooring systems represent the most suitable configuration for fowts deployed in southern and northern north sea areas on water depths ranging from 50 up to 350 m as they assure redundancy of station keeping system in case of failure of one mooring line despite of the commonly applied 3 line configuration and are slightly lighter than 9 line configurations that in turn are characterized by higher installation costs due to the increased line number furthermore it was verified that wire ropes don t represent a feasible design choice for fowts in the examined water depth range as they are characterized by higher line scopes as regards chain cables so resulting in too wide horizontal separations between adjacent wind turbines required to avoid possible overlapping between mooring lines of different support structures this outcome represents one of the basic differences between the mooring design for fowts and the offshore structures for the oil gas industry ii a preliminary cost analysis has been performed from which it has been verified that mooring installation cost decreases from 50 up to 80 m water depth while it increases again beyond it furthermore it was checked that installation savings due to onshore maintenance inspections are overtaken by the increased expenses due to higher maintenance costs during the wind farm lifetime so as visual onshore activities need to be avoided as far as possible hence based on current results a clear dependence of mooring weight on water depth and maintenance inspections is detected from which it is gathered that possible savings due to reduced scantlings are counterbalanced by the increased costs due to onshore maintenance inspections differently from the oil gas offshore structures where in some cases the opposite holds true iii some recommendations for proper design and selection of mooring systems have been provided mainly focusing on line number platform admissible offset and line scope offshore onshore maintenance inspections minimum spacings between adjacent fowts in this respect recommendations for mooring design of fowts reported in section 7 represent one of the first attempts towards a cost based design of mooring systems and allow assessing already in a preliminary project phase the optimal stationkeeping configuration expected to minimize the total installation costs nevertheless current outcomes need to be further investigated analysing the candidate mooring configurations at different water depths by more refined models in the time domain focusing on hybrid chain cable wire rope configurations on intermediate water depths and more accurately evaluating the overall mooring installations and maintenance costs in a life cycle perspective also with reference to relevant incidence on the wind farm levelised cost of energy acknowledgements the paper has
