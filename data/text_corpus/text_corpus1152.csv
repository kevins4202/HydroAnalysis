5760,the hydraulic conductivity of soil is a fundamental parameter that should be obtained both in hydrological and geotechnical studies since it relates to a series of hazards in earthen engineering projects whereas investigations on dispersive soils especially those distributed in cold regions have rarely been reported this study aims to explore the characteristics of permeability by using a dispersive soil from northeastern china as well as the effects of soil salinity and freeze thaw on the variation in hydraulic conductivity indoor constant head permeation tests were conducted on artificially prepared specimens and initial soil suctions were measured by the filter paper method to assist the analyses the results demonstrated that the hydraulic conductivity decayed with permeation time until reaching relative stability and both maximum and relatively stable values kmax and krs respectively should be adopted for comprehensively characterizing the permeability of dispersive soils increasing salt content increased the kmax exponentially and the inflection salt content was approximately 1 5 from which a sharp increase in kmax appeared the krs showed a slight increase with initial salt contents as well freeze thaw yielded nonmonotonic changes in the permeability as kmax peaked at 5 freeze thaw cycles the variation in krs was similar the osmotic suction positively correlated with kmax but did not fully contribute to the sharp increase in kmax since it increased linearly with the salt content without mutation points the number of freeze thaw cycles influenced the relationship between the osmotic suction and kmax the matric and osmotic suctions posed opposite impacts on the permeability more importantly detailed discussions for the underlying mechanisms of the abovementioned novel observations were illustrated these results may serve as good references for understanding the features of the permeability of dispersive soils in seasonally frozen regions domestically or worldwide keywords dispersive soil hydraulic conductivity suction salt content freeze thaw cycle 1 introduction dispersive soil is distributed in many arid or semiarid parts of the world and has not received enough attention until the 1960s in hydraulic engineering practice in australia turgut et al 2017 it is recognized as unstable and highly erodible and dispersive soils are highly susceptible to erosion and piping when interacting with water in geotechnical and geo environmental projects bell and walker 2000 nagy et al 2016 unlike other types of special soils such as loess frozen soil and soft clay the study on dispersive soil is still in its infancy at present for such a type of problematic soil the main research hotspot is dispersity identification and improvement against dispersity for the purpose of weakening or eliminating its dispersive characteristics to ensure the applicability of earthen materials in the intended project areas covered with dispersive soils the interference of low salinity water or purified water would make the soil aggregates quickly disintegrate into primary grains and repel each other furthermore the relatively high content of exchangeable sodium ion is generally considered responsible for dispersity some common parameters related to cations in soil for instance exchangeable sodium percentage and sodium adsorption ratio are employed for describing the level of dispersity and some new concepts and methods were also reported fan and kong 2013 rengasamy and marchuk 2011 rengasamy et al 2016 zorluer et al 2010 in addition various treatments were applied for soil amelioration such as chemical additives abbasi et al 2017 goodarzi and salimi 2015 ouhadi and goodarzi 2006 shoghi et al 2017 turkoz et al 2014 turkoz et al 2018 vakili et al 2017 biological additives moravej et al 2018 or even physical methods vakili et al 2018 to overcome dispersion and improve the geotechnical properties to serve as references for practical engineering needs however if dispersive soil is used in large scale earthen channels dams or road embankments in situ the method of amelioration might be unrealistic instead physical covers such as geotextiles can be an alternative choice since the physical cover is not strictly impervious and its cover area is limited liquid water is sure to infiltrate into the body of the dispersive soil and deflocculate the soil particles forming internal erosion which is a large potential threat to soil stability therefore understanding the permeability of dispersive soil is of great significance in hazard control and numerical calculation of protection in practical engineering activities which can also be used to assist in the analysis of the water salt migration process in addition erosion usually occurs synchronously through permeation therefore understanding the characteristics of permeation also contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the dispersion process some previous studies on the permeability of dispersive soils may help us perform this study for example yousaf et al 1987 demonstrated the clay dispersion caused by the decreasing electrolyte concentration and increasing the sodium adsorption ratio led to a corresponding reduction in the permeability of salt affected soils levy et al 2005 concluded that the impacts of salinity sodicity and wetting rate jointly gave rise to a complexity in the estimation of soil permeability dikinya et al 2006 attributed the decrease in permeability to microscopic changes including internal swelling dispersion and pore diameter reduction that occurred during the permeation process ben hur et al 2009 indicated that clay dispersion is the main factor causing a significant decrease in soil permeability after deionized water leaching hydraulic conductivity as a fundamental geotechnical engineering parameter reflects the ability and velocity of water flow passing through the soil body and inherent features of soil such as structural pore characteristics deng et al 2015 romero 2013 mineral composition prakash et al 2016 as well as external factors like disturbance state pusch and schomburg 1999 and effective stress zeng et al 2011 were reported in previous studies to have connections with hydraulic conductivity moreover the geotechnical properties of soils distributed in cold regions suffer significant variations due to periodic freeze thaw cycles qi et al 2006 which can appreciably deteriorate the soil structure in the forms of apparent manifestations in the aggregate size changes and crack expansion zhang et al 2016 as a consequence the looser soil structure provides preferential paths for water migration sterpi 2015 fruitful investigations have corroborated the influences of consecutive freeze thaw on the hydraulic conductivity of fine grained soils in cold regions konrad and samson 2000 sterpi 2015 yıldız and soğancı 2012 or in underground engineering hirose and ito 2017 tang and yan 2015 combined with microfabric observation hohmann porebska 2002 concluded that the hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils and soil bentonite mixtures subjected to freeze thaw achieved a significant increase up to 2 3 orders of magnitude a survey from hanay et al 2003 demonstrated that the trend in variation of saturated hydraulic conductivity of clay relied on the exchangeable sodium percentage as freeze thaw cycles increased interestingly makusa et al 2016 drew an unconventional conclusion in which the hydraulic conductivity of a stabilized dredged sediment exhibited a decreasing increasing or unchanged trend of the discontinuous microcracks induced by the initial high unconfined compressive strength with increasing freeze thaw cycles konrad and samson 2000 confirmed that decreasing the freezing temperature increased the permeability index of a silty clay consequently for the dispersive soil distribution in cold regions such as northeastern china the effect of freeze thaw cannot be neglected for the investigation on the hydraulic conductivity to be close to reality another factor that should be considered is soil salinity the salt content of soil in situ frequently fluctuates rather than remains unchanged as a result of dynamic weather conditions it is also of practical significance to consider salt content as an influencing factor the existing literature has revealed some specific relationships between salt content and hydraulic conductivity of other soil types vidyapin and cheverev 2008 observed that for the frozen sodium chloride salted kaolinite clay the hydraulic conductivity of the unfrozen zone decreased with increasing salt content while that of the frozen zone showed an opposite trend deng et al 2006 reported that the total salt content of qinghai tibet clay had a negative influence on the hydraulic conductivity and the sodium sulfate in the soil had a stronger ability to decrease the hydraulic conductivity than that of sodium chloride chen et al 2016 drew similar conclusions on rammed earth unfortunately such a relationship has not been explored for dispersive soil because scholars are more focused on the study of erosion phenomena enlightened by the abovementioned research deficiency and with the consideration of the temperature change and salinity fluctuation in the field through conducting constant head permeation tests the current experimental study aims to explore a the characteristics of the permeation process of dispersive soil b the individual and synergistic effects of the soil salinity and freeze thaw cycles on the variation in hydraulic conductivity and c the relationship between the initial unsaturated state and the maximum permeability of dispersive soils 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil properties the dispersive soils evolving from quaternary alluvial and lacustrine sediments were sampled near one bank slope collapse area of a linear open channel in qian an of northeastern china where there is an arid semiarid seasonally frozen region as shown in fig 1 a c the dispersity of soil can be identified based on field observations because there is breakdown or disintegration of single aggregates after immersion in water emerson 1967 loveday and pyle 1973 and fig 1 d e shows the obvious dispersity by judging from its large scale instability feature and its crusting appearance which are the consequences of interaction with water the collected samples were air dried first and then homogenized ahead of testing the basic properties as listed in table 1 were strictly tested according to gb t50123 1999 1999 in addition it should be clarified that the total soluble salt content was lower than the value suggested by general specification 0 3 due to salt transported along with concentrated rainfall water in forms of surface flow and downward seepage before sampling in the summer of 2018 parameters related to dispersity including the sodium adsorption ratio total dissolved salts na k ca mg and sodium percentage were equal to 10 8 8 83 meq l and 81 5 respectively according to the sodium percentage versus total dissolved salt chart proposed by sherard et al 1972 the soil was located in the dispersive zone the cation exchange capacity was equal to 16 38 cmolc kg which was measured by using edta nh4oac method based on jtge40 2007 2007 moreover the soil was classified as lean clay based on the unified soil classification system astm 2011 mineral compositions were obtained by x ray diffraction analyses as listed in table 2 2 2 specimen preparation for natural soils with salinity the desalination procedure is usually necessary for further studies however considering that the long term immersion of the soil in water might cause irreversible changes in the structure to maximally retain the dispersity feature of the natural soils air dried soils were directly used in preparation considering the time dependent salt content and the range of variation in soil salinity based on previous in situ observations in the study area different salt contents including 0 3 0 6 1 0 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 0 were prepared and the analytical pure sodium bicarbonate powder was chosen as an additive based on the chemical properties mentioned above note that the here means the percentage of the total weight of soluble salt in a prepared soil specimen to the weight of corresponding mixture of dried soil and sodium bicarbonate powder the planned water content and wet density were 20 and 1 80 g cm3 respectively first the homogenized air dried soil samples that passed a 2 mm sieve were evenly mixed with calculated dosages of salt powder and then the mixture was gradually humidified by a sprayer containing a calculated volume of distilled water within a short time to prevent excessive evaporation the mixture was next transferred to a cylindrical space created by two face to face cutting rings φ79 8 mm 20 mm and was compacted to a height of 20 mm the demolded specimens were wrapped with preservative films sealed in valve bags fig 2 and removed into moisturizing tanks for spare 2 3 freeze thaw test in this study 0 1 5 10 20 and 30 freeze thaw cycles were conducted in a homemade temperature controllable freezer a complete cycle consisted of a 12 hour freezing process at 20 c and a 12 hour thawing process at 20 c these set temperatures could ensure thorough freezing and thawing of free water in the soil specimens 2 4 constant head permeation test the measurement of hydraulic conductivity was performed on a modified device as shown in fig 3 which was designed based on darcy s law the device could provide stable fluid injection with constant head pressure the stainless steel specimen chamber was fully enclosed ensuring that the injected fluid could only permeate from the bottom to the top of the installed soil specimen controlled by an air compressor the head pressure could be accurately adjusted and kept stable moreover the leachate was weighed by an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0 001 g and all the data could be automatically recorded by the equipped software in this study since the required size of a soil specimen for this device was 61 8 mm in diameter each soil specimen subjected to freeze thaw to be tested was carefully cut by using a cutting ring coated with vaseline first and the smaller soil specimen confined by a cutting ring was installed in the stainless steel chamber distilled water was selected for injection as low salinity water could stimulate appreciable potential of dispersity considering that the dispersive soil easily eroded the head pressure was set as 0 007 mpa as pre experiments demonstrated that a lower head pressure would make the infiltration process extremely time consuming while a higher value such as 0 015 mpa could soon break up the intact specimen in addition it should be emphasized that the soil specimens were not artificially saturated in water ahead of the permeation tests considering that the secondary internal structure modified by freeze thaw might be destroyed by water due to clay dispersity the following formula was used for determining the hydraulic conductivity deng et al 2015 1 k t q t ai where kt denotes the real time hydraulic conductivity m s qt denotes the leachate volume per time m3 s a denotes the cross sectional area of the soil specimen m2 and i denotes the hydraulic gradient 2 5 suction measurement to quantify the unsaturated characteristics of dispersive soil suctions were measured based on the filter paper method for specimens undergoing different freeze thaw cycles corresponding to the filter paper used shuangquan no 203 produced in china the suction was calculated based on the following calibration equations proposed by bai et al 2011 and wang et al 2003 total suction 2 lg h t 5 257 0 070 ω ω 41 lg h t 51 321 1 194 ω ω 41 matric suction 3 lg h m 5 493 0 076 ω ω 47 lg h m 2 470 0 012 ω ω 47 where ht and hm denote the total and matric suctions kpa respectively and ω denotes the water content of the filter paper hence the osmotic suction ho can be determined 4 h o h t h m 3 results and discussion 3 1 real time hydraulic conductivity fig 4 shows the real time hydraulic conductivity of artificially prepared dispersive soil specimens in each experimental case which depicts the dynamic evolution of hydraulic conductivity through the permeation process these data are the basis of the following analyses obviously in the initial stage it can be seen that the dispersive soil with higher salt content has more prominent permeability in terms of the numerical value of real time hydraulic conductivity regardless of the freeze thaw cycles moreover the hydraulic conductivity of the 2 0 case decreases sharply to relative stability within 1000 s and 1 75 and 1 5 cases exhibit similar variation trends but with much lower rates of reduction in order when the salt content is lower than 1 5 the hydraulic conductivity undergoes little fluctuation during the whole process another important phenomenon is that the hydraulic conductivities corresponding to the first several data points are usually smaller than their next indicating that the hydraulic conductivity does not monotonically decrease from the maximum although the period of rise is very short in addition the real time hydraulic conductivity is smaller than 10 8 m s when the salt content is less than 1 5 for each case and its magnitude markedly depends on the effect of freeze thaw when the salt content is not less than 1 5 unlike many other nondispersive soils exhibiting relatively stable hydraulic conductivity against experimental time such as soft clay the hydraulic conductivity of dispersive soil can be deemed a processual parameter based on fig 4 it can be inferred that the injected water flows slowly at the beginning simultaneously the injected water ceaselessly expels the interior air in the specimen and the injected water flows rapidly soon after the predominant permeation channels form leading the hydraulic conductivity to a transitory increase however due to the strong dispersity of the soil increasing flow velocity can easily erode the surrounding aggregates into the flow causing clogging in the predominant permeation channels hence a sudden decrease in the hydraulic conductivity occurs in addition this process also accompanies a decrease in the salt concentration in the soil system differences induced by freeze thaw cycles primarily lie in the time required to form predominant permeation channels on the base of the existing microfractures after that when the structural evolution of the soil reaches a dynamic equilibrium and the exchange capacity between the injected water and the pore solution reaches a maximum the injected water in the specimen body has the features of approximate laminar flow such transformation is especially notable at high salt contents this indicates that the hydraulic conductivity of dispersive soil is both structure and salinity dependent it is necessary to rationally characterize the hydraulic conductivities of specimens in different experimental cases from fig 4 by employing the same method because the hydraulic conductivity of dispersive soil is regarded as a processual parameter merely using one characteristic value might be inappropriate for description therefore we believe that both the maximum and relatively stable hydraulic conductivities kmax and krs respectively should be adopted together to define the permeability of dispersive soil as the kmax reflects the soil dispersity in terms of the influences from structure and substance composition and the krs reflects the time independent feature that can be utilized in temporal analyses the kmax can be easily retrieved while the krs can be determined after mathematically fitting the data by using the following function 5 k t a b a t n t n p n where kt denotes the real time hydraulic conductivity at time t and a b p and n are fitting parameters this fitting ignores whether the essential relationship exists between the two dimensional data and only considers the numerical value in this study the krs corresponds to the fitting value when t equals 4000 s at which time the real time hydraulic conductivity fluctuates very little fig 4 note that for cases including 0 3 salt content 0 freeze thaw cycle 0 6 salt content 1 freeze thaw cycle and 0 6 salt content 10 freeze thaw cycles the fitting results reach a constant value when the time is far less than 4000 s therefore these constant values are adopted as the krs 3 2 effect of soil salinity on hydraulic conductivity the relationship between different salt contents and kmax is depicted in fig 5 it is clear that the kmax approximates an exponential increment with increasing salt content regardless of the number of freeze thaw cycles the fitting curve for each case is given as shown in fig 5 a f and each goodness of fitting is above 98 5 higher salinity has a higher upper limit of permeability that is carbonate salt plays a positive role in migrating water through the pore channels of dispersive soil in the early permeation stage moreover when the salt content is no more than 1 25 the difference in kmax is small after exceeding 1 25 there is a sharp increase in the kmax especially from 1 75 to 2 0 salt content with a rate of increase ranging from 92 fig 5 f to 313 fig 5 c associated with different freeze thaw cycles the maximum kmax occurs after 5 cycles with a value of 2 68 10 7 m s at 2 0 salt content followed by 1 75 10 7 7 84 10 8 6 11 10 8 5 61 10 8 and 5 56 10 8 m s corresponding to 1 0 10 20 and 30 freeze thaw cycles for the 2 0 salt content case respectively to determine the salt content at the inflection point from which the kmax increases sharply piecewise linear fittings are performed as shown in fig 5 a f note that the first four and the last three data points in each subfigure are fitted the results demonstrate that the salt content at the inflection point varies between 1 370 and 1 535 approximately 1 5 which increases from 0 to 5 freeze thaw cycles and then decreases somewhat in the following cycles suggesting that the freeze thaw treatment has a conspicuous influence on the impact of the salt content on the kmax of dispersive soil since the kmax is derived at the initial stage of permeation the initial salt content of each specimen is sure to affect its kmax note that the water content is targeted as 20 thus increasing the salt content will lead to a greater amount of sodium ions and a higher concentration of pore solution accompanying the migration of pore solution in the soil body the dissociated salt ions interact with the surrounding soil particles koniorczyk 2012 there is a positive correlation between the clay dispersity and ph of clay soil chorom et al 1994 and obviously higher soil ph associates with lower hydraulic conductivity suarez et al 1984 however in this study for soil specimens with the lowest 0 3 salt content the concentration of the solution is equal to 0 113 mol l based on the dosages of sodium bicarbonate powder and distilled water and at this concentration or higher the ph changes within a narrow range with increasing salt content at a constant testing temperature according to chemical theory approximately 8 31 this creates basically the same initial property of ph for all the soil specimens in this study and the effect of ph is not considered here consequently the increase in salt content has little influence on the initial soil ph and the variation in kma x is attributed to the aggregate changes affected by the diffuse double layer for clayey soils with a certain water content the effect of soluble salt on the soil properties primarily lies in influencing the feature of the diffuse double layer han et al 2018 the nature of the diffuse double layer has a certain regular influence on the permeability behavior of clay chen et al 2019 achari et al 1999 has applied the theory of diffuse double layer for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of clays for permeants of known composition when the concentration of sodium bicarbonate in the pore solution is low the monovalent sodium ions have the ability to induce thick hydration films and disperse clay particles from each other elkady and al mahbashi 2017 whereas when continuously increasing the salt content the concentration of the pore solution shifts to be the leading role in thinning the thickness of the diffuse double layer han et al 2018 increasing the thickness of the diffuse double layer can strengthen the electrostatic repulsion between the clay particles dolinar and trauner 2007 combining the current experimental results it can be elaborated that when the salt content is less than approximately 1 5 the weak increase in kmax is the consequence of relative structural equilibrium as a result of the mutual conflict of both the effects of increasing the amount of sodium ions and increasing the concentration of the pore solution during which the thickness of the diffuse double layer decreases slightly thereafter when the salt content continues to increase to more than 1 5 the concentration of the pore solution exceeds the threshold the diffuse double layer becomes significantly thinner the distance between the aggregates becomes much shorter and the attraction of the thinner water film greatly increases in summary the thickness of the diffuse double layer decreases slightly from 0 3 to approximately 1 5 salt content and then decreases markedly after exceeding the threshold salt content increase in salt content could bring changes in the microstructure of the soil aggregates liu and zhang 2014 as illustrated in fig 6 the higher salt content of the soil will promote the clay particles to unite with surrounding particles to form larger particles the flocculation results from the compressed diffuse double layer bahloul et al 2016 however limited to the aggregation ability and because of the primary existing pores and micro fissures clay particles are prone to flock together to form many independent larger aggregates and separate from each other which closes the interaggregate pores and enlarges the pore apertures similarly zhang et al 2014 observed that a looser microstructure of cement stabilized clay was formed at a higher salt concentration the above changes conceivably show that at the initial stage of permeation the number of pore channels along the streamline direction that the injected water encountered decreases relatively meanwhile the enlarged pore apertures have a positive effect in accelerating flow advance resulting in the weakening of the random flow diversion effect shortening the infiltration time and consequently increasing the hydraulic conductivity in the current study the kmax increases slightly at the same order of magnitude when the salt content increases from 0 3 to 1 25 and after exceeding the inflection point namely approximately 1 5 the kmax has a significant increase even with an increase of only a 0 25 in salt content it can be concluded that the salt content at the inflection point is a threshold value from which appreciable structural alternation is triggered in forms of generating more distributed newly bonded clay aggregates with larger sizes as well as more concomitant pore channels with larger apertures fig 5 also presents the variation in krs versus salt content of each specimen corresponding to the time of 4000 s at which time the permeation process is in a relatively stable stage the specimen approaches a saturated state and the internal dispersion and channel clogging exhibit a balance the krs is in the range of 1 18 10 9 8 94 10 9 m s below 10 8 m s because of the successive injection of distilled water the salt is gradually leached out of the soil specimen and thus the pore solution is diluted therefore in fact the salt content corresponding to krs is nominal for instance for the case of 1 5 salt content 0 freeze thaw cycle the krs is 5 30 10 9 m s while when the hydraulic conductivity of the specimen drops to this value the salt content of the specimen is already less than 1 5 hence the magnitude of krs depends on the residual amount of soluble salt when discussing the effect of soil salinity on it it is important to note that measurement of residual salt content was not conducted in this study based on the foregoing discussions the lower concentration of the pore solution may recover or even strengthen the random distribution of the pore channels and the larger clay aggregates disintegrate into smaller ones as a result of the behavior of residual dispersity and the increase in the thickness of the diffuse double layer this phenomenon is particularly evident when the nominal salt content is not less than 1 5 it is interesting that there is a slight increase in krs with nominal salt content no matter how many cycles of freeze thaw reflecting that there may be a proportional relationship between the nominal and residual salt contents for the specimens before and after hydraulic permeation and further investigations are needed to clarify this 3 3 effect of freeze thaw on hydraulic conductivity fig 7 shows the changes in kmax with freeze thaw cycles at different soil salinities the changes are not monotonous and are greatly affected by the number of freeze thaw cycles a global pattern can apparently be noticed that the kmax increases after suffering the first freeze thaw cycle reaches its maximum after experiencing 5 freeze thaw cycles decreases after 10 cycles and then fluctuates somewhat in the following 20 cycles despite some data exceptions although the pattern can be considered independent of salinity the change in kmax between adjacent freeze thaw cycles such as from 5 to 10 cycles is found to be related to the salt content soil samples with different salt contents have different rates of change in kmax after the same freeze thaw cycles for instance the changes in kmax subjected to 1 freeze thaw cycle are relatively small with gradients of 25 3 31 3 and 6 0 when the salt contents are 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 respectively however the increases are more significant with gradients of 80 5 48 1 166 7 and 122 7 when the salt content increases from 1 25 to 2 0 whereas the pattern between the values of the gradient and salt content is not obvious furthermore when the salt content is below 2 0 different numbers of freeze thaw cycles do not cause a change in the order of magnitude of kmax as the kmax varies with an order of magnitude of 10 9 m s for specimens with salt contents from 0 3 to 1 25 and of 10 8 m s for salt contents of 1 5 and 1 75 however when the salt content is 2 0 the kmax of the specimen exceeds 10 7 m s after 1 and 5 freeze thaw cycles and then decreases to an order of magnitude of 10 8 m s after 20 and 30 cycles this proves that the degree of influence of the freeze thaw cycles on the maximum permeability of the dispersive soil has a close connection with the soil salinity the main contribution of freeze thaw cycles to the change in soil properties is by changing the soil microstructure and particle composition zhang et al 2016 the above results in this study also indicate that the effect of periodic freeze thaw cycles does not merely deteriorate and simplify the soil structure but also complicate the soil structure after specific cycles within the first few cycles of freeze thaw corresponding to the first 5 cycles here the deterioration of the structure is manifested in the volume expansion caused by the freezing of free water in the pore channels of the dispersive soil during the freezing process which further agglomerates the soil aggregates surrounded by ice crystals and closes the interaggregate pores attention should be paid to the fact that the freezing point of loosely bound water of clayey soil particles is below 20 c while the freezing temperature of 20 c set in this experiment is not able to result in the phase change of loosely bound water accordingly it is considered that the diffuse double layer of a soil particle is almost unaffected by freeze thaw and the function of the diffuse double layer is reversible after freeze thaw cycles during the thawing process the ice crystals in the pore channels undergo phase transformation into liquid water and the liquid free water becomes redistributed in the soil specimen whereas the smaller units contained in the agglomerated soil aggregates cannot completely regain the distribution state before freezing due to the reduction in distance and the enhancement of adsorption from the diffuse double layer this leads to the decrease in the amount of pore channels and the increase in pore apertures as a consequence the permeability strengthens because the soil structure becomes more fissured and jointed eigenbrod 1996 and the kmax increases hohmann porebska 2002 also emphasized that the permeability of soil meets with the most intensive alterations during the first several freeze thaw cycles after 10 freeze thaw cycles the freezing of free water weakens in the soil aggregation because of the enhanced redistribution and migration of free water during the thawing process the redistributed free water has more chances to enter into the larger interaggregate pores and undergoes phase transformation under freezing conditions which forces the larger aggregates to disintegrate into smaller ones creating more smaller aggregates per unit space and increasing their density increasing the number of potential pore channels for permeability improving the randomness for injected water selecting the permeability channels while passing through the soil and extending the permeation time thus the kmax decreases noticeably with the increasing number of freeze thaw cycles at a certain salt content as shown in fig 7 the phenomenon that the kmax basically reaches stability between 10 and 30 freeze thaw cycles might be due to the equilibrium between the redistribution of the free water and its phase transformation during freezing and thawing therefore a dynamic equilibrium is attained in the internal structure of the soil specimen wang et al 2007 furthermore the slight fluctuation in the kmax in fig 7 from 10 to 30 cycles is due to the randomness of the redistribution action of the free water which can be considered to have less impact on the overall pattern moreover the variation in krs as given in fig 7 basically agrees with the form of the pattern for kmax however its degree of variation caused by freeze thaw is relatively lower compared with that of kmax this is attributed to the transformation by water injection to the soil microstructure during permeation because of the soil dispersity the number of microfissures decreases the density of the pore channels for permeation increases and the soil samples become more homogeneous hence most of the initial modifications in the soil specimens resulting from the freeze thaw cycles have already been eliminated by the water permeation process after 4000 s 3 4 relationship between soil suctions and kmax as the permeation process proceeds the degree of saturation of the soil specimen gradually increases that is the specimen shifts from an unsaturated state to a saturated state therefore it is meaningless to establish the relationship between krs and soil suction while the kmax is bound to be affected by the initial suction of the soil specimen which has great significance for investigation of unsaturated dispersive soil fig 8 shows the effect of the salt content on the evolution of kmax with the soil suction of dispersive soil under different freeze thaw cycles obviously the kmax has a clear exponential increase with increasing osmotic suction regardless of the freeze thaw cycles and the variation trend is similar to that shown in fig 5 besides it can be seen from fig 8 that under different freeze thaw cycles there is a negative correlation between the matric suction and kmax the effect of freeze thaw cycles on the evolution of kmax with soil suctions of dispersive soil with different salt contents is presented in fig 9 a g for the relationship between the osmotic suction and kmax because of the acceptable fluctuations in data the curve under a certain salt content does not advance monotonously with the increase in freeze thaw cycles instead some turns appear on the curves with increasing freeze thaw cycles for example as shown in fig 9 a when the number of freeze thaw cycles increases from 1 to 5 the kmax increases with increasing osmotic suction however when the number of freeze thaw cycles increases from 5 to 10 the osmotic suction and kmax decrease synchronously while when the number of freeze thaw cycles increases from 20 to 30 increasing osmotic suction leads to a reduction in kmax despite the small variation in kmax to better understand the overall pattern for the relationship between the osmotic suction and kmax with different freeze thaw cycles the variation trend from one data point to the next data point is employed as shown in fig 9 h if the variation trend falls in zone i and zone iii there is a positive correlation between osmotic suction and kmax otherwise if the variation trend falls in zone ⅱ and zone ⅳ the correlation is negative the summary result shown in fig 9 h reveals that the osmotic suction is positively related to kmax in the first 20 freeze thaw cycles and is negatively related from 20 to 30 cycles note that from 5 to 10 cycles the decreasing osmotic suction reduces the kmax similarly fig 9 i summarizes the pattern for the relationship between the matric suction and kmax and it is interesting that such a relationship is opposite to that given in fig 9 h in the first 20 freeze thaw cycles while it is consistent from 20 to 30 cycles the soil suctions are the overall reflections of the abovementioned analyses on physical processes involving changes in microstructure and granularity as presented in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the variations in osmotic suction and matric suction in different experimental cases are plotted in fig 10 since the water content of each specimen is equal increasing the salt content causes more solute sodium bicarbonate in this study to dissolve in the pore water thus the osmotic suction increases in an approximately linear way as shown in fig 10 a the increase in kmax accompanies increasing osmotic suction showing a positive correlation however the relationship between kmax and the salt content as demonstrated in fig 5 and the relationship between kmax and the osmotic suction as illustrated in fig 8 both indicate that the salt content of approximately 1 5 is an inflection point from which the kmax is significantly affected while no remarkable mutation salt contents are found in fig 10 a for all the cases thus it can be concluded that the osmotic suction is not the chief factor contributing to such a sharp increase in kmax it is the combined effect of particle aggregation and modification of the pore channels that leads to such variation as the osmotic suction is mainly controlled by the solute concentration of the pore solution in the soil under the same freeze thaw condition it is also interesting that the matric suction decreases almost linearly with increasing salt content as shown in fig 10 b and this pattern accords with the analyses presented in section 3 2 where the increasing salinity is believed to be beneficial to agglomerate smaller particles or aggregates into larger ones and enlarge the pore channels in the dispersive soil resulting in the local capillary effect as a component of matric suction weakening and the matric suction decreases accordingly a novel finding is that the osmotic suction is affected by freeze thaw when the salt content is constant as reflected in fig 10 a based on the analyses stated in section 3 3 freeze thaw cycles affect the relative amount of bound water and free water by alternating the size of aggregates and the distance between aggregates the pore water in clayey soil consists of bound water and nonbound water the bound water includes strongly and loosely bound water and the nonbound water includes liquid gaseous and solid water for a thawed unsaturated clay the solute in the pore water refers to the solute in the strongly bound water weakly bound water and liquid free water the suction represents the free energy of the pore water in the soil and the free energies of the bound water and free water are different therefore the transformation between the bound water and free water will affect the total free energy of the pore water because their relative amounts are changed when other conditions are the same and then affect the osmotic suction in this study as shown in fig 10 a the first 5 freeze thaw cycles gradually agglomerate soil aggregates together the newly bonded aggregates have larger sizes and surfaces as well as a greater number of monovalent sodium ions and absorb more free water surrounded by them as a result the free water transforms into bound water with lower osmotic potential thus the osmotic suction increases from 5 to 10 cycles the disintegration of newly bonded aggregates releases some bound water into the free water and similarly the osmotic suction decreases from 10 to 20 cycles the variation in aggregates reaches an equilibrium and there are some acceptable fluctuations whereas the osmotic suction increases somewhat after 30 cycles which might be attributed to the reaggregation effect induced by the randomness of the redistribution action of the free water this reveals that the kmax of dispersive soil with a certain salinity is mainly controlled by the osmotic suction when the number of freeze thaw cycles is no more than 20 and after 30 cycles the effect of the osmotic suction weakens in addition as depicted in fig 10 b the matric suction basically decreases with increasing freeze thaw cycles while the kmax increases showing that the matric suction in dispersive soil has an opposite impact on the kmax when the salt content is the same 4 conclusions the impacts of soil salinity and freeze thaw as well as the resulting soil suctions on the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated dispersive soil were investigated in this study the major conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the hydraulic conductivity of dispersive soil is proposed to be described by maximum and relatively stable values kmax and krs respectively together since it is deemed a processual parameter the kmax links to the unsaturated state and reflects soil dispersity in terms of the influences from structural and substance composition and the krs is appropriate to be applied in temporal studies related to permeability 2 an approximately exponential relationship between the salt content and kmax was found regardless of the number of freeze thaw cycles the salt content of approximately 1 5 is a threshold value from which a significant increase begins to appear in the kmax although the krs increases slightly with increasing salt content this nominal salt content should be replaced with the residual salt content due to the injected water flow in the specimen that brings salt away as a result of the soil dispersity and salt dilution in the later equilibrium stage 3 the effect of freeze thaw cycles on kmax is not monotonous regardless of the salt content 5 cycles induce the greatest positive influence on the magnitude of kmax based on experimental results while a reduction is found after 10 cycles and there are some smaller variations from 20 to 30 cycles the pattern of changes in krs with increasing freeze thaw cycles basically accords with that of kmax but with a smaller degree of variation 4 subjected to the same freeze thaw cycles the kmax of dispersive soil is positively correlated with the osmotic suction but negatively correlated with the matric suction the number of freeze thaw cycles influences the relationship between the osmotic suction and kmax when the salt content is the same the relationship between kmax and the osmotic suction is positive in the first 20 cycles and the effect weakens after 30 cycles such influence does not exist in the relationship between kmax and the matric suction since the two indexes basically remain negatively correlated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was funded by the key project of

5760,the hydraulic conductivity of soil is a fundamental parameter that should be obtained both in hydrological and geotechnical studies since it relates to a series of hazards in earthen engineering projects whereas investigations on dispersive soils especially those distributed in cold regions have rarely been reported this study aims to explore the characteristics of permeability by using a dispersive soil from northeastern china as well as the effects of soil salinity and freeze thaw on the variation in hydraulic conductivity indoor constant head permeation tests were conducted on artificially prepared specimens and initial soil suctions were measured by the filter paper method to assist the analyses the results demonstrated that the hydraulic conductivity decayed with permeation time until reaching relative stability and both maximum and relatively stable values kmax and krs respectively should be adopted for comprehensively characterizing the permeability of dispersive soils increasing salt content increased the kmax exponentially and the inflection salt content was approximately 1 5 from which a sharp increase in kmax appeared the krs showed a slight increase with initial salt contents as well freeze thaw yielded nonmonotonic changes in the permeability as kmax peaked at 5 freeze thaw cycles the variation in krs was similar the osmotic suction positively correlated with kmax but did not fully contribute to the sharp increase in kmax since it increased linearly with the salt content without mutation points the number of freeze thaw cycles influenced the relationship between the osmotic suction and kmax the matric and osmotic suctions posed opposite impacts on the permeability more importantly detailed discussions for the underlying mechanisms of the abovementioned novel observations were illustrated these results may serve as good references for understanding the features of the permeability of dispersive soils in seasonally frozen regions domestically or worldwide keywords dispersive soil hydraulic conductivity suction salt content freeze thaw cycle 1 introduction dispersive soil is distributed in many arid or semiarid parts of the world and has not received enough attention until the 1960s in hydraulic engineering practice in australia turgut et al 2017 it is recognized as unstable and highly erodible and dispersive soils are highly susceptible to erosion and piping when interacting with water in geotechnical and geo environmental projects bell and walker 2000 nagy et al 2016 unlike other types of special soils such as loess frozen soil and soft clay the study on dispersive soil is still in its infancy at present for such a type of problematic soil the main research hotspot is dispersity identification and improvement against dispersity for the purpose of weakening or eliminating its dispersive characteristics to ensure the applicability of earthen materials in the intended project areas covered with dispersive soils the interference of low salinity water or purified water would make the soil aggregates quickly disintegrate into primary grains and repel each other furthermore the relatively high content of exchangeable sodium ion is generally considered responsible for dispersity some common parameters related to cations in soil for instance exchangeable sodium percentage and sodium adsorption ratio are employed for describing the level of dispersity and some new concepts and methods were also reported fan and kong 2013 rengasamy and marchuk 2011 rengasamy et al 2016 zorluer et al 2010 in addition various treatments were applied for soil amelioration such as chemical additives abbasi et al 2017 goodarzi and salimi 2015 ouhadi and goodarzi 2006 shoghi et al 2017 turkoz et al 2014 turkoz et al 2018 vakili et al 2017 biological additives moravej et al 2018 or even physical methods vakili et al 2018 to overcome dispersion and improve the geotechnical properties to serve as references for practical engineering needs however if dispersive soil is used in large scale earthen channels dams or road embankments in situ the method of amelioration might be unrealistic instead physical covers such as geotextiles can be an alternative choice since the physical cover is not strictly impervious and its cover area is limited liquid water is sure to infiltrate into the body of the dispersive soil and deflocculate the soil particles forming internal erosion which is a large potential threat to soil stability therefore understanding the permeability of dispersive soil is of great significance in hazard control and numerical calculation of protection in practical engineering activities which can also be used to assist in the analysis of the water salt migration process in addition erosion usually occurs synchronously through permeation therefore understanding the characteristics of permeation also contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the dispersion process some previous studies on the permeability of dispersive soils may help us perform this study for example yousaf et al 1987 demonstrated the clay dispersion caused by the decreasing electrolyte concentration and increasing the sodium adsorption ratio led to a corresponding reduction in the permeability of salt affected soils levy et al 2005 concluded that the impacts of salinity sodicity and wetting rate jointly gave rise to a complexity in the estimation of soil permeability dikinya et al 2006 attributed the decrease in permeability to microscopic changes including internal swelling dispersion and pore diameter reduction that occurred during the permeation process ben hur et al 2009 indicated that clay dispersion is the main factor causing a significant decrease in soil permeability after deionized water leaching hydraulic conductivity as a fundamental geotechnical engineering parameter reflects the ability and velocity of water flow passing through the soil body and inherent features of soil such as structural pore characteristics deng et al 2015 romero 2013 mineral composition prakash et al 2016 as well as external factors like disturbance state pusch and schomburg 1999 and effective stress zeng et al 2011 were reported in previous studies to have connections with hydraulic conductivity moreover the geotechnical properties of soils distributed in cold regions suffer significant variations due to periodic freeze thaw cycles qi et al 2006 which can appreciably deteriorate the soil structure in the forms of apparent manifestations in the aggregate size changes and crack expansion zhang et al 2016 as a consequence the looser soil structure provides preferential paths for water migration sterpi 2015 fruitful investigations have corroborated the influences of consecutive freeze thaw on the hydraulic conductivity of fine grained soils in cold regions konrad and samson 2000 sterpi 2015 yıldız and soğancı 2012 or in underground engineering hirose and ito 2017 tang and yan 2015 combined with microfabric observation hohmann porebska 2002 concluded that the hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils and soil bentonite mixtures subjected to freeze thaw achieved a significant increase up to 2 3 orders of magnitude a survey from hanay et al 2003 demonstrated that the trend in variation of saturated hydraulic conductivity of clay relied on the exchangeable sodium percentage as freeze thaw cycles increased interestingly makusa et al 2016 drew an unconventional conclusion in which the hydraulic conductivity of a stabilized dredged sediment exhibited a decreasing increasing or unchanged trend of the discontinuous microcracks induced by the initial high unconfined compressive strength with increasing freeze thaw cycles konrad and samson 2000 confirmed that decreasing the freezing temperature increased the permeability index of a silty clay consequently for the dispersive soil distribution in cold regions such as northeastern china the effect of freeze thaw cannot be neglected for the investigation on the hydraulic conductivity to be close to reality another factor that should be considered is soil salinity the salt content of soil in situ frequently fluctuates rather than remains unchanged as a result of dynamic weather conditions it is also of practical significance to consider salt content as an influencing factor the existing literature has revealed some specific relationships between salt content and hydraulic conductivity of other soil types vidyapin and cheverev 2008 observed that for the frozen sodium chloride salted kaolinite clay the hydraulic conductivity of the unfrozen zone decreased with increasing salt content while that of the frozen zone showed an opposite trend deng et al 2006 reported that the total salt content of qinghai tibet clay had a negative influence on the hydraulic conductivity and the sodium sulfate in the soil had a stronger ability to decrease the hydraulic conductivity than that of sodium chloride chen et al 2016 drew similar conclusions on rammed earth unfortunately such a relationship has not been explored for dispersive soil because scholars are more focused on the study of erosion phenomena enlightened by the abovementioned research deficiency and with the consideration of the temperature change and salinity fluctuation in the field through conducting constant head permeation tests the current experimental study aims to explore a the characteristics of the permeation process of dispersive soil b the individual and synergistic effects of the soil salinity and freeze thaw cycles on the variation in hydraulic conductivity and c the relationship between the initial unsaturated state and the maximum permeability of dispersive soils 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil properties the dispersive soils evolving from quaternary alluvial and lacustrine sediments were sampled near one bank slope collapse area of a linear open channel in qian an of northeastern china where there is an arid semiarid seasonally frozen region as shown in fig 1 a c the dispersity of soil can be identified based on field observations because there is breakdown or disintegration of single aggregates after immersion in water emerson 1967 loveday and pyle 1973 and fig 1 d e shows the obvious dispersity by judging from its large scale instability feature and its crusting appearance which are the consequences of interaction with water the collected samples were air dried first and then homogenized ahead of testing the basic properties as listed in table 1 were strictly tested according to gb t50123 1999 1999 in addition it should be clarified that the total soluble salt content was lower than the value suggested by general specification 0 3 due to salt transported along with concentrated rainfall water in forms of surface flow and downward seepage before sampling in the summer of 2018 parameters related to dispersity including the sodium adsorption ratio total dissolved salts na k ca mg and sodium percentage were equal to 10 8 8 83 meq l and 81 5 respectively according to the sodium percentage versus total dissolved salt chart proposed by sherard et al 1972 the soil was located in the dispersive zone the cation exchange capacity was equal to 16 38 cmolc kg which was measured by using edta nh4oac method based on jtge40 2007 2007 moreover the soil was classified as lean clay based on the unified soil classification system astm 2011 mineral compositions were obtained by x ray diffraction analyses as listed in table 2 2 2 specimen preparation for natural soils with salinity the desalination procedure is usually necessary for further studies however considering that the long term immersion of the soil in water might cause irreversible changes in the structure to maximally retain the dispersity feature of the natural soils air dried soils were directly used in preparation considering the time dependent salt content and the range of variation in soil salinity based on previous in situ observations in the study area different salt contents including 0 3 0 6 1 0 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 0 were prepared and the analytical pure sodium bicarbonate powder was chosen as an additive based on the chemical properties mentioned above note that the here means the percentage of the total weight of soluble salt in a prepared soil specimen to the weight of corresponding mixture of dried soil and sodium bicarbonate powder the planned water content and wet density were 20 and 1 80 g cm3 respectively first the homogenized air dried soil samples that passed a 2 mm sieve were evenly mixed with calculated dosages of salt powder and then the mixture was gradually humidified by a sprayer containing a calculated volume of distilled water within a short time to prevent excessive evaporation the mixture was next transferred to a cylindrical space created by two face to face cutting rings φ79 8 mm 20 mm and was compacted to a height of 20 mm the demolded specimens were wrapped with preservative films sealed in valve bags fig 2 and removed into moisturizing tanks for spare 2 3 freeze thaw test in this study 0 1 5 10 20 and 30 freeze thaw cycles were conducted in a homemade temperature controllable freezer a complete cycle consisted of a 12 hour freezing process at 20 c and a 12 hour thawing process at 20 c these set temperatures could ensure thorough freezing and thawing of free water in the soil specimens 2 4 constant head permeation test the measurement of hydraulic conductivity was performed on a modified device as shown in fig 3 which was designed based on darcy s law the device could provide stable fluid injection with constant head pressure the stainless steel specimen chamber was fully enclosed ensuring that the injected fluid could only permeate from the bottom to the top of the installed soil specimen controlled by an air compressor the head pressure could be accurately adjusted and kept stable moreover the leachate was weighed by an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0 001 g and all the data could be automatically recorded by the equipped software in this study since the required size of a soil specimen for this device was 61 8 mm in diameter each soil specimen subjected to freeze thaw to be tested was carefully cut by using a cutting ring coated with vaseline first and the smaller soil specimen confined by a cutting ring was installed in the stainless steel chamber distilled water was selected for injection as low salinity water could stimulate appreciable potential of dispersity considering that the dispersive soil easily eroded the head pressure was set as 0 007 mpa as pre experiments demonstrated that a lower head pressure would make the infiltration process extremely time consuming while a higher value such as 0 015 mpa could soon break up the intact specimen in addition it should be emphasized that the soil specimens were not artificially saturated in water ahead of the permeation tests considering that the secondary internal structure modified by freeze thaw might be destroyed by water due to clay dispersity the following formula was used for determining the hydraulic conductivity deng et al 2015 1 k t q t ai where kt denotes the real time hydraulic conductivity m s qt denotes the leachate volume per time m3 s a denotes the cross sectional area of the soil specimen m2 and i denotes the hydraulic gradient 2 5 suction measurement to quantify the unsaturated characteristics of dispersive soil suctions were measured based on the filter paper method for specimens undergoing different freeze thaw cycles corresponding to the filter paper used shuangquan no 203 produced in china the suction was calculated based on the following calibration equations proposed by bai et al 2011 and wang et al 2003 total suction 2 lg h t 5 257 0 070 ω ω 41 lg h t 51 321 1 194 ω ω 41 matric suction 3 lg h m 5 493 0 076 ω ω 47 lg h m 2 470 0 012 ω ω 47 where ht and hm denote the total and matric suctions kpa respectively and ω denotes the water content of the filter paper hence the osmotic suction ho can be determined 4 h o h t h m 3 results and discussion 3 1 real time hydraulic conductivity fig 4 shows the real time hydraulic conductivity of artificially prepared dispersive soil specimens in each experimental case which depicts the dynamic evolution of hydraulic conductivity through the permeation process these data are the basis of the following analyses obviously in the initial stage it can be seen that the dispersive soil with higher salt content has more prominent permeability in terms of the numerical value of real time hydraulic conductivity regardless of the freeze thaw cycles moreover the hydraulic conductivity of the 2 0 case decreases sharply to relative stability within 1000 s and 1 75 and 1 5 cases exhibit similar variation trends but with much lower rates of reduction in order when the salt content is lower than 1 5 the hydraulic conductivity undergoes little fluctuation during the whole process another important phenomenon is that the hydraulic conductivities corresponding to the first several data points are usually smaller than their next indicating that the hydraulic conductivity does not monotonically decrease from the maximum although the period of rise is very short in addition the real time hydraulic conductivity is smaller than 10 8 m s when the salt content is less than 1 5 for each case and its magnitude markedly depends on the effect of freeze thaw when the salt content is not less than 1 5 unlike many other nondispersive soils exhibiting relatively stable hydraulic conductivity against experimental time such as soft clay the hydraulic conductivity of dispersive soil can be deemed a processual parameter based on fig 4 it can be inferred that the injected water flows slowly at the beginning simultaneously the injected water ceaselessly expels the interior air in the specimen and the injected water flows rapidly soon after the predominant permeation channels form leading the hydraulic conductivity to a transitory increase however due to the strong dispersity of the soil increasing flow velocity can easily erode the surrounding aggregates into the flow causing clogging in the predominant permeation channels hence a sudden decrease in the hydraulic conductivity occurs in addition this process also accompanies a decrease in the salt concentration in the soil system differences induced by freeze thaw cycles primarily lie in the time required to form predominant permeation channels on the base of the existing microfractures after that when the structural evolution of the soil reaches a dynamic equilibrium and the exchange capacity between the injected water and the pore solution reaches a maximum the injected water in the specimen body has the features of approximate laminar flow such transformation is especially notable at high salt contents this indicates that the hydraulic conductivity of dispersive soil is both structure and salinity dependent it is necessary to rationally characterize the hydraulic conductivities of specimens in different experimental cases from fig 4 by employing the same method because the hydraulic conductivity of dispersive soil is regarded as a processual parameter merely using one characteristic value might be inappropriate for description therefore we believe that both the maximum and relatively stable hydraulic conductivities kmax and krs respectively should be adopted together to define the permeability of dispersive soil as the kmax reflects the soil dispersity in terms of the influences from structure and substance composition and the krs reflects the time independent feature that can be utilized in temporal analyses the kmax can be easily retrieved while the krs can be determined after mathematically fitting the data by using the following function 5 k t a b a t n t n p n where kt denotes the real time hydraulic conductivity at time t and a b p and n are fitting parameters this fitting ignores whether the essential relationship exists between the two dimensional data and only considers the numerical value in this study the krs corresponds to the fitting value when t equals 4000 s at which time the real time hydraulic conductivity fluctuates very little fig 4 note that for cases including 0 3 salt content 0 freeze thaw cycle 0 6 salt content 1 freeze thaw cycle and 0 6 salt content 10 freeze thaw cycles the fitting results reach a constant value when the time is far less than 4000 s therefore these constant values are adopted as the krs 3 2 effect of soil salinity on hydraulic conductivity the relationship between different salt contents and kmax is depicted in fig 5 it is clear that the kmax approximates an exponential increment with increasing salt content regardless of the number of freeze thaw cycles the fitting curve for each case is given as shown in fig 5 a f and each goodness of fitting is above 98 5 higher salinity has a higher upper limit of permeability that is carbonate salt plays a positive role in migrating water through the pore channels of dispersive soil in the early permeation stage moreover when the salt content is no more than 1 25 the difference in kmax is small after exceeding 1 25 there is a sharp increase in the kmax especially from 1 75 to 2 0 salt content with a rate of increase ranging from 92 fig 5 f to 313 fig 5 c associated with different freeze thaw cycles the maximum kmax occurs after 5 cycles with a value of 2 68 10 7 m s at 2 0 salt content followed by 1 75 10 7 7 84 10 8 6 11 10 8 5 61 10 8 and 5 56 10 8 m s corresponding to 1 0 10 20 and 30 freeze thaw cycles for the 2 0 salt content case respectively to determine the salt content at the inflection point from which the kmax increases sharply piecewise linear fittings are performed as shown in fig 5 a f note that the first four and the last three data points in each subfigure are fitted the results demonstrate that the salt content at the inflection point varies between 1 370 and 1 535 approximately 1 5 which increases from 0 to 5 freeze thaw cycles and then decreases somewhat in the following cycles suggesting that the freeze thaw treatment has a conspicuous influence on the impact of the salt content on the kmax of dispersive soil since the kmax is derived at the initial stage of permeation the initial salt content of each specimen is sure to affect its kmax note that the water content is targeted as 20 thus increasing the salt content will lead to a greater amount of sodium ions and a higher concentration of pore solution accompanying the migration of pore solution in the soil body the dissociated salt ions interact with the surrounding soil particles koniorczyk 2012 there is a positive correlation between the clay dispersity and ph of clay soil chorom et al 1994 and obviously higher soil ph associates with lower hydraulic conductivity suarez et al 1984 however in this study for soil specimens with the lowest 0 3 salt content the concentration of the solution is equal to 0 113 mol l based on the dosages of sodium bicarbonate powder and distilled water and at this concentration or higher the ph changes within a narrow range with increasing salt content at a constant testing temperature according to chemical theory approximately 8 31 this creates basically the same initial property of ph for all the soil specimens in this study and the effect of ph is not considered here consequently the increase in salt content has little influence on the initial soil ph and the variation in kma x is attributed to the aggregate changes affected by the diffuse double layer for clayey soils with a certain water content the effect of soluble salt on the soil properties primarily lies in influencing the feature of the diffuse double layer han et al 2018 the nature of the diffuse double layer has a certain regular influence on the permeability behavior of clay chen et al 2019 achari et al 1999 has applied the theory of diffuse double layer for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of clays for permeants of known composition when the concentration of sodium bicarbonate in the pore solution is low the monovalent sodium ions have the ability to induce thick hydration films and disperse clay particles from each other elkady and al mahbashi 2017 whereas when continuously increasing the salt content the concentration of the pore solution shifts to be the leading role in thinning the thickness of the diffuse double layer han et al 2018 increasing the thickness of the diffuse double layer can strengthen the electrostatic repulsion between the clay particles dolinar and trauner 2007 combining the current experimental results it can be elaborated that when the salt content is less than approximately 1 5 the weak increase in kmax is the consequence of relative structural equilibrium as a result of the mutual conflict of both the effects of increasing the amount of sodium ions and increasing the concentration of the pore solution during which the thickness of the diffuse double layer decreases slightly thereafter when the salt content continues to increase to more than 1 5 the concentration of the pore solution exceeds the threshold the diffuse double layer becomes significantly thinner the distance between the aggregates becomes much shorter and the attraction of the thinner water film greatly increases in summary the thickness of the diffuse double layer decreases slightly from 0 3 to approximately 1 5 salt content and then decreases markedly after exceeding the threshold salt content increase in salt content could bring changes in the microstructure of the soil aggregates liu and zhang 2014 as illustrated in fig 6 the higher salt content of the soil will promote the clay particles to unite with surrounding particles to form larger particles the flocculation results from the compressed diffuse double layer bahloul et al 2016 however limited to the aggregation ability and because of the primary existing pores and micro fissures clay particles are prone to flock together to form many independent larger aggregates and separate from each other which closes the interaggregate pores and enlarges the pore apertures similarly zhang et al 2014 observed that a looser microstructure of cement stabilized clay was formed at a higher salt concentration the above changes conceivably show that at the initial stage of permeation the number of pore channels along the streamline direction that the injected water encountered decreases relatively meanwhile the enlarged pore apertures have a positive effect in accelerating flow advance resulting in the weakening of the random flow diversion effect shortening the infiltration time and consequently increasing the hydraulic conductivity in the current study the kmax increases slightly at the same order of magnitude when the salt content increases from 0 3 to 1 25 and after exceeding the inflection point namely approximately 1 5 the kmax has a significant increase even with an increase of only a 0 25 in salt content it can be concluded that the salt content at the inflection point is a threshold value from which appreciable structural alternation is triggered in forms of generating more distributed newly bonded clay aggregates with larger sizes as well as more concomitant pore channels with larger apertures fig 5 also presents the variation in krs versus salt content of each specimen corresponding to the time of 4000 s at which time the permeation process is in a relatively stable stage the specimen approaches a saturated state and the internal dispersion and channel clogging exhibit a balance the krs is in the range of 1 18 10 9 8 94 10 9 m s below 10 8 m s because of the successive injection of distilled water the salt is gradually leached out of the soil specimen and thus the pore solution is diluted therefore in fact the salt content corresponding to krs is nominal for instance for the case of 1 5 salt content 0 freeze thaw cycle the krs is 5 30 10 9 m s while when the hydraulic conductivity of the specimen drops to this value the salt content of the specimen is already less than 1 5 hence the magnitude of krs depends on the residual amount of soluble salt when discussing the effect of soil salinity on it it is important to note that measurement of residual salt content was not conducted in this study based on the foregoing discussions the lower concentration of the pore solution may recover or even strengthen the random distribution of the pore channels and the larger clay aggregates disintegrate into smaller ones as a result of the behavior of residual dispersity and the increase in the thickness of the diffuse double layer this phenomenon is particularly evident when the nominal salt content is not less than 1 5 it is interesting that there is a slight increase in krs with nominal salt content no matter how many cycles of freeze thaw reflecting that there may be a proportional relationship between the nominal and residual salt contents for the specimens before and after hydraulic permeation and further investigations are needed to clarify this 3 3 effect of freeze thaw on hydraulic conductivity fig 7 shows the changes in kmax with freeze thaw cycles at different soil salinities the changes are not monotonous and are greatly affected by the number of freeze thaw cycles a global pattern can apparently be noticed that the kmax increases after suffering the first freeze thaw cycle reaches its maximum after experiencing 5 freeze thaw cycles decreases after 10 cycles and then fluctuates somewhat in the following 20 cycles despite some data exceptions although the pattern can be considered independent of salinity the change in kmax between adjacent freeze thaw cycles such as from 5 to 10 cycles is found to be related to the salt content soil samples with different salt contents have different rates of change in kmax after the same freeze thaw cycles for instance the changes in kmax subjected to 1 freeze thaw cycle are relatively small with gradients of 25 3 31 3 and 6 0 when the salt contents are 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 respectively however the increases are more significant with gradients of 80 5 48 1 166 7 and 122 7 when the salt content increases from 1 25 to 2 0 whereas the pattern between the values of the gradient and salt content is not obvious furthermore when the salt content is below 2 0 different numbers of freeze thaw cycles do not cause a change in the order of magnitude of kmax as the kmax varies with an order of magnitude of 10 9 m s for specimens with salt contents from 0 3 to 1 25 and of 10 8 m s for salt contents of 1 5 and 1 75 however when the salt content is 2 0 the kmax of the specimen exceeds 10 7 m s after 1 and 5 freeze thaw cycles and then decreases to an order of magnitude of 10 8 m s after 20 and 30 cycles this proves that the degree of influence of the freeze thaw cycles on the maximum permeability of the dispersive soil has a close connection with the soil salinity the main contribution of freeze thaw cycles to the change in soil properties is by changing the soil microstructure and particle composition zhang et al 2016 the above results in this study also indicate that the effect of periodic freeze thaw cycles does not merely deteriorate and simplify the soil structure but also complicate the soil structure after specific cycles within the first few cycles of freeze thaw corresponding to the first 5 cycles here the deterioration of the structure is manifested in the volume expansion caused by the freezing of free water in the pore channels of the dispersive soil during the freezing process which further agglomerates the soil aggregates surrounded by ice crystals and closes the interaggregate pores attention should be paid to the fact that the freezing point of loosely bound water of clayey soil particles is below 20 c while the freezing temperature of 20 c set in this experiment is not able to result in the phase change of loosely bound water accordingly it is considered that the diffuse double layer of a soil particle is almost unaffected by freeze thaw and the function of the diffuse double layer is reversible after freeze thaw cycles during the thawing process the ice crystals in the pore channels undergo phase transformation into liquid water and the liquid free water becomes redistributed in the soil specimen whereas the smaller units contained in the agglomerated soil aggregates cannot completely regain the distribution state before freezing due to the reduction in distance and the enhancement of adsorption from the diffuse double layer this leads to the decrease in the amount of pore channels and the increase in pore apertures as a consequence the permeability strengthens because the soil structure becomes more fissured and jointed eigenbrod 1996 and the kmax increases hohmann porebska 2002 also emphasized that the permeability of soil meets with the most intensive alterations during the first several freeze thaw cycles after 10 freeze thaw cycles the freezing of free water weakens in the soil aggregation because of the enhanced redistribution and migration of free water during the thawing process the redistributed free water has more chances to enter into the larger interaggregate pores and undergoes phase transformation under freezing conditions which forces the larger aggregates to disintegrate into smaller ones creating more smaller aggregates per unit space and increasing their density increasing the number of potential pore channels for permeability improving the randomness for injected water selecting the permeability channels while passing through the soil and extending the permeation time thus the kmax decreases noticeably with the increasing number of freeze thaw cycles at a certain salt content as shown in fig 7 the phenomenon that the kmax basically reaches stability between 10 and 30 freeze thaw cycles might be due to the equilibrium between the redistribution of the free water and its phase transformation during freezing and thawing therefore a dynamic equilibrium is attained in the internal structure of the soil specimen wang et al 2007 furthermore the slight fluctuation in the kmax in fig 7 from 10 to 30 cycles is due to the randomness of the redistribution action of the free water which can be considered to have less impact on the overall pattern moreover the variation in krs as given in fig 7 basically agrees with the form of the pattern for kmax however its degree of variation caused by freeze thaw is relatively lower compared with that of kmax this is attributed to the transformation by water injection to the soil microstructure during permeation because of the soil dispersity the number of microfissures decreases the density of the pore channels for permeation increases and the soil samples become more homogeneous hence most of the initial modifications in the soil specimens resulting from the freeze thaw cycles have already been eliminated by the water permeation process after 4000 s 3 4 relationship between soil suctions and kmax as the permeation process proceeds the degree of saturation of the soil specimen gradually increases that is the specimen shifts from an unsaturated state to a saturated state therefore it is meaningless to establish the relationship between krs and soil suction while the kmax is bound to be affected by the initial suction of the soil specimen which has great significance for investigation of unsaturated dispersive soil fig 8 shows the effect of the salt content on the evolution of kmax with the soil suction of dispersive soil under different freeze thaw cycles obviously the kmax has a clear exponential increase with increasing osmotic suction regardless of the freeze thaw cycles and the variation trend is similar to that shown in fig 5 besides it can be seen from fig 8 that under different freeze thaw cycles there is a negative correlation between the matric suction and kmax the effect of freeze thaw cycles on the evolution of kmax with soil suctions of dispersive soil with different salt contents is presented in fig 9 a g for the relationship between the osmotic suction and kmax because of the acceptable fluctuations in data the curve under a certain salt content does not advance monotonously with the increase in freeze thaw cycles instead some turns appear on the curves with increasing freeze thaw cycles for example as shown in fig 9 a when the number of freeze thaw cycles increases from 1 to 5 the kmax increases with increasing osmotic suction however when the number of freeze thaw cycles increases from 5 to 10 the osmotic suction and kmax decrease synchronously while when the number of freeze thaw cycles increases from 20 to 30 increasing osmotic suction leads to a reduction in kmax despite the small variation in kmax to better understand the overall pattern for the relationship between the osmotic suction and kmax with different freeze thaw cycles the variation trend from one data point to the next data point is employed as shown in fig 9 h if the variation trend falls in zone i and zone iii there is a positive correlation between osmotic suction and kmax otherwise if the variation trend falls in zone ⅱ and zone ⅳ the correlation is negative the summary result shown in fig 9 h reveals that the osmotic suction is positively related to kmax in the first 20 freeze thaw cycles and is negatively related from 20 to 30 cycles note that from 5 to 10 cycles the decreasing osmotic suction reduces the kmax similarly fig 9 i summarizes the pattern for the relationship between the matric suction and kmax and it is interesting that such a relationship is opposite to that given in fig 9 h in the first 20 freeze thaw cycles while it is consistent from 20 to 30 cycles the soil suctions are the overall reflections of the abovementioned analyses on physical processes involving changes in microstructure and granularity as presented in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the variations in osmotic suction and matric suction in different experimental cases are plotted in fig 10 since the water content of each specimen is equal increasing the salt content causes more solute sodium bicarbonate in this study to dissolve in the pore water thus the osmotic suction increases in an approximately linear way as shown in fig 10 a the increase in kmax accompanies increasing osmotic suction showing a positive correlation however the relationship between kmax and the salt content as demonstrated in fig 5 and the relationship between kmax and the osmotic suction as illustrated in fig 8 both indicate that the salt content of approximately 1 5 is an inflection point from which the kmax is significantly affected while no remarkable mutation salt contents are found in fig 10 a for all the cases thus it can be concluded that the osmotic suction is not the chief factor contributing to such a sharp increase in kmax it is the combined effect of particle aggregation and modification of the pore channels that leads to such variation as the osmotic suction is mainly controlled by the solute concentration of the pore solution in the soil under the same freeze thaw condition it is also interesting that the matric suction decreases almost linearly with increasing salt content as shown in fig 10 b and this pattern accords with the analyses presented in section 3 2 where the increasing salinity is believed to be beneficial to agglomerate smaller particles or aggregates into larger ones and enlarge the pore channels in the dispersive soil resulting in the local capillary effect as a component of matric suction weakening and the matric suction decreases accordingly a novel finding is that the osmotic suction is affected by freeze thaw when the salt content is constant as reflected in fig 10 a based on the analyses stated in section 3 3 freeze thaw cycles affect the relative amount of bound water and free water by alternating the size of aggregates and the distance between aggregates the pore water in clayey soil consists of bound water and nonbound water the bound water includes strongly and loosely bound water and the nonbound water includes liquid gaseous and solid water for a thawed unsaturated clay the solute in the pore water refers to the solute in the strongly bound water weakly bound water and liquid free water the suction represents the free energy of the pore water in the soil and the free energies of the bound water and free water are different therefore the transformation between the bound water and free water will affect the total free energy of the pore water because their relative amounts are changed when other conditions are the same and then affect the osmotic suction in this study as shown in fig 10 a the first 5 freeze thaw cycles gradually agglomerate soil aggregates together the newly bonded aggregates have larger sizes and surfaces as well as a greater number of monovalent sodium ions and absorb more free water surrounded by them as a result the free water transforms into bound water with lower osmotic potential thus the osmotic suction increases from 5 to 10 cycles the disintegration of newly bonded aggregates releases some bound water into the free water and similarly the osmotic suction decreases from 10 to 20 cycles the variation in aggregates reaches an equilibrium and there are some acceptable fluctuations whereas the osmotic suction increases somewhat after 30 cycles which might be attributed to the reaggregation effect induced by the randomness of the redistribution action of the free water this reveals that the kmax of dispersive soil with a certain salinity is mainly controlled by the osmotic suction when the number of freeze thaw cycles is no more than 20 and after 30 cycles the effect of the osmotic suction weakens in addition as depicted in fig 10 b the matric suction basically decreases with increasing freeze thaw cycles while the kmax increases showing that the matric suction in dispersive soil has an opposite impact on the kmax when the salt content is the same 4 conclusions the impacts of soil salinity and freeze thaw as well as the resulting soil suctions on the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated dispersive soil were investigated in this study the major conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the hydraulic conductivity of dispersive soil is proposed to be described by maximum and relatively stable values kmax and krs respectively together since it is deemed a processual parameter the kmax links to the unsaturated state and reflects soil dispersity in terms of the influences from structural and substance composition and the krs is appropriate to be applied in temporal studies related to permeability 2 an approximately exponential relationship between the salt content and kmax was found regardless of the number of freeze thaw cycles the salt content of approximately 1 5 is a threshold value from which a significant increase begins to appear in the kmax although the krs increases slightly with increasing salt content this nominal salt content should be replaced with the residual salt content due to the injected water flow in the specimen that brings salt away as a result of the soil dispersity and salt dilution in the later equilibrium stage 3 the effect of freeze thaw cycles on kmax is not monotonous regardless of the salt content 5 cycles induce the greatest positive influence on the magnitude of kmax based on experimental results while a reduction is found after 10 cycles and there are some smaller variations from 20 to 30 cycles the pattern of changes in krs with increasing freeze thaw cycles basically accords with that of kmax but with a smaller degree of variation 4 subjected to the same freeze thaw cycles the kmax of dispersive soil is positively correlated with the osmotic suction but negatively correlated with the matric suction the number of freeze thaw cycles influences the relationship between the osmotic suction and kmax when the salt content is the same the relationship between kmax and the osmotic suction is positive in the first 20 cycles and the effect weakens after 30 cycles such influence does not exist in the relationship between kmax and the matric suction since the two indexes basically remain negatively correlated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was funded by the key project of

5761,artificial neural networks anns are increasingly used for flood forecasting the performance of these models relies on the selection of appropriate inputs however input variable selection ivs is typically performed using expert knowledge or simple linear methods this research compares and evaluates four ivs methods including two model free methods partial correlation pc partial mutual information pmi and two novel model based methods an improved input omission io and improved combined neural pathway strength cnps a comprehensive comparison of performance efficacy for multiple ivs methods has not been published in literature before each method is used for daily and hourly lead times in the bow and don rivers both in canada respectively these watersheds represent different hydrological systems and were selected to highlight the performance of the ivs methods under differing conditions this research determines that the proposed cnps produces the strongest performing anns based on the robustness of the inputs selected comparison to other ivs methods and models developed without ivs additionally this research demonstrates that standard termination criteria do not reliably identify the optimum number of inputs for the anns and using a model based optimization of inputs is recommended as a result it is recommended that the number of inputs be determined using a systematic approach where each input selection is informed by an ivs based input ranking rather than a predefined termination criterion lastly this research demonstrates that input usefulness is not binary concept the correct number of selected inputs is dependant on the desired model complexity instead of an arbitrarily selected ivs termination criteria keywords flow forecasting artificial neural networks input variable selection partial mutual information input omission neural pathway strength analysis 1 introduction in coming years the risk of riverine flooding in urban areas is expected to increase which is driven by factors such as climate change and rapid urbanization asce 2000 toronto and region conservation authority 2018 wilby 2006 one way that flood damage can be mitigated is with early flood warning systems which are used to provide advance warning of flood conditions to local authorities and floodplain occupants reducing the risk of property damage and loss of life shrubsole et al 1993 yin et al 2004 flood warning systems typically utilize rainfall runoff models to estimate future stage or discharge levels historically rainfall runoff models have been developed based on physical processes these models rely on the simplification of complex hydrological processes which are highly nonlinear and exhibit high spatial and temporal variability asce 2000 khan and valeo 2016 wijesekara et al 2012 throughout the past two decades data driven models ddms have emerged as competitive alternatives to physically based models for characterizing rainfall runoff systems asce 2000 dawson and wilby 2001 shrestha and nestmann 2009 while physically based models rely on principles of physics to describe a system ddms are based on mathematical relationships between data that characterizes the system solomatine and ostfeld 2008 among data driven methods artificial neural networks anns are the most widely used for flow forecasting solomatine and ostfeld 2008 anns which are inspired by biological neural networks have a framework consisting of interconnected groups of input hidden and output nodes see fig 1 each connection has a numeric weight while hidden and output nodes both have a numeric bias and a nonlinear activation function weights and biases are typically initialized to a random starting point then adjusted based on an objective or cost function such as the sum of squared error recent research in this field has largely focused on optimization algorithms that are used to train or calibrate the models such as the use of swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithms to boost model performance to improve the accuracy of future predictions of stage or discharge in rivers maier et al 2018 meshram et al 2018 however there are fundamental aspects of ann model development that are still widely overlooked including optimizing the architecture or the structure of the networks i e the number of layers and nodes in the hidden layers the uncertainty associated with the amount of data used for training versus validation or testing the models and the selection of the best inputs needed for optimal model performance this last component is the focus of the present research 1 1 overview of input variable selection while ann models have demonstrated their suitability for modelling rainfall runoff systems the selection of input variables a process commonly referred to as input variable selection ivs consistently receives little attention maier et al 2010 maier and dandy 2000 may et al 2011 ivs methods are typically used to identify the most useful inputs from a larger set of candidate input variables where usefulness is defined as having maximum relevancy to the output while minimizing redundancy with other candidate inputs may et al 2011 reducing the number of model inputs is important for minimizing computational demand addressing the curse of dimensionality trunk 1979 reducing output variability caused by local minima on the error surface and informing the behaviour of the physical system bowden et al 2005a may et al 2008a šindelář and babuška 2004 many applications of anns in hydrology do not describe a systematic ivs process or rely on methods such as a priori knowledge of the system trial and error or linear cross correlation abrahart et al 2012 bowden et al 2005a maier and dandy 2000 moreover each of these approaches has limitations expert knowledge of hydrological systems is not dependably available for many systems or may be unreliable trial and error approaches where a brute force method is used to determine the best inputs are computationally intensive especially for ann systems with a large number of candidate inputs may et al 2011 lastly linear cross correlation which is the most commonly used data driven ivs approach is limited to identifying discrete linear relationships between the output and individual candidate inputs abrahart et al 2008 nanda et al 2016 while methods such as cross correlation may be useful for reducing the number of inputs included in the set of candidates by providing modellers with the approximate lag times between monitoring points it is unable to capture the interdependencies redundancies and nonlinearities typical of hydrological systems abrahart et al 2012 therefore there is a clear need for more robust ivs methods that do not rely on a priori knowledge or assumptions about the system are computationally inexpensive and can characterise nonlinear and interdependent relationships between candidate inputs ivs has been the focus of multiple review papers that provide a comprehensive overview of its taxonomy and methods in water resources modelling bowden et al 2005a maier et al 2010 may et al 2011 ivs methods can be grouped into two broad categories model free methods and model based methods both of which are described below along with the four ivs techniques partial correlation partial mutual information input omission and combined neural pathway strength that are the focus of this research following this review the overall objectives of the research are presented 1 1 1 model free methods model free ivs methods do not rely on a pre existing model bowden et al 2005a may et al 2011 most ivs methods belong to this classification and it includes common methods such as a priori knowledge and linear correlation the first ivs method examined in this research is partial correlation pc which is based on linear correlation however unlike most linear correlation based methods the pc criteria reduces the likelihood of linear redundancy between input variables this is done by iteratively selecting inputs from the candidate set and controlling each new selection with the inputs that have already been selected may et al 2011 the pc method iteratively selects inputs using a forward selection algorithm in which the partial correlation between candidate inputs and the target variable is calculated at each step where the input selected depends on the previous iteration he et al 2011 may et al 2008b sharma 2000 sharma et al 2000 this approach is criticized by may et al 2008 who stated that linear model free methods are not suitable for non linear models such as anns he et al 2011 demonstrated that while inferior to its partial mutual information pmi based counterpart described below pc is reasonably capable of identifying useful inputs the second model free method examined in this research is partial mutual information pmi similar to pc pmi is used in a forward selection algorithm since each selection depends on the previous one pmi based ivs was first used by sharma 2000 and sharma et al 2000 who used a bootstrapping algorithm to check for statistical significance of each pmi value which is used as the termination criterion for the algorithm bowden et al 2005a b apply pmi to predict river salinity using a two step algorithm where pmi is firstly used to select appropriate lagged inputs for each monitoring station then selects from the reduced set of candidate inputs this method is suitable for large candidate input sets especially where little to no expert knowledge of the hydrological system exists bowden et al 2005b 2005a this application of pmi correctly identified all of the relevant input variables for a synthetic dataset bowden et al 2005b 2005a may et al evaluated different termination criteria for the pmi selection algorithm for synthetic and water quality datasets may et al 2008b 2008a in addition to the bootstrap based approach may et al 2008b 2008a demonstrated the use of the akaike information criterion aic as an effective termination criterion for the pmi algorithm lastly he et al 2011 also demonstrated the capabilities of pmi using the aic based termination criterion for selecting input variables for an ann used to predict stormwater runoff quality parameters 1 1 2 model based methods model based ivs methods select inputs based on a calibrated model after inputs are selected models are recalibrated using a subset of the original inputs may et al 2011 the main limitations of this method are its high computational demand and its dependency on parameters that are decided prior to the model being trained also called hyperparameters for example the inputs selected by a model based method may depend on the number of hidden neurons chosen for the ann while hyperparameter optimization is not a focus of this research ensemble modelling is used to capture some of the uncertainty associated with the selection of model parameters specifically in this research k fold cross validation kfcv and multi start are used to generate ensembles which is discussed in greater detail in section 2 2 input omission io a type of model based ivs estimates input usefulness by iteratively examining model behaviour following the omission of an input from the full set of inputs with which the ann was trained io identifies useful and non useful inputs based on the significance or insignificance of the error caused by the omission of a certain input setiono and liu 1997 setiono and liu 1997 use io to select inputs for a classifier ann inputs are iteratively removed from the selected set based on the input corresponding to the smallest decrease in accuracy when omitted from the model the model is retrained at each iteration and the algorithm terminates once a maximum decrease in accuracy is reached next abrahart et al 2001 use input omission referred to as saliency analysis in their paper to explain ann behaviour and to identify important inputs timeseries plots are generated from io to infer the effect of each input on the model output e g how omitting precipitation impacts the rising limb of the modelled hydrographs this analysis provided a defense against criticism of anns as being black box models by demonstrating that omitting inputs that are known to be important drivers in hydrological systems negatively impacts the performance of the model lastly combined neural pathway strength cnps is another model based method that uses a linear approximation of the total neural pathway strength of each input to estimate its usefulness generally speaking the strength of a neural pathway is defined as the absolute magnitude of the weights associated with each input the higher the magnitude of the weight the stronger or more relevant a particular input is in predicting the desired output nath et al 1997 demonstrate an early use of this idea where the neural pathway strength is calculated as the relative absolute matrix multiplication between the first and second sets of weights of a 3 layer ann the cnps of each input is expressed as a percentage of the overall strength of all inputs the approach is found to improve classification accuracy across several synthetic and real world datasets more recently duncan 2014 adopted a similar ivs approach in which the cnps is approximated as the simple matrix multiplication between the two weight matrices of a 3 layer ann the sign of the cnps is used to indicate whether the input has an excitatory positive correlation with output or inhibitory negative correlation with output effect on the output this method relies on a model ensemble framework in which a distribution of cnps values is calculated for each input if the distribution is centred around cnps values of 0 the input is deemed non useful whereas if the distribution is centred at higher magnitudes of cnps values it is deemed to be useful duncan 2014 while this approach relies on simplifications and lumping and ann parameters e g ignoring the effects of the activation functions and biases within the ann it has demonstrated capable performance for identifying useful inputs duncan 2014 this approach has been used in several recent studies where the use of duncan s cnps method resulted in unchanged or improved model performance for applications in water quality prediction forest fire extent prediction flood forecasting and fever outbreak prediction duncan 2014 khan et al 2018 laureano rosario et al 2018 each of the ivs methods described above whether model based or model free are conceptually distinct in their approach to selecting the most useful inputs from a set of candidate inputs an important factor for each method is the termination criterion which is used to determine whether or not a candidate input is significant may et al 2008a regardless which selection criterion is used by an ivs method over or under selection of inputs as determined by the termination criterion may be detrimental to the overall performance of the model 1 2 objectives the overall objective of this research is to further develop refine and compare the four ivs methods described above pc pmi io and cnps so as to provide better tools for the development of ann models used for flow forecasting first we propose a novel ivs method io which builds on previous studies that evaluate input omission the proposed io method is designed to quantitatively identify non useful inputs addressing limitations in previous work on this method next we propose novel improvements to the cnps method developed by duncan 2014 which is improved by measuring input usefulness based solely on consistency defined as a statistical measure and eliminating the requirement of an arbitrary threshold for the selection criterion we compare these two model based methods to two commonly used model free methods pc and pmi such a comparison is necessary to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of each approach and a comprehensive comparison of performance efficacy has not been published in literature before these methods were chosen based on their distinctive characteristics which allow for further comparative analysis between ivs methods other than comparing model free and model based ivs approaches the selection of the aforementioned ivs methods also allows for the comparison of linear pc and non linear pmi cnps io methods and low computational effort pc cnps io versus high computational effort pmi methods secondly the impact of the standard predetermined termination criterion currently used for each ivs method on ann model performance is quantified the model performance with termination criteria based selected inputs is compared to model performance using a predefined number of inputs determined by each ivs method this analysis will help answer questions related to optimizing model complexity measured as the number of inputs used and model performance lastly the ann model performance using ivs is compared to the performance of using a full set of candidate inputs referred to hereinafter as the base model which provides a baseline of ann performance in an effort to quantify the improvement in model performance attributable to each ivs method often ivs methods are evaluated based on synthetic datasets or a single environmental system limiting broader use of the developed methods this research is conducted for two watersheds the bow river watershed in calgary alberta and the don river watershed in toronto ontario both in canada the watersheds have distinct dominant hydrological processes the first is a relatively large snowmelt dominated watershed with strong seasonality the second is a small flashy urbanized watershed additionally the bow watershed has a relatively large dataset available whereas the don watershed has a short timeseries allowing for a comparison of the methods under different data availability conditions the validation of ivs methods on real world datasets for two distinct watersheds demonstrates the broader applicability of these methods for future use the objective of this research with respect to flow forecasting models is to reduce the data requirements uncertainty of predictions and computing power required for these models and thus improve flow forecasting the following section provides details of the study regions the candidate input variables the structure of the ann used the mathematical development of each ivs method and model performance metrics used for the comparison 2 methods 2 1 site description and data source this research used hydro meteorological data from the bow upper and central and don river watersheds which are located in western and central canada respectively the locations of the target stream gauge and candidate input stations the upstream meteorological and stream gauging stations are illustrated in fig 2 the target stations for each watershed are the downstream stream gauge stations water level data from these stations are used as the dependent variables in the anns whereas lagged water level data are used as candidate input variables i e the independent variables for the ann referred to as autoregressive inputs the remaining candidate input stations are the collection of all upstream hydro meteorological referred to as exogenous inputs data used as the independent variables in the anns the target stations were identified as suitable locations for forecasting since both have a history of flooding in recent years namely in 2013 data from november to april and november to december were removed from the bow and don rivers respectively due to snow or ice conditions a summary of the watersheds attributes is provided in table 1 the upper and central bow river watersheds have headwaters fed by the rocky mountains and contain predominantly natural and agricultural land uses in comparison the don river watershed is heavily urbanized large regions of impermeable surfaces and stormwater management infrastructure is present throughout the basin hydraulic infrastructure is present along both rivers this is evidenced in the downstream hydrographs that have characteristic and unnatural receding limbs which are attributable to the operation of a dam this is confirmed based on available documentation for each river seasonality was determined using the 95 confidence bands of the autocorrelogram i e the autocorrelation plot of each river which was developed using 10 years of water level data the autocorrelation measures the similarity i e the correlation of a timeseries with itself at different lag times geurts et al 1977 if a timeseries has annual seasonality such as high flows in the spring and low flows in the autumn it is expected to be autocorrelated i e correlated with itself lagged by one year or multiple years the pearson s correlation function was used to measure the autocorrelation in each river note that the timeseries length of the don river dataset is limited for the target station only 10 months of common data was available between the candidate inputs and output data on the other hand 10 years worth of data was available for the bow river target station all of the data used in this research was collected and distributed by environment canada the water survey of canada or the city of calgary as indicated in table 2 2 2 ann model configuration a generalized process flow diagram that describes the model framework is provided in fig 3 a feedforward multi layer perceptron ann is used for this research which is the most widely used type of ann flood forecasting abrahart et al 2012 maier et al 2010 choosing a widely used model type facilitates comparison with existing studies moreover both model based ivs methods are designed based on the architecture of feedforward anns remote sensing stations located throughout each watershed continuously collect hydrometeorological data which is available in real time and stored as a timeseries datatype upstream water level and meteorological stations are used as candidate input variables for the ann the same timeseries are lagged by various amounts of timesteps which are also used as candidate input variables the timeseries for the downstream monitoring station is shifted forward in time which is used as the target observed flow the objective of this approach is to be able to predict the stage in advance to highlight the risk of high peak flow or flooding conditions using available upstream data the linear cross correlation function is calculated by measuring the correlation between one timeseries and a second timeseries at different lag times geurts et al 1977 the approximate lag times between the downstream target station and the other stations are estimated based on the maximum correlation of the cross correlation functions between each station excluding the downstream station and the downstream station the number of variables within the full set of candidate inputs at each site was intentionally large in order to demonstrate the utility of each ivs method to reduce the candidate inputs the candidate input sets are denoted in table 2 in a compressed form for example the first row of the bow river section includes the different water level inputs for the model there are two flow stations ids bb001 and bh001 each with three statistical transformations maximum daily mean daily and minimum daily and each for three different lag times unlagged lagged by 1 day and lagged by 2 days collectively this produces 18 water level input variables for the bow river the don river candidate set has a total of 60 input variables whereas for the bow river the candidate set has 30 input variables note that for both watersheds an ann model was created using all of the candidate inputs this model is referred to as the base model the base model was developed in order to provide a reference model to compare the ivs reduced ann models this comparison is intended to evaluate the change in model performance after input reduction using each of the four ivs methods each model predicts a single output either hourly 1 3 and 6 hour for the don or daily 1 2 and 3 day for the bow water levels a single output node is favoured for ann models since multiple models each with single output variables will outperform a single multi output model kaastra and boyd 1996 masters 1993 for instance for the bow river forecasts of 1 day 2 days and 3 days are predicted using distinct models rather than a single model with three outputs all models use a single hidden layer with 25 nodes which is sufficiently sized such that it does not restrict the performance of models with a large input set while various empirical rule of thumb methods exist for choosing the number of hidden nodes there is high variability between these methods maier and dandy 2000 while the hidden layer could be optimized based on a systematic trial and error approach for each unique model configuration it is computationally demanding and beyond the scope of this research khan et al 2018 a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid activation function was used between the input and hidden layer and a linear activation function was used between the hidden and output layer the second order levenberg marquardt algorithm lm is used to train the neural network while the first order backpropagation algorithm is the most widely used algorithm for flood forecasting anns the lm is also commonly used and is considered more efficient than the simpler backpropagation algorithm abrahart et al 2012 maier et al 2010 for this research the mean squared error mse is used as the objective function for the training the anns typically for anns datasets are partitioned into three subsets training validation and testing the training subset is used to calibrate the ann s weights and biases the initial values of each weight and bias is first randomly initialised after which the objective function mse is iteratively reduced using the lm backpropagation algorithm after each iteration the mse of the validation subset is calculated and training is terminated once the mse of the validation dataset stops decreasing this process is known as the early stopping procedure and is commonly used in ann applications to prevent overfitting or overtraining i e when the ann model outputs follow the targets too closely and hence lose generalisability and the ability to predict independent data reliably the third subset the testing subset is used to independently evaluate ann model performance by using data that was not used for training or validation in this research the dataset is partitioned into training validation testing subsets of 60 20 20 respectively k fold cross validation kfcv is used to train an ensemble of networks kfcv is a commonly used cross validation method where the data is partitioned into k partitions also called folds the model is calibrated using k 1 folds and evaluated on the remaining folds hastie et al 2009 the implementation of kfcv in this research is illustrated in table 3 since this research utilizes three distinct partitions training validation and testing kfcv is applied for the training and validation partitions whereas the test partition is fixed allowing for direct comparison between models within the ensemble using a cross validation method such as kfcv reduces the chance of the validation partition biasing the results and is useful for smaller datasets hastie et al 2009 in this research partitions are continuous blocks when the data is sorted temporally as opposed to random sampling which is typical for temporal data the most recent data is used for the test partition as this data is most representative of existing conditions in a real time forecasting scenario for both catchments in this research 5 folds 4 for training and validation and 1 independent fold for testing are used that are 2 years and 2 months for the bow and the don rivers respectively kfcv is used to capture the uncertainty associated with the selection of the calibration which includes the training and validation partitions then each unique fold configuration is trained 250 times to capture the uncertainty associated with the ann initialization which assigns random values to weights and biases to begin the lm training algorithm different initial values for weights and biases may result in different values after training the ann thus different predictions by considering multiple different starting points for these weights and biases a process referred to multi start is one way of characterizing the uncertainty associated with the randomness of the ann initialization collectively the four unique calibration configurations consisting of four different kfcv fold configurations as shown in table 3 and 250 multi start initialization for each configuration results in 1000 ann models which are referred to as an ensemble discrete models are referred to as ensemble members best practices in hydrological modelling suggest that model performance be assessed based on multiple performance measures as different measures capture different model characteristics ewen 2011 maier et al 2010 there is a wide variety of commonly used measures this research utilises four common measures including root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean absolute error mae and the persistence index pi the nse is the most commonly used performance metric in hydrology nse compares the model under study to the mean value nse is unitless and has a range between and 1 0 with 1 0 being the optimum value models with nse values between 1 00 and 0 75 are considered to have very good performance 0 75 0 65 indicates good performance 0 65 0 50 indicates satisfactory performance and lower than 0 50 is considered unsatisfactory based on the analysis provided in moriasi et al 2007 the pi is similar to the nse but is specialized for forecasting models instead of comparing model performance to the mean observed value as the nse does the pi compares the model under study to the naïve model abrahart et al 2008 anctil and lauzon 2004 de vos and rientjes 2005 kitanidis and bras 1980 for a model predicting the water level at some lead time in the future qt lead the naïve model simply uses the current flow qt as the estimate like nse the pi is unitless and normalized with a range between to 1 00 a pi value greater than 0 indicates that the model under study performs better than the naïve model lastly both rmse and mae are dimensioned performance metrics that have the same units as the observed data they are not normalized thus not contained within specific a range like nse and pi therefore there is no absolute threshold indicating whether or not the model is performing well instead rmse and mae are used for comparisons between different models for the same observed data or are used to calculate relative error these error measures are chosen from three distinct error measure taxonomies used for neural network assessment being based on squared residuals rmse and nse absolute residuals mae and timing pi maier et al 2010 while nse and rmse are essentially the same they are both included here due to their widespread use in previous hydrological studies ewen 2011 2 3 input variable selection the four ivs methods evaluated in this research are summarized in table 4 along with the selection and termination criteria used for each method these criteria are described in detail in the following sections all the ivs methods are applied using the calibration partition and the ann performance is measured using the independent test partition pseudocode for each ivs algorithm is included in appendix a each ivs method is used to reduce the number of inputs based on a pre established termination criterion listed in table 4 which is a common practice for ivs algorithms however using an ivs termination criterion may result in the over or under selection of input variables for example if pc selects ten inputs and pmi selects five inputs assuming there are 10 reasonably useful inputs the pc based ann may perform better than the pmi based model since more useful data is included this is not reflective of pmi as a poor selection criterion rather that the final selection is repressed by a too strict termination criterion this highlights the significance and impact of the termination criteria used for ivs in order to address the risk of non optimum termination criteria each ivs method is used to select the most relevant inputs which we have selected as 10 and 20 of the candidate set for each river without regard for any termination criteria this will showcase the capability of each ivs method to identify the most useful inputs and allows for a direct comparison between input reduced models that have the same level of complexity i e the same number of selected input parameters note that for methods where inputs are not selected iteratively i e cnps and io and thus the inputs are not ranked based on importance the selection criteria to rank inputs are described in table 4 and in the appropriate subsections in the methods section they are used to select a predefined number of inputs 2 3 1 partial correlation this method uses a forward selection algorithm to select useful inputs from a candidate set c based on the maximum pc between a given candidate input c j and the output y controlling for the effects of the set of inputs that have already been selected s for the first selection s is an empty set and the first input is selected as having the maximum squared linear correlation between the candidate c j and the output y note that both the pc and pmi based input selection methods were adopted directly from existing studies bowden et al 2005b he et al 2011 may et al 2008b sharma 2000 sharma et al 2000 however one distinction in the implementation of pc in this research that distinguishes it from previous studies is the use of r2 instead of r to avoid inputs with a strong negative correlation being selected last for a set of selected inputs s and a set of j candidate inputs for candidates j 1 j the partial correlation between c j and output y controlling s is given by 1 pc c j y s r v u 2 c o v u v σ u σ v 2 where u and v are the residuals given by the following equations 2 v c j c j s 3 u y y s where c j and y are the multivariate linear least squares regression estimates of c j and y respectively the algorithm for pc first calculates the correlation for each input and selects the input having the highest correlation next the residual u is calculated for the selected input s using equation 2 and the residual v is calculated for each remaining candidate input using equation 3 the input corresponding to the highest partial correlation which is described in equation 1 and is a function of u and v is moved from the candidate set to the selected set at each step the aic is calculated as per the following equation 4 ai c j n log e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 2 p where n is the number of samples and p is the number of parameters in the linear regression model this selection process is repeated until the aic increases if using the termination criterion the desired number of inputs is reached 3 6 12 etc for the non termination criteria experiments or no inputs remain in the candidate set 2 3 2 partial mutual information this selection method is conceptually similar to the pc based method described above but uses mutual information mi rather than linear correlation for input selection the pmi value is the shared entropy between output y and candidate input c j that is not also already contained in s expressed as mi c j y s the pmi based approach uses the same selection algorithm as for pc however the linear estimators c s and y s are replaced with non parametric estimators e c j s s and e y s s respectively and the selection criteria of partial correlation pc is replaced with the partial mutual information pmi the non parametric kernel regression estimation i e the conditional expectation of given s is given by the expression 5 e x s s 1 n i n n x i k h s s i i 1 n k h s s i where n is the total number of sample observations s is the selected set x is either cj or y and k h is the gaussian kernel function given by 6 k h x x i 1 2 π h d σ exp x x i t σ 1 x x i 2 h 2 where d is the dimensionality of x σ is the sample covariance matrix and h is the kernel bandwidth given by 7 h 4 d 2 1 d 4 n 1 d 4 the pmi is then calculated as follows 8 pmi c j y s m i u v 1 n i 1 n log e f u v f u f v where u and v are calculated using equations 2 and 3 using the respective non parametric kernel estimators c j s e c j s s and y s e y s s described in equation 5 f u f v and f u v are probability density functions of u v and joint u and v estimated using the following generalized expression 9 f x 1 n i 1 n k h x x i where n is the sample size and kh is the kernel function provided in equation 10 the aic which is used as the termination criteria is calculated using equation 4 where the number of parameters p is replaced with the effective degrees of freedom ν for non parametric kernel regression the effective degrees of freedom is given by the trace of the hat matrix h 10 ν t r h where the hat matrix h is given by 11 h i x k h x i x j 1 n k h x j x 2 3 3 input omission the method proposed in this research for io estimates input usefulness based on the change in performance following input omission without retraining adapting and improving previous methods used that are described in existing studies cf abrahart et al 2001 setiono and liu 1997 the complexity based performance measure aic is used as the performance criteria in this method as it permits for a small increase in error to be negated due to a slightly lower model complexity the aic is calculated using equation 4 where p is the number of ann parameters the sum of the weights and biases and y is given by 12 y j net j c c j c where y j is the output of n e t j c c j c which is the ann trained on c with input c j omitted inputs are selected based on the p value corresponding to the null hypothesis that ai c j and ai c c are samples from the same population against the alternative hypothesis that aic j is larger than ai c c using a two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks test this research uses a p value of 0 01 for the null hypothesis test the ks test cannot be used to rank input parameters therefore if io is being used to select a predefined number of inputs inputs are ranked based the median aicj values within the ensemble such that the omitted input corresponding to the largest increase in median aic is the most useful 2 3 4 combined neural pathway strength the cnps method used in this research is a modified improved and more generalised version of the method proposed by duncan 2014 where the neural pathway strengths are calculated for an ensemble of models which are then used to characterize inputs as excitatory and inhibitory in duncan s method the cnps values are calculated as the matrix multiplication of the input hidden and hidden output weight matrices 13 cnps ik w ij w jk where w ij and w jk are weight matrices with dimensions i j k which correspond to the number of input hidden and output nodes respectively in duncan s original method inputs are selected based on the ensemble interquartile range eqr metric which is defined as follows 14 eq r j min q 1 q 3 max q 1 q 3 s g n q 1 s g n q 3 where q 1 and q 3 are the 25th and 75th percentiles of the cnpsj distributions for input j eqr values are within the range of 1 1 and values greater than 0 are considered satisfactorily excitatory or inhibitory however while using this approach it was found that using an eqr of 0 as a threshold for ivs resulted in over selection consequently the eqr threshold was incrementally increased to an arbitrary value in order to select an optimum number of inputs based on model performance choosing an arbitrary non zero eqr value is undesirable since it required a trail and error approach and has no statistical meaning moreover the rate at which inputs are exhibiting excitatory or inhibitory behaviour is not known thus in this research the eqr metric was abandoned in favour of a statistical threshold inputs are ranked based on the percentile of dominant excitatory or inhibitory behaviour inferred by the signs of the cnps values for example if a threshold of 95 is selected it ensures that for each selected input inputs are exhibiting either excitatory or inhibitory behaviour at least 95 of the time within the ensemble the behavioural consistency of cnps values expressed as a percentage α for each input j is determined as follows 15 α j max c n p s j 0 c n p s j 0 n where cnp s j is the distribution of cnps scores and n is the number of ensemble members since multiple inputs may be identified at the significance value of α j 1 these inputs can be ranked based on the relative range of their cnps values 16 score min c n p s j max c n p s j inputs with a smaller range between the minimum and maximum cnps values will receive a higher score with a theoretical optimum score of 1 which indicates that the input exhibits exactly the same behaviour across the entire ensemble 3 results the ann models for both watershed systems were trained with the complete candidate sets the base model and ivs reduced inputs both using the termination criteria and predefined numbers of inputs either 10 or 20 of the candidate inputs to predict the stage at the target station a comparison of model performance using the four metrics rmse nse mae and pi are summarised in fig 4 and fig 5 and median values are contained in tables 5 and 6 for the bow river 1 day and don river 1 hour lead time models respectively note that these metrics were calculated only using the independent testing dataset the training and validation dataset are excluded from all performance evaluation in addition the results are calculated for all the models within each ensemble i e including the cross validation and multi start scenarios so as to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions thus these figures show the 25th and 75th percentile values blue boxes the median value red line and outliers red crosses of the predictions rather than deterministic results additional results for the other lead times for both rivers are included in appendix b figures b1 to b4 and tables b1 to b4 detailed discussion of the results presented in figs 4 and 5 are provided in sections 3 1 and 3 2 these figures show the performance of the flood forecast models using different combination of inputs on the vertical axes and each performance metric on the horizontal axes on the vertical axis of each subplot the upper most values are from the base model which includes all the candidate inputs followed by each of the four ivs methods first using the predetermined termination criteria then the two cases with predefined numbers of inputs the two cases for the predefined number of inputs are 10 of the candidate inputs 3 for the bow river and 6 for the don river and 20 of the candidate inputs 6 for the bow river and 12 for the don river for example in fig 4 the pc results are indicated by pc 17 pc 3 and pc 6 which corresponds to 17 inputs determined by the termination criteria followed by 10 3 inputs and 20 6 inputs of the 30 candidate inputs figs 4 and 5 demonstrate the effectiveness of using an ann approach for flood forecasting the error metrics indicate high performance for each metric the rmse and mae are low approximately 1 relative to of the observed values and the nse is greater than 0 75 with median values of about 0 98 for the bow and above 0 85 for the don see tables 5 and 6 for detailed results of the performance metrics which corresponds to very good model performance moriasi et al 2007 the median pi values are typically positive indicating that the models are an improvement over a naïve modelling approach in some cases such as the bow river pmi models approximately half the models in the ensembles have a negative pi indicating poor performance similar results can be seen for models with higher lead times results in appendix b and as expected the overall performance decreases and the variance increases as the lead time increases at the largest lead times 3 days for the bow and 6 hours for the don most models have an nse value of approximately 0 91 and 0 50 as indicated in tables b 2 and b 4 corresponding to very good and satisfactory performance respectively the pi also shown in tables b 2 and b 4 for the bow and the don are 0 06 and 0 40 respectively overall this suggests that it is possible to achieve high performance of flow forecasting models using an ann approach however an analysis of the impact of selecting inputs based on different ivs methods can help further refine these models in terms of performance computational efficiency etc which are described in the following subsections along with detailed information on which inputs were selected for each case 3 1 model performance with all candidate inputs the correlation and timeseries plots for the base models i e those that use all candidate inputs with one timestep leads 1 day for the bow and 1 hour for the don river are provided in figs 6 and 7 respectively which provide a general sense for the model performance both figures include 99th percentile bars which indicate the amount of uncertainty within the model ensembles which is quantified using the multi start and kfcv method employed fig 6 shows that the results of the independent testing dataset are very similar to the calibration training and validation datasets based on these figures both models exhibit slight under prediction of high water levels hence flowrates though this is more pronounced for the don river which is the more urbanized and flashier watershed from fig 7 it is apparent that both model outputs occasionally exhibit visible timing error during peak events however for the bow river this difference is generally captured within the 99th percentile uncertainty bands while a direct comparison with other hydrological systems offers little insight as different systems have unique physical characteristics and data availability it can provide a broad sense of whether the models are exhibiting reasonable performance out of the four error measures rmse and mae are not normalized and therefore are not useful for comparison between different systems or external models mosavi et al 2018 the nse values for both rivers are very good above 0 75 for five of six lead times evaluated mosavi et al 2018 the 6 hour don river forecast model demonstrated comparatively lower nse of 0 501 which corresponds to the lower limit for satisfactory model performance however based on discussion with the local watershed authority and the lag times inferred between upstream and downstream stations poor forecasting performance is expected for a lead time of 6 hours next while the bow river demonstrated a very good performance having an nse greater than 0 9 across all the lead times considered 1 2 and 3 day however this strong performance is somewhat superficial the bow river has high seasonality which can produce a model with a misleading nse value meshram et al 2018 thus the pi is a better indicator of forecasting strength of the model which decreases from 0 107 to 0 076 to 0 056 as the lead time increase from 1 to 2 to 3 days respectively as shown in tables 5 and tables b 1 and b 3 this is expected for forecast accuracy unlike the nse which remains high across all lead times the low pi for the 3 day lead time indicates that the ann model is only a marginal improvement over a naïve model in contrast to the bow river the don river has no significant seasonality as discussed in section 2 1 therefore the nse is a suitable performance measure as the explained fluctuations from the mean water level are due to hydrological events and are not overshadowed by seasonality within the system the performance of these base models is improved using ivs methods as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 and discussed in detail in the following section as discussed in section 1 1 reducing the number of model inputs can improve convergence during training and lower the complexity and data requirements of models 3 2 model performance with ivs the ivs models whether using a termination criteria or a predefined number of inputs often exhibit better performance than the models that uses the entire set of candidate inputs better performance being both an improvement in median performance and a decrease in range defined as the difference between the minimum and maximum performance within the ensemble this can be attributed to the fact that the ivs models have fewer non useful inputs see figs 4 and 5 the ivs models exhibit a decrease in performance when too few inputs are selected such is the case for the pmi models where the stringent termination criterion produces a model with only two inputs for the both the bow and the don both of which perform poorly similarly if too many inputs are selected e g the io models with the default termination criteria the model performance does not improve compared to the base models a detailed analysis of performance criteria for these models is listed in section 3 2 1 the selection order for the models with the termination criteria and models that select 20 of the candidate set is provided in table 7 for the bow river and table 8 for the don river where the input selection order is indicated numerically as well as by the colour intensity of the table cells for example in table 7 for the pc ivs termination results the first input selected is the 1 day lagged mean daily water level from station bh004 followed by the 2 day lagged mean daily water level from the same station the third and fourth input selected for this model is the 1 day and 2 day lagged maximum daily water level from the upstream station bb001 for this model a total of 17 inputs were selected using the termination criteria with the last input select being the 1 day lagged precipitation at the station labelled 3031093 the same pattern is seen for the pc ivs fixed results however the total number of inputs selected for this model is six with the sixth input selected as the 1 day lagged maximum daily temperature results in this table are further discussed in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 below the selection and termination criteria for each method are also shown graphically in figs 8 and 9 for the don and the bow rivers respectively these figures show the relative change in the magnitude of the selection criteria for the selection of the first 20 of the highest ranked inputs note that the termination criteria may stop the selection before or after the number of inputs included in these figures a detailed analysis and comparison of using termination criteria versus using a predefined number of inputs is provided in the following section 3 2 1 ivs with termination in these models the number of inputs is determined by a predefined termination criterion that terminates input selection when met which is outlined in tables 7 and 8 for both the bow and the don river cases pc selects roughly half of the available candidate inputs as expected the performance of the model ensembles is similar to that of the base models given the large number of inputs selected from the candidate set due to the termination criterion being too lenient for the next ivs case pmi selects only 2 to 5 inputs in all cases as a result the performance of these models is very poor for the bow comparing to the baseline model the median nse and pi performance of pmi 2 which is included in table 5 decrease from 0 985 to 0 983 and 0 110 to 0 005 respectively similarly for the don the nse and pi of pmi 2 decrease from 0 954 to 0 937 and 0 551 to 0 381 as per table 6 the decrease in performance is attributable to an ivs termination criteria that is too stringent thus terminating the selection of inputs that are used by the better performing models this early stopping is partly a result of the high estimated degrees of freedom of the non parametric kernel regression models pmi also favoured autoregressive inputs which resulted in poor model performance most notably in the don river models the kernel regression used in the pmi algorithm was found to fit the target data very closely the close fit causes the residuals denoted as u in equation 3 to be very small the residuals u may be thought of as patterns contained in the target variable denoted as y that are not captured by the kernel regression using one or more variables contained in the selected set when the kernel regression fits too closely to the target variable there are no patterns contained in the residuals u hence no improvements made by further input selection additionally the estimated degrees of freedom for pmi penalize the error much more heavily than the degrees of freedom for the linear model used for the pc method in the case of both the bow and the don models a close fit is achieved with only two selected inputs increasing the estimated degrees of freedom and producing a larger aic which results in the termination of selection as further inputs addition to not improve the already close fitting regression the relative number of inputs determined by these methods broadly agree with may et al 2008b who observed that the pc termination criterion is more lenient than the pmi based counterpart it is possible that modifications to pmi such as using a non gaussian kernel randomly sampling a subset of the data or adjusting the scaling factor may perhaps improve the selection of pmi for the model based ivs methods io for bow river selected nearly all the candidate inputs whereas for the don roughly half while developing the io method used in this research the use of a ks test was appealing due to its suitability for non parametric distributions when used on the don river this criterion was met when roughly half the inputs were selected an input reduction large enough to produce some of the benefits associated with ivs discussed in section 1 1 however when compared to results from the bow river models it is clear that the criterion was not stringent enough resulting in an over selection nonetheless the io method is quite capable of identifying useful inputs which is evidenced by the selection order illustrated in tables 7 and 8 io selected 58 83 of the number of inputs selected by the other ivs methods also the selection agrees with hydrological principles by selecting recent downstream water gauges followed by upstream stations that are lagged by a few timesteps hence capturing the time of travel of the runoff from upstream to downstream locations the selection order for io in these tables indicates that non useful inputs such as temperature which is not selected in the best performing models are among the last selected by the io method while the first selections agree with those of ivs methods that produce strong performing models this claim is further supported by the performance of io models that have used a predefined number of inputs which is discussed in the following section lastly for the cnps method in both cases this method selected between 10 and 20 and performed similarly to the fixed input cases suggesting that the termination criterion for cnps performs the best and does so consistently the proposed modification to the termination criteria using the statistical threshold described in section 2 3 4 for the cnps method appears to make the improvements creating a more robust ivs system compared to the other ivs approaches explored in this research 3 2 2 ivs for a predefined number of inputs in this section the optimality of the number of inputs determined using predefined termination criteria is assessed by comparing these inputs with two cases of models that have a predefined number of inputs selected as 10 and 20 of the candidate input set for each watershed the use of predefined number of inputs means that each ivs method can be compared against each other for the same number of inputs this approach allows for an assessment of each ivs methods performance whilst controlling for the number of inputs or level of complexity of the ann and the termination criteria used this will highlight which method selects the best inputs for improved model performance for the same level of model complexity for a predefined number of inputs for the bow model pc demonstrates lower performance compared to the termination criterion counterpart for example the median pi is 0 139 0 080 and 0 052 for the pc 17 pc 3 and pc 6 models respectively as illustrated in fig 4 compared to models for the other ivs methods that have the same number of inputs the pc results indicate that this ivs method does not accurately rank the most useful inputs within the candidate set and therefore is not a good ivs method specifically as illustrated in table 7 pc failed to select daily maximum inputs for station bh001 which are included in the selection of better performing models in the case of the don river the performance of pc improved with pc 37 pc 6 and pc 12 having median nse values of 0 957 0 962 and 0 962 respectively the models with a constrained number of inputs outperforming the termination criterion model suggests that the standard termination criterion was too lenient for this watershed next pmi overwhelmingly favoured autoregressive inputs selecting exclusively autoregressive inputs for the bow and all the autoregressive inputs for the don in the case of the don pmi first selected all 6 inputs for the target station followed by all 6 inputs for a nearby upstream station hy022 these models generally perform better than the termination criterion models with the nse shown in table 6 for models pmi 2 and pmi 12 increasing from 0 938 to 0 946 implying that the termination criterion is too strict however the shortcomings of pmi are best evidenced by the pi measure which is 0 461 compared to 0 551 for the baseline model demonstrating how too few exogenous inputs produces poor forecasting performance the models for io demonstrate improved performance for both watersheds while using fewer inputs indicating that this method is reasonably capable of ranking inputs and that the termination criterion used in this research is much too lenient given the large number of inputs selected for each watershed finally cnps models typically exhibit marginally lower performance while using a predefined number of inputs nse values are typically lower than the termination criterion models by an order of magnitude of 10 2 10 3 even while the number of inputs determined using a termination criterion is in between the two cases that use a predefined number of inputs suggesting that the termination criterion determined nearest to the optimum number of inputs this underscores the utility and effectiveness of the proposed statistical threshold proposed and implemented in this research for the cnps method 4 discussion ultimately there are no cases where the use of a termination criterion consistently produces better performing models than using a predetermined number of inputs this is true for both the bow and don watersheds and for the different ivs methods for example in fig 4 io 3 outperforms io 28 which over selects inputs using the termination criterion however this is not the case for larger lead times shown in appendix b where using a termination criterion produces slightly better performing models than io 3 and io 6 next in fig 4 the termination criteria for pc 17 over selects while the pmi 2 models under select since they both exhibit lower performance compared to their counterpart selections with 12 inputs as a result it is recommended that the number of inputs be determined using a systematic forward addition approach where each input addition is informed by an ivs based input ranking instead of determining the number of inputs based on a predefined termination criterion such an approach is similar to those used for the optimization of model hyperparameters i e hidden layer architecture this approach may use any suitable performance measure s or a complexity based measure for determining the optimum number of inputs all four ivs methods identify the most recent autoregressive input daily mean as the most useful often one or two more autoregressive inputs are selected before methods select exogenous inputs in fact the best preforming models for the bow river are achieved using only autoregressive inputs next three of the four ivs methods use one or more of the autoregressive daily maximum and upstream daily maximum data precipitation and temperature are seldom selected unless the ivs method s termination criteria is very lenient as is the case for pc and io the preference of autoregressive inputs in all models results in time delayed predictions which is evidenced by the strong nse but poor pi which is most apparent for longer lead times see appendix b the preference of autoregressive inputs for model free ivs methods is likely due to the strong dissimilarity between autoregressive and exogenous signals a significant limitation of the model free methods whereas for model based methods it may be attributed to the objective function mse of the ann the utilization of mse for ann training has been associated with time delayed predictions subsequently model based ivs methods will favour autoregressive inputs as such model based ivs methods cannot reliably avoid time delay issues for the don similar to the bow the first selection is the most recent autoregressive input see tables 4 and 5 next multiple inputs at upstream gauge hy022 are selected by all four methods as well as hy080 by pc io and cnps these three methods also each utilize one to four precipitation inputs the best performing models for the don rely on exogenous inputs which is evidenced by the difference in performance of the pc io and cnps selections and the autoregressive dominated pmi selection which is discussed in section 3 2 2 the selection order for the bow and don river models are consistent with expectations based on traditional knowledge of hydrological processes the autoregressive inputs which are consistently identified as the most useful input is expected to be most similar to the flow at the same station several timesteps forward using this input as the estimate the target flow is known as a naïve forecast next still consistent with the ivs results lagged versions of this input are important as they inform on the change in the flowrate at the downstream location typically only 1 to 2 lagged copies are selected suggesting that records of flow beyond this number of timesteps are not useful flow at upstream locations which typically exhibit water level patterns in advance of the downstream location the difference in timing being the lag time are the next most hydrologically relevant inputs the bow river ivs models typically do not heavily utilize input variables for this station with the exception of the daily upstream maximum unlagged input which was selected by all ivs methods except for pmi moreover the some of the best performing bow models do not utilize this station whatsoever while this station is expected to make a suitable predictor the underutilization may be attributable to factors such as the large distance between this station and the downstream location and the presence of infrastructure located between stations precipitation which produces the runoff that contributes to increased streamflow is expected to be a useful input variable for flow forecasting models excluding pmi the don river ivs models typically select precipitation inputs after the upstream flow selections however none of the bow river models select a precipitation input within the first six input selections this may be attributable to the location of the precipitation gauge in the bow river see fig 2 precipitation gauges are expected to be more useful at upstream locations rather than downstream as it takes much longer for the precipitation to concentrate downstream making it a better predictor the close proximity of the single precipitation gauge and the downstream flow gauge may be why it was not used by the ivs models temperature which may be considered a surrogate parameter for processes such as snowmelt and evaporation is also expected to be a useful input however none of the ivs models for either watershed except the pc model for the bow river selected temperature as an input variable the non utilization of temperature may be due to the timescale at which processes such as snowmelt occur relative to the number of lags provided to the model up to 2 days moreover the daily periodicity of temperature may also factor into its non utilization by the ivs methods next this research demonstrated an application of kfcv which coupled with multi start is used to generate model ensembles using kfcv or a different variation of cross validation is strongly encouraged it eliminates the subjective discretization of the training and validation data and quantifies the associated uncertainty such methods are simple to implement yet often missing in existing studies of data driven flood forecasting models furthermore provided advances to computing power thousands of anns can be trained in a short amount of time it is worth restating that input usefulness is a not binary but exists on a spectrum for real world datasets in which usefulness is measured based on model performance whether an input is useful corresponds to a point at which its inclusion in the model will not consistently improve the performance of the model consequently the usefulness of an input is a function of both the performance measures chosen for the model and the selection of model hyperparameters as demonstrated in this research improvements to model performance owed to the application of ivs methods should be assessed using multiple distinct measures next some of the uncertainty associated with hyperparameter selection is considered in this research by using an ensemble based modelling approach which demonstrates how the uncertainty associated with the selection of two groups of hyperparameters is quantified these include the calibration dataset partitioning kfcv and the initial values for ann weights and biases multi start lastly it is important to highlight that the base models which feature all candidate inputs perform reasonably well while the performance is improved with the removal of non useful inputs the input reduced models are not drastically superior to non input reduced models in the context of flood forecasting capabilities which is largely attributable to the strength of the lm training algorithm and the ann structure used in this research furthermore in practical applications there may be value in having redundant inputs such as in the event of a sensor failure in the monitoring network if an ivs method identifies inputs as non useful it does not mean that the monitoring location is not hydrologically relevant or important with respect to the overall purpose of the model 5 conclusions and recommendations this research evaluated four different ivs methods for ann models for the bow and the don rivers two methods were improved cnps by providing an alternative selection criterion that places increased emphases on the characterization of input behaviour and io by describing an ensemble based quantitative selection criterion which is lacking from existing work pc demonstrated reasonable performance for both watersheds however using a predefined termination criterion causes an over selection of inputs and the resultant models are outperformed by other ivs methods in most instances pmi suffered early stopping indicating that the aic based termination was too strict io demonstrated reasonably strong performance however the termination criterion used in this research is not recommended for future use as it was too lenient and inconsistent io may be improved by making changes to the method by exploring topics such as retraining after omission omitting more than one input at a time or using different performance criteria the modified cnps demonstrated the strongest and most consistent performance amongst the ivs methods evaluated which highlights the significance and impact of the proposed improvements to this method this research produced results for two reasonably distinct hydrological systems the bow and don rivers this type of validation is important for ensuring that methods are sufficiently robust to be useable for different hydrological regions in this research the results for both basins were generally in agreement however some notable exceptions include the pmi selection for the bow which performs adequately as an autoregressive model however an autoregressive model for the don exhibits very poor performance due to the flashy urbanized nature of this watershed next the selection criterion for io selected a drastically different number of inputs for the bow and don which was not observed using other ivs methods indicating that the selection criterion proposed in this research may need further refinement before future use other methods such as pc and cnps demonstrated reasonable and consistent selections both watersheds next this research determined that the use of a termination criterion is not consistent in selecting the optimum number of inputs instead it is recommended that ivs be used to rank input usefulness on a spectrum after which the number of inputs is determined on a case by case basis based on a systematic evaluation of model performance future research topics may include the coupled optimization of ann model inputs and hyperparameters and further refinements to cnps based ivs methods funding this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of

5761,artificial neural networks anns are increasingly used for flood forecasting the performance of these models relies on the selection of appropriate inputs however input variable selection ivs is typically performed using expert knowledge or simple linear methods this research compares and evaluates four ivs methods including two model free methods partial correlation pc partial mutual information pmi and two novel model based methods an improved input omission io and improved combined neural pathway strength cnps a comprehensive comparison of performance efficacy for multiple ivs methods has not been published in literature before each method is used for daily and hourly lead times in the bow and don rivers both in canada respectively these watersheds represent different hydrological systems and were selected to highlight the performance of the ivs methods under differing conditions this research determines that the proposed cnps produces the strongest performing anns based on the robustness of the inputs selected comparison to other ivs methods and models developed without ivs additionally this research demonstrates that standard termination criteria do not reliably identify the optimum number of inputs for the anns and using a model based optimization of inputs is recommended as a result it is recommended that the number of inputs be determined using a systematic approach where each input selection is informed by an ivs based input ranking rather than a predefined termination criterion lastly this research demonstrates that input usefulness is not binary concept the correct number of selected inputs is dependant on the desired model complexity instead of an arbitrarily selected ivs termination criteria keywords flow forecasting artificial neural networks input variable selection partial mutual information input omission neural pathway strength analysis 1 introduction in coming years the risk of riverine flooding in urban areas is expected to increase which is driven by factors such as climate change and rapid urbanization asce 2000 toronto and region conservation authority 2018 wilby 2006 one way that flood damage can be mitigated is with early flood warning systems which are used to provide advance warning of flood conditions to local authorities and floodplain occupants reducing the risk of property damage and loss of life shrubsole et al 1993 yin et al 2004 flood warning systems typically utilize rainfall runoff models to estimate future stage or discharge levels historically rainfall runoff models have been developed based on physical processes these models rely on the simplification of complex hydrological processes which are highly nonlinear and exhibit high spatial and temporal variability asce 2000 khan and valeo 2016 wijesekara et al 2012 throughout the past two decades data driven models ddms have emerged as competitive alternatives to physically based models for characterizing rainfall runoff systems asce 2000 dawson and wilby 2001 shrestha and nestmann 2009 while physically based models rely on principles of physics to describe a system ddms are based on mathematical relationships between data that characterizes the system solomatine and ostfeld 2008 among data driven methods artificial neural networks anns are the most widely used for flow forecasting solomatine and ostfeld 2008 anns which are inspired by biological neural networks have a framework consisting of interconnected groups of input hidden and output nodes see fig 1 each connection has a numeric weight while hidden and output nodes both have a numeric bias and a nonlinear activation function weights and biases are typically initialized to a random starting point then adjusted based on an objective or cost function such as the sum of squared error recent research in this field has largely focused on optimization algorithms that are used to train or calibrate the models such as the use of swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithms to boost model performance to improve the accuracy of future predictions of stage or discharge in rivers maier et al 2018 meshram et al 2018 however there are fundamental aspects of ann model development that are still widely overlooked including optimizing the architecture or the structure of the networks i e the number of layers and nodes in the hidden layers the uncertainty associated with the amount of data used for training versus validation or testing the models and the selection of the best inputs needed for optimal model performance this last component is the focus of the present research 1 1 overview of input variable selection while ann models have demonstrated their suitability for modelling rainfall runoff systems the selection of input variables a process commonly referred to as input variable selection ivs consistently receives little attention maier et al 2010 maier and dandy 2000 may et al 2011 ivs methods are typically used to identify the most useful inputs from a larger set of candidate input variables where usefulness is defined as having maximum relevancy to the output while minimizing redundancy with other candidate inputs may et al 2011 reducing the number of model inputs is important for minimizing computational demand addressing the curse of dimensionality trunk 1979 reducing output variability caused by local minima on the error surface and informing the behaviour of the physical system bowden et al 2005a may et al 2008a šindelář and babuška 2004 many applications of anns in hydrology do not describe a systematic ivs process or rely on methods such as a priori knowledge of the system trial and error or linear cross correlation abrahart et al 2012 bowden et al 2005a maier and dandy 2000 moreover each of these approaches has limitations expert knowledge of hydrological systems is not dependably available for many systems or may be unreliable trial and error approaches where a brute force method is used to determine the best inputs are computationally intensive especially for ann systems with a large number of candidate inputs may et al 2011 lastly linear cross correlation which is the most commonly used data driven ivs approach is limited to identifying discrete linear relationships between the output and individual candidate inputs abrahart et al 2008 nanda et al 2016 while methods such as cross correlation may be useful for reducing the number of inputs included in the set of candidates by providing modellers with the approximate lag times between monitoring points it is unable to capture the interdependencies redundancies and nonlinearities typical of hydrological systems abrahart et al 2012 therefore there is a clear need for more robust ivs methods that do not rely on a priori knowledge or assumptions about the system are computationally inexpensive and can characterise nonlinear and interdependent relationships between candidate inputs ivs has been the focus of multiple review papers that provide a comprehensive overview of its taxonomy and methods in water resources modelling bowden et al 2005a maier et al 2010 may et al 2011 ivs methods can be grouped into two broad categories model free methods and model based methods both of which are described below along with the four ivs techniques partial correlation partial mutual information input omission and combined neural pathway strength that are the focus of this research following this review the overall objectives of the research are presented 1 1 1 model free methods model free ivs methods do not rely on a pre existing model bowden et al 2005a may et al 2011 most ivs methods belong to this classification and it includes common methods such as a priori knowledge and linear correlation the first ivs method examined in this research is partial correlation pc which is based on linear correlation however unlike most linear correlation based methods the pc criteria reduces the likelihood of linear redundancy between input variables this is done by iteratively selecting inputs from the candidate set and controlling each new selection with the inputs that have already been selected may et al 2011 the pc method iteratively selects inputs using a forward selection algorithm in which the partial correlation between candidate inputs and the target variable is calculated at each step where the input selected depends on the previous iteration he et al 2011 may et al 2008b sharma 2000 sharma et al 2000 this approach is criticized by may et al 2008 who stated that linear model free methods are not suitable for non linear models such as anns he et al 2011 demonstrated that while inferior to its partial mutual information pmi based counterpart described below pc is reasonably capable of identifying useful inputs the second model free method examined in this research is partial mutual information pmi similar to pc pmi is used in a forward selection algorithm since each selection depends on the previous one pmi based ivs was first used by sharma 2000 and sharma et al 2000 who used a bootstrapping algorithm to check for statistical significance of each pmi value which is used as the termination criterion for the algorithm bowden et al 2005a b apply pmi to predict river salinity using a two step algorithm where pmi is firstly used to select appropriate lagged inputs for each monitoring station then selects from the reduced set of candidate inputs this method is suitable for large candidate input sets especially where little to no expert knowledge of the hydrological system exists bowden et al 2005b 2005a this application of pmi correctly identified all of the relevant input variables for a synthetic dataset bowden et al 2005b 2005a may et al evaluated different termination criteria for the pmi selection algorithm for synthetic and water quality datasets may et al 2008b 2008a in addition to the bootstrap based approach may et al 2008b 2008a demonstrated the use of the akaike information criterion aic as an effective termination criterion for the pmi algorithm lastly he et al 2011 also demonstrated the capabilities of pmi using the aic based termination criterion for selecting input variables for an ann used to predict stormwater runoff quality parameters 1 1 2 model based methods model based ivs methods select inputs based on a calibrated model after inputs are selected models are recalibrated using a subset of the original inputs may et al 2011 the main limitations of this method are its high computational demand and its dependency on parameters that are decided prior to the model being trained also called hyperparameters for example the inputs selected by a model based method may depend on the number of hidden neurons chosen for the ann while hyperparameter optimization is not a focus of this research ensemble modelling is used to capture some of the uncertainty associated with the selection of model parameters specifically in this research k fold cross validation kfcv and multi start are used to generate ensembles which is discussed in greater detail in section 2 2 input omission io a type of model based ivs estimates input usefulness by iteratively examining model behaviour following the omission of an input from the full set of inputs with which the ann was trained io identifies useful and non useful inputs based on the significance or insignificance of the error caused by the omission of a certain input setiono and liu 1997 setiono and liu 1997 use io to select inputs for a classifier ann inputs are iteratively removed from the selected set based on the input corresponding to the smallest decrease in accuracy when omitted from the model the model is retrained at each iteration and the algorithm terminates once a maximum decrease in accuracy is reached next abrahart et al 2001 use input omission referred to as saliency analysis in their paper to explain ann behaviour and to identify important inputs timeseries plots are generated from io to infer the effect of each input on the model output e g how omitting precipitation impacts the rising limb of the modelled hydrographs this analysis provided a defense against criticism of anns as being black box models by demonstrating that omitting inputs that are known to be important drivers in hydrological systems negatively impacts the performance of the model lastly combined neural pathway strength cnps is another model based method that uses a linear approximation of the total neural pathway strength of each input to estimate its usefulness generally speaking the strength of a neural pathway is defined as the absolute magnitude of the weights associated with each input the higher the magnitude of the weight the stronger or more relevant a particular input is in predicting the desired output nath et al 1997 demonstrate an early use of this idea where the neural pathway strength is calculated as the relative absolute matrix multiplication between the first and second sets of weights of a 3 layer ann the cnps of each input is expressed as a percentage of the overall strength of all inputs the approach is found to improve classification accuracy across several synthetic and real world datasets more recently duncan 2014 adopted a similar ivs approach in which the cnps is approximated as the simple matrix multiplication between the two weight matrices of a 3 layer ann the sign of the cnps is used to indicate whether the input has an excitatory positive correlation with output or inhibitory negative correlation with output effect on the output this method relies on a model ensemble framework in which a distribution of cnps values is calculated for each input if the distribution is centred around cnps values of 0 the input is deemed non useful whereas if the distribution is centred at higher magnitudes of cnps values it is deemed to be useful duncan 2014 while this approach relies on simplifications and lumping and ann parameters e g ignoring the effects of the activation functions and biases within the ann it has demonstrated capable performance for identifying useful inputs duncan 2014 this approach has been used in several recent studies where the use of duncan s cnps method resulted in unchanged or improved model performance for applications in water quality prediction forest fire extent prediction flood forecasting and fever outbreak prediction duncan 2014 khan et al 2018 laureano rosario et al 2018 each of the ivs methods described above whether model based or model free are conceptually distinct in their approach to selecting the most useful inputs from a set of candidate inputs an important factor for each method is the termination criterion which is used to determine whether or not a candidate input is significant may et al 2008a regardless which selection criterion is used by an ivs method over or under selection of inputs as determined by the termination criterion may be detrimental to the overall performance of the model 1 2 objectives the overall objective of this research is to further develop refine and compare the four ivs methods described above pc pmi io and cnps so as to provide better tools for the development of ann models used for flow forecasting first we propose a novel ivs method io which builds on previous studies that evaluate input omission the proposed io method is designed to quantitatively identify non useful inputs addressing limitations in previous work on this method next we propose novel improvements to the cnps method developed by duncan 2014 which is improved by measuring input usefulness based solely on consistency defined as a statistical measure and eliminating the requirement of an arbitrary threshold for the selection criterion we compare these two model based methods to two commonly used model free methods pc and pmi such a comparison is necessary to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of each approach and a comprehensive comparison of performance efficacy has not been published in literature before these methods were chosen based on their distinctive characteristics which allow for further comparative analysis between ivs methods other than comparing model free and model based ivs approaches the selection of the aforementioned ivs methods also allows for the comparison of linear pc and non linear pmi cnps io methods and low computational effort pc cnps io versus high computational effort pmi methods secondly the impact of the standard predetermined termination criterion currently used for each ivs method on ann model performance is quantified the model performance with termination criteria based selected inputs is compared to model performance using a predefined number of inputs determined by each ivs method this analysis will help answer questions related to optimizing model complexity measured as the number of inputs used and model performance lastly the ann model performance using ivs is compared to the performance of using a full set of candidate inputs referred to hereinafter as the base model which provides a baseline of ann performance in an effort to quantify the improvement in model performance attributable to each ivs method often ivs methods are evaluated based on synthetic datasets or a single environmental system limiting broader use of the developed methods this research is conducted for two watersheds the bow river watershed in calgary alberta and the don river watershed in toronto ontario both in canada the watersheds have distinct dominant hydrological processes the first is a relatively large snowmelt dominated watershed with strong seasonality the second is a small flashy urbanized watershed additionally the bow watershed has a relatively large dataset available whereas the don watershed has a short timeseries allowing for a comparison of the methods under different data availability conditions the validation of ivs methods on real world datasets for two distinct watersheds demonstrates the broader applicability of these methods for future use the objective of this research with respect to flow forecasting models is to reduce the data requirements uncertainty of predictions and computing power required for these models and thus improve flow forecasting the following section provides details of the study regions the candidate input variables the structure of the ann used the mathematical development of each ivs method and model performance metrics used for the comparison 2 methods 2 1 site description and data source this research used hydro meteorological data from the bow upper and central and don river watersheds which are located in western and central canada respectively the locations of the target stream gauge and candidate input stations the upstream meteorological and stream gauging stations are illustrated in fig 2 the target stations for each watershed are the downstream stream gauge stations water level data from these stations are used as the dependent variables in the anns whereas lagged water level data are used as candidate input variables i e the independent variables for the ann referred to as autoregressive inputs the remaining candidate input stations are the collection of all upstream hydro meteorological referred to as exogenous inputs data used as the independent variables in the anns the target stations were identified as suitable locations for forecasting since both have a history of flooding in recent years namely in 2013 data from november to april and november to december were removed from the bow and don rivers respectively due to snow or ice conditions a summary of the watersheds attributes is provided in table 1 the upper and central bow river watersheds have headwaters fed by the rocky mountains and contain predominantly natural and agricultural land uses in comparison the don river watershed is heavily urbanized large regions of impermeable surfaces and stormwater management infrastructure is present throughout the basin hydraulic infrastructure is present along both rivers this is evidenced in the downstream hydrographs that have characteristic and unnatural receding limbs which are attributable to the operation of a dam this is confirmed based on available documentation for each river seasonality was determined using the 95 confidence bands of the autocorrelogram i e the autocorrelation plot of each river which was developed using 10 years of water level data the autocorrelation measures the similarity i e the correlation of a timeseries with itself at different lag times geurts et al 1977 if a timeseries has annual seasonality such as high flows in the spring and low flows in the autumn it is expected to be autocorrelated i e correlated with itself lagged by one year or multiple years the pearson s correlation function was used to measure the autocorrelation in each river note that the timeseries length of the don river dataset is limited for the target station only 10 months of common data was available between the candidate inputs and output data on the other hand 10 years worth of data was available for the bow river target station all of the data used in this research was collected and distributed by environment canada the water survey of canada or the city of calgary as indicated in table 2 2 2 ann model configuration a generalized process flow diagram that describes the model framework is provided in fig 3 a feedforward multi layer perceptron ann is used for this research which is the most widely used type of ann flood forecasting abrahart et al 2012 maier et al 2010 choosing a widely used model type facilitates comparison with existing studies moreover both model based ivs methods are designed based on the architecture of feedforward anns remote sensing stations located throughout each watershed continuously collect hydrometeorological data which is available in real time and stored as a timeseries datatype upstream water level and meteorological stations are used as candidate input variables for the ann the same timeseries are lagged by various amounts of timesteps which are also used as candidate input variables the timeseries for the downstream monitoring station is shifted forward in time which is used as the target observed flow the objective of this approach is to be able to predict the stage in advance to highlight the risk of high peak flow or flooding conditions using available upstream data the linear cross correlation function is calculated by measuring the correlation between one timeseries and a second timeseries at different lag times geurts et al 1977 the approximate lag times between the downstream target station and the other stations are estimated based on the maximum correlation of the cross correlation functions between each station excluding the downstream station and the downstream station the number of variables within the full set of candidate inputs at each site was intentionally large in order to demonstrate the utility of each ivs method to reduce the candidate inputs the candidate input sets are denoted in table 2 in a compressed form for example the first row of the bow river section includes the different water level inputs for the model there are two flow stations ids bb001 and bh001 each with three statistical transformations maximum daily mean daily and minimum daily and each for three different lag times unlagged lagged by 1 day and lagged by 2 days collectively this produces 18 water level input variables for the bow river the don river candidate set has a total of 60 input variables whereas for the bow river the candidate set has 30 input variables note that for both watersheds an ann model was created using all of the candidate inputs this model is referred to as the base model the base model was developed in order to provide a reference model to compare the ivs reduced ann models this comparison is intended to evaluate the change in model performance after input reduction using each of the four ivs methods each model predicts a single output either hourly 1 3 and 6 hour for the don or daily 1 2 and 3 day for the bow water levels a single output node is favoured for ann models since multiple models each with single output variables will outperform a single multi output model kaastra and boyd 1996 masters 1993 for instance for the bow river forecasts of 1 day 2 days and 3 days are predicted using distinct models rather than a single model with three outputs all models use a single hidden layer with 25 nodes which is sufficiently sized such that it does not restrict the performance of models with a large input set while various empirical rule of thumb methods exist for choosing the number of hidden nodes there is high variability between these methods maier and dandy 2000 while the hidden layer could be optimized based on a systematic trial and error approach for each unique model configuration it is computationally demanding and beyond the scope of this research khan et al 2018 a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid activation function was used between the input and hidden layer and a linear activation function was used between the hidden and output layer the second order levenberg marquardt algorithm lm is used to train the neural network while the first order backpropagation algorithm is the most widely used algorithm for flood forecasting anns the lm is also commonly used and is considered more efficient than the simpler backpropagation algorithm abrahart et al 2012 maier et al 2010 for this research the mean squared error mse is used as the objective function for the training the anns typically for anns datasets are partitioned into three subsets training validation and testing the training subset is used to calibrate the ann s weights and biases the initial values of each weight and bias is first randomly initialised after which the objective function mse is iteratively reduced using the lm backpropagation algorithm after each iteration the mse of the validation subset is calculated and training is terminated once the mse of the validation dataset stops decreasing this process is known as the early stopping procedure and is commonly used in ann applications to prevent overfitting or overtraining i e when the ann model outputs follow the targets too closely and hence lose generalisability and the ability to predict independent data reliably the third subset the testing subset is used to independently evaluate ann model performance by using data that was not used for training or validation in this research the dataset is partitioned into training validation testing subsets of 60 20 20 respectively k fold cross validation kfcv is used to train an ensemble of networks kfcv is a commonly used cross validation method where the data is partitioned into k partitions also called folds the model is calibrated using k 1 folds and evaluated on the remaining folds hastie et al 2009 the implementation of kfcv in this research is illustrated in table 3 since this research utilizes three distinct partitions training validation and testing kfcv is applied for the training and validation partitions whereas the test partition is fixed allowing for direct comparison between models within the ensemble using a cross validation method such as kfcv reduces the chance of the validation partition biasing the results and is useful for smaller datasets hastie et al 2009 in this research partitions are continuous blocks when the data is sorted temporally as opposed to random sampling which is typical for temporal data the most recent data is used for the test partition as this data is most representative of existing conditions in a real time forecasting scenario for both catchments in this research 5 folds 4 for training and validation and 1 independent fold for testing are used that are 2 years and 2 months for the bow and the don rivers respectively kfcv is used to capture the uncertainty associated with the selection of the calibration which includes the training and validation partitions then each unique fold configuration is trained 250 times to capture the uncertainty associated with the ann initialization which assigns random values to weights and biases to begin the lm training algorithm different initial values for weights and biases may result in different values after training the ann thus different predictions by considering multiple different starting points for these weights and biases a process referred to multi start is one way of characterizing the uncertainty associated with the randomness of the ann initialization collectively the four unique calibration configurations consisting of four different kfcv fold configurations as shown in table 3 and 250 multi start initialization for each configuration results in 1000 ann models which are referred to as an ensemble discrete models are referred to as ensemble members best practices in hydrological modelling suggest that model performance be assessed based on multiple performance measures as different measures capture different model characteristics ewen 2011 maier et al 2010 there is a wide variety of commonly used measures this research utilises four common measures including root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean absolute error mae and the persistence index pi the nse is the most commonly used performance metric in hydrology nse compares the model under study to the mean value nse is unitless and has a range between and 1 0 with 1 0 being the optimum value models with nse values between 1 00 and 0 75 are considered to have very good performance 0 75 0 65 indicates good performance 0 65 0 50 indicates satisfactory performance and lower than 0 50 is considered unsatisfactory based on the analysis provided in moriasi et al 2007 the pi is similar to the nse but is specialized for forecasting models instead of comparing model performance to the mean observed value as the nse does the pi compares the model under study to the naïve model abrahart et al 2008 anctil and lauzon 2004 de vos and rientjes 2005 kitanidis and bras 1980 for a model predicting the water level at some lead time in the future qt lead the naïve model simply uses the current flow qt as the estimate like nse the pi is unitless and normalized with a range between to 1 00 a pi value greater than 0 indicates that the model under study performs better than the naïve model lastly both rmse and mae are dimensioned performance metrics that have the same units as the observed data they are not normalized thus not contained within specific a range like nse and pi therefore there is no absolute threshold indicating whether or not the model is performing well instead rmse and mae are used for comparisons between different models for the same observed data or are used to calculate relative error these error measures are chosen from three distinct error measure taxonomies used for neural network assessment being based on squared residuals rmse and nse absolute residuals mae and timing pi maier et al 2010 while nse and rmse are essentially the same they are both included here due to their widespread use in previous hydrological studies ewen 2011 2 3 input variable selection the four ivs methods evaluated in this research are summarized in table 4 along with the selection and termination criteria used for each method these criteria are described in detail in the following sections all the ivs methods are applied using the calibration partition and the ann performance is measured using the independent test partition pseudocode for each ivs algorithm is included in appendix a each ivs method is used to reduce the number of inputs based on a pre established termination criterion listed in table 4 which is a common practice for ivs algorithms however using an ivs termination criterion may result in the over or under selection of input variables for example if pc selects ten inputs and pmi selects five inputs assuming there are 10 reasonably useful inputs the pc based ann may perform better than the pmi based model since more useful data is included this is not reflective of pmi as a poor selection criterion rather that the final selection is repressed by a too strict termination criterion this highlights the significance and impact of the termination criteria used for ivs in order to address the risk of non optimum termination criteria each ivs method is used to select the most relevant inputs which we have selected as 10 and 20 of the candidate set for each river without regard for any termination criteria this will showcase the capability of each ivs method to identify the most useful inputs and allows for a direct comparison between input reduced models that have the same level of complexity i e the same number of selected input parameters note that for methods where inputs are not selected iteratively i e cnps and io and thus the inputs are not ranked based on importance the selection criteria to rank inputs are described in table 4 and in the appropriate subsections in the methods section they are used to select a predefined number of inputs 2 3 1 partial correlation this method uses a forward selection algorithm to select useful inputs from a candidate set c based on the maximum pc between a given candidate input c j and the output y controlling for the effects of the set of inputs that have already been selected s for the first selection s is an empty set and the first input is selected as having the maximum squared linear correlation between the candidate c j and the output y note that both the pc and pmi based input selection methods were adopted directly from existing studies bowden et al 2005b he et al 2011 may et al 2008b sharma 2000 sharma et al 2000 however one distinction in the implementation of pc in this research that distinguishes it from previous studies is the use of r2 instead of r to avoid inputs with a strong negative correlation being selected last for a set of selected inputs s and a set of j candidate inputs for candidates j 1 j the partial correlation between c j and output y controlling s is given by 1 pc c j y s r v u 2 c o v u v σ u σ v 2 where u and v are the residuals given by the following equations 2 v c j c j s 3 u y y s where c j and y are the multivariate linear least squares regression estimates of c j and y respectively the algorithm for pc first calculates the correlation for each input and selects the input having the highest correlation next the residual u is calculated for the selected input s using equation 2 and the residual v is calculated for each remaining candidate input using equation 3 the input corresponding to the highest partial correlation which is described in equation 1 and is a function of u and v is moved from the candidate set to the selected set at each step the aic is calculated as per the following equation 4 ai c j n log e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 2 p where n is the number of samples and p is the number of parameters in the linear regression model this selection process is repeated until the aic increases if using the termination criterion the desired number of inputs is reached 3 6 12 etc for the non termination criteria experiments or no inputs remain in the candidate set 2 3 2 partial mutual information this selection method is conceptually similar to the pc based method described above but uses mutual information mi rather than linear correlation for input selection the pmi value is the shared entropy between output y and candidate input c j that is not also already contained in s expressed as mi c j y s the pmi based approach uses the same selection algorithm as for pc however the linear estimators c s and y s are replaced with non parametric estimators e c j s s and e y s s respectively and the selection criteria of partial correlation pc is replaced with the partial mutual information pmi the non parametric kernel regression estimation i e the conditional expectation of given s is given by the expression 5 e x s s 1 n i n n x i k h s s i i 1 n k h s s i where n is the total number of sample observations s is the selected set x is either cj or y and k h is the gaussian kernel function given by 6 k h x x i 1 2 π h d σ exp x x i t σ 1 x x i 2 h 2 where d is the dimensionality of x σ is the sample covariance matrix and h is the kernel bandwidth given by 7 h 4 d 2 1 d 4 n 1 d 4 the pmi is then calculated as follows 8 pmi c j y s m i u v 1 n i 1 n log e f u v f u f v where u and v are calculated using equations 2 and 3 using the respective non parametric kernel estimators c j s e c j s s and y s e y s s described in equation 5 f u f v and f u v are probability density functions of u v and joint u and v estimated using the following generalized expression 9 f x 1 n i 1 n k h x x i where n is the sample size and kh is the kernel function provided in equation 10 the aic which is used as the termination criteria is calculated using equation 4 where the number of parameters p is replaced with the effective degrees of freedom ν for non parametric kernel regression the effective degrees of freedom is given by the trace of the hat matrix h 10 ν t r h where the hat matrix h is given by 11 h i x k h x i x j 1 n k h x j x 2 3 3 input omission the method proposed in this research for io estimates input usefulness based on the change in performance following input omission without retraining adapting and improving previous methods used that are described in existing studies cf abrahart et al 2001 setiono and liu 1997 the complexity based performance measure aic is used as the performance criteria in this method as it permits for a small increase in error to be negated due to a slightly lower model complexity the aic is calculated using equation 4 where p is the number of ann parameters the sum of the weights and biases and y is given by 12 y j net j c c j c where y j is the output of n e t j c c j c which is the ann trained on c with input c j omitted inputs are selected based on the p value corresponding to the null hypothesis that ai c j and ai c c are samples from the same population against the alternative hypothesis that aic j is larger than ai c c using a two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks test this research uses a p value of 0 01 for the null hypothesis test the ks test cannot be used to rank input parameters therefore if io is being used to select a predefined number of inputs inputs are ranked based the median aicj values within the ensemble such that the omitted input corresponding to the largest increase in median aic is the most useful 2 3 4 combined neural pathway strength the cnps method used in this research is a modified improved and more generalised version of the method proposed by duncan 2014 where the neural pathway strengths are calculated for an ensemble of models which are then used to characterize inputs as excitatory and inhibitory in duncan s method the cnps values are calculated as the matrix multiplication of the input hidden and hidden output weight matrices 13 cnps ik w ij w jk where w ij and w jk are weight matrices with dimensions i j k which correspond to the number of input hidden and output nodes respectively in duncan s original method inputs are selected based on the ensemble interquartile range eqr metric which is defined as follows 14 eq r j min q 1 q 3 max q 1 q 3 s g n q 1 s g n q 3 where q 1 and q 3 are the 25th and 75th percentiles of the cnpsj distributions for input j eqr values are within the range of 1 1 and values greater than 0 are considered satisfactorily excitatory or inhibitory however while using this approach it was found that using an eqr of 0 as a threshold for ivs resulted in over selection consequently the eqr threshold was incrementally increased to an arbitrary value in order to select an optimum number of inputs based on model performance choosing an arbitrary non zero eqr value is undesirable since it required a trail and error approach and has no statistical meaning moreover the rate at which inputs are exhibiting excitatory or inhibitory behaviour is not known thus in this research the eqr metric was abandoned in favour of a statistical threshold inputs are ranked based on the percentile of dominant excitatory or inhibitory behaviour inferred by the signs of the cnps values for example if a threshold of 95 is selected it ensures that for each selected input inputs are exhibiting either excitatory or inhibitory behaviour at least 95 of the time within the ensemble the behavioural consistency of cnps values expressed as a percentage α for each input j is determined as follows 15 α j max c n p s j 0 c n p s j 0 n where cnp s j is the distribution of cnps scores and n is the number of ensemble members since multiple inputs may be identified at the significance value of α j 1 these inputs can be ranked based on the relative range of their cnps values 16 score min c n p s j max c n p s j inputs with a smaller range between the minimum and maximum cnps values will receive a higher score with a theoretical optimum score of 1 which indicates that the input exhibits exactly the same behaviour across the entire ensemble 3 results the ann models for both watershed systems were trained with the complete candidate sets the base model and ivs reduced inputs both using the termination criteria and predefined numbers of inputs either 10 or 20 of the candidate inputs to predict the stage at the target station a comparison of model performance using the four metrics rmse nse mae and pi are summarised in fig 4 and fig 5 and median values are contained in tables 5 and 6 for the bow river 1 day and don river 1 hour lead time models respectively note that these metrics were calculated only using the independent testing dataset the training and validation dataset are excluded from all performance evaluation in addition the results are calculated for all the models within each ensemble i e including the cross validation and multi start scenarios so as to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions thus these figures show the 25th and 75th percentile values blue boxes the median value red line and outliers red crosses of the predictions rather than deterministic results additional results for the other lead times for both rivers are included in appendix b figures b1 to b4 and tables b1 to b4 detailed discussion of the results presented in figs 4 and 5 are provided in sections 3 1 and 3 2 these figures show the performance of the flood forecast models using different combination of inputs on the vertical axes and each performance metric on the horizontal axes on the vertical axis of each subplot the upper most values are from the base model which includes all the candidate inputs followed by each of the four ivs methods first using the predetermined termination criteria then the two cases with predefined numbers of inputs the two cases for the predefined number of inputs are 10 of the candidate inputs 3 for the bow river and 6 for the don river and 20 of the candidate inputs 6 for the bow river and 12 for the don river for example in fig 4 the pc results are indicated by pc 17 pc 3 and pc 6 which corresponds to 17 inputs determined by the termination criteria followed by 10 3 inputs and 20 6 inputs of the 30 candidate inputs figs 4 and 5 demonstrate the effectiveness of using an ann approach for flood forecasting the error metrics indicate high performance for each metric the rmse and mae are low approximately 1 relative to of the observed values and the nse is greater than 0 75 with median values of about 0 98 for the bow and above 0 85 for the don see tables 5 and 6 for detailed results of the performance metrics which corresponds to very good model performance moriasi et al 2007 the median pi values are typically positive indicating that the models are an improvement over a naïve modelling approach in some cases such as the bow river pmi models approximately half the models in the ensembles have a negative pi indicating poor performance similar results can be seen for models with higher lead times results in appendix b and as expected the overall performance decreases and the variance increases as the lead time increases at the largest lead times 3 days for the bow and 6 hours for the don most models have an nse value of approximately 0 91 and 0 50 as indicated in tables b 2 and b 4 corresponding to very good and satisfactory performance respectively the pi also shown in tables b 2 and b 4 for the bow and the don are 0 06 and 0 40 respectively overall this suggests that it is possible to achieve high performance of flow forecasting models using an ann approach however an analysis of the impact of selecting inputs based on different ivs methods can help further refine these models in terms of performance computational efficiency etc which are described in the following subsections along with detailed information on which inputs were selected for each case 3 1 model performance with all candidate inputs the correlation and timeseries plots for the base models i e those that use all candidate inputs with one timestep leads 1 day for the bow and 1 hour for the don river are provided in figs 6 and 7 respectively which provide a general sense for the model performance both figures include 99th percentile bars which indicate the amount of uncertainty within the model ensembles which is quantified using the multi start and kfcv method employed fig 6 shows that the results of the independent testing dataset are very similar to the calibration training and validation datasets based on these figures both models exhibit slight under prediction of high water levels hence flowrates though this is more pronounced for the don river which is the more urbanized and flashier watershed from fig 7 it is apparent that both model outputs occasionally exhibit visible timing error during peak events however for the bow river this difference is generally captured within the 99th percentile uncertainty bands while a direct comparison with other hydrological systems offers little insight as different systems have unique physical characteristics and data availability it can provide a broad sense of whether the models are exhibiting reasonable performance out of the four error measures rmse and mae are not normalized and therefore are not useful for comparison between different systems or external models mosavi et al 2018 the nse values for both rivers are very good above 0 75 for five of six lead times evaluated mosavi et al 2018 the 6 hour don river forecast model demonstrated comparatively lower nse of 0 501 which corresponds to the lower limit for satisfactory model performance however based on discussion with the local watershed authority and the lag times inferred between upstream and downstream stations poor forecasting performance is expected for a lead time of 6 hours next while the bow river demonstrated a very good performance having an nse greater than 0 9 across all the lead times considered 1 2 and 3 day however this strong performance is somewhat superficial the bow river has high seasonality which can produce a model with a misleading nse value meshram et al 2018 thus the pi is a better indicator of forecasting strength of the model which decreases from 0 107 to 0 076 to 0 056 as the lead time increase from 1 to 2 to 3 days respectively as shown in tables 5 and tables b 1 and b 3 this is expected for forecast accuracy unlike the nse which remains high across all lead times the low pi for the 3 day lead time indicates that the ann model is only a marginal improvement over a naïve model in contrast to the bow river the don river has no significant seasonality as discussed in section 2 1 therefore the nse is a suitable performance measure as the explained fluctuations from the mean water level are due to hydrological events and are not overshadowed by seasonality within the system the performance of these base models is improved using ivs methods as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 and discussed in detail in the following section as discussed in section 1 1 reducing the number of model inputs can improve convergence during training and lower the complexity and data requirements of models 3 2 model performance with ivs the ivs models whether using a termination criteria or a predefined number of inputs often exhibit better performance than the models that uses the entire set of candidate inputs better performance being both an improvement in median performance and a decrease in range defined as the difference between the minimum and maximum performance within the ensemble this can be attributed to the fact that the ivs models have fewer non useful inputs see figs 4 and 5 the ivs models exhibit a decrease in performance when too few inputs are selected such is the case for the pmi models where the stringent termination criterion produces a model with only two inputs for the both the bow and the don both of which perform poorly similarly if too many inputs are selected e g the io models with the default termination criteria the model performance does not improve compared to the base models a detailed analysis of performance criteria for these models is listed in section 3 2 1 the selection order for the models with the termination criteria and models that select 20 of the candidate set is provided in table 7 for the bow river and table 8 for the don river where the input selection order is indicated numerically as well as by the colour intensity of the table cells for example in table 7 for the pc ivs termination results the first input selected is the 1 day lagged mean daily water level from station bh004 followed by the 2 day lagged mean daily water level from the same station the third and fourth input selected for this model is the 1 day and 2 day lagged maximum daily water level from the upstream station bb001 for this model a total of 17 inputs were selected using the termination criteria with the last input select being the 1 day lagged precipitation at the station labelled 3031093 the same pattern is seen for the pc ivs fixed results however the total number of inputs selected for this model is six with the sixth input selected as the 1 day lagged maximum daily temperature results in this table are further discussed in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 below the selection and termination criteria for each method are also shown graphically in figs 8 and 9 for the don and the bow rivers respectively these figures show the relative change in the magnitude of the selection criteria for the selection of the first 20 of the highest ranked inputs note that the termination criteria may stop the selection before or after the number of inputs included in these figures a detailed analysis and comparison of using termination criteria versus using a predefined number of inputs is provided in the following section 3 2 1 ivs with termination in these models the number of inputs is determined by a predefined termination criterion that terminates input selection when met which is outlined in tables 7 and 8 for both the bow and the don river cases pc selects roughly half of the available candidate inputs as expected the performance of the model ensembles is similar to that of the base models given the large number of inputs selected from the candidate set due to the termination criterion being too lenient for the next ivs case pmi selects only 2 to 5 inputs in all cases as a result the performance of these models is very poor for the bow comparing to the baseline model the median nse and pi performance of pmi 2 which is included in table 5 decrease from 0 985 to 0 983 and 0 110 to 0 005 respectively similarly for the don the nse and pi of pmi 2 decrease from 0 954 to 0 937 and 0 551 to 0 381 as per table 6 the decrease in performance is attributable to an ivs termination criteria that is too stringent thus terminating the selection of inputs that are used by the better performing models this early stopping is partly a result of the high estimated degrees of freedom of the non parametric kernel regression models pmi also favoured autoregressive inputs which resulted in poor model performance most notably in the don river models the kernel regression used in the pmi algorithm was found to fit the target data very closely the close fit causes the residuals denoted as u in equation 3 to be very small the residuals u may be thought of as patterns contained in the target variable denoted as y that are not captured by the kernel regression using one or more variables contained in the selected set when the kernel regression fits too closely to the target variable there are no patterns contained in the residuals u hence no improvements made by further input selection additionally the estimated degrees of freedom for pmi penalize the error much more heavily than the degrees of freedom for the linear model used for the pc method in the case of both the bow and the don models a close fit is achieved with only two selected inputs increasing the estimated degrees of freedom and producing a larger aic which results in the termination of selection as further inputs addition to not improve the already close fitting regression the relative number of inputs determined by these methods broadly agree with may et al 2008b who observed that the pc termination criterion is more lenient than the pmi based counterpart it is possible that modifications to pmi such as using a non gaussian kernel randomly sampling a subset of the data or adjusting the scaling factor may perhaps improve the selection of pmi for the model based ivs methods io for bow river selected nearly all the candidate inputs whereas for the don roughly half while developing the io method used in this research the use of a ks test was appealing due to its suitability for non parametric distributions when used on the don river this criterion was met when roughly half the inputs were selected an input reduction large enough to produce some of the benefits associated with ivs discussed in section 1 1 however when compared to results from the bow river models it is clear that the criterion was not stringent enough resulting in an over selection nonetheless the io method is quite capable of identifying useful inputs which is evidenced by the selection order illustrated in tables 7 and 8 io selected 58 83 of the number of inputs selected by the other ivs methods also the selection agrees with hydrological principles by selecting recent downstream water gauges followed by upstream stations that are lagged by a few timesteps hence capturing the time of travel of the runoff from upstream to downstream locations the selection order for io in these tables indicates that non useful inputs such as temperature which is not selected in the best performing models are among the last selected by the io method while the first selections agree with those of ivs methods that produce strong performing models this claim is further supported by the performance of io models that have used a predefined number of inputs which is discussed in the following section lastly for the cnps method in both cases this method selected between 10 and 20 and performed similarly to the fixed input cases suggesting that the termination criterion for cnps performs the best and does so consistently the proposed modification to the termination criteria using the statistical threshold described in section 2 3 4 for the cnps method appears to make the improvements creating a more robust ivs system compared to the other ivs approaches explored in this research 3 2 2 ivs for a predefined number of inputs in this section the optimality of the number of inputs determined using predefined termination criteria is assessed by comparing these inputs with two cases of models that have a predefined number of inputs selected as 10 and 20 of the candidate input set for each watershed the use of predefined number of inputs means that each ivs method can be compared against each other for the same number of inputs this approach allows for an assessment of each ivs methods performance whilst controlling for the number of inputs or level of complexity of the ann and the termination criteria used this will highlight which method selects the best inputs for improved model performance for the same level of model complexity for a predefined number of inputs for the bow model pc demonstrates lower performance compared to the termination criterion counterpart for example the median pi is 0 139 0 080 and 0 052 for the pc 17 pc 3 and pc 6 models respectively as illustrated in fig 4 compared to models for the other ivs methods that have the same number of inputs the pc results indicate that this ivs method does not accurately rank the most useful inputs within the candidate set and therefore is not a good ivs method specifically as illustrated in table 7 pc failed to select daily maximum inputs for station bh001 which are included in the selection of better performing models in the case of the don river the performance of pc improved with pc 37 pc 6 and pc 12 having median nse values of 0 957 0 962 and 0 962 respectively the models with a constrained number of inputs outperforming the termination criterion model suggests that the standard termination criterion was too lenient for this watershed next pmi overwhelmingly favoured autoregressive inputs selecting exclusively autoregressive inputs for the bow and all the autoregressive inputs for the don in the case of the don pmi first selected all 6 inputs for the target station followed by all 6 inputs for a nearby upstream station hy022 these models generally perform better than the termination criterion models with the nse shown in table 6 for models pmi 2 and pmi 12 increasing from 0 938 to 0 946 implying that the termination criterion is too strict however the shortcomings of pmi are best evidenced by the pi measure which is 0 461 compared to 0 551 for the baseline model demonstrating how too few exogenous inputs produces poor forecasting performance the models for io demonstrate improved performance for both watersheds while using fewer inputs indicating that this method is reasonably capable of ranking inputs and that the termination criterion used in this research is much too lenient given the large number of inputs selected for each watershed finally cnps models typically exhibit marginally lower performance while using a predefined number of inputs nse values are typically lower than the termination criterion models by an order of magnitude of 10 2 10 3 even while the number of inputs determined using a termination criterion is in between the two cases that use a predefined number of inputs suggesting that the termination criterion determined nearest to the optimum number of inputs this underscores the utility and effectiveness of the proposed statistical threshold proposed and implemented in this research for the cnps method 4 discussion ultimately there are no cases where the use of a termination criterion consistently produces better performing models than using a predetermined number of inputs this is true for both the bow and don watersheds and for the different ivs methods for example in fig 4 io 3 outperforms io 28 which over selects inputs using the termination criterion however this is not the case for larger lead times shown in appendix b where using a termination criterion produces slightly better performing models than io 3 and io 6 next in fig 4 the termination criteria for pc 17 over selects while the pmi 2 models under select since they both exhibit lower performance compared to their counterpart selections with 12 inputs as a result it is recommended that the number of inputs be determined using a systematic forward addition approach where each input addition is informed by an ivs based input ranking instead of determining the number of inputs based on a predefined termination criterion such an approach is similar to those used for the optimization of model hyperparameters i e hidden layer architecture this approach may use any suitable performance measure s or a complexity based measure for determining the optimum number of inputs all four ivs methods identify the most recent autoregressive input daily mean as the most useful often one or two more autoregressive inputs are selected before methods select exogenous inputs in fact the best preforming models for the bow river are achieved using only autoregressive inputs next three of the four ivs methods use one or more of the autoregressive daily maximum and upstream daily maximum data precipitation and temperature are seldom selected unless the ivs method s termination criteria is very lenient as is the case for pc and io the preference of autoregressive inputs in all models results in time delayed predictions which is evidenced by the strong nse but poor pi which is most apparent for longer lead times see appendix b the preference of autoregressive inputs for model free ivs methods is likely due to the strong dissimilarity between autoregressive and exogenous signals a significant limitation of the model free methods whereas for model based methods it may be attributed to the objective function mse of the ann the utilization of mse for ann training has been associated with time delayed predictions subsequently model based ivs methods will favour autoregressive inputs as such model based ivs methods cannot reliably avoid time delay issues for the don similar to the bow the first selection is the most recent autoregressive input see tables 4 and 5 next multiple inputs at upstream gauge hy022 are selected by all four methods as well as hy080 by pc io and cnps these three methods also each utilize one to four precipitation inputs the best performing models for the don rely on exogenous inputs which is evidenced by the difference in performance of the pc io and cnps selections and the autoregressive dominated pmi selection which is discussed in section 3 2 2 the selection order for the bow and don river models are consistent with expectations based on traditional knowledge of hydrological processes the autoregressive inputs which are consistently identified as the most useful input is expected to be most similar to the flow at the same station several timesteps forward using this input as the estimate the target flow is known as a naïve forecast next still consistent with the ivs results lagged versions of this input are important as they inform on the change in the flowrate at the downstream location typically only 1 to 2 lagged copies are selected suggesting that records of flow beyond this number of timesteps are not useful flow at upstream locations which typically exhibit water level patterns in advance of the downstream location the difference in timing being the lag time are the next most hydrologically relevant inputs the bow river ivs models typically do not heavily utilize input variables for this station with the exception of the daily upstream maximum unlagged input which was selected by all ivs methods except for pmi moreover the some of the best performing bow models do not utilize this station whatsoever while this station is expected to make a suitable predictor the underutilization may be attributable to factors such as the large distance between this station and the downstream location and the presence of infrastructure located between stations precipitation which produces the runoff that contributes to increased streamflow is expected to be a useful input variable for flow forecasting models excluding pmi the don river ivs models typically select precipitation inputs after the upstream flow selections however none of the bow river models select a precipitation input within the first six input selections this may be attributable to the location of the precipitation gauge in the bow river see fig 2 precipitation gauges are expected to be more useful at upstream locations rather than downstream as it takes much longer for the precipitation to concentrate downstream making it a better predictor the close proximity of the single precipitation gauge and the downstream flow gauge may be why it was not used by the ivs models temperature which may be considered a surrogate parameter for processes such as snowmelt and evaporation is also expected to be a useful input however none of the ivs models for either watershed except the pc model for the bow river selected temperature as an input variable the non utilization of temperature may be due to the timescale at which processes such as snowmelt occur relative to the number of lags provided to the model up to 2 days moreover the daily periodicity of temperature may also factor into its non utilization by the ivs methods next this research demonstrated an application of kfcv which coupled with multi start is used to generate model ensembles using kfcv or a different variation of cross validation is strongly encouraged it eliminates the subjective discretization of the training and validation data and quantifies the associated uncertainty such methods are simple to implement yet often missing in existing studies of data driven flood forecasting models furthermore provided advances to computing power thousands of anns can be trained in a short amount of time it is worth restating that input usefulness is a not binary but exists on a spectrum for real world datasets in which usefulness is measured based on model performance whether an input is useful corresponds to a point at which its inclusion in the model will not consistently improve the performance of the model consequently the usefulness of an input is a function of both the performance measures chosen for the model and the selection of model hyperparameters as demonstrated in this research improvements to model performance owed to the application of ivs methods should be assessed using multiple distinct measures next some of the uncertainty associated with hyperparameter selection is considered in this research by using an ensemble based modelling approach which demonstrates how the uncertainty associated with the selection of two groups of hyperparameters is quantified these include the calibration dataset partitioning kfcv and the initial values for ann weights and biases multi start lastly it is important to highlight that the base models which feature all candidate inputs perform reasonably well while the performance is improved with the removal of non useful inputs the input reduced models are not drastically superior to non input reduced models in the context of flood forecasting capabilities which is largely attributable to the strength of the lm training algorithm and the ann structure used in this research furthermore in practical applications there may be value in having redundant inputs such as in the event of a sensor failure in the monitoring network if an ivs method identifies inputs as non useful it does not mean that the monitoring location is not hydrologically relevant or important with respect to the overall purpose of the model 5 conclusions and recommendations this research evaluated four different ivs methods for ann models for the bow and the don rivers two methods were improved cnps by providing an alternative selection criterion that places increased emphases on the characterization of input behaviour and io by describing an ensemble based quantitative selection criterion which is lacking from existing work pc demonstrated reasonable performance for both watersheds however using a predefined termination criterion causes an over selection of inputs and the resultant models are outperformed by other ivs methods in most instances pmi suffered early stopping indicating that the aic based termination was too strict io demonstrated reasonably strong performance however the termination criterion used in this research is not recommended for future use as it was too lenient and inconsistent io may be improved by making changes to the method by exploring topics such as retraining after omission omitting more than one input at a time or using different performance criteria the modified cnps demonstrated the strongest and most consistent performance amongst the ivs methods evaluated which highlights the significance and impact of the proposed improvements to this method this research produced results for two reasonably distinct hydrological systems the bow and don rivers this type of validation is important for ensuring that methods are sufficiently robust to be useable for different hydrological regions in this research the results for both basins were generally in agreement however some notable exceptions include the pmi selection for the bow which performs adequately as an autoregressive model however an autoregressive model for the don exhibits very poor performance due to the flashy urbanized nature of this watershed next the selection criterion for io selected a drastically different number of inputs for the bow and don which was not observed using other ivs methods indicating that the selection criterion proposed in this research may need further refinement before future use other methods such as pc and cnps demonstrated reasonable and consistent selections both watersheds next this research determined that the use of a termination criterion is not consistent in selecting the optimum number of inputs instead it is recommended that ivs be used to rank input usefulness on a spectrum after which the number of inputs is determined on a case by case basis based on a systematic evaluation of model performance future research topics may include the coupled optimization of ann model inputs and hyperparameters and further refinements to cnps based ivs methods funding this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of

5762,variations in sediment yield are controlled by many variables that operate at different scales the relationships between sediment yield and its influencing factors at multiple time scales are still unclear since the underlying processes overlap at diverse scales the objective of this study was to use multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd to reveal scale specific controls on sediment yield annual sediment yield and its five influencing factors including runoff temperature precipitation potential evapotranspiration and ndvi were collected from 1982 to 2015 from six typical karst watersheds in southwest china using memd the different scales of controls on sediment yield were determined by decomposing the data into different intrinsic mode functions imfs and residues sediment yield was found to be significantly correlated with its potential controlling factors at two or more scales for each watershed although no significant correlations were observed between sediment yield and some of the influencing factors at the observation scales the factors controlling sediment yield were found to be scale specific and varied by watershed and some factors controlling sediment yield were more deterministic at longer time scales the scale specific controlling factors at a particular scale or residue were able to predict sediment yield at each scale imf or residue furthermore sediment yield at the observation scale was predicted by summing up all the imfs and the residues derived from the factor components at equivalent scales runoff and precipitation were the major predictors for sediment yield in all watersheds except in the hongshui watershed where the temperature and ndvi were the major explanatory variables that predicted overall sediment yield the predictions of overall sediment yield using memd were better r 2 ranges from 0 81 to 0 92 than the predictions of sediment yield made using the original data r 2 ranges from 0 32 to 0 78 this suggests that the complex relationships between sediment yield and associated factors are not captured by single scale observation scale analysis this study shows that memd may be a useful tool for revealing the scale dependent relationships between sediment yield and its controlling factors in karst watersheds keywords soil erosion scale dependent multivariate empirical mode decomposition intrinsic mode functions ecohydrology 1 introduction soil erosion by water is a major environmental problem especially in southwest china where the typical karst landforms are widespread and the area is ecologically fragile jiang et al 2014 borrelli et al 2017 li et al 2017a the continuous karst landforms in southwest china are characterized by shallow surface soil complex geomorphology particular lithology and high infiltration capacity li et al 2017b zeng et al 2018 karst contain pores fractures fissures and a network of conduits that have created a complex hydrological system of ground and underground drainage hartmann et al 2014 jukić and denić jukić 2015 karst landforms are prone to soil erosion and desertification due to a combination of the geological features improper land use practices and concentrated high intensity rainfall peng and wang 2012 dai et al 2017 karst soil is formed from carbonate bedrock and the soil formation rate is very low thus the soil loss tolerance is only 30 68 mg km 2 yr 1 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2019a therefore characterization of sediment transport processes and their potential influencing factors in rivers is important for the development of strategies to effectively control sediment loss in karst watersheds the physical processes that regulate soil erosion and sediment transport are complex and influenced by many factors knapen et al 2007 vercruysse et al 2017 runoff as a primary drive source transporting eroded sediment considerably influence the production of sediment in rivers de vente et al 2013 wang et al 2016 processes that regulate erosion operate at a variety of scales and one of the most important factors regulating erosion and subsequent runoff is precipitation de vente and poesen 2005 xu and yan 2005 li et al 2017a temperature and potential evapotranspiration are also strongly linked to sediment yield on the one hand temperature exerts substantial influence on the evapotranspiration as well as the runoff and thus sediment yield gardner 2009 tuset et al 2016 on the other hand vegetation and crop growth are sensitive to changes in temperature and evapotranspiration resulting in changes of sediment yield zhang et al 2001 sun et al 2006 vegetation type also significantly affects the soil erosion amount and transportation of eroded soil to surrounding water bodies due to differences in vegetation characteristics such as canopy roots and litter garcía ruiz 2010 duan et al 2016 generally relationships between sediment yield temporal patterns and the potential influencing factors are highly variable over various time scales zhang et al 2009 gao et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 thus processes that play a critical role at one scale may not be important at another scales consequently it is imperative to identify the scale specific relationships between sediment yield and its pertinent factors many multi scale approaches such as pearson linear wavelet and spectral analysis have been used to investigate scale dependent relationships between sediment yield and its potential influencing factors venditti and bennett 2000 yang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 li et al 2018 however the pearson linear wavelet and spectral analysis are all based on the principle of superposition and consider that sediment yield and its related processes are linear actually the influences from different processes as expressed by various frequency components are not additive and cannot follow the principle of superposition hu and si 2013 she et al 2014 therefore sediment yields are generally non stationary as they have means variances and covariance that change over time kuai and tsai 2012 the empirical mode decomposition emd is a tool that can identify scale specific controls of non stationary and nonlinear time series biswas and si 2011 kuai and tsai 2012 liu et al 2016 kim et al 2018 liu et al 2018 emd works by decomposing time series into a finite set of functions called as intrinsic mode functions imfs at different spatial temporal scales plus a residue the multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd analysis extends from emd and the latter has been used to analyze the nonlinear and nonstationary time series rehman and mandic 2010 the predictability of memd method generally outperforms emd hu et al 2014 previous studies have used memd analysis to distinguish the scale specific variables that regulate particular soil properties hu and si 2013 she et al 2014 she et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b however few studies have focused on identification of the scale specific controls of sediment yield using memd especially in karst watersheds where soil erosion may be more complicated than that in non karst watersheds due to the complex geologic structure and geomorphology the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the multi scale variability of sediment yield and its potential influencing factors during 1982 2015 in six selected karst watersheds of southwest china 2 to identify scale specific controls on non stationary and nonlinear sediment yield and 3 to predict sediment yield at the observation scale based on the scale specific relationships between sediment

evenly distributed throughout the year as about 80 of precipitation falls between april and october to test whether memd can reveal the scale specific controls of sediment yield six nested watersheds

yield at each scale or residue was predicted using the corresponding imfs or residue from its five potential influencing factors using the stepwise multiple linear regression an imf of a factor was removed from the stepwise multiple regression equation when p 0 10 and introduced to the equation when p 0 05 then the sediment yield at the observation scale was predicted by summing up the predicted values for each imf and residue of sediment yield as follows 1 s d p i m im f i p r e p where the s d p refers to the predicted sediment yield at the observation scale m refers to the imf numbers im f

stepwise multiple linear regression analysis were both performed using the spss 22 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment yield and its influencing factors at the observation scale descriptive statistical parameters of the sediment yield and its five potential controlling variables for the six karst watersheds are shown in table 1 the mean sediment yield ranged from 100 t km 2 y 1 in the yujiang watershed to 258 t km 2 y 1 in the nanpan watershed in comparison to non karst areas karst regions usually have low sediment yield due to the geological characteristics of the karst gao et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the soil loss tolerance was no more than 68 t km 2 y 1 in these karst watersheds and thus strategies are also required to control soil erosion peng and wang 2012 jiang et al 2014 interestingly the sediment yield demonstrated a strong variability in the hongshui watershed while moderate variability was observed in other five watersheds runoff and precipitation exhibited moderate variability while temperature potential evapotranspiration and ndvi all showed weak variability table 1 fig 2 shows the temporal variation in sediment yield and its associated variables over the observation period the sediment yield was relative high from 1982 to 1992 stabilized during 1992 2002 and relative low sediment yield was observed during 2002 2015 sediment yield exhibited a larger variation than its related variables fig 2 a result consistent with the high coefficient of variation for sediment yield table 1 soil erosion is a complicated process and influenced by the other intrinsic e g soil properties vegetation attributes and extrinsic e g climatic features variables which lead to high temporal variation in sediment yield knapen et al 2007 de vente et al 2013 vercruysse et al 2017 prior to conducting memd analysis the relationships between sediment yield and pertinent factors at the observation scale were evaluated fig 3 as expected runoff and precipitation both significantly affected sediment yield in all six karst watersheds p 0 05 fig 3 this result is in agreement with previous studies gao et al 2016 wang et al 2016 li et al 2017a however no significant relationship was observed between sediment yield and temperature in any of the karst watersheds p 0 05 fig 3 potential evapotranspiration was not significantly correlated with sediment yield in the liujiang watershed p 0 05 fig 3b but significantly influenced sediment yield in the other five watersheds p 0 05 fig 3a c f there were significant correlations between sediment yield and ndvi in the hongshui xunjiang and xijiang watersheds p 0 01 fig 3d f but no statistically significant relationships were found between those variables in other three watersheds p 0 05 fig 3a c these differences may be attributed to that the complex hydrogeological conditions and human activities like dam construction that mask or reduce the effects of temperature potential evapotranspiration or ndvi on sediment yield li et al 2018 3 2 multivariate empirical mode decomposition to identify correlations at various scales sediment yield and its five associated factors multivariate datasets were divided into four liujiang yujiang and xijiang watersheds or five nanpan hongshui and xunjiang watersheds imfs by memd fig 4 the number of oscillations and their respective widths for the imfs with the same numerical values differed between sediment yield and its five influencing factors fig 4 based on memd smaller numerical values in imfs correspond to greater frequency oscillations at shorter time scales while imfs with greater numerical values correspond to smaller frequency oscillations at higher scales biswas and si 2011 hu and si 2013 table 2 presents the specific scales of sediment yield and pertinent factors from imf instantaneous frequencies obtained using the hilbert transform the identified scales varied among the selected variables for a given imf table 2 these differences increased when the numerical values of imfs were high since a limited number of cycles were captured by imf at longer time scales this suggests that exact common scales did not exist at the longest time scale for all the variables which is consistent with the findings in liu et al 2016 and yang et al 2019a the time scales averaged for the six imf1s or imf2s were close implying that the corresponding scales were similar among different karst watersheds the imf1 or imf2 was probably expressed as system variations over relatively short time intervals of approximately 3 yr and 5 yr respectively however the means for the six imf4s ranged from 11 4 yr in xunjiang watershed to 19 1 yr in xijiang watershed these differences may be attributed to differences in the timescales of the processes that control sediment yields differed slightly between watersheds table 3 shows the relative importance of the changes to sediment yield at different time scales the variance contributions imf1 had the greatest variance contribution in the nanpan 43 5 and the liujiang 42 4 watersheds and imf2 had the greatest contributes to variance in the nanpan 29 6 and yujiang 27 2 watershed this suggests that short time scale fluctuations are predominant in two watersheds however this differed greatly from the remaining three watersheds where 35 of the total variance was manifested in the residues this large variance in the residue may be the results of variability at longer time scales that can be resolved with the memd analysis due to the relatively short observation period rehman and mandic 2010 dongli et al 2017 interestingly the sum of all contributions of the imfs and the residue to sediment yield for each watershed did not equate to 100 similar results were observed for the five related variables the may be attributed to a lack of robust orthogonality between the imfs of each variable it is important to note that orthogonality is a requirement for linear decomposition systems but not nonlinear decomposition systems such as memd hu and si 2013 she et al 2014 yang et al 2019b actually lack of orthogonality is not a shortcoming but a breakthrough as such the memd approach can successfully be applied to nonlinear non stationary data huang et al 1998 have checked the orthogonality of this decomposition using detailed calculation processes and indicated that orthogonality is not a necessary criterion for the memd approach for expanding nonlinear and non stationary time series huang et al 1998 also showed that orthogonality would not make physical sense for a nonlinear decomposition in memd method since memd was used in this study the lack of orthogonality does not necessarily compromise the physical scale specific meanings of the imfs and the residue huang et al 1998 yang et al 2019a 3 3 scale specific control of sediment yield fig 5 depicts the multi scale correlation coefficients between sediment yield and its five influencing factors at each imf or residue for the six watersheds the correlation coefficients greatly differed between watersheds sediment yield was significantly correlated with runoff at all imfs p 0 05 except imf2 and imf4 in the hongshui watershed p 0 05 similarly except for imf3 in the liujiang watershed and imf3 imf4 imf5 in the hongshui watershed p 0 05 correlations between sediment yield and precipitation were significant at all imfs p 0 05 fig 5 although no significant relationships were detected between sediment yield and temperature at the observation scale p 0 05 fig 3 the relationship between these two factors became significant in at least one scale component extracted by memd p 0 05 fig 5 for example sediment yield was significantly influenced by temperature at imf1 imf3 and imf4 in the hongshui watershed p 0 05 fig 5d this may be attributed to the arbitrarily selected scale of observation which is not necessarily representative of the linear relationships between sediment yield and the factors that influence sediment yield wendroth et al 2011 yang et al 2019a therefore weak correlation at the observation scale but significant correlations between some imfs or residues can be due to confounding variability that occurs at other scales or by contrasting relationships at the observation scale hu and si 2013 yang et al 2019b sediment yield and potential evapotranspiration were significantly correlated at all imfs in the yujiang watershed p 0 01 fig 5c while these relationships were complex for the other watersheds for example this correlation was statistically significant only at imf2 in the hongshui watershed p 0 05 fig 5d sediment yields were significantly affected by ndvi at imf2 for the nanpan liujiang and yujiang watersheds p 0 01 fig 5a c while these significant relationships were all observed at imf3 and imf4 in the remaining three watersheds p 0 05 fig 5d f sediment yield was significantly correlated with all five variables for residues p 0 01 fig 5 with the exception of the correlation between sediment yield and runoff for the xunjiang watershed p 0 05 fig 5e it is important to note that both runoff and precipitation had significant effects on sediment yield at most time scales while temperature potential evapotranspiration and ndvi considerably influenced sediment at long time scales fig 5 for example insignificant correlation between sediment yield and ndvi were detected at 3 0 and 5 6 yr short time scales as reflected in imf1 and imf2 respectively but these correlations were significant at 9 8 and 21 8 yr long time scales in the xijiang watershed table 2 fig 5f these results further verified that the relationships between sediment yield and its influencing variables were scale dependent these scale specific relationships were also found in previous studies in relation to soil moisture or hydraulic conductivity and environmental factors biswas and si 2011 hu and si 2013 she et al 2014 yang et al 2019a it is noteworthy that the direction of the correlation coefficients positive or negative differed depending on the scale for example temperature was significantly and negatively correlated with sediment yield at imf3 while a strong positive correlation at imf4 was observed between these two variables in the yujiang watershed p 0 01 fig 5c a possible reason for this change could be that the positive correlations at one scale could cancel out a negative correlation at another scale resulting low overall correlations 3 4 sediment yield prediction based on its scale specific controlling factors stepwise multiple linear regressions was used to predict sediment yield at each imf or residue using scale specific controlling factors at the same scale table 4 the adjusted r 2 generally increased with scale in all watersheds the adjusted r 2 was almost 1 at imf4 imf5 and the residue implying that almost all of the variance in sediment yield can be explained by its influencing factors at these time scales this result further corroborates that sediment yield cycles at longer time scales interestingly the scale specific related factors that were included in the regression equations differed with different imfs or residues specifically for the yujiang and xijiang watersheds runoff was selected for all imf scales and residue and it was not included in the equation for imf2 and residue in the xunjiang watershed for the liujiang watershed ndvi were always included in the equations for all imf and residue except imf1 which included runoff and potential evapotranspiration table 4 sediment yield can be predicted at the observation scale by adding together all of the predicted imfs and residues table 5 provides the prediction accuracy of multiple linear regression mlr equations based on the data before and after memd represented by mae rmse r 2 and nse values the mae 18 45 60 44 and rmse 16 98 46 56 using memd were lower than the corresponding mae 28 91 162 22 and rmse 18 50 74 48 values based on the original data at the observation scale as expected the r 2 and nse values derived from the mlr after memd were greater than those values from the mlr before memd also the scatter of the data after decomposition was closer to the observation values for all watersheds fig 6 therefore in contrast to sediment yield predictions based on the original data decomposing sediment yield into different scales using memd analysis enhanced the predictability of sediment yield fig 7 a illustrates the coefficients of determination between each predicted imf or residue and the overall sediment yield at the observation scale the relative importance of each imf or residue to the sediment yield varied greatly among different watersheds specifically imf1 and imf2 primarily contributed to the overall prediction of sediment yield in the nanpan liujiang and yujiang watersheds while the predictions of residues were principle contributors to the overall predictions of sediment yield in the hongshui xunjiang and xijiang watersheds this implied that the dominant processes influencing sediment yield had relatively long time scales in the hongshui xunjiang and xijiang watersheds compared to the nanpan liujiang and yujiang watersheds the relative importance of each variable used to predict sediment yield was also compared using the r 2 between total predicted sediment yields at different scales by each variable and the overall sediment yield at the observation scale fig 7b precipitation and runoff were the dominant factors influencing sediment yield in the nanpan liujiang and yujiang watersheds while the temperature and ndvi were the major explanatory variables affecting sediment yield in the hongshui watershed interestingly the five factors all exerted substantial influence on sediment yield in the xunjiang and xijiang watersheds implying that the dominant factors controlling sediment yield were probably more complicated in larger karst watersheds this study reveals that the relationships between sediment yield and its potential controlling variables are scale dependent because of the lithology and geomorphology in karst landscapes these relationships are complex which makes it difficult to identify what factors control sediment yield from simple observation data jiang et al 2014 li et al 2019b using memd analysis sediment yield at different time scales and the scale dependent relationships between sediment yield and the factors that influence sediment yield were determined sediment yield was better predicted from environmental variables using memd analysis compared to multiple linear regression of the observation data at the observation scale the results from current study provide a more comprehensive understanding of the multi scale correlations between sediment yield and associated factors and may provide scientific basis for improved watershed management 4 conclusions memd approach was used to decompose and evaluate scale dependent relationships of sediment yield with five potential influencing factors runoff precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and ndvi in six karst watersheds in southwest china with the memd method the variation of sediment yield was decomposed into four or five significant quasi periodic cycles and residues in some circumstances no significant correlations were observed between sediment yields and associated factors at the observation scale while the significant relationships were detected at two or more scales at each watershed implying that scale specific relationships existed between sediment yield and related variables sediment yield at an imf or residue can be predicted from the scale specific controlling variables at the corresponding imf or residue and sediment yield at the observation scale was also predicted by summing up all predicted imfs and residues temperature and ndvi were the main factors contributing to variability in sediment yield in the hongshui watershed while runoff and precipitation were the major predictors for sediment yield in the other five watersheds the overall sediment yield prediction using memd approach was better than the sediment yield predictions based on the original data at the observation scale the memd method was used to identify the scale specific controls on sediment yield making an overall prediction of sediment yield and influencing factors stronger since the relevant hydrological processes are generally non stationary and

5762,variations in sediment yield are controlled by many variables that operate at different scales the relationships between sediment yield and its influencing factors at multiple time scales are still unclear since the underlying processes overlap at diverse scales the objective of this study was to use multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd to reveal scale specific controls on sediment yield annual sediment yield and its five influencing factors including runoff temperature precipitation potential evapotranspiration and ndvi were collected from 1982 to 2015 from six typical karst watersheds in southwest china using memd the different scales of controls on sediment yield were determined by decomposing the data into different intrinsic mode functions imfs and residues sediment yield was found to be significantly correlated with its potential controlling factors at two or more scales for each watershed although no significant correlations were observed between sediment yield and some of the influencing factors at the observation scales the factors controlling sediment yield were found to be scale specific and varied by watershed and some factors controlling sediment yield were more deterministic at longer time scales the scale specific controlling factors at a particular scale or residue were able to predict sediment yield at each scale imf or residue furthermore sediment yield at the observation scale was predicted by summing up all the imfs and the residues derived from the factor components at equivalent scales runoff and precipitation were the major predictors for sediment yield in all watersheds except in the hongshui watershed where the temperature and ndvi were the major explanatory variables that predicted overall sediment yield the predictions of overall sediment yield using memd were better r 2 ranges from 0 81 to 0 92 than the predictions of sediment yield made using the original data r 2 ranges from 0 32 to 0 78 this suggests that the complex relationships between sediment yield and associated factors are not captured by single scale observation scale analysis this study shows that memd may be a useful tool for revealing the scale dependent relationships between sediment yield and its controlling factors in karst watersheds keywords soil erosion scale dependent multivariate empirical mode decomposition intrinsic mode functions ecohydrology 1 introduction soil erosion by water is a major environmental problem especially in southwest china where the typical karst landforms are widespread and the area is ecologically fragile jiang et al 2014 borrelli et al 2017 li et al 2017a the continuous karst landforms in southwest china are characterized by shallow surface soil complex geomorphology particular lithology and high infiltration capacity li et al 2017b zeng et al 2018 karst contain pores fractures fissures and a network of conduits that have created a complex hydrological system of ground and underground drainage hartmann et al 2014 jukić and denić jukić 2015 karst landforms are prone to soil erosion and desertification due to a combination of the geological features improper land use practices and concentrated high intensity rainfall peng and wang 2012 dai et al 2017 karst soil is formed from carbonate bedrock and the soil formation rate is very low thus the soil loss tolerance is only 30 68 mg km 2 yr 1 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2019a therefore characterization of sediment transport processes and their potential influencing factors in rivers is important for the development of strategies to effectively control sediment loss in karst watersheds the physical processes that regulate soil erosion and sediment transport are complex and influenced by many factors knapen et al 2007 vercruysse et al 2017 runoff as a primary drive source transporting eroded sediment considerably influence the production of sediment in rivers de vente et al 2013 wang et al 2016 processes that regulate erosion operate at a variety of scales and one of the most important factors regulating erosion and subsequent runoff is precipitation de vente and poesen 2005 xu and yan 2005 li et al 2017a temperature and potential evapotranspiration are also strongly linked to sediment yield on the one hand temperature exerts substantial influence on the evapotranspiration as well as the runoff and thus sediment yield gardner 2009 tuset et al 2016 on the other hand vegetation and crop growth are sensitive to changes in temperature and evapotranspiration resulting in changes of sediment yield zhang et al 2001 sun et al 2006 vegetation type also significantly affects the soil erosion amount and transportation of eroded soil to surrounding water bodies due to differences in vegetation characteristics such as canopy roots and litter garcía ruiz 2010 duan et al 2016 generally relationships between sediment yield temporal patterns and the potential influencing factors are highly variable over various time scales zhang et al 2009 gao et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 thus processes that play a critical role at one scale may not be important at another scales consequently it is imperative to identify the scale specific relationships between sediment yield and its pertinent factors many multi scale approaches such as pearson linear wavelet and spectral analysis have been used to investigate scale dependent relationships between sediment yield and its potential influencing factors venditti and bennett 2000 yang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 li et al 2018 however the pearson linear wavelet and spectral analysis are all based on the principle of superposition and consider that sediment yield and its related processes are linear actually the influences from different processes as expressed by various frequency components are not additive and cannot follow the principle of superposition hu and si 2013 she et al 2014 therefore sediment yields are generally non stationary as they have means variances and covariance that change over time kuai and tsai 2012 the empirical mode decomposition emd is a tool that can identify scale specific controls of non stationary and nonlinear time series biswas and si 2011 kuai and tsai 2012 liu et al 2016 kim et al 2018 liu et al 2018 emd works by decomposing time series into a finite set of functions called as intrinsic mode functions imfs at different spatial temporal scales plus a residue the multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd analysis extends from emd and the latter has been used to analyze the nonlinear and nonstationary time series rehman and mandic 2010 the predictability of memd method generally outperforms emd hu et al 2014 previous studies have used memd analysis to distinguish the scale specific variables that regulate particular soil properties hu and si 2013 she et al 2014 she et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b however few studies have focused on identification of the scale specific controls of sediment yield using memd especially in karst watersheds where soil erosion may be more complicated than that in non karst watersheds due to the complex geologic structure and geomorphology the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the multi scale variability of sediment yield and its potential influencing factors during 1982 2015 in six selected karst watersheds of southwest china 2 to identify scale specific controls on non stationary and nonlinear sediment yield and 3 to predict sediment yield at the observation scale based on the scale specific relationships between sediment yield and associated factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the typical karst region of the xijiang watershed 102 16 52 113 23 51 e 21 36 17 27 00 21 n which has

descriptive statistical parameters of the sediment yield and its five potential controlling variables for the six karst watersheds are shown in table 1 the mean sediment yield ranged from 100 t km 2 y 1 in the yujiang watershed to 258 t km 2 y 1 in the nanpan watershed in comparison to non karst areas karst regions usually have low sediment yield due to the geological characteristics of the karst gao et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the soil loss tolerance was no more than 68 t km 2 y 1 in these karst watersheds and thus strategies are also required to control soil erosion peng and wang 2012 jiang et al 2014 interestingly the sediment yield demonstrated a strong variability in the hongshui watershed while moderate variability was observed in other five watersheds runoff and precipitation exhibited moderate variability while temperature potential evapotranspiration and ndvi all showed weak variability table 1 fig 2 shows the temporal variation in sediment yield and its associated variables over the observation period the sediment yield was relative high from 1982 to 1992 stabilized during 1992 2002 and relative low sediment yield was observed during 2002 2015 sediment yield exhibited a larger variation than its related variables fig 2 a result consistent with the high coefficient of variation for sediment yield table 1 soil erosion is a complicated process and influenced by the other intrinsic e g soil properties vegetation attributes and extrinsic e g climatic features variables which lead to high temporal variation in sediment yield knapen et al 2007 de vente et al 2013 vercruysse et al 2017 prior to conducting memd analysis the relationships between sediment yield and pertinent factors at the observation scale were evaluated fig 3 as expected runoff and precipitation both significantly affected sediment yield in all six karst watersheds p 0 05 fig 3 this result is in agreement with previous studies gao et al 2016 wang et al 2016 li et al 2017a however no significant relationship was observed between sediment yield and temperature in any of the karst watersheds p 0 05 fig 3 potential evapotranspiration was not significantly correlated with sediment yield in the liujiang watershed p 0 05 fig 3b but significantly influenced sediment yield in the other five watersheds p 0 05 fig 3a c f there were significant correlations between sediment yield and ndvi in the hongshui xunjiang and xijiang watersheds p 0 01 fig 3d f but no statistically significant relationships were found between those variables in other three watersheds p 0 05 fig 3a c these differences may be attributed to that the complex hydrogeological conditions and human activities like dam construction that mask or reduce the effects of temperature potential evapotranspiration or ndvi on sediment yield li et al 2018 3 2 multivariate empirical mode decomposition to identify correlations at various scales sediment yield and its five associated factors multivariate datasets were divided into four liujiang yujiang and xijiang watersheds or five nanpan hongshui and xunjiang watersheds imfs by memd fig 4 the number of oscillations and their respective widths for the imfs with the same numerical values differed between sediment yield and its five influencing factors fig 4 based on memd smaller numerical values in imfs correspond to greater frequency oscillations at shorter time scales while imfs with greater numerical values correspond to smaller frequency oscillations at higher scales biswas and si 2011 hu and si 2013 table 2 presents the specific scales of sediment yield and pertinent factors from imf instantaneous frequencies obtained using the hilbert transform the identified scales varied among the selected variables for a given imf table 2 these differences increased when the numerical values of imfs were high since a limited number of cycles were captured by imf at longer time scales this suggests that exact common scales did not exist at the longest time scale for all the variables which is consistent with the findings in liu et al 2016 and yang et al 2019a the time scales averaged for the six imf1s or imf2s were close implying that the corresponding scales were similar among different karst watersheds the imf1 or imf2 was probably expressed as system variations over relatively short time intervals of approximately 3 yr and 5 yr respectively however the means for the six imf4s ranged from 11 4 yr in xunjiang watershed to 19 1 yr in xijiang watershed these differences may be attributed to differences in the timescales of the processes that control sediment yields differed slightly between watersheds table 3 shows the relative importance of the changes to sediment yield at different time scales the variance contributions imf1 had the greatest variance contribution in the nanpan 43 5 and the liujiang 42 4 watersheds and imf2 had the greatest contributes to variance in the nanpan 29 6 and yujiang 27 2 watershed this suggests that short time scale fluctuations are predominant in two watersheds however this differed greatly from the remaining three watersheds where 35 of the total variance was manifested in the residues this large variance in the residue may be the results of variability at longer time scales that can be resolved with the memd analysis due to the relatively short observation period rehman and mandic 2010 dongli et al 2017 interestingly the sum of all contributions of the imfs and the residue to sediment yield for each watershed did not equate to 100 similar results were observed for the five related variables the may be attributed to a lack of robust orthogonality between the imfs of each variable it is important to note that orthogonality is a requirement for linear decomposition systems but not nonlinear decomposition systems such as memd hu and si 2013 she et al 2014 yang et al 2019b actually lack of orthogonality is not a shortcoming but a breakthrough as such the memd approach can successfully be applied to nonlinear non stationary data huang et al 1998 have checked the orthogonality of this decomposition using detailed calculation processes and indicated that orthogonality is not a necessary criterion for the memd approach for expanding nonlinear and non stationary time series huang et al 1998 also showed that orthogonality would not make physical sense for a nonlinear decomposition in memd method since memd was used in this study the lack of orthogonality does not necessarily compromise the physical scale specific meanings of the imfs and the residue huang et al 1998 yang et al 2019a 3 3 scale specific control of sediment yield fig 5 depicts the multi scale correlation coefficients between sediment yield and its five influencing factors at each imf or residue for the six watersheds the correlation coefficients greatly differed between watersheds sediment yield was significantly correlated with runoff at all imfs p 0 05 except imf2 and imf4 in the hongshui watershed p 0 05 similarly except for imf3 in the liujiang watershed and imf3 imf4 imf5 in the hongshui watershed p 0 05 correlations between sediment yield and precipitation were significant at all imfs p 0 05 fig 5 although no significant relationships were detected between sediment yield and temperature at the observation scale p 0 05 fig 3 the relationship between these two factors became significant in at least one scale component extracted by memd p 0 05 fig 5 for example sediment yield was significantly influenced by temperature at imf1 imf3 and imf4 in the hongshui watershed p 0 05 fig 5d this may be attributed to the arbitrarily selected scale of observation which is not necessarily representative of the linear relationships between sediment yield and the factors that influence sediment yield wendroth et al 2011 yang et al 2019a therefore weak correlation at the observation scale but significant correlations between some imfs or residues can be due to confounding variability that occurs at other scales or by contrasting relationships at the observation scale hu and si 2013 yang et al 2019b sediment yield and potential evapotranspiration were significantly correlated at all imfs in the yujiang watershed p 0 01 fig 5c while these relationships were complex for the other watersheds for example this correlation was statistically significant only at imf2 in the hongshui watershed p 0 05 fig 5d sediment yields were significantly affected by ndvi at imf2 for the nanpan liujiang and yujiang watersheds p 0 01 fig 5a c while these significant relationships were all observed at imf3 and imf4 in the remaining three watersheds p 0 05 fig 5d f sediment yield was significantly correlated with all five variables for residues p 0 01 fig 5 with the exception of the correlation between sediment yield and runoff for the xunjiang watershed p 0 05 fig 5e it is important to note that both runoff and precipitation had significant effects on sediment yield at most time scales while temperature potential evapotranspiration and ndvi considerably influenced sediment at long time scales fig 5 for example insignificant correlation between sediment yield and ndvi were detected at 3 0 and 5 6 yr short time scales as reflected in imf1 and imf2 respectively but these correlations were significant at 9 8 and 21 8 yr long time scales in the xijiang watershed table 2 fig 5f these results further verified that the relationships between sediment yield and its influencing variables were scale dependent these scale specific relationships were also found in previous studies in relation to soil moisture or hydraulic conductivity and environmental factors biswas and si 2011 hu and si 2013 she et al 2014 yang et al 2019a it is noteworthy that the direction of the correlation coefficients positive or negative differed depending on the scale for example temperature was significantly and negatively correlated with sediment yield at imf3 while a strong positive correlation at imf4 was observed between these two variables in the yujiang watershed p 0 01 fig 5c a possible reason for this change could be that the positive correlations at one scale could cancel out a negative correlation at another scale resulting low overall correlations 3 4 sediment yield prediction based on its scale specific controlling factors stepwise multiple linear regressions was used to predict sediment yield at each imf or residue using scale specific controlling factors at the same scale table 4 the adjusted r 2 generally increased with scale in all watersheds the adjusted r 2 was almost 1 at imf4 imf5 and the residue implying that almost all of the variance in sediment yield can be explained by its influencing factors at these time scales this result further corroborates that sediment yield cycles at longer time scales interestingly the scale specific related factors that were included in the regression equations differed with different imfs or residues specifically for the yujiang and xijiang watersheds runoff was selected for all imf scales and residue and it was not included in the equation for imf2 and residue in the xunjiang watershed for the liujiang watershed ndvi were always included in the equations for all imf and residue except imf1 which included runoff and potential evapotranspiration table 4 sediment yield can be predicted at the observation scale by adding together all of the predicted imfs and residues table 5 provides the prediction accuracy of multiple linear regression mlr equations based on the data before and after memd represented by mae rmse r 2 and nse values the mae 18 45 60 44 and rmse 16 98 46 56 using memd were lower than the corresponding mae 28 91 162 22 and rmse 18 50 74 48 values based on the original data at the observation scale as expected the r 2 and nse values derived from the mlr after memd were greater than those values from the mlr before memd also the scatter of the data after decomposition was closer to the observation values for all watersheds fig 6 therefore in contrast to sediment yield predictions based on the original data decomposing sediment yield into different scales using memd analysis enhanced the predictability of sediment yield fig 7 a illustrates the coefficients of determination between each predicted imf or residue and the overall sediment yield at the observation scale the relative importance of each imf or residue to the sediment yield varied greatly among different watersheds specifically imf1 and imf2 primarily contributed to the overall prediction of sediment yield in the nanpan liujiang and yujiang watersheds while the predictions of residues were principle contributors to the overall predictions of sediment yield in the hongshui xunjiang and xijiang watersheds this implied that the dominant processes influencing sediment yield had relatively long time scales in the hongshui xunjiang and xijiang watersheds compared to the nanpan liujiang and yujiang watersheds the relative importance of each variable used to predict sediment yield was also compared using the r 2 between total predicted sediment yields at different scales by each variable and the overall sediment yield at the observation scale fig 7b precipitation and runoff were the dominant factors influencing sediment yield in the nanpan liujiang and yujiang watersheds while the temperature and ndvi were the major explanatory variables affecting sediment yield in the hongshui watershed interestingly the five factors all exerted substantial influence on sediment yield in the xunjiang and xijiang watersheds implying that the dominant factors controlling sediment yield were probably more complicated in larger karst watersheds this study reveals that the relationships between sediment yield and its potential controlling variables are scale dependent because of the lithology and geomorphology in karst landscapes these relationships are complex which makes it difficult to identify what factors control sediment yield from simple observation data jiang et al 2014 li et al 2019b using memd analysis sediment yield at different time scales and the scale dependent relationships between sediment yield and the factors that influence sediment yield were determined sediment yield was better predicted from environmental variables using memd analysis compared to multiple linear regression of the observation data at the observation scale the results from current study provide a more comprehensive understanding of the multi scale correlations between sediment yield and associated factors and may provide scientific basis for improved watershed management 4 conclusions memd approach was used to decompose and evaluate scale dependent relationships of sediment yield with five potential influencing factors runoff precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and ndvi in six karst watersheds in southwest china with the memd method the variation of sediment yield was decomposed into four or five significant quasi periodic cycles and residues in some circumstances no significant correlations were observed between sediment yields and associated factors at the observation scale while the significant relationships were detected at two or more scales at each watershed implying that scale specific relationships existed between sediment yield and related variables sediment yield at an imf or residue can be predicted from the scale specific controlling variables at the corresponding imf or residue and sediment yield at the observation scale was also predicted by summing up all predicted imfs and residues temperature and ndvi were the main factors contributing to variability in sediment yield in the hongshui watershed while runoff and precipitation were the major predictors for sediment yield in the other five watersheds the overall sediment yield prediction using memd approach was better than the sediment yield predictions based on the original data at the observation scale the memd method was used to identify the scale specific controls on sediment yield making an overall prediction of sediment yield and influencing factors stronger since the relevant hydrological processes are generally non stationary and

5763,in this study longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients of the two dimensional advection dispersion model were calculated using both the velocity and concentration data obtained through tracer tests in large scale meandering channels the velocity based dispersion coefficients calculated by applying the theoretical equations to the velocity data were compared with concentration based dispersion coefficients that were calculated by applying the routing procedure to the measured concentration curves the results showed that the cross sectional averaged values of the dimensionless longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l h u calculated from the velocity profile data ranged 4 1 6 5 which corresponded to the theoretical value whereas d l h u by concentration data ranged 14 7 35 5 which was 4 6 times larger than the velocity based coefficient the cross sectional maximum values of the dimensionless transverse dispersion coefficient d t h u by the velocity based method ranged 0 1 3 3 whereas d t h u by concentration based method was 0 9 2 9 these results revealed that the velocity based longitudinal dispersion coefficient is a fractional value of the concentration based result which contained mixing caused by channel irregularities throughout the reach in addition to shear dispersion by vertical velocity variations while transverse dispersion coefficients by both methods represented the same dispersion mechanism which was dominated by the secondary currents developed in highly sinuous channels keywords 2d mixing meandering channels dispersion coefficients vertical velocity deviation concentration data shear dispersion 1 introduction when a pollutant is first inserted into an open channel it spreads and goes through several stages of shear dispersion as in fig 1 a in the first stage which is considered the near field vertical mixing mainly occurs in most open channels that would be completely mixed in a relatively short time because the water depth is much smaller than the width of the channel in the second stage known as the intermediate field the transverse and longitudinal mixings take place and is a subject for careful investigation as the vertical mixing is already completed the mixing stage of the intermediate field is very long compared to near field mixing therefore for accurate analysis of the mixing in large rivers study of the two dimensional mixing is required fischer et al 1979 in meandering rivers as shown in fig 1a the analysis of two dimensional 2d mixing would be affected by the combined effects of the variation of flow and channel geometries where the variation of streamwise and spanwise flow that changes throughout the meandering channel would affect the longitudinal and transverse mixing respectively the secondary flow has increased especially at the bend apex areas of the meandering channel increasing the transverse mixing of any contaminant then as the contaminant passes throughout the channel to the crossover areas of the channel the longitudinal mixing would be more dominant as illustrated in fig 1a since the mixing characteristics are dependent on these flow structures careful analysis of both streamwise and spanwise flows are necessary to understand the 2d mixing in meandering rivers for the modeling of mixing in the intermediate field the 2d advection dispersion equation ade has been used the 2d advection dispersion equation derived by depth averaging the three dimensional transport equation for natural channels could be shown in the curvilinear coordinate system as the following lee and seo 2013 1 c t u s c s u n c n 1 h s h d l c s 1 h n h d t c n where c is the depth averaged concentration h is the local depth u s and u n are the depth averaged velocities in the streamwise and span wise directions respectively d l is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d t is the transverse dispersion coefficient s is the steamwise direction n is the spanwise direction and t is time to use the 2d ade for the analysis of contaminant transport in shallow flows of rivers the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients should be provided for the study of contaminant dispersion and its coefficients taylor 1954 originally explained that the mixing properties of pollutant dispersion by shear flow that can be described with the dispersion coefficients in the pipe flow later aris 1956 presented the method of concentration moments by theoretical analysis which were expanded into generalized theoretical dispersion researches gill 1967 wang and chen 2016 to find the dispersion coefficients through field experiments for data acquisition either concentration driven method or velocity driven method could be used depending the availability of the data in the case of the velocity driven method the 2d dispersion coefficients shown in eq 1 could be calculated using the vertical profiles of streamwise and spanwise velocities following the theoretical derivation by fischer et al 1979 as 2a d l 1 h 0 h u s 0 z 1 ε v 0 z u s d z d z d z 2b d t 1 h 0 h u n 0 z 1 ε v 0 z u n d z d z d z where ε v is the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient z is the vertical distance from the channel bottom and u s and u n are the velocity deviations from the depth averaged velocity in the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively as shown in fig 1b eq 2 was from the rate of mass transport with the cross sectional mixing coefficient applied to a skewed shear flow with velocity profiles in two directions it assumed that the mechanical spreading of contaminants by shear dispersion was done by the characteristic of the vertical flow structure using eq 2 longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients could be calculated from the velocity data without using the concentration data obtained from high cost tracer tests thus in recent years field researches carr and rehmann 2007 shen et al 2010 kim 2012 erwin and jacobson 2015 pilechi et al 2016 were conducted in which this method was used to obtain the observed dispersion coefficient with the convenient acquisition of the velocity data using acoustic doppler current profilers adcp which originally was an efficient equipment to measure accurate flow velocities and topography in open channels from fixed or moving measurements since adcp measurements were already used frequently for discharge measurements in rivers using eq 2 for the calculation of dispersion coefficients decreased the necessity of conducting high cost tracer tests for dispersion coefficients another method to calculate the two dimensional dispersion is a concentration based method in which either the moment methods or the routing techniques are applied to the measured concentration curves through tracer tests fischer et al 1979 the moment methods were frequently applied to calculate the transverse dispersion coefficients from the field tracer studies which were conducted with steady state conditions yotsukura and fischer 1970 sayre 1979 beltaos 1980 holley and nerat 1983 rutherford 1994 in this case only the transverse dispersion coefficient could be calculated with tracer tests with the steady state condition so those researches did not focus much on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for this reason in the early modeling of 2d ade the theoretical longitudinal dispersion coefficient proposed by elder 1959 was usually used however more recently to find the actual values for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for 2d mixing analysis in natural streams tracer studies were conducted with an unsteady tracer input baek and seo 2010 sun et al 2011 seo et al 2016 then the two dimensional routing procedure which was developed following the same theory used for one dimensional routing method by fischer et al 1979 was applied to calculate both longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients simultaneously baek et al 2006 baek and seo 2010 2013 using these two different methods calculated longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients were reported in several studies seo et al 2006 baek et al 2006 baek and seo 2010 kim 2012 and seo et al 2016 they reported that the transverse dispersion coefficients calculated from concentration data of transient tracer tests were in the similar range with the values obtained from the steady state tracer tests i e d t h u 0 2 1 0 and this dimensionless coefficient mostly increased with increasing channel sinuosity even though it showed some sensitivity to the channel aspect ratio w h seo et al 2016 here h is the average depth of the river and u is the shear velocity and w is the average width of the river in recent years several researchers reported that values of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient calculated by the concentration data from field studies are much higher than the theoretical value suggested by elder 1959 which was derived under the assumption of the shear flow over an infinitely wide plane as 3 d l h u 5 93 higher observed values of d l h u were firstly reported by seo et al 2006 and baek and seo 2010 based on the concentration data from tracer study under slug tests they found that d l h u ranges 10 to 90 in highly sinuous natural rivers sun et al 2011 based on the 2d tracer tests under the transient condition reported that d l h u was about 80 which would fall into the range of the values reported by baek and seo 2010 more recently seo et al 2016 conducted nine tracer tests in medium sized rivers of which w h was 21 125 their values of d l h u from the concentration data ranged 13 to 150 and the dimensionless longitudinal dispersion coefficient tended to be proportional to w h and u u while d l h u was rather insensitive to the channel sinuosity aforementioned findings of higher observed values of d l h u were not fully validated by the velocity based method even though using the velocity data by adcp kim 2012 reported that values of d l h u due to vertical shear is order of 101 which is much great than the elder s theoretical value most studies of velocity based method shen et al 2010 kim 2012 erwin and jacobson 2015 were focused mainly on calculating dispersion coefficients driven by the velocity shear only while comparisons with 2d tracer test results have not been conducted previous studies including baek and seo 2010 and seo et al 2016 demonstrated that the dispersion coefficients calculated from the concentration data represent the spreading of pollutant clouds caused by vertical variations of velocities and other processes such as turbulent diffusions and mixing due to channel irregularities therefore cross verification of the velocity based method and the concentration based dispersion coefficients is indispensable this study compared the 2d dispersion coefficients by velocity measurements and the dispersion coefficients by using tracer test results to find the applicability and characteristics of the velocity driven dispersion coefficients both hydraulic and dispersion data were collected from the large scale meandering channel experiments the velocity driven dispersion coefficients were calculated using the measured data of vertical velocity profiles and concentration based coefficients were obtained by applying the two dimensional routing method to the measured concentration curves finally the comparison between dispersion coefficients by the two methods was conducted 2 theoretical background 2 1 calculating dispersion coefficients by velocity measurements in this research the intermediate field mixing was the subject of focus where vertical shear could dominate as shown in fig 1b thus the calculation of 2d dispersion coefficients was needed and the measured vertical profiles of the streamwise and spanwise velocities need to be utilized for calculation of both the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients using eq 2 in using eq 2 the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient ε v based on the momentum related to the logarithmic law velocity profile was applied as below fischer et al 1979 4 ε v κ h u z h 1 z h where κ is the von kármán constant and u is the cross sectional shear velocity determined using the following equation 5 u g r h s f where g is the gravitational acceleration r h is the hydraulic radius and s f is the slope of the channel the vertical turbulent coefficient could also be calculated by using the turbulent shear stress calculated if the detailed measurements of the flow and turbulence in the experiments are available fischer 1966 2 2 calculation of dispersion coefficients using concentration data as aforementioned the moment methods were mainly used to calculate the transverse dispersion coefficient from the concentration data obtained by the steady state tracer experiments however to calculate both longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients from the unsteady state tracer data the two dimensional routing methods need to be applied baek et al 2006 baek and seo 2010 in order to calculate the longitudinal dispersion and improve dispersion analysis the routing procedure was first developed by fischer 1968 this method was conducted by the calculation of the concentration profile of the downstream section using the upstream concentration profile as an input to the analytical solution of 1d advection dispersion equation with an initial guess of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for calculation this process was repeated until the optimal value of the dispersion coefficient was found by matching the calculated profile to the measured profile at the downstream section for the case of calculating transverse dispersion coefficients the moment based methods sayre and chang 1968 holley et al 1972 were developed using concentration data obtained from injection tests the stream tube moment method beltaos 1980 was developed to overcome the drawbacks of simple moment methods so it could be applied to meandering streams with a skewed concentration distribution it used cumulative discharge from each sections and the variance of the concentration distribution as shown in fig 2 a the stream tube moment method equation is shown as the following 6 d t q 2 ψ u s h s 2 σ η 2 x 1 1 1 η 0 c 1 η 0 c 0 where η q q q is the cumulative discharge q is the total discharge σ η 2 and η 0 are the variance and the centroid of the s η distribution respectively where c n θ θ θ is the total dosage u s is the span averaged value of the cross sectional mean velocity in the streamwise direction h s is the span averaged value of the cross sectional average depth of the river h c 0 and c 1 are the normalized dosages at the left and right banks respectively and ψ is the normalized shape factor with the range 1 0 3 6 beltaos 1980 and given as 7 ψ 1 q 0 q h 2 u d q instead of calculating only 1d dispersion for the 2d calculation of both longitudinal and transverse coefficients baek et al 2006 first expanded the 1d routing method of fischer into a 2d version this 2d method succeeded in the calculation of both the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients needed for 2d modeling but still had its limits in dealing with the skewed concentration profiles in meandering channels non uniformities of bed topography and dead zones in natural channels later baek and seo 2010 developed the 2d stream tube routing procedure 2d strp to include the effect of the irregularities of the river channel into both the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients by combining the 2d routing procedure and stream tube concept as shown in fig 2b the stream tube concept used a fixed value of discharge attached to a fixed streamline which enabled the coordinate system to shift back and forth within the cross section with the flow therefore the meandering channel could be considered as an equivalent straight channel which would be acceptable in correctly calculating the skewed concentration distributions in meandering channels fischer et al 1979 the analytical solution of the 2d strp is given as follows 8 c s 2 η t 0 1 c s 1 ω τ u s 4 π d l t 2 t 1 exp u s 2 t 2 t 1 t τ 2 4 d l t 2 t 1 d τ 4 π b c s 2 s 1 exp η ω 2 4 b c s 2 s 1 d ω where c s 2 η t is the temporal profile of the predicted concentration contour at the downstream section s 2 c s 1 ω τ is the temporal profile of the measured concentration at the upstream section s 1 τ is the dummy time variable of integration and t 1 and t 2 are the mean times of passage in sections s 1 and s 2 respectively ω is the normalized dummy variable of integration and λ is the dimensionless discharge as follow 9 λ q q 0 y uhdy 0 w uhdy where u is the local streamwise velocity and w is the width of the channel b c is the bulk dispersion coefficient which is defined as 10 b c ψ h s 2 u s q s 2 d t where q s is the span averaged value of the flow discharge the process of determining the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients was similar to the 1d routing procedures except that the multiple regression method needed to be used in determining both parameters of dispersion coefficients using a single equation eq 8 3 experimental data acquisition 3 1 experimental flumes to find the 2d dispersion coefficients using the vertical velocity profiles of adcp and the concentration data of tracer tests experiments were conducted in large meandering channels of the river experiment center in andong korea the center was positioned in the vicinity of the nakdong river which is located in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula the meandering flume was about 11 m wide and 600 m long with three different sinuosities as shown in fig 3 a the channels were classified as a312 a315 and a317 which have sinuosities of 1 2 1 5 and 1 7 respectively as shown in fig 3b the full discharge capability of the meandering flume was 10 0 m3 s using large pumping facilities that draws their water directly from the nakdong river this made it possible to conduct various river experiments almost free from scale effects the experiments for velocity measurements and 2d tracer tests were conducted in the a315 and a317 channels these channels were originally constructed in a trapezoidal shape but later became natural shaped channels as the water flow caused natural erosion and deposition at the bend apex and crossover areas of each channel as shown in fig 3b the measuring cross sections were placed with tag lines at a distance of 20 40 m each with 6 sections per channel with half at the apex of the channel and half at the center of the crossover part for the a315 and a317 channels table 1 lists the hydraulic data at each section of the two experiments conducted in 2016 3 2 measurements of velocity and concentration the velocity measurements were conducted with an acoustic doppler current profiler which is a hydroacoustic current meter that is similar to sonar capable of measuring water current velocities over a depth range based on the doppler effect of sound waves scattered back from particles within the water column the experimental equipment used in this study was the sontek s5 a multi band acoustic frequency capable product with profiling ranges up to 0 06 to 5 m depth and velocity up to 20 m s sontek 2015 the adcp operation with the moving boat was done with two people to pull the boat connected to a tether line as the channel width during the experiment was about 5 6 m the adcp could not measure velocities within a blanking distance of about 0 05 m below the transducers near the surface and the bottom 10 of the measured flow depth was removed to correct for acoustic side lobe interference table 1 shows that the percentage of unmeasured areas ranged 23 31 thus as recommended by usgs mueller et al 2009 the 1 7 power law was used to extrapolate the vertical profile of the streamwise velocity to the unmeasured areas for the calculation of the 2d longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the tracer experiments rhodamine wt was selected as the tracers for the input in the meandering channel rhodamine wt is a fluorescence dye with reddish color that had been selected in previous tracer tests for mixing research in open channels since it is convenient to detect in low background concentrations rowiński et al 2007 sun et al 2011 seo et al 2016 in this study rhodamine wt was made into 20 solute using the dosage formula by kilpatrick 1970 and was released into the injection section 11 v s 2 0 10 3 q m l u 0 93 c p where vs is the volume of stock rhodamine wt 20 percent dye in liters qm is the maximum stream discharge at the downstream site l is the distance to the downstream monitoring site and cp is the peak concentration at the downstream site the tracer concentrations were measured using an in situ electronic fluorometer ysi 600 oms sonde with 6130 rhodamine wt sensor the range of the ysi 600 oms sonde was 0 200 μ g l ppb and the accuracy was 5 of the measured data or 1 μ g l whichever was greater the resolution of the instrument sensor was 0 1 μ g l and the water temperature range was 5 to 50 c before each field experiment the sensors were calibrated using standard solutions the dye concentrations were measured at five points at evenly lateral distributed sensors per section using the installed tag lines as shown in fig 3b the tracer concentrations were obtained after the vertical mixing was completed to produce the vertically averaged mixing throughout the field the tracer was injected as a full depth vertical line source seo et al 2006 the concentrations were recorded at every 1 s to obtain the concentration time curves per sensor for the injection 150 ml of 20 000 000 ppb rhodamine wt solution was instantaneously injected at the injection point as shown in fig 4 a the rhodamine wt solution was shown to move back and forth shifting from the left bank to the right bank as the contaminant moved through the meandering channel apexes as shown in fig 4 the first cross section was installed after the vertical mixing was finished using the equation by fischer et al 1979 as 12 l v 0 4 u h 2 ε v where l v is the length needed to finish vertical mixing and u is the reach averaged velocity thus the taylor period fischer et al 1979 for mixing where the variance of the dispersing cloud grew linearly with time and the initial skew degenerates into the normal distribution was calculated to be 56 63 s and the length was about 30 01 m all the first sections of each experiment were located after 30 m however as the actual tracer test was conducted in case amc 315 r1 in table 2 the arrival time at sec 1 was shown to be near the taylor period fischer et al 1979 4 analysis of experimental data 4 1 velocity data in table 1 the measured value of the cross sectional averaged velocity ranged 0 39 0 63 m s top width of the flow in the channel was 5 2 6 1 m the average depth was 0 43 0 56 m and the discharge rate was 1 2 1 5 m3 s the cross sectional values of the shear velocity calculated by manning equation based on the uniform flow in the channel ranged 0 038 to 0 064 m s figs 5 and 6 show the velocity data obtained from the adcp in which the lateral variations of streamwise and spanwise flows are shown at each cross section two dimensionally fig 5 shows that a strong rotating cell of the secondary flow mainly occurred at the bend apexes of even sections s2 s4 and s6 the strong centrifugal force induced by the geometrical properties of the meandering channel transported the top of the water body to the outer bank at the bend apex strong secondary flow occurred in the apex areas and decreased in the crossover sections and then developed again in the next bend which showed the growth and decay of secondary flow throughout the apex and crossover sections in meandering channels these flow structures would cause strong transverse dispersion at the apex sections fig 6 shows that in the case of streamwise velocity the maximum velocity was formed at the points with high depth in all sections furthermore vertical variations of the streamwise velocity were strong at the maximum velocity line at each section figs 5 and 6 show that the geometrical formation of the meandering channel has a large effect on the size of the streamwise and spanwise flow throughout the channel 4 2 concentration curves the concentration time curves measured at each measured point by sensor were plotted in fig 7 for case amc 315 r1 the figure was plotted to 400 s due to the long tail that was formed in the latter sections such as sections s5 and s6 in most point measurements the concentration time curves show an asymmetric distribution with left skew and the long tails in a falling limb the long tails in the falling limbs were frequently observed in the concentration time measurements using the eulerian method and these occurred due to the channel irregularities and the storage zones in this test channels these long tails of the concentration time curves made the dispersion calculation with moment based methods difficult and routing methods were more appropriate in calculation of the dispersion coefficients similar to previous experiments conducted in meandering streams baek et al 2006 seo et al 2008 the tracer cloud moved back and forth to each side of the bank throughout the channels and the skewness of the concentration curves changed therefore the stream tube method should be used with routing procedures for the accurate calculation of longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients since the stream tube method has a fixed value of discharge attached to a streamline by moving the coordinate system along with the flow this method allowed the user to take consideration of the discharge distribution shifts in meandering channels and irregularities of the channel table 2 shows that as the tracer cloud moved downstream the variance of the concentration time curves increased as the longitudinal and transverse mixing occurred whereas the peak concentration decreased 4 3 calculation of velocity based dispersion coefficients as shown in figs 5 and 6 the adcp velocity measurements at the meandering channels of the rec of korea institute of construction technology kict had vertical profiles of both streamwise and spanwise velocities and their deviations to be used for the dispersion coefficient calculation equations 2 and 4 were used for the triple integration of the measured velocity data in each section for the depth averaged shear dispersion coefficients for two dimensional mixing as aforementioned to cover up the blanking areas in the upper region of the water body and in the channel bottom an extrapolation method was needed for accurate representation of the actual velocity profile in this research the power law of 1 7 was used for the estimation of the vertical profile of the streamwise velocity the 1 7 power law has frequently been used in many discharge calculations in adcp software and is one of the recommended extrapolation methods of vertical profiles in adcp manuals by usgs mueller et al 2009 in the case of spanwise velocity however the vertical velocity profile was not extrapolated additionally since the data from former laboratory experiments showed that the highest and lowest parts of the water body in open channel flows have smaller spanwise flow and the possibility of overestimation arose if the extrapolation was calculated for spanwise flow lee and seo 2013 figs 8 and 11 plot the lateral distributions of the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients calculated from the vertical profile of the streamwise and spanwise velocities at each section for two cases while table 1 lists the cross sectional averages and maximum values for each section table 1 shows that the cross sectional averaged values of d l h u by the velocity profile data ranged 4 1 to 6 5 which corresponded with the theoretical value of elder 1959 which is 5 93 these results were expected since the cross sectional averaged values represented the dispersion capacity due to vertical shear effect of the whole cross section which was the same as the infinitely wide pane of elder s assumption however in case of the maximum dispersion coefficient by section the longitudinal dispersion values were larger by up to 2 times the cross sectional averaged coefficient table 1 reveals that the cross sectional averaged values of d t h u ranged 0 02 to 0 8 and showed the periodic variation as the tracer cloud moved through the crossover sections and bend apex sections the cross sectional averaged values of d t h u at bend apices were 10 30 times larger than the values at cross over sections the maximum values of the dimensionless transverse dispersion coefficient at bend apex sections ranged 2 2 to 3 3 which were also order of 101 larger than the maximum value at crossover sections figs 8 and 9 show that the lateral distribution of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient had similarity with the lateral distribution of the streamwise velocity in each section shown in fig 6 because the higher velocities tend to have more velocity deviation from the mean velocity which was actually incorporated into the triple integration of eq 2 for the dispersion calculations since the bottom velocities tended to approach zero in the water body as shown in fig 6 the higher the streamwise velocity was the larger the vertical profile also became and the velocity deviations from the mean velocity also increased accordingly this was also noted in lee and seo 2013 where the maximum point of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was located at the point where the maximum velocity was located these distinct characteristics were demonstrated more clearly in fig 12 which depicts that spatial variability of the velocity based longitudinal dispersion in the sinuous channels used in this study these contours were generated by interpolation of point values of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient at each cross section this figure shows that for both cases of this experiment the maximum point of longitudinal dispersion was located more to the outer bank of the bend apex since the sinuosity and natural channel shape led the point of maximum velocity at the outer side of the cross sections as shown in fig 6 this was due to the secondary current developed at the bend apex of the meandering channel as shown in fig 5 however while the first apex was affected by the first meander only the second and third apices had been affected by the preceding meanders in terms of the development of secondary currents so the maximum point of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was shifted to the middle of the channel section at the second and third apices due to the phase lag occurring from the previous bends therefore the lateral distribution of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient tended to be more centered at the succeeding apices sections s4 and s6 following the trajectory of the main cloud of the tracer as shown in the photography of fig 4 which was also illustrated in the analysis of uav images of the tracer cloud transport in the same flume of the river experiment center by baek et al 2019 the transverse dispersion coefficient calculation results in figs 10 and 11 shows the maximum point to be located near the outer bank at the first apex as in section 2 while in downstream apices the maximum point was near the middle of the channel this characteristic was similar to the lateral distribution of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient but the points were nearer to the center of the channel since fig 5 shows that the maximum spanwise flow occurred at the point of highest depth for each section it seemed that the transverse dispersion coefficient size would match the point with the highest spanwise flow in the cross section fig 13 depicts the spatial variation of the velocity based transverse dispersion coefficient for two cases in which contours were generated by interpolation of point values of the transverse dispersion coefficient at each cross section this figure along with figs 10 and 11 clearly demonstrate that the transverse dispersion coefficients were much higher at the bend apices sections s2 s4 and s6 than at the crossover sections sections s1 s3 and s5 the larger values of the transverse dispersion coefficients at the bend apices were driven by the strong secondary currents developed at the bend as shown in fig 5 the same result was also reported in the analysis of experimental works by lee and seo 2013 where the apex areas showed higher values of the transverse dispersion coefficient than the crossover sections this difference between apex and crossover section was not profound in the case of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient because the development of the strong secondary current did not greatly affect the vertical profile of the streamwise velocity at the bend apices even though it caused more skewed lateral distribution of the streamwise velocity at the crossover sections 4 4 calculation of the concentration based dispersion coefficients for calculation of the dispersion coefficients using the 2d strp eq 8 the predicted time concentration curves as c t η contours at the downstream section were calculated using the observed upstream time concentration contour as an input as shown in fig 2b the predicted contour was repeatedly matched with the observed contour at the downstream section until the optimal value of the dispersion coefficient was found in this study the nonlinear multiple regression technique was applied to find the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficient at the same time the best fit was decided based on the root mean square error rmse which is given below 13 rmse 1 n c p c o 2 n where n is the number of interpolated concentration data c p is the predicted concentration and c o is the observed concentration while the measured curves were incorporated into the equation to calculate the predicted curves the concentration time lateral distance curves were transformed into the concentration time normalized cumulative discharge curves then the c t η time concentration curves were interpolated by using the kriging method this interpolation was necessary to match the predicted curves that were positioned with the measured curves because the actual distances between the concentration curves across the normalized cumulative discharge were not uniform in each section due to the channel meandering the results of the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients calculated from 2d strp were listed in table 3 in this table the routing span a b would represent that the concentration profile acquired from section a was used as the input data to route the concentration profile at the downstream section section b for all routing cases the rmse were between 0 5 and 1 5 ppb which meant that the results of the routing method calibrated well with the measured values this method can only calculate span averaged results to a single value while the velocity based method can produce the spatial variability of the dispersion coefficients such as shown in figs 8 12 figs 14 and 15 depict the comparisons of the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients by two different methods table 3 shows that the dimensionless values of the concentration based longitudinal dispersion coefficients ranged 14 7 35 5 which were much greater than the elder s theoretical result this difference has been reported by other researchers including seo et al 2006 baek and seo 2010 and seo et al 2016 they maintained that the concentration based longitudinal dispersion coefficients observed in natural rivers were up to 25 times the elder s theoretical result table 3 and fig 14 show that compared to the velocity based dispersion coefficients the longitudinal dispersion coefficients calculated from the concentration curves were 4 to 6 times the cross sectional averaged value of the velocity based dispersion coefficients while 2 to 3 times the value of the maximum dispersion coefficient found along the maximum velocity line at each section this suggests that the velocity based longitudinal dispersion coefficient is a fractional value of the concentration based result which contained mixing caused by channel irregularities throughout the reach in addition to shear dispersion by vertical velocity variations therefore the concentration driven coefficient contained mixing other than the ones by shear flow and turbulent motion can be suggested to have the form given below 14 d lc d lv d li ε l where d lc is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient calculated from the concentration data d lv is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient due to velocity distribution of the shear flow d li is the dispersion coefficient caused by the irregularities of the channel and storage zones and ε l is the turbulence driven mixing coefficient from these results one can also note that the main tracer cloud was moving and dispersing longitudinally following the maximum velocity line of the meandering channel as sketched in fig 1a and photographed in fig 4 table 3 also shows that in the case of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the longer routing span calculations tended to generate higher values because the channel irregularities throughout the channel contributed to the longitudinal mixing in addition to the shear effect by vertical velocity variations table 3 and fig 15 shows that in the case of the transverse dispersion coefficients the concentration based coefficients were almost equivalent to the velocity based coefficients unlike the longitudinal dispersion coefficient as mentioned earlier the high values of the velocity based transverse dispersion coefficients at the alternating bend apices and low values at the crossover sections were because of the action of strong secondary currents developed in the bend apex thus we can conceptualize that the main tracer cloud moving along the maximum velocity line of the meandering channel expanded in full scale in the transverse direction at the bend areas but dispersed in minimum scale at the crossover regions and this process was occurring alternately through the meandering channels in this situation actual dispersion of the tracer cloud was mainly dependent on the velocity structure of the secondary currents rather than on any other processes furthermore in table 3 in case of the concentration based transverse dispersion coefficient the tendency found in the case of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient that the longer routing span tended to generate higher values was not found this also suggests that the channel irregularities throughout the channel reach did not contribute significantly to the transverse mixing compared to the shear effect by vertical velocity variations due to the secondary currents to check the validity of two methods for calculating the transverse dispersion coefficients used in this study classical empirical equations developed by gharbi and verrette 1998 and deng et al 2001 were used for comparison the equation developed by gharbi and verrette 1998 is the following 15 d t 0 0035 q s h s 1 75 w h s 0 25 d l 0 75 0 0005 this equation contains the longitudinal dispersion coefficients so the values calculated from the 2d strp in this paper were used as the input the equation developed by deng et al 2001 is the following 16 d t h s u 0 145 1 3 530 u s u w h s 1 38 results of the velocity based transverse dispersion coefficient are compared with gharbi and verrette 1998 and deng et al 2001 in figs 10 and 11 the figures show that the values by empirical equations were higher than the velocity based results at the cross over sections while the velocity based results generated significantly higher values than the empirical equations at the bend apex sections this comparison result demonstrated the periodic behavior of the tracer dispersion in the meandering channels which was manifested by the velocity based dispersion coefficient values comparison of the reach averaged values for the calculated transverse dispersion coefficients including the stmm method was shown in fig 16 overall the values by different methods displayed similarity especially in case amc 317 r1 for case amc315 r1 2d strp generated higher values than the empirical equations and the stmm the averaged values of dispersion coefficients for five different methods for two cases were quite similar with 0 26 and 0 25 respectively these comparisons revealed that the velocity based method showed more consistent results in calculating reach averaged values of the transverse dispersion coefficient than the concentration based methods 5 conclusions in this study the 2d dispersion coefficients were obtained from the velocity data of the meandering channels using the equation developed by fischer et al 1979 which incorporated the shear effects into the triple integration of the deviation from the depth averaged velocity this approach was compared to the two dimensional routing procedures in which the dispersion coefficients were calculated from the concentration data obtained through tracer tests in meandering channels the experiments were conducted at the meandering channels with sinuosity of 1 5 and 1 7 in the river experiment center of kict korea the results show that the streamwise and spanwise velocities were affected by the geometric shape of the channel which then affected the mixing characteristics as the tracer flows throughout the apex and crossover sections of the meandering channels in particular the maximum point of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was shifted to the middle of the channel section in the apex sections due to the phase lag occurring from the previous apices the calculation results demonstrate that the cross sectional averaged values of the non dimensional longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l h u by velocity profile ranged 4 1 to 6 5 of which range is close to elder s theoretical result 5 93 however the longitudinal dispersion coefficients calculated from the concentration curves using the 2d stream tube routing procedure were quite a lot larger than elder s result the span averaged values of the concentration based coefficients ranged 14 7 to 35 5 this difference could be explained by the fact that the concentration driven dispersion coefficients included the mixing effects due to the irregularities of the channel and storage zones as well as shear dispersion while the velocity driven coefficients only accounted for shear flow effects the analysis of the spatial variability of the velocity based longitudinal dispersion in the sinuous channels used in this study showed the notable characteristics that the maximum point of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was located at the point where the maximum velocity was located in the case of the transverse dispersion coefficient the difference between the velocity based and the concentration based coefficients was not as profound as for the longitudinal dispersion coefficients the cross sectional maximum values of the non dimensional transverse dispersion coefficient d t h u ranged 0 1 3 3 for the velocity driven coefficients and 0 9 2 9 for the concentration based coefficients the analysis of the spatial variability of the velocity based transverse dispersion showed that transverse dispersion coefficients were much higher at the bend apices than at the crossover sections the larger values of the transverse dispersion coefficients at the bend apices were driven by the strong secondary currents developed at the bend these results suggest that the transverse dispersion of the tracer cloud was mainly dependent on the velocity structure of the secondary currents rather than on any other processes therefore it can be concluded that transverse dispersion coefficients by both methods represented the same dispersion mechanism which was dominated by the secondary currents developed in the sinuous channels declaration of

5763,in this study longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients of the two dimensional advection dispersion model were calculated using both the velocity and concentration data obtained through tracer tests in large scale meandering channels the velocity based dispersion coefficients calculated by applying the theoretical equations to the velocity data were compared with concentration based dispersion coefficients that were calculated by applying the routing procedure to the measured concentration curves the results showed that the cross sectional averaged values of the dimensionless longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l h u calculated from the velocity profile data ranged 4 1 6 5 which corresponded to the theoretical value whereas d l h u by concentration data ranged 14 7 35 5 which was 4 6 times larger than the velocity based coefficient the cross sectional maximum values of the dimensionless transverse dispersion coefficient d t h u by the velocity based method ranged 0 1 3 3 whereas d t h u by concentration based method was 0 9 2 9 these results revealed that the velocity based longitudinal dispersion coefficient is a fractional value of the concentration based result which contained mixing caused by channel irregularities throughout the reach in addition to shear dispersion by vertical velocity variations while transverse dispersion coefficients by both methods represented the same dispersion mechanism which was dominated by the secondary currents developed in highly sinuous channels keywords 2d mixing meandering channels dispersion coefficients vertical velocity deviation concentration data shear dispersion 1 introduction when a pollutant is first inserted into an open channel it spreads and goes through several stages of shear dispersion as in fig 1 a in the first stage which is considered the near field vertical mixing mainly occurs in most open channels that would be completely mixed in a relatively short time because the water depth is much smaller than the width of the channel in the second stage known as the intermediate field the transverse and longitudinal mixings take place and is a subject for careful investigation as the vertical mixing is already completed the mixing stage of the intermediate field is very long compared to near field mixing therefore for accurate analysis of the mixing in large rivers study of the two dimensional mixing is required fischer et al 1979 in meandering rivers as shown in fig 1a the analysis of two dimensional 2d mixing would be affected by the combined effects of the variation of flow and channel geometries where the variation of streamwise and spanwise flow that changes throughout the meandering channel would affect the longitudinal and transverse mixing respectively the secondary flow has increased especially at the bend apex areas of the meandering channel increasing the transverse mixing of any contaminant then as the contaminant passes throughout the channel to the crossover areas of the channel the longitudinal mixing would be more dominant as illustrated in fig 1a since the mixing characteristics are dependent on these flow structures careful analysis of both streamwise and spanwise flows are necessary to understand the 2d mixing in meandering rivers for the modeling of mixing in the intermediate field the 2d advection dispersion equation ade has been used the 2d advection dispersion equation derived by depth averaging the three dimensional transport equation for natural channels could be shown in the curvilinear coordinate system as the following lee and seo 2013 1 c t u s c s u n c n 1 h s h d l c s 1 h n h d t c n where c is the depth averaged concentration h is the local depth u s and u n are the depth averaged velocities in the streamwise and span wise directions respectively d l is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d t is the transverse dispersion coefficient s is the steamwise direction n is the spanwise direction and t is time to use the 2d ade for the analysis of contaminant transport in shallow flows of rivers the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients should be provided for the study of contaminant dispersion and its coefficients taylor 1954 originally explained that the mixing properties of pollutant dispersion by shear flow that can be described with the dispersion coefficients in the pipe flow later aris 1956 presented the method of concentration moments by theoretical analysis which were expanded into generalized theoretical dispersion researches gill 1967 wang and chen 2016 to find the dispersion coefficients through field experiments for data acquisition either concentration driven method or velocity driven method could be used depending the availability of the data in the case of the velocity driven method the 2d dispersion coefficients shown in eq 1 could be calculated using the vertical profiles of streamwise and spanwise velocities following the theoretical derivation by fischer et al 1979 as 2a d l 1 h 0 h u s 0 z 1 ε v 0 z u s d z d z d z 2b d t 1 h 0 h u n 0 z 1 ε v 0 z u n d z d z d z where ε v is the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient z is the vertical distance from the channel bottom and u s and u n are the velocity deviations from the depth averaged velocity in the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively as shown in fig 1b eq 2 was from the rate of mass transport with the cross sectional mixing coefficient applied to a skewed shear flow with velocity profiles in two directions it assumed that the mechanical spreading of contaminants by shear dispersion was done by the characteristic of the vertical flow structure using eq 2 longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients could be calculated from the velocity data without using the concentration data obtained from high cost tracer tests thus in recent years field researches carr and rehmann 2007 shen et al 2010 kim 2012 erwin and jacobson 2015 pilechi et al 2016 were conducted in which this method was used to obtain the observed dispersion coefficient with the convenient acquisition of the velocity data using acoustic doppler current profilers adcp which originally was an efficient equipment to measure accurate flow velocities and topography in open channels from fixed or moving measurements since adcp measurements were already used frequently for discharge measurements in rivers using eq 2 for the calculation of dispersion coefficients decreased the necessity of conducting high cost tracer tests for dispersion coefficients another method to calculate the two dimensional dispersion is a concentration based method in which either the moment methods or the routing techniques are applied to the measured concentration curves through tracer tests fischer et al 1979 the moment methods were frequently applied to calculate the transverse dispersion coefficients from the field tracer studies which were conducted with steady state conditions yotsukura and fischer 1970 sayre 1979 beltaos 1980 holley and nerat 1983 rutherford 1994 in this case only the transverse dispersion coefficient could be calculated with tracer tests with the steady state condition so those researches did not focus much on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for this reason in the early modeling of 2d ade the theoretical longitudinal dispersion coefficient proposed by elder 1959 was usually used however more recently to find the actual values for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for 2d mixing analysis in natural streams tracer studies were conducted with an unsteady tracer input baek and seo 2010 sun et al 2011 seo et al 2016 then the two dimensional routing procedure which was developed following the same theory used for one dimensional routing method by fischer et al 1979 was applied to calculate both longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients simultaneously baek et al 2006 baek and seo 2010 2013 using these two different methods calculated longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients were reported in several studies seo et al 2006 baek et al 2006 baek and seo 2010 kim 2012 and seo et al 2016 they reported that the transverse dispersion coefficients calculated from concentration data of transient tracer tests were in the similar range with the values obtained from the steady state tracer tests i e d t h u 0 2 1 0 and this dimensionless coefficient mostly increased with increasing channel sinuosity even though it showed some sensitivity to the channel aspect ratio w h seo et al 2016 here h is the average depth of the river and u is the shear velocity and w is the average width of the river in recent years several researchers reported that values of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient calculated by the concentration data from field studies are much higher than the theoretical value suggested by elder 1959 which was derived under the assumption of the shear flow over an infinitely wide plane as 3 d l h u 5 93 higher observed values of d l h u were firstly reported by seo et al 2006 and baek and seo 2010 based on the concentration data from tracer study under slug tests they found that d l h u ranges 10 to 90 in highly sinuous natural rivers sun et al 2011 based on the 2d tracer tests under the transient condition reported that d l h u was about 80 which would fall into the range of the values reported by baek and seo 2010 more recently seo et al 2016 conducted nine tracer tests in medium sized rivers of which w h was 21 125 their values of d l h u from the concentration data ranged 13 to 150 and the dimensionless longitudinal dispersion coefficient tended to be proportional to w h and u u while d l h u was rather insensitive to the channel sinuosity aforementioned findings of higher observed values of d l h u were not fully validated by the velocity based method even though using the velocity data by adcp kim 2012 reported that values of d l h u due to vertical shear is order of 101 which is much great than the elder s theoretical value most studies of velocity based method shen et al 2010 kim 2012 erwin and jacobson 2015 were focused mainly on calculating dispersion coefficients driven by the velocity shear only while comparisons with 2d tracer test results have not been conducted previous studies including baek and seo 2010 and seo et al 2016 demonstrated that the dispersion coefficients calculated from the concentration data represent the spreading of pollutant clouds caused by vertical variations of velocities and other processes such as turbulent diffusions and mixing due to channel irregularities therefore cross verification of the velocity based method and the concentration based dispersion coefficients is indispensable this study compared the 2d dispersion coefficients by velocity measurements and the dispersion coefficients by using tracer test results to find the applicability and characteristics of the velocity driven dispersion coefficients both hydraulic and dispersion data were collected from the large scale meandering channel experiments the velocity driven dispersion coefficients were calculated using the measured data of vertical velocity profiles and concentration based coefficients were obtained by applying the two dimensional routing method to the measured concentration curves finally the comparison between dispersion coefficients by the two methods was conducted 2 theoretical background 2 1 calculating dispersion coefficients by velocity measurements in this research the intermediate field mixing was the subject of focus where vertical shear could dominate as shown in fig 1b thus the calculation of 2d dispersion coefficients was needed and the measured vertical profiles of the streamwise and spanwise velocities need to be utilized for calculation of both the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients using eq 2 in using eq 2 the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient ε v based on the momentum related to the logarithmic law velocity profile was applied as below fischer et al 1979 4 ε v κ h u z h 1 z h where κ is the von kármán constant and u is the cross sectional shear velocity determined using the following equation 5 u g r h s f where g is the gravitational acceleration r h is the hydraulic radius and s f is the slope of the channel the vertical turbulent coefficient could also be calculated by using the turbulent shear stress calculated if the detailed measurements of the flow and turbulence in the experiments are available fischer 1966 2 2 calculation of dispersion coefficients using concentration data as aforementioned the moment methods were mainly used to calculate the transverse dispersion coefficient from the concentration data obtained by the steady state tracer experiments however to calculate both longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients from the unsteady state tracer data the two dimensional routing methods need to be applied baek et al 2006 baek and seo 2010 in order to calculate the longitudinal dispersion and improve dispersion analysis the routing procedure was first developed by fischer 1968 this method was conducted by the calculation of the concentration profile of the downstream section using the upstream concentration profile as an input to the analytical solution of 1d advection dispersion equation with an initial guess of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for calculation this process was repeated until the optimal value of the dispersion coefficient was found by matching the calculated profile to the measured profile at the downstream section for the case of calculating transverse dispersion coefficients the moment based methods sayre and chang 1968 holley et al 1972 were developed using concentration data obtained from injection tests the stream tube moment method beltaos 1980 was developed to overcome the drawbacks of simple moment methods so it could be applied to meandering streams with a skewed concentration distribution it used cumulative discharge from each sections and the variance of the concentration distribution as shown in fig 2 a the stream tube moment method equation is shown as the following 6 d t q 2 ψ u s h s 2 σ η 2 x 1 1 1 η 0 c 1 η 0 c 0 where η q q q is the cumulative discharge q is the total discharge σ η 2 and η 0 are the variance and the centroid of the s η distribution respectively where c n θ θ θ is the total dosage u s is the span averaged value of the cross sectional mean velocity in the streamwise direction h s is the span averaged value of the cross sectional average depth of the river h c 0 and c 1 are the normalized dosages at the left and right banks respectively and ψ is the normalized shape factor with the range 1 0 3 6 beltaos 1980 and given as 7 ψ 1 q 0 q h 2 u d q instead of calculating only 1d dispersion for the 2d calculation of both longitudinal and transverse coefficients baek et al 2006 first expanded the 1d routing method of fischer into a 2d version this 2d method succeeded in the calculation of both the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients needed for 2d modeling but still had its limits in dealing with the skewed concentration profiles in meandering channels non uniformities of bed topography and dead zones in natural channels later baek and seo 2010 developed the 2d stream tube routing procedure 2d strp to include the effect of the irregularities of the river channel into both the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients by combining the 2d routing procedure and stream tube concept as shown in fig 2b the stream tube concept used a fixed value of discharge attached to a fixed streamline which enabled the coordinate system to shift back and forth within the cross section with the flow therefore the meandering channel could be considered as an equivalent straight channel which would be acceptable in correctly calculating the skewed concentration distributions in meandering channels fischer et al 1979 the analytical solution of the 2d strp is given as follows 8 c s 2 η t 0 1 c s 1 ω τ u s 4 π d l t 2 t 1 exp u s 2 t 2 t 1 t τ 2 4 d l t 2 t 1 d τ 4 π b c s 2 s 1 exp η ω 2 4 b c s 2 s 1 d ω where c s 2 η t is the temporal profile of the predicted concentration contour at the downstream section s 2 c s 1 ω τ is the temporal profile of the measured concentration at the upstream section s 1 τ is the dummy time variable of integration and t 1 and t 2 are the mean times of passage in sections s 1 and s 2 respectively ω is the normalized dummy variable of integration and λ is the dimensionless discharge as follow 9 λ q q 0 y uhdy 0 w uhdy where u is the local streamwise velocity and w is the width of the channel b c is the bulk dispersion coefficient which is defined as 10 b c ψ h s 2 u s q s 2 d t where q s is the span averaged value of the flow discharge the process of determining the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients was similar to the 1d routing procedures except that the multiple regression method needed to be used in determining both parameters of dispersion coefficients using a single equation eq 8 3 experimental data acquisition 3 1 experimental flumes to find the 2d dispersion coefficients using the vertical velocity profiles of adcp and the concentration data of tracer tests experiments were conducted in large meandering channels of the river experiment center in andong korea the center was positioned in the vicinity of the nakdong river which is located in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula the meandering flume was about 11 m wide and 600 m long with three different sinuosities as shown in fig 3 a the channels were classified as a312 a315 and a317 which have sinuosities of 1 2 1 5 and 1 7 respectively as shown in fig 3b the full discharge capability of the meandering flume was 10 0 m3 s using large pumping facilities that draws their water directly from the nakdong river this made it possible to conduct various river experiments almost free from scale effects the experiments for velocity measurements and 2d tracer tests were conducted in the a315 and a317 channels these channels were originally constructed in a trapezoidal shape but later became natural shaped channels as the water flow caused natural erosion and deposition at the bend apex and crossover areas of each channel as shown in fig 3b the measuring cross sections were placed with tag lines at a distance of 20 40 m each with 6 sections per channel with half at the apex of the channel and half at the center of the crossover part for the a315 and a317 channels table 1 lists the hydraulic data at each section of the two experiments conducted in 2016 3 2 measurements of velocity and concentration the velocity measurements were conducted with an acoustic doppler current profiler which is a hydroacoustic current meter that is similar to sonar capable of measuring water current velocities over a depth range based on the doppler effect of sound waves scattered back from particles within the water column the experimental equipment used in this study was the sontek s5 a multi band acoustic frequency capable product with profiling ranges up to 0 06 to 5 m depth and velocity up to 20 m s sontek 2015 the adcp operation with the moving boat was done with two people to pull the boat connected to a tether line as the channel width during the experiment was about 5 6 m the adcp could not measure velocities within a blanking distance of about 0 05 m below the transducers near the surface and the bottom 10 of the measured flow depth was removed to correct for acoustic side lobe interference table 1 shows that the percentage of unmeasured areas ranged 23 31 thus as recommended by usgs mueller et al 2009 the 1 7 power law was used to extrapolate the vertical profile of the streamwise velocity to the unmeasured areas for the calculation of the 2d longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the tracer experiments rhodamine wt was selected as the tracers for the input in the meandering channel rhodamine wt is a fluorescence dye with reddish color that had been selected in previous tracer tests for mixing research in open channels since it is convenient to detect in low background concentrations rowiński et al 2007 sun et al 2011 seo et al 2016 in this study rhodamine wt was made into 20 solute using the dosage formula by kilpatrick 1970 and was released into the injection section 11 v s 2 0 10 3 q m l u 0 93 c p where vs is the volume of stock rhodamine wt 20 percent dye in liters qm is the maximum stream discharge at the downstream site l is the distance to the downstream monitoring site and cp is the peak concentration at the downstream site the tracer concentrations were measured using an in situ electronic fluorometer ysi 600 oms sonde with 6130 rhodamine wt sensor the range of the ysi 600 oms sonde was 0 200 μ g l ppb and the accuracy was 5 of the measured data or 1 μ g l whichever was greater the resolution of the instrument sensor was 0 1 μ g l and the water temperature range was 5 to 50 c before each field experiment the sensors were calibrated using standard solutions the dye concentrations were measured at five points at evenly lateral distributed sensors per section using the installed tag lines as shown in fig 3b the tracer concentrations were obtained after the vertical mixing was completed to produce the vertically averaged mixing throughout the field the tracer was injected as a full depth vertical line source seo et al 2006 the concentrations were recorded at every 1 s to obtain the concentration time curves per sensor for the injection 150 ml of 20 000 000 ppb rhodamine wt solution was instantaneously injected at the injection point as shown in fig 4 a the rhodamine wt solution was shown to move back and forth shifting from the left bank to the right bank as the contaminant moved through the meandering channel apexes as shown in fig 4 the first cross section was installed after the vertical mixing was finished using the equation by fischer et al 1979 as 12 l v 0 4 u h 2 ε v where l v is the length needed to finish vertical mixing and u is the reach averaged velocity thus the taylor period fischer et al 1979 for mixing where the variance of the dispersing cloud grew linearly with time and the initial skew degenerates into the normal distribution was calculated to be 56 63 s and the length was about 30 01 m all the first sections of each experiment were located after 30 m however as the actual tracer test was conducted in case amc 315 r1 in table 2 the arrival time at sec 1 was shown to be near the taylor period fischer et al 1979 4 analysis of experimental data 4 1 velocity data in table 1 the measured value of the cross sectional averaged velocity ranged 0 39 0 63 m s top width of the flow in the channel was 5 2 6 1 m the average depth was 0 43 0 56 m and the discharge rate was 1 2 1 5 m3 s the cross sectional values of the shear velocity calculated by manning equation based on the uniform flow in the channel ranged 0 038 to 0 064 m s figs 5 and 6 show the velocity data obtained from the adcp in which the lateral variations of streamwise and spanwise flows are shown at each cross section two dimensionally fig 5 shows that a strong rotating cell of the secondary flow mainly occurred at the bend apexes of even sections s2 s4 and s6 the strong centrifugal force induced by the geometrical properties of the meandering channel transported the top of the water body to the outer bank at the bend apex strong secondary flow occurred in the apex areas and decreased in the crossover sections and then developed again in the next bend which showed the growth and decay of secondary flow throughout the apex and crossover sections in meandering channels these flow structures would cause strong transverse dispersion at the apex sections fig 6 shows that in the case of streamwise velocity the maximum velocity was formed at the points with high depth in all sections furthermore vertical variations of the streamwise velocity were strong at the maximum velocity line at each section figs 5 and 6 show that the geometrical formation of the meandering channel has a large effect on the size of the streamwise and spanwise flow throughout the channel 4 2 concentration curves the concentration time curves measured at each measured point by sensor were plotted in fig 7 for case amc 315 r1 the figure was plotted to 400 s due to the long tail that was formed in the latter sections such as sections s5 and s6 in most point measurements the concentration time curves show an asymmetric distribution with left skew and the long tails in a falling limb the long tails in the falling limbs were frequently observed in the concentration time measurements using the eulerian method and these occurred due to the channel irregularities and the storage zones in this test channels these long tails of the concentration time curves made the dispersion calculation with moment based methods difficult and routing methods were more appropriate in calculation of the dispersion coefficients similar to previous experiments conducted in meandering streams baek et al 2006 seo et al 2008 the tracer cloud moved back and forth to each side of the bank throughout the channels and the skewness of the concentration curves changed therefore the stream tube method should be used with routing procedures for the accurate calculation of longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients since the stream tube method has a fixed value of discharge attached to a streamline by moving the coordinate system along with the flow this method allowed the user to take consideration of the discharge distribution shifts in meandering channels and irregularities of the channel table 2 shows that as the tracer cloud moved downstream the variance of the concentration time curves increased as the longitudinal and transverse mixing occurred whereas the peak concentration decreased 4 3 calculation of velocity based dispersion coefficients as shown in figs 5 and 6 the adcp velocity measurements at the meandering channels of the rec of korea institute of construction technology kict had vertical profiles of both streamwise and spanwise velocities and their deviations to be used for the dispersion coefficient calculation equations 2 and 4 were used for the triple integration of the measured velocity data in each section for the depth averaged shear dispersion coefficients for two dimensional mixing as aforementioned to cover up the blanking areas in the upper region of the water body and in the channel bottom an extrapolation method was needed for accurate representation of the actual velocity profile in this research the power law of 1 7 was used for the estimation of the vertical profile of the streamwise velocity the 1 7 power law has frequently been used in many discharge calculations in adcp software and is one of the recommended extrapolation methods of vertical profiles in adcp manuals by usgs mueller et al 2009 in the case of spanwise velocity however the vertical velocity profile was not extrapolated additionally since the data from former laboratory experiments showed that the highest and lowest parts of the water body in open channel flows have smaller spanwise flow and the possibility of overestimation arose if the extrapolation was calculated for spanwise flow lee and seo 2013 figs 8 and 11 plot the lateral distributions of the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients calculated from the vertical profile of the streamwise and spanwise velocities at each section for two cases while table 1 lists the cross sectional averages and maximum values for each section table 1 shows that the cross sectional averaged values of d l h u by the velocity profile data ranged 4 1 to 6 5 which corresponded with the theoretical value of elder 1959 which is 5 93 these results were expected since the cross sectional averaged values represented the dispersion capacity due to vertical shear effect of the whole cross section which was the same as the infinitely wide pane of elder s assumption however in case of the maximum dispersion coefficient by section the longitudinal dispersion values were larger by up to 2 times the cross sectional averaged coefficient table 1 reveals that the cross sectional averaged values of d t h u ranged 0 02 to 0 8 and showed the periodic variation as the tracer cloud moved through the crossover sections and bend apex sections the cross sectional averaged values of d t h u at bend apices were 10 30 times larger than the values at cross over sections the maximum values of the dimensionless transverse dispersion coefficient at bend apex sections ranged 2 2 to 3 3 which were also order of 101 larger than the maximum value at crossover sections figs 8 and 9 show that the lateral distribution of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient had similarity with the lateral distribution of the streamwise velocity in each section shown in fig 6 because the higher velocities tend to have more velocity deviation from the mean velocity which was actually incorporated into the triple integration of eq 2 for the dispersion calculations since the bottom velocities tended to approach zero in the water body as shown in fig 6 the higher the streamwise velocity was the larger the vertical profile also became and the velocity deviations from the mean velocity also increased accordingly this was also noted in lee and seo 2013 where the maximum point of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was located at the point where the maximum velocity was located these distinct characteristics were demonstrated more clearly in fig 12 which depicts that spatial variability of the velocity based longitudinal dispersion in the sinuous channels used in this study these contours were generated by interpolation of point values of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient at each cross section this figure shows that for both cases of this experiment the maximum point of longitudinal dispersion was located more to the outer bank of the bend apex since the sinuosity and natural channel shape led the point of maximum velocity at the outer side of the cross sections as shown in fig 6 this was due to the secondary current developed at the bend apex of the meandering channel as shown in fig 5 however while the first apex was affected by the first meander only the second and third apices had been affected by the preceding meanders in terms of the development of secondary currents so the maximum point of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was shifted to the middle of the channel section at the second and third apices due to the phase lag occurring from the previous bends therefore the lateral distribution of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient tended to be more centered at the succeeding apices sections s4 and s6 following the trajectory of the main cloud of the tracer as shown in the photography of fig 4 which was also illustrated in the analysis of uav images of the tracer cloud transport in the same flume of the river experiment center by baek et al 2019 the transverse dispersion coefficient calculation results in figs 10 and 11 shows the maximum point to be located near the outer bank at the first apex as in section 2 while in downstream apices the maximum point was near the middle of the channel this characteristic was similar to the lateral distribution of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient but the points were nearer to the center of the channel since fig 5 shows that the maximum spanwise flow occurred at the point of highest depth for each section it seemed that the transverse dispersion coefficient size would match the point with the highest spanwise flow in the cross section fig 13 depicts the spatial variation of the velocity based transverse dispersion coefficient for two cases in which contours were generated by interpolation of point values of the transverse dispersion coefficient at each cross section this figure along with figs 10 and 11 clearly demonstrate that the transverse dispersion coefficients were much higher at the bend apices sections s2 s4 and s6 than at the crossover sections sections s1 s3 and s5 the larger values of the transverse dispersion coefficients at the bend apices were driven by the strong secondary currents developed at the bend as shown in fig 5 the same result was also reported in the analysis of experimental works by lee and seo 2013 where the apex areas showed higher values of the transverse dispersion coefficient than the crossover sections this difference between apex and crossover section was not profound in the case of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient because the development of the strong secondary current did not greatly affect the vertical profile of the streamwise velocity at the bend apices even though it caused more skewed lateral distribution of the streamwise velocity at the crossover sections 4 4 calculation of the concentration based dispersion coefficients for calculation of the dispersion coefficients using the 2d strp eq 8 the predicted time concentration curves as c t η contours at the downstream section were calculated using the observed upstream time concentration contour as an input as shown in fig 2b the predicted contour was repeatedly matched with the observed contour at the downstream section until the optimal value of the dispersion coefficient was found in this study the nonlinear multiple regression technique was applied to find the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficient at the same time the best fit was decided based on the root mean square error rmse which is given below 13 rmse 1 n c p c o 2 n where n is the number of interpolated concentration data c p is the predicted concentration and c o is the observed concentration while the measured curves were incorporated into the equation to calculate the predicted curves the concentration time lateral distance curves were transformed into the concentration time normalized cumulative discharge curves then the c t η time concentration curves were interpolated by using the kriging method this interpolation was necessary to match the predicted curves that were positioned with the measured curves because the actual distances between the concentration curves across the normalized cumulative discharge were not uniform in each section due to the channel meandering the results of the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients calculated from 2d strp were listed in table 3 in this table the routing span a b would represent that the concentration profile acquired from section a was used as the input data to route the concentration profile at the downstream section section b for all routing cases the rmse were between 0 5 and 1 5 ppb which meant that the results of the routing method calibrated well with the measured values this method can only calculate span averaged results to a single value while the velocity based method can produce the spatial variability of the dispersion coefficients such as shown in figs 8 12 figs 14 and 15 depict the comparisons of the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients by two different methods table 3 shows that the dimensionless values of the concentration based longitudinal dispersion coefficients ranged 14 7 35 5 which were much greater than the elder s theoretical result this difference has been reported by other researchers including seo et al 2006 baek and seo 2010 and seo et al 2016 they maintained that the concentration based longitudinal dispersion coefficients observed in natural rivers were up to 25 times the elder s theoretical result table 3 and fig 14 show that compared to the velocity based dispersion coefficients the longitudinal dispersion coefficients calculated from the concentration curves were 4 to 6 times the cross sectional averaged value of the velocity based dispersion coefficients while 2 to 3 times the value of the maximum dispersion coefficient found along the maximum velocity line at each section this suggests that the velocity based longitudinal dispersion coefficient is a fractional value of the concentration based result which contained mixing caused by channel irregularities throughout the reach in addition to shear dispersion by vertical velocity variations therefore the concentration driven coefficient contained mixing other than the ones by shear flow and turbulent motion can be suggested to have the form given below 14 d lc d lv d li ε l where d lc is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient calculated from the concentration data d lv is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient due to velocity distribution of the shear flow d li is the dispersion coefficient caused by the irregularities of the channel and storage zones and ε l is the turbulence driven mixing coefficient from these results one can also note that the main tracer cloud was moving and dispersing longitudinally following the maximum velocity line of the meandering channel as sketched in fig 1a and photographed in fig 4 table 3 also shows that in the case of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the longer routing span calculations tended to generate higher values because the channel irregularities throughout the channel contributed to the longitudinal mixing in addition to the shear effect by vertical velocity variations table 3 and fig 15 shows that in the case of the transverse dispersion coefficients the concentration based coefficients were almost equivalent to the velocity based coefficients unlike the longitudinal dispersion coefficient as mentioned earlier the high values of the velocity based transverse dispersion coefficients at the alternating bend apices and low values at the crossover sections were because of the action of strong secondary currents developed in the bend apex thus we can conceptualize that the main tracer cloud moving along the maximum velocity line of the meandering channel expanded in full scale in the transverse direction at the bend areas but dispersed in minimum scale at the crossover regions and this process was occurring alternately through the meandering channels in this situation actual dispersion of the tracer cloud was mainly dependent on the velocity structure of the secondary currents rather than on any other processes furthermore in table 3 in case of the concentration based transverse dispersion coefficient the tendency found in the case of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient that the longer routing span tended to generate higher values was not found this also suggests that the channel irregularities throughout the channel reach did not contribute significantly to the transverse mixing compared to the shear effect by vertical velocity variations due to the secondary currents to check the validity of two methods for calculating the transverse dispersion coefficients used in this study classical empirical equations developed by gharbi and verrette 1998 and deng et al 2001 were used for comparison the equation developed by gharbi and verrette 1998 is the following 15 d t 0 0035 q s h s 1 75 w h s 0 25 d l 0 75 0 0005 this equation contains the longitudinal dispersion coefficients so the values calculated from the 2d strp in this paper were used as the input the equation developed by deng et al 2001 is the following 16 d t h s u 0 145 1 3 530 u s u w h s 1 38 results of the velocity based transverse dispersion coefficient are compared with gharbi and verrette 1998 and deng et al 2001 in figs 10 and 11 the figures show that the values by empirical equations were higher than the velocity based results at the cross over sections while the velocity based results generated significantly higher values than the empirical equations at the bend apex sections this comparison result demonstrated the periodic behavior of the tracer dispersion in the meandering channels which was manifested by the velocity based dispersion coefficient values comparison of the reach averaged values for the calculated transverse dispersion coefficients including the stmm method was shown in fig 16 overall the values by different methods displayed similarity especially in case amc 317 r1 for case amc315 r1 2d strp generated higher values than the empirical equations and the stmm the averaged values of dispersion coefficients for five different methods for two cases were quite similar with 0 26 and 0 25 respectively these comparisons revealed that the velocity based method showed more consistent results in calculating reach averaged values of the transverse dispersion coefficient than the concentration based methods 5 conclusions in this study the 2d dispersion coefficients were obtained from the velocity data of the meandering channels using the equation developed by fischer et al 1979 which incorporated the shear effects into the triple integration of the deviation from the depth averaged velocity this approach was compared to the two dimensional routing procedures in which the dispersion coefficients were calculated from the concentration data obtained through tracer tests in meandering channels the experiments were conducted at the meandering channels with sinuosity of 1 5 and 1 7 in the river experiment center of kict korea the results show that the streamwise and spanwise velocities were affected by the geometric shape of the channel which then affected the mixing characteristics as the tracer flows throughout the apex and crossover sections of the meandering channels in particular the maximum point of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was shifted to the middle of the channel section in the apex sections due to the phase lag occurring from the previous apices the calculation results demonstrate that the cross sectional averaged values of the non dimensional longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l h u by velocity profile ranged 4 1 to 6 5 of which range is close to elder s theoretical result 5 93 however the longitudinal dispersion coefficients calculated from the concentration curves using the 2d stream tube routing procedure were quite a lot larger than elder s result the span averaged values of the concentration based coefficients ranged 14 7 to 35 5 this difference could be explained by the fact that the concentration driven dispersion coefficients included the mixing effects due to the irregularities of the channel and storage zones as well as shear dispersion while the velocity driven coefficients only accounted for shear flow effects the analysis of the spatial variability of the velocity based longitudinal dispersion in the sinuous channels used in this study showed the notable characteristics that the maximum point of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was located at the point where the maximum velocity was located in the case of the transverse dispersion coefficient the difference between the velocity based and the concentration based coefficients was not as profound as for the longitudinal dispersion coefficients the cross sectional maximum values of the non dimensional transverse dispersion coefficient d t h u ranged 0 1 3 3 for the velocity driven coefficients and 0 9 2 9 for the concentration based coefficients the analysis of the spatial variability of the velocity based transverse dispersion showed that transverse dispersion coefficients were much higher at the bend apices than at the crossover sections the larger values of the transverse dispersion coefficients at the bend apices were driven by the strong secondary currents developed at the bend these results suggest that the transverse dispersion of the tracer cloud was mainly dependent on the velocity structure of the secondary currents rather than on any other processes therefore it can be concluded that transverse dispersion coefficients by both methods represented the same dispersion mechanism which was dominated by the secondary currents developed in the sinuous channels declaration of

5764,the aims of this study were to develop a method to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of agricultural non point source anps pollution loads at the basin scale and to identify the dominant processes and factors responsible time series of water flow and nh4 n tn and tp loads at sub basin outlets in the qujiang and fujiang river basins were obtained using a model calibrated with field measured data the dynamic time warping dtw distances of flow rate and anps pollution loads between a sub basin outlet and the basin outlet were calculated using the time series at the sub basin outlet and the basin outlet the dtws were divided into clusters to evaluate the differences in variation information content and similarity among anps pollution load time series at the various spatial scales results showed that the proposed method could successfully identify the critical spatial scale of the basin in the sub basins smaller than the critical spatial scale anps pollution loads were primarily affected by the land surface hydrological processes in the sub basins larger than the critical spatial scale anps pollution loads were affected mainly by the river hydrological processes in the qujiang river basin the spatial dtw clusters of anps pollution loads were similar to those of the water flow in the sub basins smaller than the critical scale distinguishing factors for the anps pollution loads clusters were from most to least important stream order i e the spatial scale land use and soil nutrient content in the fujiang river basin the spatial dtw clusters of the three pollutants were similar distinguishing factors for the anps pollution loads clusters were from most to least important slope land use and soil nutrient content this method developed can be used as a practical technique to characterize spatial and temporal distributions of anps pollution in river basins keywords agricultural non point source pollution river basins critical spatial scale dynamic time warping distance 1 introduction agricultural non point source anps pollution comes from various sources such as farmland and rural activities animal breeding and soil erosion ongley et al 2010 wang et al 2019 the spatial and temporal distributions of anps pollution are influenced by the physical and chemical properties of soil topography land use climate hydrology and many other factors shen et al 2014 liu et al 2016 it is challenging to estimate the spatial and temporal distributions of anps pollution loads accurately because of the interactions among underlying surface conditions pollution sources and hydrological processes it has been reported that pollutant concentrations in stream water due to anps are better predicted with riparian land use than with catchment land use tran et al 2010 collins et al 2013 mcmillan et al 2014 shi et al 2017 however other studies demonstrated that changes in water quality related to anps pollution were better predicted with land use at catchment scale sliva and williams 2001 king et al 2005 meneses et al 2015 ding et al 2016 the underlying surface is characterized by a mixture of land uses such as agricultural and forest kaushal et

processes especially long term ones play an important role in distributing of anps pollution from soil to rivers morse and wollheim 2014 musolff et al 2017 the capability of various land types to store and retard anps pollution loads depends on the spatial scale and hydrological conditions being considered the anps pollution loads at a catchment outlet substantially increase after discharged pollution fluxes exceed the storage and retard capabilities of the land danz et al 2013 complex hydrological processes combined with the physical and biogeochemical processes of pollutants e g

g the water environmental capacity are often used to characterize anps pollution loads variations at various spatial scales randhir and tsvetkova 2011 wang and lin 2018 however these statistical measures are only as good as the amount and quality of input data it is not clear to what extent the limited input data can characterize the uncertainty and heterogeneity in anps pollution load time series at various spatial scales li et al 2019 dynamic time warping dtw is the most useful method to discriminate time series giustarini et al 2016 the time series of the anps pollution loads are not synchronic at different spatial scales due to spatially uneven rainfalls in a basin and different confluence processes at various sub basin scales the dtw distance can identify changes in time series at different resolutions i e different spatial scales dürrenmatt et al 2013 therefore it is feasible to utilize the dtw distances to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of anps pollution loads under the basin scale physical and process based models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 have been widely used for anps pollution load simulations singh et al 2012 with good quality and detailed spatially disaggregated data for model calibration and validation swat can provide reliable pollutant load estimates yang et al 2016 the calibrated

ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations measured at monitoring stations in the qujiang and fujiang river basins were used to calibrate the swat model the calibrated swat model simulated time series of water flow and loads of nh4 n tn and tp at sub basin outlets which were then used as the basis to analyze spatial and temporal variations of the anps pollution loads the objectives of this study were to develop a method that could characterize spatial and temporal distributions of anps pollution loads in the basins and to identify the dominant processes and factors influencing anps pollution loads at various spatial scales specifically we synchronized time series of anps pollution loads at various spatial scales and characterized differences in the time series through investigating the variation information content and similarity these differences were related to the underlying surface conditions pollution sources and hydrological processes overall this study provided an increased understanding of anps pollution at various temporal and spatial scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the qujiang and fujiang

were simulated using the qual2e model brown and barnwell 1987 dynamic land use conditions were considered in swat during the simulation period the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup a program developed for sensitivity analysis calibration validation and uncertainty analysis abbaspour 2011 abbaspour et al 2015 was utilized to calibrate swat parameters table s2 the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup was selected as the calibration algorithm due to its good performance in large watersheds rostamian et al 2008 wu and chen 2015 a first set of iterations was performed to obtain the sensitive parameters and a second set of iterations was then calibrated using the sensitive parameters the most sensitive parameters were selected based on 2000 simulations with the calibrated values the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient was used as the objective function for optimization nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 3 characterization of anps time series using the dynamic time warping distance based on the concept of dtw distance giustarini et al 2016 a method was developed to compare different time series of flow rates and anps pollution loads to study anps pollution at different scales time series of flow rate and loads of nh4 n tn and tp at the basin outlet were set as the references the flow rates and anps pollution fluxes at the basin outlet were the superposition of the flow rates and anps pollution fluxes of the sub basins therefore the time series differences or similarities between the sub basins and the basin i e the references were used to evaluate anps pollution contributions of the sub basins to the entire basin and determine the primary contributing factors dtw distances were calculated using time series of the variables from each sub basin outlet and the reference two time series with length n i e x x 1 x 2 xi xn and y y 1 y 2 yj yn were used to construct a n n warping matrix the dtw distance was calculated using giorgino 2009 1 d x y min w k 1 k d w k where d is the euclidean distance wk i j denotes the alignment between points xi and y j and k is the entire warping path length the more similar two time series the smaller their dtw distance is dtw distances of the variables were divided into five independent clusters using the wilcoxom rank sum test wang et al 2009 if time series from a sub basin with i 1th order streams and one with ith order streams were similar the dtw distances were assigned to the same cluster the dtw distance was primarily dependent on variation information content and similarity of the compared time series of anps pollution loads changes in dtw distances indicated impacts of the hydrological and non hydrological processes on anps pollution loads the variation in time series reflects the interaction among rainfall and underlying surface conditions on the anps pollution load a time series can be standardized as follows 2 n s t n t μ σ where n t and ns t are the original and standardized time series respectively and µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of n t respectively the dtw distance difference between the original and standardized time series was used to evaluate the interaction among rainfall and underlying surface conditions and associated impacts on the anps pollution loads the information content of anps pollution loads were evaluated with the extreme numbers i e fluctuation in the time series the extreme numbers were largely caused by the hydrological i e water fluxes from different flow paths related to pollutant transport processes and non hydrological processes e g discharges of anps pollution into a stream from various rural sources and changes in sediment nutrient content for time series of the anps pollution loads the parts with extreme values caused by the flow extremes were kept constant and other parts with extreme values caused by pollution loads were treated by replacing with splines dtw distances were calculated using the anps pollution loads treated and original time series respectively comparison of the two dtw distances should show effects of extreme numbers on dtw distance 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat simulation of flow and pollution transport swat simulated flow rates are compared in fig 4 with the measurements at the typical hydrological stations in the fujiang and qujiang river basins fig 5 shows results of nh4 n tn and tp concentrations simulated using swat and the measurements at sailong station in the qujiang river basin more comparisons of the simulated and measured water flow rates and anps pollution loads are presented in figs s2 and s3 for the qujiang river basin errors mainly occurred in peak flow simulations the peak flow rates were underestimated by 6 29 and 5 87 in 2007 and 2011 respectively and overestimated by 9 02 and 7 74 in 2008 and 2016 for the fujiang river basin swat underestimated the maximum flow rates in 2009 and 2013 by 6 84 and 5 25 respectively for the fujiang river basin for the two river basins the model overestimated the minimum flow rates by 10 the flow rate extreme numbers were underestimated by 2 47 4 88 and 6 04 for the dry normal and wet years respectively nh4 n and tn concentrations were typically overestimated in the dry years extreme numbers estimations for nh4 n and tn were more accurate than those of tp and the minimum tp concentrations were overestimated for the three pollutants estimations of high concentrations were more accurate than those of lower concentrations the results were similar to swat simulated results for other basins čerkasova et al 2018 the nse coefficients of flow rate nh4 n tn and tp in the qujiang river basin were 0 671 0 554 0 548 and 0 502 resepctively the nse coefficients of flow rate nh4 n tn and tp in the fujiang river basin were 0 702 0 601 0 597 and 0 534 resepctively overall the nse coefficients of ansp pollution loads were lower than those of flow rate consistent with swat simulated results in other basins e g liu et al 2016 these results were attributable to the transmission of flow simulation errors as well as the various physical chemical and biological processes involved in pollutant transport and transformation with the simulation errors 10 0 and the nse coefficients 0 50 the model calibration results were considered satisfactory for both basins therefore the calibrated swat model was used to generate time series of flow rates and loads of nh4 n tn and tp for the following analyses 3 2 the temporal distributions of anps pollution loads at different spatial scales according to vannote et al 1980 the smallest tributaries in the qujiang and fujiang river basins were classified as fifth order steams in the qujiang river basin the extreme numbers of flow rates and loads of nh4 n and tn at the sub basin outlets increased linearly with spatial scales i e from the sub basin with the fifth order streams to that with the second order streams and then maintained stable from the sub basin with the second order streams to that with the first order streams table 2 the differences in extreme numbers between flow rates and nh4 n and tn loads were generally stable in the sub basins with all stream orders extreme flow rate numbers were 62 4 66 5 of nh4 n values and 40 2 40 9 of tn values as shown in table 3 the impact of the nh4 n and tn loads extreme numbers on dtw distances increased with decreasing spatial scales primarily because the distances of the extremes were extend by the pollutant diffusion process in the streams in the fujiang river basin the extreme numbers of nh4 n and tn loads increased non linearly with spatial scale and then were stable from sub basins with the second order streams to those with the first order streams table 2 compared to sub basins with the fifth order streams the differences in extreme numbers between flow rate and nh4 n load in sub basins with the third order streams increased 40 7 and the difference between flow rate and tn load increased 48 2 table 2 however changes in the relative dtw distances of nh4 n and tn loads increased only 4 8 and 7 5 respectively as shown in table 2 differences in extreme numbers between flow rates and anps pollution loads were relatively stable among the different spatial scales in the qujiang river basin while extreme numbers increased significantly with spatial scale in the fujiang river basin the changes in relative dtw distances of nh4 n and tn loads in the qujiang river basin were significantly higher than those in the fujiang river basin table 3 moreover the change differences of relative dtw distances of nh4 n and tn loads between the two basins increased with spatial scales in the qujiang river basin higher extreme numbers of nh4 n and tn loads were mainly attributable to organic n transport and transformation with land surface hydrological processes in the fujiang river basin the slopes of the sub basins with the first third order streams were very gentle fig 3c therefore due to lower runoff flow rates and the longer residence time of anps pollution the extreme number of the anps pollution loads increased while the impacts of the increased extreme numbers on relative dtw distances were small as tn was transported in both soluble and insoluble forms with sediment and tp was transported primarily in insoluble form with sediment the extreme numbers of tn were higher than those of tp at all spatial scales in the two basins surface runoff and sediment transport processes played a dominant role in tp transport to streams e g kleinman et al 2000 preedy et al 2001 michaud and laverdiere 2004 the very different dtw distances between flow rate and tp indicated that a considerable proportion of the tp load was caused by heavy rainfall events furthermore the tp amount added to the runoff was significantly different for various underlying surface conditions i e soil land use and slope danz et al 2013 the simulated and measured results of flow rates and anps pollution loads in sub basin with various order streams are presented in table 4 mean values of flow rates and anps pollution loads were generally stable across spatial scales however the standard deviations of the flow rates and anps pollution loads decreased with increasing spatial scale in both the basins at each spatial scale the relative changes in dtw distances of the original and standardized anps pollution loads time series were within 10 table 3 this result was attributed to the centralized distributions of anps pollution loads during moderate and heavy rainfall events 20 mm at each spatial scale the ratios of nh4 n tn and tp loads during 20 mm rainfall events to the total loads were 52 4 60 2 63 1 72 8 and 60 4 75 2 in the qujiang river basin respectively for the fujiang basin the corresponding ranges were 44 6 52 4 58 9 67 4 and 55 1 65 5 respectively during rainfall events the anps pollution loads were primarily from the surface runoff meaning that only a small portion percolated into groundwater and discharged into streams the pollution flux at a sub basin outlet included the pollution inflow from connected sub basins i e i sub basins and the net flux from the sub basin the contribution ratio was defined as the ratio of the pollution inflow from the i sub basin with the same dtw cluster to the flux at the sub basin outlet contribution ratios of sub basins with different order streams for nh4 n tn and tp are listed in table 5 in both basins the mean contribution ratios increased but the variation coefficients decreased with spatial scale the mean variation coefficients for nh4 n tn and tp loads were 0 482 0 415 and 0 347 respectively in the qujiang river basin and 0 176 0 179 and 0 157 respectively in the fujiang river basin the much higher variation coefficients in the qujiang river basin were attributable to anps pollution load differences between the stream and inflow tributaries during moderate and heavy rainfall events in addition rainfall impacts on anps pollution load contribution ratios became less significant at larger spatial scales as shown in table 5 the mean contribution ratios of the three anps pollution loads for sub basins smaller than the critical scale were 0 74 and 0 63 respectively in the qujiang and fujiang river basins these results indicated that the dtw clusters could be used to identify critical source areas i e the sub basin contributing the primary sediments and pollutants in the basin shore et al 2014 winchell et al 2015 3 3 determination of the critical spatial scales and identification of the dominant processes in the qujiang river basin and for the three pollutants the relative changes in dtw distances of the extreme numbers and the variation were maximized in the sub basins with the second order streams tables 2 and 3 the contribution ratios of sub basins with the second order streams were also much higher than those of the smaller sub basins table 5 therefore the sub basin with the second order streams was designated as the critical spatial scale for the ansp pollution loads in the qujiang river basin in the sub basins larger than the critical spatial scale the differences in the dtw distances of the anps pollution loads were caused mainly by the river hydrological processes i e the mixing and transformation processes in streams furthermore the time series at sub basins outlets were similar to those at the basin outlet the impacts of nh4 n tn and tp discharged into streams from various land surface processes on the anps pollution loads were less important than that from the river hydrological processes for the sub basins smaller than the critical spatial scale the anps pollution loads were primarily affected by the land surface hydrological processes i e the discharge processes from the land surface to streams with various pollution sources and pathways similarly the critical spatial scale in the fujiang river basin was the sub basin with third order streams in the basin overall land surface was the dominated influence factor in sub basins smaller than the critical spatial scale while river hydrological processes were the dominated influence factor in sub basins larger than the critical spatial scale the spatial distributions of the dtw distance clusters of flow rate and loads of nh4 n tn and tp are shown in fig 6 for the qujiang river basin in the river basin the dtw distance clusters for the flow rate were consistent with the stream orders figs 2 and 6 for all anps pollution loads the regions within the first dtw cluster were in the first order stream sub basin the regions within the second and third dtw distance clusters of the loads were in the sub basins with the second order streams for the nh4 n and tn loads the dtw distances spatial distributions were similar to those of the flow rates the regions within the fifth dtw distance cluster were primarily in the sub basins with the fifth order streams while the regions within the fourth dtw distance cluster were mainly in the sub basins with third and fourth orders streams the soil tp content in the regions within the fourth dtw distance cluster was higher than that in the fifth dtw distance cluster figs 2 and 6 in the fujiang river basin figs 3 and 7 the spatial distributions of the dtw distance clusters were similar to those of the flow rates however the spatial patterns of the dtw distance clusters of the anps pollution loads were quite different from those of the flow rates for the anps pollution loads the regions within the first and second dtw clusters were in the sub basins with the first and second order streams the regions within the third dtw cluster of the loads were in the areas with agricultural land use and gentle slopes in the regions within the fourth dtw cluster of the nh4 n load 24 5 78 4 of the total area was the agricultural land while the regions within the fifth dtw cluster of the nh4 n load were largely forest the soil tp content in the fifth dtw distance cluster regions was higher than that in the fourth cluster similarly the organic matter content within the fifth dtw distance cluster regions of tn was much higher than that within the fourth cluster the results were consistent with chen et al 2019 showing that the impact of soil physical and chemical properties on anps pollution loads decreased with the increasing spatial scale in the qujiang river basin the spatial distributions of dtw distances of tn during the wet seasons were similar to those during all seasons fig 6e and c however dtw distributions during the dry seasons were different from those during all seasons fig 6f and c the dtw distances for the nh4 n tn and tp loads during the wet seasons accounted for 70 4 74 8 and 80 4 respectively of the total dtw distances during all seasons the number of sub basins with the same cluster of the tn i e the third cluster in the dry seasons was much higher than that in the wet seasons fig 6e and f as indicated by zhu et al 2019 baseflow was the main way of nonpoint source n movement during the dry seasons in the fujiang river basin the dtw distances for the nh4 n tn and tp loads during the wet seasons accounted for 58 4 66 2 and 64 5 respectively of the total dtw distances the spatial distributions of dtw distances of tn during the wet and dry seasons were not similar to the total dtw distance fig 7c e and f these results indicated that rainfall events were the dominant influence on the anps pollution loads in the qujiang river basin while the underlying surface conditions dominated in the fujiang river basin in the sub basins smaller than the critical scale the contribution ratios of the sub basins within the same dtw cluster were much higher in the qujiang river basin than in the fujiang river basin the anps pollution loads were primarily from the regions sensitive to rainfall events in the qujiang river basin soil nutrients in the qujiang river basin were also higher than those in the fujiang river basin figs 2 and 3 and the two basins exhibited similar land use proportions table s2 however the increases of the anps pollution loads in the qujiang river basin were significantly lower than those of flow rate i e 2 11 11 7 and 1 4 for the nh4 n tn and tp loads respectively and 32 3 for flow rate moreover because anps pollution loads in the qujiang and fujiang river basins largely originated from regions sensitive to rainfall events and entire areas respectively the differences in relative dtw distances changes of anps pollution loads increased with the increasing spatial scale in the qujiang river basin spatial distributions of anps pollution loads were highly similar to those of flow rate impact of the land surface hydrological process on anps pollution loads decreased with increasing spatial scale therefore anps pollution load estimation accuracy might not be affected by the spatial scale which was similar to the anps pollution results predicted in riparian areas by tran et al 2010 and shi et al 2017 in the fujiang river basin the underlying surface was the dominant factor on anps pollution loads the effects of underlying surface conditions pollution sources and hydrological processes on the anps pollution loads became more profound with increased spatial scale therefore anps pollution load estimation accuracy decreased with spatial scale as also found by meneses et al 2015 and ding et al 2016 4 conclusions using the concept of dtw distance a method was developed to characterize the differences in variation information content and similarity among time series of flow rate and anps pollution i e nh4 n tn and tp loads at various sub basin scales time series of flow rate and anps pollution loads in the qujiang and fujiang river basins were generated with swat which was calibrated using the data measured in the basins the critical spatial scale of a basin was defined as the scale at which relative changes of dtw distances of extreme numbers and variation reached the maximum and the contribution ratio of sub basins to the basin was the highest in the sub basins smaller than the critical spatial scale the anps pollution loads were primarily affected by the land surface hydrological processes in the sub basins larger than the critical spatial scale the anps pollution loads were mainly affected by the river hydrological processes the spatial and temporal distributions and the dominant processes affecting anps pollution loads were also determined in the qujiang river basin the hydrological processes and the related land use as well as soil chemical content were the most influential factors in the fujiang river basin the most influential factors were agricultural land hydrological processes and chemical content declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

5764,the aims of this study were to develop a method to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of agricultural non point source anps pollution loads at the basin scale and to identify the dominant processes and factors responsible time series of water flow and nh4 n tn and tp loads at sub basin outlets in the qujiang and fujiang river basins were obtained using a model calibrated with field measured data the dynamic time warping dtw distances of flow rate and anps pollution loads between a sub basin outlet and the basin outlet were calculated using the time series at the sub basin outlet and the basin outlet the dtws were divided into clusters to evaluate the differences in variation information content and similarity among anps pollution load time series at the various spatial scales results showed that the proposed method could successfully identify the critical spatial scale of the basin in the sub basins smaller than the critical spatial scale anps pollution loads were primarily affected by the land surface hydrological processes in the sub basins larger than the critical spatial scale anps pollution loads were affected mainly by the river hydrological processes in the qujiang river basin the spatial dtw clusters of anps pollution loads were similar to those of the water flow in the sub basins smaller than the critical scale distinguishing factors for the anps pollution loads clusters were from most to least important stream order i e the spatial scale land use and soil nutrient content in the fujiang river basin the spatial dtw clusters of the three pollutants were similar distinguishing factors for the anps pollution loads clusters were from most to least important slope land use and soil nutrient content this method developed can be used as a practical technique to characterize spatial and temporal distributions of anps pollution in river basins keywords agricultural non point source pollution river basins critical spatial scale dynamic time warping distance 1 introduction agricultural non point source anps pollution comes from various sources such as farmland and rural activities animal breeding and soil erosion ongley et al 2010 wang et al 2019 the spatial and temporal distributions of anps pollution are influenced by the physical and chemical properties of soil topography land use climate hydrology and many other factors shen et al 2014 liu et al 2016 it is challenging to estimate the spatial and temporal distributions of anps pollution loads accurately because of the interactions among underlying surface conditions pollution sources and hydrological processes it has been reported that pollutant concentrations in stream water due to anps are better predicted with riparian land use than with catchment land use tran et al 2010 collins et al 2013 mcmillan et al 2014 shi et al 2017 however other studies demonstrated that changes in water quality related to anps pollution were better predicted with land use at catchment scale sliva and williams 2001 king et al 2005 meneses et al 2015 ding et al 2016 the underlying surface is characterized by a mixture of land uses such as agricultural and forest kaushal et al 2014 vaughan et al 2017 contributions of the anps pollution from various land uses change dramatically with runoff flow rates kaushal et al 2011 chen et al 2018 jacobs et al 2018 hydrological processes especially long term ones play an important role in distributing of anps pollution from soil to rivers morse and wollheim 2014 musolff et al 2017 the capability of various land types to store and retard anps pollution loads depends on the spatial scale and hydrological conditions being considered the anps pollution loads at a catchment outlet substantially increase after discharged pollution fluxes exceed the storage and retard capabilities of the land danz et al 2013 complex hydrological processes combined with the physical and biogeochemical processes of pollutants e g nitrogen n and phosphorus p make it extremely difficult to predict anps pollution events e g water eutrophication especially at the basin scale the interactions of underlying surface conditions pollution sources and hydrological process result directly in largely spatial and temporal variations in anps pollution loads statistics e g means and standard deviation and environmental indicators e g the water environmental capacity are often used to characterize anps pollution loads variations at various spatial scales randhir and tsvetkova 2011 wang and lin 2018 however these statistical measures are only as good as the amount and quality of input data it is not clear to what extent the limited input data can characterize the uncertainty and heterogeneity in anps pollution load time series at various spatial scales li et al 2019 dynamic time warping dtw is the most useful method to discriminate time series giustarini et al 2016 the time series of the anps pollution loads are not synchronic at different spatial scales due to spatially uneven rainfalls in a basin and different confluence processes at various sub basin scales the dtw distance can identify changes in time series at different resolutions i e different spatial scales dürrenmatt et al 2013 therefore it is feasible to utilize the dtw distances to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of anps pollution loads under the basin scale physical and process based models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 have been widely used for anps pollution load simulations singh et al 2012 with good quality and detailed spatially disaggregated data for model calibration and validation swat can provide reliable pollutant load estimates yang et al 2016 the calibrated model can estimate the impacts of spatial e g land use and or temporal variables e g rainfall on anps pollution ouyang et al 2009 shen et al 2014 chen et al 2019 in this study flow rates data and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations measured at monitoring stations in the qujiang and fujiang river basins were used to calibrate the swat model the calibrated swat model simulated time series of water flow and loads of nh4 n tn and tp at sub basin outlets which were then used as the basis to analyze spatial and temporal variations of the anps pollution loads the objectives of this study were to develop a method that could characterize spatial and temporal distributions of anps pollution loads in the basins and to identify the dominant processes and factors influencing anps pollution loads at various spatial scales specifically we synchronized time series of anps pollution loads at various spatial scales and characterized differences in the time series through investigating the variation information content and similarity these differences were related to the underlying surface conditions pollution sources and hydrological processes overall this study provided an increased understanding of anps pollution at various temporal and spatial scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the qujiang and fujiang rivers are the largest tributaries on the left and right banks respectively of the jialingjiang river fig 1 the qujiang river basin is in northeastern sichuan province china 30 00 to 32 45 n 106 17 to 109 00 e with an area of 389212 km2 and elevation ranging from 188 to 2669 m the fujiang river basin is in central sichuan province 29 30 to 33 05 n 103 44 to 106 16 e with an area of 35509 km2 and elevation ranging from 180 to 5502 m for the qujiang basin the mean annual rainfall temperature wind speed and relative humidity were 1199 mm 16 4 c 1 39 m s and 76 1 respectively 1956 2018 in the fujiang river basin 1956 2018 these parameters were 1102 mm 17 9 c 1 28 m s and 77 3 respectively similar to other studies in upstream catchments of the yangtse river e g shen et al 2013 chen et al 2017 excessive use of n and p fertilizers high density rural population and livestock and poultry farming have caused extensive release of n and p in the region basin information of the pollution sources including human population livestock and poultry heads discharged sewage and pollution densities of nh4 n tn and tp in rural and urban areas is listed in table 1 the digital elevation model dem data of the two basins with a spatial resolution of 30 m were was extracted for the two basins from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm nasa s jet propulsion laboratory land use information for 2005 2010 and 2015 was obtained from the chinese academy of sciences and classified into the standard swat land use categories table s1 in rural areas land use category changes were 5 during this period the land use types of the qujiang and fujiang river basins in 2015 are shown in figs 2 a and 3a respectively daily meteorological data 2003 2018 including precipitation the minimum and maximum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were collected at 18 and 16 weather stations respectively in the qujiang and fujiang river basins figs 2b and 3b flow rates during the period from 2006 to 2018 were monitored at 8 and 12 hydrological stations respectively in the qujiang and fujiang river basins figs 2b and 3b concentrations of anps pollutants i e nh4 n tn and tp were measured at three automatic water quantity monitoring stations in the qujiang river basin i e jiangling liangtan and sailong fig 2b and four stations in the fujiang river basin i e fenggu daan xiangshan and laochi fig 3 b daily water quality data were collected at all stations from 2008 to 2018 pollution discharged from point sources including industrial and urban sewage and atmospheric deposition was monitored by the sichuan environmental monitoring center the slopes of the two basins were derived from dem data figs 2c and 3c soil types and properties were extracted from the nanjing institute of soil science databases yu et al 2007a b shi et al 2010 soil physical properties i e particle size distribution bulk density field capacity and hydraulic conductivity were obtained from the soil database and field survey soil nutrient i e tn tp and organic matter contents were obtained from the local soil survey reports soil nutrient distributions for the qujiang and fujiang river basins are presented in fig 2d f and fig 3d f respectively more information about the study basins is shown in fig s1 2 2 simulation of the transport processes of water flow and anps pollution using swat the qujiang and fujiang river basins were divided into 261 and 238 sub basins respectively based on dem data which was done in the swat model using the arcgis hydrological analysis function each sub basin was further grouped into hydrologic response units which were composed of unique land use soil type and management practice combinations the effects of different underlying surface conditions and management practices on hydrological processes erosion transport and nutrient cycles of the hydrologic response units were quantified and integrated for the sub basins and the basin the swat model simulated hydrological process based on the subsequent water balance equation van griensven et al 2012 roth et al 2016 surface runoff was calculated using a modified soil conservation service scs curve number method usda 2004 sediment yield was estimated using the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1995 water flow sediment transport and anps pollution in streams were simulated using the qual2e model brown and barnwell 1987 dynamic land use conditions were considered in swat during the simulation period the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup a program developed for sensitivity analysis calibration validation and uncertainty analysis abbaspour 2011 abbaspour et al 2015 was utilized to calibrate swat parameters table s2 the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup was selected as the calibration algorithm due to its good performance in large watersheds rostamian et al 2008 wu and chen 2015 a first set of iterations was performed to obtain the sensitive parameters and a second set of iterations was then calibrated using the sensitive parameters the most sensitive parameters were selected based on 2000 simulations with the calibrated values the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient was used as the objective function for optimization nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 3 characterization of anps time series using the dynamic time warping distance based on the concept of dtw distance giustarini et al 2016 a method was developed to compare different time series of flow rates and anps pollution loads to study anps pollution at different scales time series of flow rate and loads of nh4 n tn and tp at the basin outlet were set as the references the flow rates and anps pollution fluxes at the basin outlet were the superposition of the flow rates and anps pollution fluxes of the sub basins therefore the time series differences or similarities between the sub basins and the basin i e the references were used to evaluate anps pollution contributions of the sub basins to the entire basin and determine the primary contributing factors dtw distances were calculated using time series of the variables from each sub basin outlet and the reference two time series with length n i e x x 1 x 2 xi xn and y y 1 y 2 yj yn were used to construct a n n warping matrix the dtw distance was calculated using giorgino 2009 1 d x y min w k 1 k d w k where d is the euclidean distance wk i j denotes the alignment between points xi and y j and k is the entire warping path length the more similar two time series the smaller their dtw distance is dtw distances of the variables were divided into five independent clusters using the wilcoxom rank sum test wang et al 2009 if time series from a sub basin with i 1th order streams and one with ith order streams were similar the dtw distances were assigned to the same cluster the dtw distance was primarily dependent on variation information content and similarity of the compared time series of anps pollution loads changes in dtw distances indicated impacts of the hydrological and non hydrological processes on anps pollution loads the variation in time series reflects the interaction among rainfall and underlying surface conditions on the anps pollution load a time series can be standardized as follows 2 n s t n t μ σ where n t and ns t are the original and standardized time series respectively and µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of n t respectively the dtw distance difference between the original and standardized time series was used to evaluate the interaction among rainfall and underlying surface conditions and associated impacts on the anps pollution loads the information content of anps pollution loads were evaluated with the extreme numbers i e fluctuation in the time series the extreme numbers were largely caused by the hydrological i e water fluxes from different flow paths related to pollutant transport processes and non hydrological processes e g discharges of anps pollution into a stream from various rural sources and changes in sediment nutrient content for time series of the anps pollution loads the parts with extreme values caused by the flow extremes were kept constant and other parts with extreme values caused by pollution loads were treated by replacing with splines dtw distances were calculated using the anps pollution loads treated and original time series respectively comparison of the two dtw distances should show effects of extreme numbers on dtw distance 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat simulation of flow and pollution transport swat simulated flow rates are compared in fig 4 with the measurements at the typical hydrological stations in the fujiang and qujiang river basins fig 5 shows results of nh4 n tn and tp concentrations simulated using swat and the measurements at sailong station in the qujiang river basin more comparisons of the simulated and measured water flow rates and anps pollution loads are presented in figs s2 and s3 for the qujiang river basin errors mainly occurred in peak flow simulations the peak flow rates were underestimated by 6 29 and 5 87 in 2007 and 2011 respectively and overestimated by 9 02 and 7 74 in 2008 and 2016 for the fujiang river basin swat underestimated the maximum flow rates in 2009 and 2013 by 6 84 and 5 25 respectively for the fujiang river basin for the two river basins the model overestimated the minimum flow rates by 10 the flow rate extreme numbers were underestimated by 2 47 4 88 and 6 04 for the dry normal and wet years respectively nh4 n and tn concentrations were typically overestimated in the dry years extreme numbers estimations for nh4 n and tn were more accurate than those of tp and the minimum tp concentrations were overestimated for the three pollutants estimations of high concentrations were more accurate than those of lower concentrations the results were similar to swat simulated results for other basins čerkasova et al 2018 the nse coefficients of flow rate nh4 n tn and tp in the qujiang river basin were 0 671 0 554 0 548 and 0 502 resepctively the nse coefficients of flow rate nh4 n tn and tp in the fujiang river basin were 0 702 0 601 0 597 and 0 534 resepctively overall the nse coefficients of ansp pollution loads were lower than those of flow rate consistent with swat simulated results in other basins e g liu et al 2016 these results were attributable to the transmission of flow simulation errors as well as the various physical chemical and biological processes involved in pollutant transport and transformation with the simulation errors 10 0 and the nse coefficients 0 50 the model calibration results were considered satisfactory for both basins therefore the calibrated swat model was used to generate time series of flow rates and loads of nh4 n tn and tp for the following analyses 3 2 the temporal distributions of anps pollution loads at different spatial scales according to vannote et al 1980 the smallest tributaries in the qujiang and fujiang river basins were classified as fifth order steams in the qujiang river basin the extreme numbers of flow rates and loads of nh4 n and tn at the sub basin outlets increased linearly with spatial scales i e from the sub basin with the fifth order streams to that with the second order streams and then maintained stable from the sub basin with the second order streams to that with the first order streams table 2 the differences in extreme numbers between flow rates and nh4 n and tn loads were generally stable in the sub basins with all stream orders extreme flow rate numbers were 62 4 66 5 of nh4 n values and 40 2 40 9 of tn values as shown in table 3 the impact of the nh4 n and tn loads extreme numbers on dtw distances increased with decreasing spatial scales primarily because the distances of the extremes were extend by the pollutant diffusion process in the streams in the fujiang river basin the extreme numbers of nh4 n and tn loads increased non linearly with spatial scale and then were stable from sub basins with the second order streams to those with the first order streams table 2 compared to sub basins with the fifth order streams the differences in extreme numbers between flow rate and nh4 n load in sub basins with the third order streams increased 40 7 and the difference between flow rate and tn load increased 48 2 table 2 however changes in the relative dtw distances of nh4 n and tn loads increased only 4 8 and 7 5 respectively as shown in table 2 differences in extreme numbers between flow rates and anps pollution loads were relatively stable among the different spatial scales in the qujiang river basin while extreme numbers increased significantly with spatial scale in the fujiang river basin the changes in relative dtw distances of nh4 n and tn loads in the qujiang river basin were significantly higher than those in the fujiang river basin table 3 moreover the change differences of relative dtw distances of nh4 n and tn loads between the two basins increased with spatial scales in the qujiang river basin higher extreme numbers of nh4 n and tn loads were mainly attributable to organic n transport and transformation with land surface hydrological processes in the fujiang river basin the slopes of the sub basins with the first third order streams were very gentle fig 3c therefore due to lower runoff flow rates and the longer residence time of anps pollution the extreme number of the anps pollution loads increased while the impacts of the increased extreme numbers on relative dtw distances were small as tn was transported in both soluble and insoluble forms with sediment and tp was transported primarily in insoluble form with sediment the extreme numbers of tn were higher than those of tp at all spatial scales in the two basins surface runoff and sediment transport processes played a dominant role in tp transport to streams e g kleinman et al 2000 preedy et al 2001 michaud and laverdiere 2004 the very different dtw distances between flow rate and tp indicated that a considerable proportion of the tp load was caused by heavy rainfall events furthermore the tp amount added to the runoff was significantly different for various underlying surface conditions i e soil land use and slope danz et al 2013 the simulated and measured results of flow rates and anps pollution loads in sub basin with various order streams are presented in table 4 mean values of flow rates and anps pollution loads were generally stable across spatial scales however the standard deviations of the flow rates and anps pollution loads decreased with increasing spatial scale in both the basins at each spatial scale the relative changes in dtw distances of the original and standardized anps pollution loads time series were within 10 table 3 this result was attributed to the centralized distributions of anps pollution loads during moderate and heavy rainfall events 20 mm at each spatial scale the ratios of nh4 n tn and tp loads during 20 mm rainfall events to the total loads were 52 4 60 2 63 1 72 8 and 60 4 75 2 in the qujiang river basin respectively for the fujiang basin the corresponding ranges were 44 6 52 4 58 9 67 4 and 55 1 65 5 respectively during rainfall events the anps pollution loads were primarily from the surface runoff meaning that only a small portion percolated into groundwater and discharged into streams the pollution flux at a sub basin outlet included the pollution inflow from connected sub basins i e i sub basins and the net flux from the sub basin the contribution ratio was defined as the ratio of the pollution inflow from the i sub basin with the same dtw cluster to the flux at the sub basin outlet contribution ratios of sub basins with different order streams for nh4 n tn and tp are listed in table 5 in both basins the mean contribution ratios increased but the variation coefficients decreased with spatial scale the mean variation coefficients for nh4 n tn and tp loads were 0 482 0 415 and 0 347 respectively in the qujiang river basin and 0 176 0 179 and 0 157 respectively in the fujiang river basin the much higher variation coefficients in the qujiang river basin were attributable to anps pollution load differences between the stream and inflow tributaries during moderate and heavy rainfall events in addition rainfall impacts on anps pollution load contribution ratios became less significant at larger spatial scales as shown in table 5 the mean contribution ratios of the three anps pollution loads for sub basins smaller than the critical scale were 0 74 and 0 63 respectively in the qujiang and fujiang river basins these results indicated that the dtw clusters could be used to identify critical source areas i e the sub basin contributing the primary sediments and pollutants in the basin shore et al 2014 winchell et al 2015 3 3 determination of the critical spatial scales and identification of the dominant processes in the qujiang river basin and for the three pollutants the relative changes in dtw distances of the extreme numbers and the variation were maximized in the sub basins with the second order streams tables 2 and 3 the contribution ratios of sub basins with the second order streams were also much higher than those of the smaller sub basins table 5 therefore the sub basin with the second order streams was designated as the critical spatial scale for the ansp pollution loads in the qujiang river basin in the sub basins larger than the critical spatial scale the differences in the dtw distances of the anps pollution loads were caused mainly by the river hydrological processes i e the mixing and transformation processes in streams furthermore the time series at sub basins outlets were similar to those at the basin outlet the impacts of nh4 n tn and tp discharged into streams from various land surface processes on the anps pollution loads were less important than that from the river hydrological processes for the sub basins smaller than the critical spatial scale the anps pollution loads were primarily affected by the land surface hydrological processes i e the discharge processes from the land surface to streams with various pollution sources and pathways similarly the critical spatial scale in the fujiang river basin was the sub basin with third order streams in the basin overall land surface was the dominated influence factor in sub basins smaller than the critical spatial scale while river hydrological processes were the dominated influence factor in sub basins larger than the critical spatial scale the spatial distributions of the dtw distance clusters of flow rate and loads of nh4 n tn and tp are shown in fig 6 for the qujiang river basin in the river basin the dtw distance clusters for the flow rate were consistent with the stream orders figs 2 and 6 for all anps pollution loads the regions within the first dtw cluster were in the first order stream sub basin the regions within the second and third dtw distance clusters of the loads were in the sub basins with the second order streams for the nh4 n and tn loads the dtw distances spatial distributions were similar to those of the flow rates the regions within the fifth dtw distance cluster were primarily in the sub basins with the fifth order streams while the regions within the fourth dtw distance cluster were mainly in the sub basins with third and fourth orders streams the soil tp content in the regions within the fourth dtw distance cluster was higher than that in the fifth dtw distance cluster figs 2 and 6 in the fujiang river basin figs 3 and 7 the spatial distributions of the dtw distance clusters were similar to those of the flow rates however the spatial patterns of the dtw distance clusters of the anps pollution loads were quite different from those of the flow rates for the anps pollution loads the regions within the first and second dtw clusters were in the sub basins with the first and second order streams the regions within the third dtw cluster of the loads were in the areas with agricultural land use and gentle slopes in the regions within the fourth dtw cluster of the nh4 n load 24 5 78 4 of the total area was the agricultural land while the regions within the fifth dtw cluster of the nh4 n load were largely forest the soil tp content in the fifth dtw distance cluster regions was higher than that in the fourth cluster similarly the organic matter content within the fifth dtw distance cluster regions of tn was much higher than that within the fourth cluster the results were consistent with chen et al 2019 showing that the impact of soil physical and chemical properties on anps pollution loads decreased with the increasing spatial scale in the qujiang river basin the spatial distributions of dtw distances of tn during the wet seasons were similar to those during all seasons fig 6e and c however dtw distributions during the dry seasons were different from those during all seasons fig 6f and c the dtw distances for the nh4 n tn and tp loads during the wet seasons accounted for 70 4 74 8 and 80 4 respectively of the total dtw distances during all seasons the number of sub basins with the same cluster of the tn i e the third cluster in the dry seasons was much higher than that in the wet seasons fig 6e and f as indicated by zhu et al 2019 baseflow was the main way of nonpoint source n movement during the dry seasons in the fujiang river basin the dtw distances for the nh4 n tn and tp loads during the wet seasons accounted for 58 4 66 2 and 64 5 respectively of the total dtw distances the spatial distributions of dtw distances of tn during the wet and dry seasons were not similar to the total dtw distance fig 7c e and f these results indicated that rainfall events were the dominant influence on the anps pollution loads in the qujiang river basin while the underlying surface conditions dominated in the fujiang river basin in the sub basins smaller than the critical scale the contribution ratios of the sub basins within the same dtw cluster were much higher in the qujiang river basin than in the fujiang river basin the anps pollution loads were primarily from the regions sensitive to rainfall events in the qujiang river basin soil nutrients in the qujiang river basin were also higher than those in the fujiang river basin figs 2 and 3 and the two basins exhibited similar land use proportions table s2 however the increases of the anps pollution loads in the qujiang river basin were significantly lower than those of flow rate i e 2 11 11 7 and 1 4 for the nh4 n tn and tp loads respectively and 32 3 for flow rate moreover because anps pollution loads in the qujiang and fujiang river basins largely originated from regions sensitive to rainfall events and entire areas respectively the differences in relative dtw distances changes of anps pollution loads increased with the increasing spatial scale in the qujiang river basin spatial distributions of anps pollution loads were highly similar to those of flow rate impact of the land surface hydrological process on anps pollution loads decreased with increasing spatial scale therefore anps pollution load estimation accuracy might not be affected by the spatial scale which was similar to the anps pollution results predicted in riparian areas by tran et al 2010 and shi et al 2017 in the fujiang river basin the underlying surface was the dominant factor on anps pollution loads the effects of underlying surface conditions pollution sources and hydrological processes on the anps pollution loads became more profound with increased spatial scale therefore anps pollution load estimation accuracy decreased with spatial scale as also found by meneses et al 2015 and ding et al 2016 4 conclusions using the concept of dtw distance a method was developed to characterize the differences in variation information content and similarity among time series of flow rate and anps pollution i e nh4 n tn and tp loads at various sub basin scales time series of flow rate and anps pollution loads in the qujiang and fujiang river basins were generated with swat which was calibrated using the data measured in the basins the critical spatial scale of a basin was defined as the scale at which relative changes of dtw distances of extreme numbers and variation reached the maximum and the contribution ratio of sub basins to the basin was the highest in the sub basins smaller than the critical spatial scale the anps pollution loads were primarily affected by the land surface hydrological processes in the sub basins larger than the critical spatial scale the anps pollution loads were mainly affected by the river hydrological processes the spatial and temporal distributions and the dominant processes affecting anps pollution loads were also determined in the qujiang river basin the hydrological processes and the related land use as well as soil chemical content were the most influential factors in the fujiang river basin the most influential factors were agricultural land hydrological processes and chemical content declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
