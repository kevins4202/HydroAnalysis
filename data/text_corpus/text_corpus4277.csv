21385,cyclic lateral loading on a monopile in windfarms has been found to cause bed subsidence and convective motions of sediment particles around its foundations these soil deformations may affect the bearing capacity of the foundation and safety of the structure this paper presents a 2 dimensional 2d experimental study on the temporal evolution of bed subsidence and sediment convective area around vibrating monopiles the experiments were carried out in a sandbox with a transparent front wall through which the temporal development of soil deformations around the vibrating monopile can be observed and recorded by using a high definition web camera the characteristics of the soil subsidence and convective cells are examined with the recorded images and the influence of the applied force and cyclic loading frequency on the soil deformation process are discussed the experimental data show that increasing either the force or loading frequency can increase both the temporal development rates and the final size of the subsided bed and convective cells empirical equations for depicting the temporal evolution of the subsidence depth and width around monopile foundations are proposed keywords offshore wind turbines owts monopile foundations temporal development subsidence convective cells cyclic lateral loading 1 introduction the construction of offshore wind turbines owts has significantly increased across the world over the past few decades due to the increasing demand for renewable energy amongst all the foundation types of owts the monopile foundation is the most commonly used type which accounts for 79 of all owts in the european offshore wind industry esteban et al 2015 offshore wind turbines usually experience large numbers of lateral cyclic vibrations in the order of 107 108 in their service lifetime due to recurrence cyclic loading such as those induced by winds and waves in the complex marine environments yu et al 2015 the pile soil interaction under cyclic loading has been widely investigated with physical modellings reese et al 1974 moss et al 1998 rosquo et al 2007 liao et al 2018 and numerical simulations achmus et al 2007 kuo et al 2011 depina et al 2015 these studies have mainly focused on the structural response of the monopile foundation under cyclic loading few studies have hitherto investigated the deformations of the soil layers and sand particle motions around the monopile soil subsidence around a monopile foundation under cyclic lateral loading has been observed both in the field brown et al 1988 and in the experiments cuéllar et al 2009 these relevant studies are found to have mainly focused on the equilibrium state of soil deformations around the vibrating monopile to the authors knowledge very few studies have reported the detailed formation process of the soil subsidence so far cuéllar et al 2009 experimentally studied the continuous sediment particle motion around a horizontally vibrating monopile in their model study evidence of particle movement was found after excavating the soil at the end of the test as shown in fig 1 the boundary of the sediment motion region called convective cell in jaeger et al 1996 was delineated by an apparent transition band however the temporal development of the convective cell was neither presented nor discussed in their study this is probably because they cannot observe the underground particle convective motions around the cylinder foundations during the experiment the process of soil subsidence and convective motions of sediment particles around a vibrating monopile is time dependent this unsteady process may result in a gradual reduction of the bearing capacity of the monopile cuéllar et al 2012 an alteration of the natural frequency aissa et al 2018 and an increase in deflecting and rotating the monopile ma et al 2017 besides due to the time variant fluid sediment interaction guan et al 2019b hypothesized that the process of local scour at the monopile foundation also may be time dependent based on their laboratory study guan et al 2019a confirmed that when the vibration driven soil deformations co occur with scouring at a monopile foundation the temporal development rate of the scour hole and the final equilibrium scour depth can be significantly affected al hammadi and simons 2020 investigated the influence of a multi stage loading process which consisted of periodically alternating cyclically loaded and unloaded stages on the scour process at a monopile despite the growing attention on the effect of soil movements on both scour and vibrations the vibration induced soil motions especially the sand convective motions remain unclear it is therefore essential to study the temporal evolution of soil deformations around monopile foundations subjected to cyclic lateral loading the formation process of soil subsidence and sediment convective motions around monopile foundations not only can provide knowledge of the monopile soil interaction mechanism but also be used for the protection design of monopile foundations against scouring consequently the aims of this study are 1 to experimentally investigate the time evolution of soil deformations around monopile foundations subjected to cyclic lateral loading and 2 to reveal the influence of the applied force and loading frequency of cyclic loading on the development of soil subsidence and convective cells as this experimental study is a first attempt to visualize the formation process of soil deformations around the vibrating monopile the experimental conditions are simplified i e the monopile structure and soil deformations are 2 dimensional and the sediment bed is confined to dry uniform coarse sand 2 experimental set up and methods the loading and gauging system in this study contains a sandbox cyclic loading device 2d monopile model and high definition hd web camera the schematic of the system is shown in fig 2 a the tests were carried out in the sandbox that is 45 cm long 11 5 cm wide and 55 cm high the sidewalls and bottom of the sandbox are made of galvanized iron and the front wall of the sandbox is made of transparent plexiglass a rectangular monopile model which was made of aluminum alloy with a density of 2 75 g cm3 and an elastic modulus of 68 9 gpa was placed in the middle of the sandbox the monopile model is 70 cm high 10 cm long and 1 cm thick to ensure that the monopile vibration is subjected to a 2 dimensional motion the bottom of the monopile was fixed to the sandbox bottom by a pair of angle steels as shown in fig 2 c moreover two pieces of rubber strips are used to join the ends of the monopile to the wall of the sandbox to allow flexibility and thereby vibration the burial depth of the monopile was kept constant at 30 cm in all the tests the cyclic lateral loading in this study which was sinusoidal was generated by a cyclic loading device as shown in fig 2 b the loading device was installed on top of the monopile and was 40 cm above the undisturbed soil surface this device consists of two identical interlocking gears and one driving gear activated by a motor masses were fixed on the interlocking gears by using screw rods the loading frequency f hz of the cyclic loading is controlled by the output voltage u v of a regulated dc power supply which actuates the motor the actual frequency exerted on the model pile was recorded by using an accelerometer attached to the monopile the amplitude of the applied force f c can be adjusted by changing the size of masses internal diameter φ 12 mm 16 mm and 20 mm and corresponding screw rods more detailed of the working principle of this device can be found in nikitas et al 2016 the relationship between the calculated applied force and frequency of the cyclic loading device is shown as the blue shaded regions in fig 3 one uniform quartz sand with different colors was used as the bed material in this study the property of the sand is shown in table 1 in order to have a more explicit observation of sediment motions around the monopile foundation the bed was prepared in such a way that it comprises five layers with different colors in all the tests each sand layer was carefully leveled and compacted to ensure a quasi uniform density distribution before each test the initial layout of the sand layers with different colors is shown in fig 2 d for all the tests soil deformations around the vibrating monopile foundations were captured every 30 s by using the hd web camera with a full resolution of 1920 1080 photographic pixels that was mounted perpendicularly to the sandbox see fig 2 a after each test the dimensions of bed subsidence and convective cells over time were measured from the captured photos by image analysis the accuracy of the measurement was 0 5 mm table 2 shows the details of the experimental conditions of the tests eight in total in this paper the amplitude of the applied force and loading frequency were selected based on the capacity of the loading device fig 3 to avoid exerting excessive loads on the monopile a monotonic lateral loading test was performed the ultimate lateral capacity f u of the monopile was measured as 252 n the cyclic magnitudes were calculated as 2 2 11 3 f u preliminary tests have shown that the initial dry density of the sand bed is the main factor that affects the repeatability of the tests therefore for each test the initial dry density of the sand bed is controlled at an almost constant level as shown in table 2 all the tests were run for 30 h 3 experimental results 3 1 temporal evolution of subsidence and convective cells around monopile foundations the development pattern of soil deformations around the horizontally vibrating monopile which essentially was the same for all the tests was found to be almost symmetrical about the monopile vertical axis in this section test fc20f5 0 is used as an example to elaborate on the development process of soil deformations to quantify the morphological changes of soil deformations around the vibrating monopile the bed subsidence and convective cells with their four representative geometrical dimensions are illustrated in fig 4 and defined as follows 1 subsidence depth h which is the vertical distance between the original bed surface and the toe of the subsided slope 2 subsidence width b which is the horizontal distance from the edge of the monopile to the extreme edge of the subsidence slope 3 depth of the convective cells h which is the vertical distance between the toe of the subsided slope and the bottom of the transition band and 4 width of convective cells b which is the horizontal distance between the edge of the monopile and the inflection point of the transition band the progressive sequence of soil deformations which is shown in fig 5 a reveals how the blue sand particles surface tracer sand layer subside and are confined to the edge of the monopile immediately after the loading begins from t 0 h to t 0 7 h all the particles near the vibrating monopile are seen to move downwards leading to the formation of subsidence around the monopile as the sand subsides no particle convective motions are observed at this stage at t 0 7 h the dimension of subsidence b and h increases significantly with some particles near the edge of the monopile moving upwards and outwards this phenomenon signifies that the sand convective motions have begun from t 0 7 h to t 2 5 h ratcheting movements of the sand particles are clearly observed within the convective cells at this juncture the convective cells expand outward from the edge of the monopile at t 2 5 h fig 5 a shows the formation of a heart shaped convective region that contains a discernible mixture of red yellow and blue particles at t 7 h the black particles in the deeper layer 2 4 cm from the initial undisturbed bed surface are subsumed into the convective motions at the end of the test t 30 h the symmetrical convective cells on both sides of the monopile reach a quasi equilibrium state within the convective regions that are marked by an obvious transition band a heterogeneous mixture of red yellow blue and black sand particles can be observed this final quasi equilibrium pattern is consistent with the observation in cuéllar et al 2012 and zorzi et al 2017 to better illustrate the above soil deformations around the monopile foundation the corresponding video s1 that shows the entire process is provided as supplementary information it is also observed that when t 2 30 h the trajectories of particle motions within the convective cells resemble quasi closed loops on both sides of the vibrating monopile the schematic of the particle trajectories is illustrated on the left side of the monopile in fig 4 based on the experimental observation the highest flow velocity of sand particles occurs at the interface between the bed surface and monopile supplementary data related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2020 107893 the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 fig 5 b 5 e show the temporal evolution of soil deformations around the vibrating monopile the figures show that the depth and width of the subsided hole increase significantly at the beginning of the test before reaching their respective equilibrium states with decreasing development rates the data indicate that almost 50 of the subsidence depth h and width b are reached in the first hour the exponential like trends of the curves are similar to those in the 3 dimensional experiments of wei et al 2018 guan et al 2019a c fig 5 d and e show the temporal evolutions of h and b since no distinct sand convective motions are present at the beginning of the test the data in the first hour are absent in fig 5 d and e the temporal development of h exhibits a similar trend as h however the final magnitude of h is approximately 4 24 1 41 3 01 times larger than h at t 30 h the developing curve of b however is different from those of h b and h specifically b experiences a large increase in the first 8 h before increasing with an almost constant rate in the next 22 h it is evident that b has not reached its equilibrium stage due to the insufficient loading time as indicated in cuéllar et al 2012 and guan et al 2019a the periodical gap openings between the vibrating monopile and soil bed are found to be the cause of the ratcheting convection and soil densification these two phenomena co exist but occur at different time scales the soil densification ceases when the maximum soil density around the vibrating monopile is reached while the ratcheting motion of the sediment particles remains as long as the cyclic lateral loading continues this explains why the convective cells are still developing after the subsidence has reached its equilibrium 3 2 effects of force and loading frequency fig 6 shows the temporal evolution of soil deformations for the tests with different applied forces the tests used for the comparison have a similar loading frequency 6 hz the results show that h b h and b are significantly influenced by the applied force a larger force would basically 1 increases the developing rate of the subsidence and the convective cells at the beginning of the monopile soil interaction process and 2 results in higher values of h b h and b at the end of the tests temporal evolutions of h and b in test fc5 5f6 smallest f c 5 6 n are not shown in fig 6 c and d because no clear convective motions were observed during the test this indicates that there may be a threshold condition of monopile vibration for the occurrence of sand convective motions fig 7 shows the temporal evolution of soil deformations for the tests with different loading frequencies the tests used for the comparison have a similar force 10 n fig 7 shows that the loading frequency is also a key factor in determining the development of the subsidence and the convective cells a higher loading frequency induces a larger developing rate of soil deformations and increases the magnitudes of the depth and width of the subsidence and convective cells a careful examination reveals that figs 6 and 7 show different developing trends between the subsidence and convective cells at the end of the tests although the subsidence has already reached their quasi equilibrium values the convective cells are still growing at considerable rates the average magnitude of h h at t 30 h for all the tests is 3 22 with a variance of 0 21 such a considerable value of h h may provide important references in identifying the depth of sand convective motions if the subsidence depth around a monopile is known it also may be inferred from figs 6 and 7 that b could be the last representative dimension to reach its equilibrium magnitude the time for b to reach the equilibrium therefore can be seen as the equilibrium time for the overall soil deformations following this inference the cyclic lateral loading with either a larger force see fig 6 d or a higher frequency see fig 7 d will induce a longer equilibrium time for soil deformations around a vibrating monopile 3 3 regression analysis on temporal evolutions of depth width of subsidence subsidence of the bed sediment and the formation of the hole around monopiles may have adverse effects on both the stability and dynamic behavior of the foundation sumer and fredsøe 2002 therefore it is of great importance to quantify this process for the design of subsidence protections similar attempts can also be found in the studies on the scouring process melville and chiew 1999 qi and gao 2014 ma et al 2018 the data trends shown in fig 6 a b 7 a and 7 b suggest that exponential functions may be appropriate to describe the temporal evolution of subsidence lengths inspired by the typical exponential function of scouring process oliveto and hager 2002 cheng et al 2016 wei et al 2018 guan et al 2019c this study adopts the following functional expression to fit the data of the temporal development of the subsidence as follows 1 y y e a 1 exp c t t e n where y subsidence length h or b at any time t t e characteristic time scale that represents quasi equilibrium time for subsidence lengths t he or t be y e subsidence lengths at t e h e or b e and a c n the coefficients to be determined based on regression analysis due to insufficient experimental time none of the tests strictly has reached the final equilibrium state although their developing rates of the subsidence have become very small at the end of the tests see figs 6 and 7 in this study the quasi equilibrium time t e is defined as the time at which the increasing rate of subsidence length does not exceed 1 of the magnitude of y e in the succeeding 3 h period i e 2 d y e d t 0 01 y e 3 h based on this definition t he and t be are deduced from the data in fig 6 a b 7 a and 7 b table 3 shows the values of t he and t be and their corresponding subsidence lengths h e and b e it should be noted that the quasi equilibrium time t e actually takes into account the combined effect of loading frequency and force based on the experimental data and the expression of eq 1 the temporal evolution of the depth and width of the subsidence can be deduced as follows 3a h h e 1 08 1 exp 2 51 t t h e 0 24 3b b b e 1 98 1 exp 0 69 t t b e 0 16 the coefficients of determination r 2 for eq 3a and eq 3b are 0 948 and 0 954 respectively fig 8 reveals that eq 3 is accurate in depicting the temporal evolution of soil subsidence when t approaches infinity one can infer from eqs 3a and 3b that the final equilibrium subsidence depth h max 1 08 h e and subsidence width b max 1 98 b e although this inference which is deduced from laboratory test results can provide values of the final equilibrium subsidence depth and length its reliability needs to be verified by using more data with a sufficiently longer experimental time in future studies for field applications it is still premature to predict the scope of sand deformations by using eq 3 at this stage more studies are needed in the future 4 discussion this experimental study which aims to investigate the effect of monopile vibrations in the lateral direction on the temporal evolution of sand deformation was conducted in dry sand with a small specimen consequently some differences from the actual process of sand deformation in the prototype condition are to be expected even though the general observation and physics governing the system are expected to be the same the following discussion provides an account of what these changes are the present experimental data which was measured from a small scale laboratory specimen reveal that the depth of the convective cell h can reach a depth of up to 23 of the embedded length which is 30 cm in the experiment even when the equilibrium condition is not reached see test fc30f6 in fig 6 c if this result can be directly applied to the prototype condition it would indicate a considerable dimension of the sand convective cell since the test was carried out in a 1 g condition with a small specimen we could have underestimated the geostatic stress of real soil consequently the results obtained in this study may have amplified the geometrical size of the sand deformations for simplicity water was altogether absent in the experiment if water were present the drainage through the pore of individual sand grains would play important roles in terms of how the loading rate influences the sand motions barari et al 2017 this influence is mainly due to the pore pressure build up with every vibration cycle with fine sand subjected to considerable magnitude of vibrations the transient large pore pressure will lead to a substantial reduction of the effective stresses this may enhance the mobility of sand particles and result in higher development rates as well as a larger final geometrical dimension of sand subsidence and convective cells as compared to presented in this paper moreover the sand particles located at the pile sand interface are likely to be subjected to the pumping washing effect of water which will make their motions much more complex cuéllar et al 2009 2012 found that the sand deformation around a vibrating cylinder monopile exhibits 3 dimensional 3d characteristics it is therefore inferred that the 2d experiment at least omits parts of the out of plane motions of sand around the circular pile however the similarity of the sand deformation profiles obtained in the 2d this paper and that in the 3d case cuéllar et al 2009 2012 indicates that the partial exclusion of motion in the third direction does not impact the overall behavior of the deformation process specifically the final sand deformation profile obtained from the 2d experiment is almost identical to that obtained through soil cuts in line with the loading direction in the 3d experiment of cuéllar et al 2009 2012 in summary the results of this 2d experiment could be useful for the preliminary design of the dimension of countermeasures such as riprap stones to eradicate of mitigating granular flow around a vibrating circular structure this paper has only focused on the effect of f c f and t future research could address but not limited to the following matters 1 based on the 2d experiment under multiple scales the influence of other parameters concerning the properties of pile and soil and their dimensionless forms should be explored and their respective empirical model established accordingly the scaling effect and the role of water in pile soil interaction mechanism also could be explored 2 to depict the three dimensional nature of sand deformations under a constant loading the sand deformation profiles developed in tests conducted in 3d experiments need to be measured 3 to better understand the effect of pile vibrations on the development of the scour hole scour experiments at the vibrating cylinder could be carried out the scour mechanism which includes both the development of the horseshoe vortex together with soil deformation due to sand subsidence needs to be investigated this will provide an improved understanding of the overall effect on the development of the scour hole subjected to a recurring loading of the pile finally empirical equilibrium scour depth equations at vibrating monopiles can be proposed for design 5 concluding remarks this paper presents an experimental study on the temporal evolution of soil deformations around monopile foundations subjected to cyclic lateral loading the experiments were conducted in a dry sand bed and limited to a 2 dimensional monopile the temporal development curves of soil subsidence and sediment convective cells in the vicinity of the monopile foundation were measured in all the tests the influences of the applied force and loading frequencies of cyclic lateral loading are discussed moreover exponential equations are developed for estimating the temporal variation of the subsidence depth and subsidence width the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 a heart shaped sediment convective zone around the vibrating monopile is observed and the trajectories of particle motions within the convective cells resemble quasi closed loops with an opposite sense of rotation on either side of the vibrating monopile 2 the temporal development rates of soil subsidence and convective cells are different the lowest limit of h may be computed from h 3 22h if the equilibrium value of the subsidence depth h is known 3 increasing either the force or loading frequency will increase the temporal development rate and the final geometrical dimension of the subsidence and convective cells 4 a higher force or loading frequency increases the time for the representative geometrical dimensions of soil deformations to reach their equilibrium values 5 exponential equations are able to depict the temporal evolutions of soil subsidence around vibrating monopiles under different loading conditions the conclusions of this study may be useful for hydraulic coastal and offshore engineers in the design of countermeasures against soil subsidence and sand

component 1 multimedia component 1 fig 5 b 5 e show the temporal evolution of soil deformations around the vibrating monopile the figures show that the depth and width of the subsided hole increase significantly at the beginning of the test before reaching their respective equilibrium states with decreasing development rates the data indicate that almost 50 of the subsidence depth h and width b are reached in the first hour the exponential like trends of the curves are similar to those in the 3 dimensional experiments of wei et al 2018 guan et al 2019a c fig 5 d and e show the temporal evolutions of h and b since no distinct sand convective motions are present at the beginning of the test the data in the first hour are absent in fig 5 d and e the temporal development of h exhibits a similar trend as h however the final magnitude of h is approximately 4 24 1 41 3 01 times larger than h at t 30 h the developing curve of b however is different from those of h b and h specifically b experiences a large increase in the first 8 h before increasing with an almost constant rate in the next 22 h it is evident that b has not reached its equilibrium stage due to the insufficient loading time as indicated in cuéllar et al 2012 and guan et al 2019a the periodical gap openings between the vibrating monopile and soil bed are found to be the cause of the ratcheting convection and soil densification these two phenomena co exist but occur at different time scales the soil densification ceases when the maximum soil density around the vibrating monopile is reached while the ratcheting motion of the sediment particles remains as long as the cyclic lateral loading continues this explains why the convective cells are still developing after the subsidence has reached its equilibrium 3 2 effects of force and loading frequency fig 6 shows the temporal evolution of soil deformations for the tests with different applied forces the tests used for the comparison have a similar loading frequency 6 hz the results show that h b h and b are significantly influenced by the applied force a larger force would basically 1 increases the developing rate of the subsidence and the convective cells at the beginning of the monopile soil interaction process and 2 results in higher values of h b h and b at the end of the tests temporal evolutions of h and b in test fc5 5f6 smallest f c 5 6 n are not shown in fig 6 c and d because no clear convective motions were observed during the test this indicates that there may be a threshold condition of monopile vibration for the occurrence of sand convective motions fig 7 shows the temporal evolution of soil deformations for the tests with different loading frequencies the tests used for the comparison have a similar force 10 n fig 7 shows that the loading frequency is also a key factor in determining the development of the subsidence and the convective cells a higher loading frequency induces a larger developing rate of soil deformations and increases the magnitudes of the depth and width of the subsidence and convective cells a careful examination reveals that figs 6 and 7 show different developing trends between the subsidence and convective cells at the end of the tests although the subsidence has already reached their quasi equilibrium values the convective cells are still growing at considerable rates the average magnitude of h h at t 30 h for all the tests is 3 22 with a variance of 0 21 such a considerable value of h h may provide important references in identifying the depth of sand convective motions if the subsidence depth around a monopile is known it also may be inferred from figs 6 and 7 that b could be the last representative dimension to reach its equilibrium magnitude the time for b to reach the equilibrium therefore can be seen as the equilibrium time for the overall soil deformations following this inference the cyclic lateral loading with either a larger force see fig 6 d or a higher frequency see fig 7 d will induce a longer equilibrium time for soil deformations around a vibrating monopile 3 3 regression analysis on temporal evolutions of depth width of subsidence subsidence of the bed sediment and the formation of the hole around monopiles may have adverse effects on both the stability and dynamic behavior of the foundation sumer and fredsøe 2002 therefore it is of great importance to quantify this process for the design of subsidence protections similar attempts can also be found in the studies on the scouring process melville and chiew 1999 qi and gao 2014 ma et al 2018 the data trends shown in fig 6 a b 7 a and 7 b suggest that exponential functions may be appropriate to describe the temporal evolution of subsidence lengths inspired by the typical exponential function of scouring process oliveto and hager 2002 cheng et al 2016 wei et al 2018 guan et al 2019c this study adopts the following functional expression to fit the data of the temporal development of the subsidence as follows 1 y y e a 1 exp c t t e n where y subsidence length h or b at any time t t e characteristic time scale that represents quasi equilibrium time for subsidence lengths t he or t be y e subsidence lengths at t e h e or b e and a c n the coefficients to be determined based on regression analysis due to insufficient experimental time none of the tests strictly has reached the final equilibrium state although their developing rates of the subsidence have become very small at the end of the tests see figs 6 and 7 in this study the quasi equilibrium time t e is defined as the time at which the increasing rate of subsidence length does not exceed 1 of the magnitude of y e in the succeeding 3 h period i e 2 d y e d t 0 01 y e 3 h based on this definition t he and t be are deduced from the data in fig 6 a b 7 a and 7 b table 3 shows the values of t he and t be and their corresponding subsidence lengths h e and b e it should be noted that the quasi equilibrium time t e actually takes into account the combined effect of loading frequency and force based on the experimental data and the expression of eq 1 the temporal evolution of the depth and width of the subsidence can be deduced as follows 3a h h e 1 08 1 exp 2 51 t t h e 0 24 3b b b e 1 98 1 exp 0 69 t t b e 0 16 the coefficients of determination r 2 for eq 3a and eq 3b are 0 948 and 0 954 respectively fig 8 reveals that eq 3 is accurate in depicting the temporal evolution of soil subsidence when t approaches infinity one can infer from eqs 3a and 3b that the final equilibrium subsidence depth h max 1 08 h e and subsidence width b max 1 98 b e although this inference which is deduced from laboratory test results can provide values of the final equilibrium subsidence depth and length its reliability needs to be verified by using more data with a sufficiently longer experimental time in future studies for field applications it is still premature to predict the scope of sand deformations by using eq 3 at this stage more studies are needed in the future 4 discussion this experimental study which aims to investigate the effect of monopile vibrations in the lateral direction on the temporal evolution of sand deformation was conducted in dry sand with a small specimen consequently some differences from the actual process of sand deformation in the prototype condition are to be expected even though the general observation and physics governing the system are expected to be the same the following discussion provides an account of what these changes are the present experimental data which was measured from a small scale laboratory specimen reveal that the depth of the convective cell h can reach a depth of up to 23 of the embedded length which is 30 cm in the experiment even when the equilibrium condition is not reached see test fc30f6 in fig 6 c if this result can be directly applied to the prototype condition it would indicate a considerable dimension of the sand convective cell since the test was carried out in a 1 g condition with a small specimen we could have underestimated the geostatic stress of real soil consequently the results obtained in this study may have amplified the geometrical size of the sand deformations for simplicity water was altogether absent in the experiment if water were present the drainage through the pore of individual sand grains would play important roles in terms of how the loading rate influences the sand motions barari et al 2017 this influence is mainly due to the pore pressure build up with every vibration cycle with fine sand subjected to considerable magnitude of vibrations the transient large pore pressure will lead to a substantial reduction of the effective stresses this may enhance the mobility of sand particles and result in higher development rates as well as a larger final geometrical dimension of sand subsidence and convective cells as compared to presented in this paper moreover the sand particles located at the pile sand interface are likely to be subjected to the pumping washing effect of water which will make their motions much more complex cuéllar et al 2009 2012 found that the sand deformation around a vibrating cylinder monopile exhibits 3 dimensional 3d characteristics it is therefore inferred that the 2d experiment at least omits parts of the out of plane motions of sand around the circular pile however the similarity of the sand deformation profiles obtained in the 2d this paper and that in the 3d case cuéllar et al 2009 2012 indicates that the partial exclusion of motion in the third direction does not impact the overall behavior of the deformation process specifically the final sand deformation profile obtained from the 2d experiment is almost identical to that obtained through soil cuts in line with the loading direction in the 3d experiment of cuéllar et al 2009 2012 in summary the results of this 2d experiment could be useful for the preliminary design of the dimension of countermeasures such as riprap stones to eradicate of mitigating granular flow around a vibrating circular structure this paper has only focused on the effect of f c f and t future research could address but not limited to the following matters 1 based on the 2d experiment under multiple scales the influence of other parameters concerning the properties of pile and soil and their dimensionless forms should be explored and their respective empirical model established accordingly the scaling effect and the role of water in pile soil interaction mechanism also could be explored 2 to depict the three dimensional nature of sand deformations under a constant loading the sand deformation profiles developed in tests conducted in 3d experiments need to be measured 3 to better understand the effect of pile vibrations on the development of the scour hole scour experiments at the vibrating cylinder could be carried out the scour mechanism which includes both the development of the horseshoe vortex together with soil deformation due to sand subsidence needs to be investigated this will provide an improved understanding of the overall effect on the development of the scour hole subjected to a recurring loading of the pile finally empirical equilibrium scour depth equations at vibrating monopiles can be proposed for design 5 concluding remarks this paper presents an experimental study on the temporal evolution of soil deformations around monopile foundations subjected to cyclic lateral loading the experiments were conducted in a dry sand bed and limited to a 2 dimensional monopile the temporal development curves of soil subsidence and sediment convective cells in the vicinity of the monopile foundation were measured in all the tests the influences of the applied force and loading frequencies of cyclic lateral loading are discussed moreover exponential equations are developed for estimating the temporal variation of the subsidence depth and subsidence width the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 a heart shaped sediment convective zone around the vibrating monopile is observed and the trajectories of particle motions within the convective cells resemble quasi closed loops with an opposite sense of rotation on either side of the vibrating monopile 2 the temporal development rates of soil subsidence and convective cells are different the lowest limit of h may be computed from h 3 22h if the equilibrium value of the subsidence depth h is known 3 increasing either the force or loading frequency will increase the temporal development rate and the final geometrical dimension of the subsidence and convective cells 4 a higher force or loading frequency increases the time for the representative geometrical dimensions of soil deformations to reach their equilibrium values 5 exponential equations are able to depict the temporal evolutions of soil subsidence around vibrating monopiles under different loading conditions the conclusions of this study may be useful for hydraulic coastal and offshore engineers in the design of countermeasures against soil subsidence and sand convective motions at windfarm monopile foundations subjected to lateral vibrations credit authorship contribution statement jialong li investigation methodology writing original draft dawei guan

21386,a numerical model is developed to investigate the effect of the channel walls on the second order hydrodynamic characteristics of three dimensional bodies with arbitrary geometries in a wave channel based on the higher order boundary element method in the frequency domain the second order double frequency radiation and diffraction potentials are obtained explicitly in contrast to the second order wave body interaction problem in the open sea the main difficulty stems from the boundary integral equation with the supplementary contribution of the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces of the channel in the second order diffraction analysis by exploiting the free surface channel green function and the known first order scattering potential in eigenfunction expansion the rapidly convergent integrals over the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces in the near fields can be evaluated analytically numerical results for the wave interaction with a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder a fixed truncated vertical circular cylinder and a freely floating four column structure are presented and show that in comparison with the results in the open sea condition the second order hydrodynamic properties of a body in a channel are affected more seriously than the linear ones due to the side wall reflections keywords second order wave channel frequency domain method wave forces 1 introduction experiments are usually carried out in wave channels to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics of offshore structures nevertheless in comparison with the open sea condition the fluid domain in a channel is bounded with channel walls such that the scattering waves induced by structures will be reflected by the side walls and those reflected waves will interact with the structure again in view of this the results obtained from laboratory measurements sometimes exhibit large scatter comparing with the results in the open sea therefore having a good understanding of how the side walls affect the results of such experiments especially for relatively large bodies is essential many papers have presented the solution of the radiation and diffraction problems for wave interacting with bodies in channels for the linear problem of the scattering of water waves by a vertical circular cylinder situated in a channel of constant depth and width two representative analytical methods eigenfunction expansion method and multipoles expansion method have been extensively developed yeung and sphaier 1989 given an analytical solution for hydrodynamic properties of a truncated vertical cylinder in a wave tank by matching an interior eigensolution under the cylinder with an exterior eigensolution and showed that hydrodynamic properties of a truncated circular cylinder in a channel are characterized by the presence of a sequence of spike responses at transverse tank resonant frequencies when the motion is symmetric about the centerline of the channel by constructing appropriate multipoles for cylinders placed symmetrically in channels linton and evans 1992 developed the scattering potential for a vertical circular cylinder they showed that large spikes occurred when the motion is antisymmetric about the centerline of the channel because of the different behavior of the multipoles for symmetric and antisymmetric problems based on a similar procedure of constructing multipoles linton and mclver 1996 derived the velocity potential for an array of n bottom mounted vertical cylinders in a channel the above cases solved the radiation and diffraction problems for the specific geometry of bodies in wave channels for structures with arbitrary cross section the problem was often solved by the boundary integral equation with applying green s second identity including a known green function hearn and liou 1991 solved the radiation and diffraction problems in channels based on a hybrid method where the rankine form of green function and eigenfunction expansion matching techniques were used a large discretization of the boundary surfaces was applied to the free surface the seabed the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces and the side walls besides the wetted surface of the structure provided that a green function satisfying the conditions over all boundary surfaces except the wetted body surface is constructed the unknowns in boundary integral equation can be reduced to velocity potentials only on the body surface obviously we can obtain such a green function namely the free surface channel green function or tank green function tgf by using the method of infinite mirror images of the singularity in the channel walls with the open sea green function however on account of the slow convergence of such green function it is usually ineffective to apply directly from the perspective of numerical computation in order to speed up the numerical evaluation of the tgf many researchers have developed various analytic techniques to calculate it kashiwagi 1991 considered the case of a tank with infinite depth and constructed the tgf by adding the tank wall effect part to the open sea green function chen 1994 presented the tgf composed of a finite series of open sea green functions and an asymptotic part represented by two single integrals whose kernels decay exponentially with the integral variable but the numerical efficiency falls down in the evaluation of the fluid kinematics of wave fields far from the body because of many more open sea green functions to be numerically computed linton 1993 derived representations for the tgf in both finite and infinite depth by using fourier series to express a source point in an unbounded fluid and modifying the fourier series coefficients to account for the free surface and bottom boundary conditions due to the slow convergence of the summation for the case of finite depth another representation eigenfunction expansion for the tgf was developed however when the distance along the channel between the source and field points is too small eigenfunction expansion converges slowly then based on this eigenfunction expansion linton 1999 derived a new representation by using the poisson summation formula and some integral transformations the numerical examinations illustrated that the convergence characteristics are excellent for values of ν h in the range 0 ν h 10 which is likely to include any value of practical interest where ω is the angular frequency of the waves g is the gravitational acceleration ν ω 2 g and h is the water depth xia 2001 did a similar treatment as chen 1994 for the tgf which is separated into three parts based on the consistent asymptotic analysis in general the above slowly convergent series are replaced by several rapidly decaying integrals which can be evaluated numerically in the above mentioned papers only the first order quantities and the second order drift loads depended on the first order wave field and body motions are presented it is well known that non linearity plays a crucial role in the design of offshore structures and some physical phenomena such as the high frequency resonant motion of floating bodies can only be modeled by including second or higher order wave loading effects based on the green function and boundary integral equation chau and eatock taylor 1992 huang and eatock taylor 1996 and malenica et al 1999 presented an analytical solution for the problem of the second order wave diffraction by a vertical cylinder a truncated cylinder and an array of vertical cylinders respectively michele and renzi 2019 presented a second order nonlinear analytical method for an array of curved oscillating plates in open sea by adopting a technique similar to the analysis of the bragg resonance mechanism it can be found that the component of the second order wave forces due to the second order potential make significant contributions to those of the second order forces hence it is important to solve the second order boundary value problems and obtain the second order potential in wave channels for considering the channel wall effects molin et al 2007 presented a semi analytical solution for a second order wave interacting with a vertical plate with no thickness in a channel they divided the fluid domain into two sub domains in either sub domain the second order velocity potential satisfying non homogeneous free surface condition can be expanded over sets of eigenfunctions that satisfy the no flow conditions at the horizontal bottom and the side walls with matching the potentials at the common boundary the resolution of the second order diffraction problem is obtained due to the vertical plate having a uniform cross section extending to the channel bottom only propagating modes for the first order problems are included in their study however if we want to study the effects of side walls on a three dimensional body of arbitrary geometry in a channel both propagating and non propagating modes should be taken into account for an array of oscillating wave flaps with finite thickness in a channel michele et al 2018 developed a weakly nonlinear theory on the natural modes resonance of the structure and evaluated the nonlinear effects on the energy conversion performance of the array moreover michele et al 2019 considered the hydrodynamic interactions between an array of curved gates and weakly nonlinear waves in a semi infinite channel and presented products between the gate shape function and the second order terms that force the first harmonic at the third order based on multiple scale analysis and three timing in view of the above motivations the present study provides a detailed analysis of the second order radiation and diffraction problems for arbitrary bodies in wave channels by using the boundary element method in the frequency domain the problem is decomposed into the radiation and diffraction problems the second order radiation problems can be calculated as the same as the first order radiation problems with the double frequency free surface channel green function while for the second order diffraction problem more attention should be paid to evaluating the free surface integral the body surface integral and the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals and the present paper gives the detailed treatments for those integrals after solving the boundary integral equation the local quantities such as the hydrodynamic pressure wave elevation and wave forces due to the second order potential in the fluid can be calculated for investigate the side wall effects on the second order hydrodynamic properties of a body in a channel the present numerical method is applied to the study of second order wave interaction with a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder a fixed truncated vertical circular cylinder and a freely floating four column structure and the pressure distribution wave run up wave force magnification factor and motion amplitude to the second order are shown respectively the numerical results may help to throw some light on results measured experimentally in the wave channel used as an estimate of the results in the open sea 2 problem statement as shown in fig 1 the problem of second order interaction of monochromatic water waves with a three dimensional body of arbitrary geometry in a channel of finite water depth h and of width w is presented two cartesian coordinate systems are defined one is the earth fixed coordinate o x y z with its origin o on the mean water surface the o x z plane coinciding with the longitudinal symmetry of the channel the y axis in the transverse direction and the z axis pointing vertically upward the other is the body fixed coordinate o x y z with its origin o at the center of mass of the body when the body is at its equilibrium position the two sets of coordinate systems are parallel we assume that the incident waves propagate along the x axis the water domain is surrounded by the instantaneous free surface s f z ζ the instantaneous wetted body surface s b the horizontal bottom surface s d z h and the vertical channel walls s w y w 2 under the assumption of incompressible and inviscid fluid and irrotational flow the potential theory is adopted to study the present problem so that the flow can be described by a velocity potential φ x y z t which satisfies the laplace equation 1 2 φ x y z t 0 with the combination of the dynamic and kinematic conditions the velocity potential satisfies 2 2 φ t 2 g φ z 2 φ φ t 1 2 φ φ φ 0 on the free surface z ζ x y t where g is the acceleration of gravity and the free surface elevation is 3 ζ 1 g φ t 1 2 φ 2 z ζ as fluid particles do not penetrate body surface the body boundary condition on the instantaneous wetted body surface is 4 φ n n u where n represents the normal vector on the transient body surface and u is the velocity of the rigid body motion under the earth fixed coordinate system on the sea bottom and channel walls the no flow conditions are written as 5 φ n 0 in addition a suitable radiation boundary condition on the wave side and lee side of the channel should be imposed which requires that the scattering waves are outgoing at the far fields such that a unique solution can be determined 3 second order expansion under the assumption of the amplitudes of the incident wave and body motion small compared with a principal body dimension the velocity potential and body motion can be expanded in the form of a power series with respect to wave steepness ε k a 1 as 6 φ ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 o ε 3 ξ ε ξ 1 ε 2 ξ 2 o ε 3 a ε a 1 ε 2 a 2 o ε 3 where k is the wavenumber a the incident wave amplitude ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 the translational displacement vector and a a 1 a 2 a 3 the angular displacement vector as indicated by ogilvie 1983 under the assumption of small amplitude body motions the exact instantaneous position x and the unit normal vector n at a point on the body surface can be represented by the following transformation relationships 7 x x ξ a x x c h x x c 8 n n a n h n where x is the position vector to a point on the body surface in the body fixed coordinate system x c denotes the rotation center n is the unit normal vector pointing out of the fluid domain and the matrix h associated with the first order amplitude of body motion has the form 9 h 1 2 a 2 1 2 a 3 1 2 0 0 2 a 1 1 a 2 1 a 1 1 2 a 3 1 2 0 2 a 1 1 a 3 1 2 a 2 1 a 3 1 a 1 1 2 a 2 1 2 with the application of taylor series expansions we can derive the free surface and body surface boundary conditions at its corresponding mean positions based on the above perturbation expansion the second order potential satisfies the following boundary conditions 10 g φ 2 z 2 φ 2 t 2 1 g φ 1 t z 2 φ 1 t 2 g 2 φ 1 z 2 t φ 1 φ 1 on the mean free surface s f z 0 and 11 φ 2 n ξ 2 a 2 x x c ξ 1 a 1 x x c φ 1 h x x c ξ 1 a 1 x x c φ 1 a 1 n on the mean position of the body s b where an over dot represents the time derivative on the sea bed and channel walls the second order potential satisfies the no flux condition 12 φ 2 n 0 in the frequency domain the flow and body motions at the first order are assumed to be time harmonic with an angular frequency ω thus the second order potential φ 2 and body response ξ 2 can be separated into the double frequency and mean terms as 13 φ 2 x t re φ 2 x e 2 i ω t φ 2 x 14 ξ j 2 x t re ξ j 2 x e 2 i ω t ξ j 2 x j 1 2 6 as the mean term of the second order potential φ 2 x does not make any contribution to wave forces till the third order of ε it will not be discussed in this research we divide the second order complex velocity φ 2 into the incident φ i 2 radiation φ j 2 j 1 2 6 and diffraction φ d 2 potentials 15 φ 2 φ i 2 φ d 2 j 1 6 2 i ω ξ j 2 φ j 2 where ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 α 1 α 2 α 3 the second order incident potential can be written in the form stokes 1847 16 φ i 2 3 i ω a 2 8 cosh 2 k z h sinh 4 k h e 2 i k x for convenience let φ i 2 φ 0 2 and φ d 2 φ 7 2 therefore the boundary conditions to be satisfied by the radiation and diffraction potentials φ j 2 j 1 2 7 can be summarized as 17 φ j 2 z 4 ν φ j 2 0 j 1 2 6 q 2 x y q i 2 x y g j 7 on z 0 18 φ j 2 n n j j 1 2 6 φ 0 2 n w n j 7 on s b 19 φ j 2 n 0 j 1 2 7 on s d and s w where ν ω 2 g is the wave number in deep water q 2 x y is the free surface forcing term as 20 q 2 x y i ω 2 g φ 1 2 φ 1 z 2 ω 2 g φ 1 z i ω g φ 1 φ 1 and w is the body surface forcing term as 21 w 1 2 i ω χ 1 φ 1 α 1 i ω h x x c 1 2 χ 1

follow molin 1979 and do the same decomposition procedure as 23 φ d 2 φ d l 2 φ d f 2 where the locked potential φ d l 2 satisfies the boundary condition as follows 24 φ d l 2 z 4 ω 2 g φ d l 2 q 2 x y q i 2 x y g on z 0 25 φ d l 2 n 0 on s d and s w and an appropriate radiation condition which may not be written in a close form the free wave component φ d f 2 meets 26 φ d f 2 z 4 ω 2 g φ d f 2 0 on z 0 27 φ d f 2 n 0 on s d and s w and φ d f 2 behaves like an free outgoing wave as x 4 boundary integral equation application of the second green s theorem to the green function and the radiation and diffraction potentials with body surface condition eq 18 leads to the following fredholm integral equation 28 α φ j 2 x 0 s b g x x 0 n φ j 2 x d s s f s d s w s v g x x 0 n φ j 2 x g x x 0 φ j 2

shown in fig 2 s v x x 2 w 2 y w 2 represent the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces enclosing the body if a double frequency free surface channel green function g x x 0 2 ω satisfying the linearized free surface condition and the impermeable conditions on the channel bottom and side walls is applied the boundary integral equation can be expressed as 29 α φ j 2 x 0 s b g x x 0 2 ω n φ j

g x x 0 2 ω n φ d l 2 x g x x 0 2 ω φ d l 2 x n d s for the diffraction potential φ d 2 after the above decomposition procedure the second order radiation potentials can be calculated as the same as the first order radiation potentials with the free surface channel green function at the double frequency 2 ω however for the diffraction potential some key points require special attention in the numerical analysis of eq 30 the first one is the efficient computation of the free surface integral as the integrand is highly oscillatory and the integration must be performed from the body to the far field the second one is the accurate computation of forcing terms on the free surface and body surface integrals with the second derivatives of velocity potentials as the first order potential itself is obtained numerically the third one is the effective evaluation of the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals as the behavior of the second order diffraction potential far from the body is unknown discussion on these points will be given in the following sections 4 1 treatment of the free surface integral the accurate evaluation of the free surface integral is crucial to obtain the second order solution for the three dimensional wave body interaction problems in the open sea eatock taylor and chau 1992 divided the free surface into two regions in which the integrals are treated differently in the inner region the integral is performed numerically by discretizing the free surface into planer panels and using a quadrature formula while in the outer region the two dimensional free surface integral is evaluated as a series of the one dimensional radial line integrals in the present study the free surface in a channel is separated into three subdomains and the free surface integrals in them are treated differently as well as shown in fig 2 the inner region is denoted by ω 1 and the two rectangular outer regions are denoted by ω 2 the straight lines x x 1 are the boundaries between the inner and outer domains the inner region ω 1 is bounded by the body waterline γ b the two channel side wall waterlines γ w x 1 x x 1 y w 2 and two exterior boundaries γ v x x 1 the free surface integral in ω 1 is 31 i ω 1 ω 1 g x x 0 2 ω q 2 x y q i 2 x y g d s within this region the free surface is discretized into isoparametric surface elements and integration i ω 1 is performed numerically by applying a quadrature formula as indicated by chau 1989 and teng 1995 the above integral includes the second derivative of velocity potential the order of which can be reduced by employing green s theorem after that it is possible to express the integral containing only the first order derivative plus three line integrals taken along the boundary of ω 1 additionally when the source point x 0 and field point x are close to each other the integrands of the above integrals become singular in order to remove the higher order singularities the free surface integral in the inner region is finally written as 32 i ω 1 i ω 2 g ω 1 g x x 0 2 ω 6 ν 2 k 2 φ i 1 φ s 1 3 x y φ i 1 x y φ s 1 d s i ω 2 g ω 1 g x x 0 2 ω 3 ν 2 φ s 1 φ s 1 x y φ s 1 x y φ s 1 d s i ω 2 g ω 1 x

that in spite of the fact that φ s 1 x n 0 when x is on the channel side walls the last term in eq 32 the integration on the waterline corresponding to the intersection between channel side walls and clam water surface does not equal zero because of the fact that φ s 1 x 0 n 0 when x 0 is not on the channel side walls the two outer regions ω 2 are rectangular areas and the integrals in these subdomains can be represented in the earth fixed cartesian coordinate system as 33 i ω 2 x 2 x 1 w 2 w 2 g x x 0 2 ω q 2 x y q i 2 x y g d y d x 34 i ω 2 x 1 x 2 w 2 w 2 g x x 0 2 ω q 2 x y q i 2 x y g d y d x the above integrals will be calculated analytically as the free surface integrals contain the first order velocity potential and double frequency free surface channel green function we will firstly give their expressions in the following the first order scattering potential can be expanded with its eigenfunction written as 35 φ s 1 i g a ω m n a m n 1 e λ m n x cos α n w 2 y z m k m z where m n represents the double sums over all nonnegative integers m and n a m n 1 are the first order amplitudes of each wave mode to be determined and and represent the lee side and wave side of the channel respectively k m are the roots of the corresponding dispersion equation 36 ω 2 g k m tan k m h 0 where k m m 1 is real and positive while k 0 i k and k is real and positive z m k m z is a set of vertical eigenfunctions for the linear free surface potential problem defined as 37 z m k m z cos k m z h cos k m h m 0 1 2 the eigen values α n for the transverse oscillations are defined as 38 α

transverse and longitudinal directions after some lengthy reduction the two dimensional free surface integrals can be eventually reduced to analytical solutions as see appendix a for detail derivation 45 i ω 2 x 1 x 2 i ω 2 x 1 i ω 2 x 2 46 i ω 2 x 1 x 2 i ω 2 x 2 i ω 2 x 1 where i ω 2 x is defined as 47 i ω 2 x i ω a 2 4 p q β p q x e χ p q x 0 χ p q cos α q w 2 y 0 z p κ p z 0 n p in which 48 β p

look fairly complicated the results can be obtained quickly with satisfactory accuracy some features of eqs 47 53 which may be remarked are the following firstly the arguments β p q x are the functions of the location of outer regions boundaries and independent of the coordinates of source point x 0 thus β p q x only need to be computed once for each case secondly β p q x for the wave side and lee side of the channel both consist of two terms each of which contains an exponentially decaying series thirdly in the second terms of β p q x it includes a variable σ p q m n s t which is zero for a lot of cases since c q n t are the integrals of the product of trigonometric functions with eigen values of transverse oscillations fourthly for a body symmetrical about the centerline of the channel only even modes of oscillations in transverse direction are involved in eq 48 those make the summation series converge quickly as mentioned above the arguments β p q x are exponentially decaying with respect to x therefore if the value of x is chosen large enough the contribution of the evanescent waves in β p q x is negligible if five figure precision is required for the parameters β p q we can choose x h 1 83 due to the magnitude of k m m 1 being bounded m 1 2 π k m h m π under this condition the evanescent modes in eq 48 can be neglected and eq 47 can then be written as 54 i ω

body surface integral like the free surface integral the body surface integral also contains the second derivatives of the first order velocity potential on the body surface since the first order potential itself is obtained numerically high accuracy of its second derivatives is difficult to be achieved in order to achieve reasonable accuracy stokes theorem is employed to reduce the order of the derivatives in the body surface integral in addition the green function and its derivatives behave in singularity as the field point x approaches the source point x 0 after removing the higher order singularities in the body surface integral the body surface integral is finally expressed as teng 1995 56 i b s b g x x 0 2 ω w n d s 1 2 s b g x x 0 2 ω i ω α 1 χ 1 2 i ω h x x c n α 1 φ 1 x 0

potential is substituted by the first derivatives of velocity potential and green function 4 3 treatment of the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals another important integral in the boundary integral eq 30 is the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals written as 57 i v h 0 w 2 w 2 g x x 0 2 ω x φ d l 2 x g x x 0 2 ω φ d l 2 x x d y d z x x 2 for three dimensional wave body interaction problems in open sea molin 1979 has derived the asymptotic form of the locked waves φ d l 2 and proved that the integral at infinity is an order of o r 1 with respect to the horizontal distance r by exploiting the theorem of stationary phase as r goes to infinity the integral over the far field oscillates towards zero such that it will make no contribution to the second order solution in the open sea however in a channel the scattering waves propagate in a state way to the far field at x it means the integrations over the far field vertical planes will not decay to zero in order to evaluate the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals 57 one possible way is firstly to get the locked potential φ d l 2 x molin et al 2007 have presented both the free wave potential and the locked potential analytically for a second order incident wave interaction with a vertical plate in a wave channel where non propagating modes for the first order scattering potential are excluded for convenience we assume that the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces are located far away from the body in the present study such that the evanescent waves for the first order scattering potential can be neglected thus the locked potential can be expressed as the same in molin et al 2007 58 φ d l 2 i ω a 2 2 n h n a 0 n 1 e i k λ 0 n x cos α n w 2 y z 0 h n z i ω a 2

when m and n both are less than j or larger equal than j such that the vertical eigenfunctions z 0 could be complex therefore unlike φ 1 φ i 2 and φ d f 2 the locked potential φ d l 2 will not decay to zero as the water depth increases with substitution of the locked potential and the double frequency free surface channel green function in eigenfunction expansion into eq 57 and neglecting the evanescent modes the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals can finally be written as see appendix b for detail derivation 65 i v x 2 i ω a 2 4 z 0 κ z 0 n 0 p γ p x 2 e χ 0 p x 0 χ 0 p cos α p w 2 y 0 for the wave side and lee side of the channel where the arguments γ p which are similar to β 0 q given in eq 55 only depend on the locations of the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces 66 γ p x 2 i k λ 0 p χ 0 p e i k λ 0 p χ 0 p x 2 a 0 p 1 h p z κ h p m n λ 0 m λ 0 n χ 0 p e λ 0 m λ 0 n χ 0 p x 2 a 0 m 1 a 0 n 1 λ p m n λ p m n is defined as 67 λ p m n c p m n e m n z κ e n c p m

dissatisfies the homogeneous free surface condition for a channel with a width w if the relative wave number k w is in the range of p 1 π p π there will be p p 1 propagating wave modes to be generated in the wave channel consequently from eq 66 we can see that no matter how far away from the body the incident wave p reflected and p transmitted propagating waves will give contributions to the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals at the wave and lee sides again eq 66 is a very complex expression but it is unnecessary to calculate it the reason is presented in section 4 4 4 4 integral equation for determining the velocity potential further derivation of the integrals over the free surface in the outer regions and up wave and down wave vertical surfaces is given in this section in the above analysis the integration over the control boundary is divided into the integration in the near field surround the body i ω 1 the integrations in the far fields i ω 2 x 1 x 2 and the integrations over the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces i v x 2 thus the integral eq 30 can be written as 69 α φ d 2 x 0 s b g x x 0 2 ω n φ d 2 x d s s b g x x 0 2 ω φ i 2 n w n d s i ω 1 i ω 2 x 1 i ω 2 x 2 i ω 2 x 1 i ω 2 x 2 i v x 2 i v x 2 it can be seen that the boundary integral eq 69 is associated with two groups of coordinate parameters x 1 and x 2 x 1 the right and left boundaries of the inner subdomain can be selected arbitrarily but x 2 the outsides of the outer subdomains should be large enough to let the evanescent modes of the first order potential to be small enough to be neglected for a large x 2 after some calculation we found the relationships 70 μ 0 q 0 i k λ 0 q χ 0 q h q z κ h q 71 σ 0 q 0 n 0 t λ 0 n λ 0 t χ 0 q λ q n t such that 72 β 0 q x 2 γ q x 2 thus i ω 2 x 2 and i v x 2 will cancel each other 73 i ω 2 x 2 i v x 2 0 with application of eq 73 the boundary integral eq 69 can be simplified as 74 α φ d 2 x 0 s b g x x 0 2 ω n φ d 2 x d s s b g x x 0 2 ω φ i 2 n w n d s i ω 1 i ω 2 x 1 i ω 2 x 1 theoretically speaking the locations of the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces could be arbitrary and the same solution will exist irrespective of the value of x 2 it can be seen that the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals are reduced and the free surface integral is substituted by a definite integration i ω 1 in a small area surround the body which can be computed by a numerical method and analytical functions i ω 2 x 1 when calculating the boundary integral eq 74 one only needs to determine the boundaries x x 1 between the inner and outer domains if the value of x 1 is chosen to be close to the principal dimension of the structure along the longitudinal direction of the channel the calculation domain of the inner region of the free surface would be small such that the numerical part i ω 1 can be obtained quickly with less discretized elements at this moment most of the evanescent waves cannot be neglected at x x 1 so that the analytical part i ω 2 x 1 will include the more non propagating modes and the calculation efficiency of i ω 2 x 1 will decrease if the value of x 1 is chosen to be large the situation will be reversed therefore an appropriate selection of the value of x 1 is important to balance the calculation efficiency of the free surface integral and save computing time actually the integrals i ω 2 x 1 are the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals corresponding to those control surfaces located at x x 1 although we do not evaluate the locked potential in the vicinity of the body we can obtain the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals in the near fields by this indirect method moreover although the evanescent waves are neglected in the derivation of the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals the integrals i ω 2 x 1 retain the occurrence of all modes shown in eq 47 hence the present model can accurately simulate the wave field in the numerical evaluation of eqs 29 and 74 the body surface s b and free surface in the inner region s ω 1 are divided into a number of 6 node quadratic triangular elements or 8 node quadratic quadrilateral elements which are used for modeling both geometry and potentials the body waterline γ b the two channel side wall waterlines γ w and two exterior boundaries γ v are discretized by quadratic line elements and the resulting line integrals are obtained by 3 point gaussian adaptive quadrature then a higher order bem model is set up after solving eqs 29 and 74 the second order velocity potential on the body surface can be determined 5 free surface elevation and hydrodynamic forces once the second order velocity potential is determined the free surface elevation to the second order can be calculated explicitly by the dynamic free surface boundary condition in eq 3 the second order wave free surface elevation includes a double frequency term and a mean term as 75 ζ 2 re η 2 e 2 i ω t η m we divide the total second order complex wave elevation η 2 as 76 η 2 η 21 η 22 where η 21 represents the part of wave elevation associated with quadratic products of the first order quantities 77 η 21 1 2 g ν 2 φ 1 φ 1 1 2 φ 1 φ 1 and η 22 is the part due to the second order potential 78 η 22 2 i ω g φ 2 in the following the same notations are applied to the pressure distribution and wave forces upon using the perturbation expansion and the taylor series expansion the wave forces on a body can be obtained by directly integrating the water pressure on the mean body surface we can write the second order pressure distribution p 2 and wave forces f 2 as 79 p 2 re p 2 e 2 i ω t p m 80 f 2 re f 2 e 2 i ω t f m the same decomposition is used for pressure distribution and wave forces as 81 p 2 p 21 p 22 82 f 2 f 21 f 22 the second order wave pressure terms are given as 83 p 21 ρ 1 4 φ 1 2 i ω 2 χ 1 φ 1 1 2 g h x x c k 84 p 22 2 i ω ρ φ 2 ρ g χ 3 2 and the corresponding second order wave force terms are

86 f 22 2 i ρ ω s b φ i 2 φ d 2 n d s where x f y f is the coordinate of the center of water plane a w is the area of the water plane and k is the unit vector in the z direction if we consider the case with a fixed body the terms related to the body motion in the above equations equal zero since the second order oscillatory quantities are of the primary interest in the present study the second order steady terms η m p m and f m associated with the first order quantities are not given which can be found in many other papers e g kashiwagi 1991 linton and evans 1992 chen 1994 6 numerical results in order to investigate the effect of channel walls on the second order hydrodynamics properties the cases of wave interaction with a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder a fixed truncated vertical circular cylinder and a freely floating four column structure are considered and the pressure distribution wave run up wave force magnification factor and motion amplitude to the second order are shown respectively 6 1 wave diffraction around a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder in order to confirm the validity and accuracy of the present numerical model we firstly examined the convergence of the computation with three different meshes the first case considered here is a bottom mounted cylinder of radius a in a channel of width w 2 a 5 0 and depth h a 1 0 the cylinder is placed at the centerline of the channel so only one quarter of body surface and free surface need to be discretized based on its geometrical symmetry three meshes mesh a b and c are used in the convergence examination mesh a has n c n z 5 4 elements mesh b n c n z 6 6 elements and mesh c n c n z 7 8 elements on a quarter of the cylinder surface where n c and n z are the number of elements in the circumferential and vertical directions along the cylinder respectively the numbers of elements on the free surface per wavelength are approximately 6 8 and 10 for mesh a b and c respectively a wave with a non dimensional frequency of ν a 2 0 propagates along the x axis and this frequency k w 2 π 3 29 and the corresponding second order frequency κ w 2 π 12 73 both are not close to the transverse resonant frequencies of this channel in addition the results for the case of the same cylinder in open sea obtained on the basis of the method developed by teng 1995 are also plotted in figs 3 5 figs 3 and 4 show the depthwise distributions of the second order pressures on the downstream θ 0 and upstream θ 180 of the cylinder respectively it can be seen that for p 21 the curves from the three different meshes are hardly distinguishable while for p 22 the results from mesh b and c are almost coincident with each other but near the free surface some discrepancies can be observed between the results from mesh a and b or c it can be concluded that the computation with mesh c is convergent for that case accordingly a similar mesh size to mesh c is adopted for the investigation in the following cases of the present paper the comparison shows that p 21 contributed by the quadratic products of the first order quantities has relatively small difference to that in the open sea while p 22 contributed by the second order potential is markedly different from that in the open sea and discrepancy is even greater in the vicinity of the free surface since the most of the wave motion is close to the free surface the effects of the reflected waves on the body hydrodynamics properties are more significant near the free surface for the pressure distribution at deeper position like that in the open sea the behavior of the second order pressure in a channel is also slow attenuation down to the sea bottom and the rates of decay are almost the same with the increase of depth z h p 21 will decay quickly and equals zero at sea bottom owing to the fact that φ 1 0 while p 22 will not decay to zero owing to the behavior of the locked potential φ d l 2 as mentioned in section 4 3 this could cause a lower action point of wave force and generate larger second order moment on a body with large drift the pressure p 22 may not decrease monotonically with depth so that the minimum value may not be at the bottom even though p 21 and p 22 both decrease monotonically with depth the pressure p 2 may not decrease monotonically as well because of the phase difference between them since p 22 is larger than p 21 for estimation of the second order wave forces under these particular conditions it is essential to include the contribution of p 22 in the analysis of the second order oscillatory force fig 5 is the second order wave elevation run up around the circular cylinder as a function of the azimuthal angle θ it can be seen that the variation of the elevation along the waterline of the cylinder has a trend similar to the one in the open sea the maximum elevation occurs neither at the up wave side nor the down wave side of the cylinder 6 2 wave diffraction around a truncated vertical circular cylinder in this section we will consider the effects of the channel walls on the second order horizontal and vertical wave exciting forces acting on a truncated circular cylinder the cases of three axisymmetrical truncated cylinders with different radii 2 a w 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 but same drift d h 0 4 placed symmetrically relative to the center plane of the channel are examined the water depth is h w 1 0 in figures vertical dash lines and dot dash lines show the wavenumbers corresponding to k w 2 π n and κ w 2 π n n 1 2 at which transverse tank resonances for the first and second order problem occur respectively due to the symmetry of the flow only the symmetrical resonance modes are excited it should be noted that irregular frequencies have been removed for all the computed cases by a modified method to that by teng and li 1996 in which a full mesh is applied on the inner free surface of the body yeung and sphaier 1989 have pointed that for the linear problem in a wave channel the hydrodynamic properties of a truncated cylinder are characterized by the presence of spikes at transverse tank resonant frequencies from fig 6 it can be seen that for the second order problem spikes occur not only at the first order transverse tank resonant frequencies but also at transverse tank resonance frequencies corresponding to the second order problem but those second order resonant spikes are much smaller than those at the first order transverse tank resonant frequencies moreover the second order spiky responses are more obvious for a relatively small body and as the frequency increases those spiky responses at the second order transverse tank resonant frequencies gradually vanish for the second order vertical force it is hard to observe the second order spiky responses since the serious interference effects mainly occur in the vicinity of the free surface in order to further illustrate the side wall effects on the second order wave exciting forces fig 7 shows the second order force magnification factor f 2 f o 2 versus non dimensional wavenumber k w 2 π where f o 2 is the force on the same single cylinder in the open sea by the method proposed by teng 1995 the influence of the side walls is readily assessed by the study of the magnification factor when the factors are unity the channel walls have no confining effect compared with the linear problem e g linton and evans 1992 chen 1994 for the second order problem the variation of the magnification factor is seen to be considerable and larger peaks occur at the first order transverse tank resonant frequencies especially for relatively large body although the magnitude of the second order vertical exciting force is smaller than that of the horizontal force it is more affected by the presence of channel walls than the horizontal force for the second order horizontal force when there is only one propagating mode k w 2 π 1 0 side wall effects are small for relatively small body and for relatively large body it probably underestimates the results in the open sea when there are two or more propagating modes k w 2 π 1 0 the results in wave channels will fluctuate around the results in the open sea for the second order vertical force the results of cylinders in the wave channels probably tend to overestimate those in the open sea with the increase of the frequency the side wall effects appear to be greater especially for relatively large body this may be explained as due to the increased influence of reflections from the channel walls at short wavelengths in general both second order horizontal and vertical forces are disturbed seriously by the reflections from the channel walls 6 3 wave interaction with a four column structure in this section we consider the effects of tank wall reflections upon the hydrodynamic forces acting on a simple model of offshore structure as shown in fig 8 a floating structure comprising of four equal columns of vertical circular cylinders arranged at the corners of a square with a horizontal deck is located at the centerline of the channel the principal parameters of the structure are listed in table 1 where a is the radius of the cylinders d is the draft of the cylinders and l stands for the distance between cylinders in the present study two wave channels of same water depth h a 10 0 but different widths w l 2 0 and 4 0 are considered results for the first order problem of the same structure in a channel with width w l 4 0 but infinite depth have been studied and discussed by kashiwagi 1991 for clarity vertical dash lines and dot dash lines in figs 9 and 10 show the wavenumbers at which the first order transverse tank resonances occur for the channel of width w l 2 0 and 4 0 respectively since a wave channel two times wider presents two times as many resonances in the same frequency range the vertical dash line and dot dash line are coincide with each other at some frequencies fig 9 shows the second order forces and moment against the non dimensional wave number k a it can be seen that larger forces and moment occur near k a 0 26 it is due to the fact that the heave and pitch resonance frequencies of the structure are about k a 0 29 and k a 0 25 respectively besides in general large forces and moments occur when the incident wave frequency approaches the transverse tank resonant frequencies but at some transverse tank resonant frequencies it is hard to observe the obvious spiky responses it is probably due to the fact that the discrete frequency mesh adopted for the numerical study is not close to the transverse tank resonant frequencies although the wider tank has more resonant frequencies in the k a range of interest the difference between the wave forces on the cylinders in the wave channels and the open sea is somewhat less in non resonant frequency range furthermore for wave frequency in the ranges of k a 0 9 l λ 0 86 and 1 3 k a 1 8 1 24 l λ 1 72 where λ is wavelength the side wall effects are not great except that the frequency is near the tank resonant frequencies while for other frequency ranges the wave forces on the structure in the channels are affected obviously by side walls compared with those in open sea the reason is that when the span of columns becomes nearly equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength the free surface is expected to be strongly disturbed due to the interference effects between cylinders and channel walls especially for narrow channel the amplitudes of the second order motions in surge heave and pitch are displayed in fig 10 the behaviors of the motion amplitudes have the similar variation to those of the second order wave exciting forces 7 conclusions a numerical model is developed to investigate the effect of the channel side walls on the second order hydrodynamic forces acting on three dimensional bodies of arbitrary geometry in wave channels based on higher order boundary element method in the frequency domain the problem is decomposed into the radiation and diffraction problems the second order radiation problems can be calculated as the same as the first order radiation problems with the double frequency free surface channel green function while for the diffraction problem the evaluation of the integrations over the free surface body surface and up wave and down wave vertical surfaces should be taken much care in the second order numerical analysis the free surface is divided into an inner region and two outer regions for the integrations over the free surface in the inner region and body surface the integral transformations are applied to reduce the order of the derivatives of the first order velocity potential and remove the higher order singularities in the integrals for the integrations over the free surface in the outer regions and up wave and down wave vertical surfaces they are derived analytically by exploiting the free surface channel green function and the first order scattering potential in eigenfunction expansion after some algebra the integrals related to the outsides of outer regions cancel each other and the rapidly converging up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals in the near fields of the wave channel can be eventually evaluated explicitly the problems of wave scattering by a bottom mounted circular cylinder a fixed truncated circular cylinder and a freely floating offshore structure comprising of four columns with a horizontal deck are considered in the present paper the numerical results show that for the second order pressure due to the second order potential it is affected obviously by side walls especially in the vicinity of the free surface for the second order exciting forces the side wall reflections can cause not only larger spikes at the first order transverse tank resonance frequencies but also small spikes at the corresponding second order transverse tank resonance frequencies at last the second order forces and amplitudes for a simple model of offshore structure are displayed when the span of columns becomes nearly equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength the free surface is expected to be seriously disturbed due to the interference effects between cylinders and channel walls especially for narrow channel in general in contrast to the side wall reflection effects on the first order hydrodynamic properties much care should be taken in using laboratory measurements to predict the second order results for the open sea conditions

a integration on the outer regions of free surface in this appendix the detailed derivation for the free surface integrals in the outer regions is given firstly we divide the first order velocity φ 1 into the incident φ i 1 and scattering φ s 1 potentials as a1 φ 1 φ i 1 φ s 1 the first order incident potential φ i 1 for waves with amplitude of a propagating along the x axis is given by a2 φ i 1 i

diffraction radiation problem χ 1 φ s 1 x and φ i 1 x n on the body surface are known thus eq a9 can be computed by using a quadrature formula if the body is arranged at the center of the channel and has an axis of symmetry about x axis only transverse modes of even multiples of n exist in addition following srokosz 1980 the wave energy fluxes across the wave and lee sides of the channel should satisfy the energy conservation law thus the propagating modes of the reflection and transmission waves satisfy the following equation a10 a 00 1 2 1 a 00 1 2 j 1 j 1 k 2 α j 2 2 k a 0 j 1 2 a 0 j 1 2

eigenfunction expansion eq 40 the free surface integrals eqs 33 and 34 in the rectangular outer regions can be evaluated by integrating in the transverse and longitudinal directions after some algebra it can be expressed explicitly as eqs 45 and 46 appendix b integrations on the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces in this appendix the detailed derivation for the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals will be given in order to evaluate the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals one possible way is to get the locked potential φ d l 2 x at first thus the boundary value problem with eqs 24 and 25 should be solved where the forcing term contains the first order velocity potential at the far field x x 2 for the scattering potential the formula can be expressed as eq 35 where the evanescent wave number k m satisfies the dispersion equation with the increase of the distance along the channel the behavior of evanescent waves is exponential attenuation for the sake of simplicity we assume the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces s v are located far from the body so that the evanescent waves can be neglected and the first order scattering potential can be written as b1 φ s 1 i g a ω z 0 k z n a 0 n 1 e λ 0 n x cos α n w 2 y then after some algebra the right hand side of eq 24 can be expressed analytically b2 q 2 x y q i 2 x y g i g a 2 2 ω n 6 ν 2 2 k 2 4 i k

satisfies the laplace equation and non homogeneous free surface condition 24 with substitution of the locked potential eq b3 and the double frequency free surface channel green function in eigenfunction expansion into eq 57 and neglecting the evanescent modes the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals can be eventually computed explicitly as eq 65 
21386,a numerical model is developed to investigate the effect of the channel walls on the second order hydrodynamic characteristics of three dimensional bodies with arbitrary geometries in a wave channel based on the higher order boundary element method in the frequency domain the second order double frequency radiation and diffraction potentials are obtained explicitly in contrast to the second order wave body interaction problem in the open sea the main difficulty stems from the boundary integral equation with the supplementary contribution of the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces of the channel in the second order diffraction analysis by exploiting the free surface channel green function and the known first order scattering potential in eigenfunction expansion the rapidly convergent integrals over the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces in the near fields can be evaluated analytically numerical results for the wave interaction with a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder a fixed truncated vertical circular cylinder and a freely floating four column structure are presented and show that in comparison with the results in the open sea condition the second order hydrodynamic properties of a body in a channel are affected more seriously than the linear ones due to the side wall reflections keywords second order wave channel frequency domain method wave forces 1 introduction experiments are usually carried out in wave channels to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics of offshore structures nevertheless in comparison with the open sea condition the fluid domain in a channel is bounded with channel walls such that the scattering waves induced by structures will be reflected by the side walls and those reflected waves will interact with the structure again in view of this the results obtained from laboratory measurements sometimes exhibit large scatter comparing with the results in the open sea therefore having a good understanding of how the side walls affect the results of such experiments especially for relatively large bodies is essential many papers have presented the solution of the radiation and diffraction problems for wave interacting with bodies in channels for the linear problem of the scattering of water waves by a vertical circular cylinder situated in a channel of constant depth and width two representative analytical methods eigenfunction expansion method and multipoles expansion method have been extensively developed yeung and sphaier 1989 given an analytical solution for hydrodynamic properties of a truncated vertical cylinder in a wave tank by matching an interior eigensolution under the cylinder with an exterior eigensolution and showed that hydrodynamic properties of a truncated circular cylinder in a channel are characterized by the presence of a sequence of spike responses at transverse tank resonant frequencies when the motion is symmetric about the centerline of the channel by constructing appropriate multipoles for cylinders placed symmetrically in channels linton and evans 1992 developed the scattering potential for a vertical circular cylinder they showed that large spikes occurred when the motion is antisymmetric about the centerline of the channel because of the different behavior of the multipoles for symmetric and antisymmetric problems based on a similar procedure of constructing multipoles linton and mclver 1996 derived the velocity potential for an array of n bottom mounted vertical cylinders in a channel the above cases solved the radiation and diffraction problems for the specific geometry of bodies in wave channels for structures with arbitrary cross section the problem was often solved by the boundary integral equation with applying green s second identity including a known green function hearn and liou 1991 solved the radiation and diffraction problems in channels based on a hybrid method where the rankine form of green function and eigenfunction expansion matching techniques were used a large discretization of the boundary surfaces was applied to the free surface the seabed the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces and the side walls besides the wetted surface of the structure provided that a green function satisfying the conditions over all boundary surfaces except the wetted body surface is constructed the unknowns in boundary integral equation can be reduced to velocity potentials only on the body surface obviously we can obtain such a green function namely the free surface channel green function or tank green function tgf by using the method of infinite mirror images of the singularity in the channel walls with the open sea green function however on account of the slow convergence of such green function it is usually ineffective to apply directly from the perspective of numerical computation in order to speed up the numerical evaluation of the tgf many researchers have developed various analytic techniques to calculate it kashiwagi 1991 considered the case of a tank with infinite depth and constructed the tgf by adding the tank wall effect part to the open sea green function chen 1994 presented the tgf composed of a finite series of open sea green functions and an asymptotic part represented by two single integrals whose kernels decay exponentially with the integral variable but the numerical efficiency falls down in the evaluation of the fluid kinematics of wave fields far from the body because of many more open sea green functions to be numerically computed linton 1993 derived representations for the tgf in both finite and infinite depth by using fourier series to express a source point in an unbounded fluid and modifying the fourier series coefficients to account for the free surface and bottom boundary conditions due to the slow convergence of the summation for the case of finite depth another representation eigenfunction expansion for the tgf was developed however when the distance along the channel between the source and field points is too small eigenfunction expansion converges slowly then based on this eigenfunction expansion linton 1999 derived a new representation by using the poisson summation formula and some integral transformations the numerical examinations illustrated that the convergence characteristics are excellent for values of ν h in the range 0 ν h 10 which is likely to include any value of practical interest where ω is the angular frequency of the waves g is the gravitational acceleration ν ω 2 g and h is the water depth xia 2001 did a similar treatment as chen 1994 for the tgf which is separated into three parts based on the consistent asymptotic analysis in general the above slowly convergent series are replaced by several rapidly decaying integrals which can be evaluated numerically in the above mentioned papers only the first order quantities and the second order drift loads depended on the first order wave field and body motions are presented it is well known that non linearity plays a crucial role in the design of offshore structures and some physical phenomena such as the high frequency resonant motion of floating bodies can only be modeled by including second or higher order wave loading effects based on the green function and boundary integral equation chau and eatock taylor 1992 huang and eatock taylor 1996 and malenica et al 1999 presented an analytical solution for the problem of the second order wave diffraction by a vertical cylinder a truncated cylinder and an array of vertical cylinders respectively michele and renzi 2019 presented a second order nonlinear analytical method for an array of curved oscillating plates in open sea by adopting a technique similar to the analysis of the bragg resonance mechanism it can be found that the component of the second order wave forces due to the second order potential make significant contributions to those of the second order forces hence it is important to solve the second order boundary value problems and obtain the second order potential in wave channels for considering the channel wall effects molin et al 2007 presented a semi analytical solution for a second order wave interacting with a vertical plate with no thickness in a channel they divided the fluid domain into two sub domains in either sub domain the second order velocity potential satisfying non homogeneous free surface condition can be expanded over sets of eigenfunctions that satisfy the no flow conditions at the horizontal bottom and the side walls with matching the potentials at the common boundary the resolution of the second order diffraction problem is obtained due to the vertical plate having a uniform cross section extending to the channel bottom only propagating modes for the first order problems are included in their study however if we want to study the effects of side walls on a three dimensional body of arbitrary geometry in a channel both propagating and non propagating modes should be taken into account for an array of oscillating wave flaps with finite thickness in a channel michele et al 2018 developed a weakly nonlinear theory on the natural modes resonance of the structure and evaluated the nonlinear effects on the energy conversion performance of the array moreover michele et al 2019 considered the hydrodynamic interactions between an array of curved gates and weakly nonlinear waves in a semi infinite channel and presented products between the gate shape function and the second order terms that force the first harmonic at the third order based on multiple scale analysis and three timing in view of the above motivations the present study provides a detailed analysis of the second order radiation and diffraction problems for arbitrary bodies in wave channels by using the boundary element method in the frequency domain the problem is decomposed into the radiation and diffraction problems the second order radiation problems can be calculated as the same as the first order radiation problems with the double frequency free surface channel green function while for the second order diffraction problem more attention should be paid to evaluating the free surface integral the body surface integral and the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals and the present paper gives the detailed treatments for those integrals after solving the boundary integral equation the local quantities such as the hydrodynamic pressure wave elevation and wave forces due to the second order potential in the fluid can be calculated for investigate the side wall effects on the second order hydrodynamic properties of a body in a channel the present numerical method is applied to the study of second order wave interaction with a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder a fixed truncated vertical circular cylinder and a freely floating four column structure and the pressure distribution wave run up wave force magnification factor and motion amplitude to the second order are shown respectively the numerical results may help to throw some light on results measured experimentally in the wave channel used as an estimate of the results in the open sea 2 problem statement as shown in fig 1 the problem of second order interaction of monochromatic water waves with a three dimensional body of arbitrary geometry in a channel of finite water depth h and of width w is presented two cartesian coordinate systems are defined one is the earth fixed coordinate o x y z with its origin o on the mean water surface the o x z plane coinciding with the longitudinal symmetry of the channel the y axis in the transverse direction and the z axis pointing vertically upward the other is the body fixed coordinate o x y z with its origin o at the center of mass of the body when the body is at its equilibrium position the two sets of coordinate systems are parallel we assume that the incident waves propagate along the x axis the water domain is surrounded by the instantaneous free surface s f z ζ the instantaneous wetted body surface s b the horizontal bottom surface s d z h and the vertical channel walls s w y w 2 under the assumption of incompressible and inviscid fluid and irrotational flow the potential theory is adopted to study the present problem so that the flow can be described by a velocity potential φ x y z t which satisfies the laplace equation 1 2 φ x y z t 0 with the combination of the dynamic and kinematic conditions the velocity potential satisfies 2 2 φ t 2 g φ z 2 φ φ t 1 2 φ φ φ 0 on the free surface z ζ x y t where g is the acceleration of gravity and the free surface elevation is 3 ζ 1 g φ t 1 2 φ 2 z ζ as fluid particles do not penetrate body surface the body boundary condition on the instantaneous wetted body surface is 4 φ n n u where n represents the normal vector on the transient body surface and u is the velocity of the rigid body motion under the earth fixed coordinate system on the sea bottom and channel walls the no flow conditions are written as 5 φ n 0 in addition a suitable radiation boundary condition on the wave side and lee side of the channel should be imposed which requires that the scattering waves are outgoing at the far fields such that a unique solution can be determined 3 second order expansion under the assumption of the amplitudes of the incident wave and body motion small compared with a principal body dimension the velocity potential and body motion can be expanded in the form of a power series with respect to wave steepness ε k a 1 as 6 φ ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 o ε 3 ξ ε ξ 1 ε 2 ξ 2 o ε 3 a ε a 1 ε 2 a 2 o ε 3 where k is the wavenumber a the incident wave amplitude ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 the translational displacement vector and a a 1 a 2 a 3 the angular displacement vector as indicated by ogilvie 1983 under the assumption of small amplitude body motions the exact instantaneous position x and the unit normal vector n at a point on the body surface can be represented by the following transformation relationships 7 x x ξ a x x c h x x c 8 n n a n h n where x is the position vector to a point on the body surface in the body fixed coordinate system x c denotes the rotation center n is the unit normal vector pointing out of the fluid domain and the matrix h associated with the first order amplitude of body motion has the form 9 h 1 2 a 2 1 2 a 3 1 2 0 0 2 a 1 1 a 2 1 a 1 1 2 a 3 1 2 0 2 a 1 1 a 3 1 2 a 2 1 a 3 1 a 1 1 2 a 2 1 2 with the application of taylor series expansions we can derive the free surface and body surface boundary conditions at its corresponding mean positions based on the above perturbation expansion the second order potential satisfies the following boundary conditions 10 g φ 2 z 2 φ 2 t 2 1 g φ 1 t z 2 φ 1 t 2 g 2 φ 1 z 2 t φ 1 φ 1 on the mean free surface s f z 0 and 11 φ 2 n ξ 2 a 2 x x c ξ 1 a 1 x x c φ 1 h x x c ξ 1 a 1 x x c φ 1 a 1 n on the mean position of the body s b where an over dot represents the time derivative on the sea bed and channel walls the second order potential satisfies the no flux condition 12 φ 2 n 0 in the frequency domain the flow and body motions at the first order are assumed to be time harmonic with an angular frequency ω thus the second order potential φ 2 and body response ξ 2 can be separated into the double frequency and mean terms as 13 φ 2 x t re φ 2 x e 2 i ω t φ 2 x 14 ξ j 2 x t re ξ j 2 x e 2 i ω t ξ j 2 x j 1 2 6 as the mean term of the second order potential φ 2 x does not make any contribution to wave forces till the third order of ε it will not be discussed in this research we divide the second order complex velocity φ 2 into the incident φ i 2 radiation φ j 2 j 1 2 6 and diffraction φ d 2 potentials 15 φ 2 φ i 2 φ d 2 j 1 6 2 i ω ξ j 2 φ j 2 where ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 α 1 α 2 α 3 the second order incident potential can be written in the form stokes 1847 16 φ i 2 3 i ω a 2 8 cosh 2 k z h sinh 4 k h e 2 i k x for convenience let φ i 2 φ 0 2 and φ d 2 φ 7 2 therefore the boundary conditions to be satisfied by the radiation and diffraction potentials φ j 2 j 1 2 7 can be summarized as 17 φ j 2 z 4 ν φ j 2 0 j 1 2 6 q 2 x y q i 2 x y g j 7 on z 0 18 φ j 2 n n j j 1 2 6 φ 0 2 n w n j 7 on s b 19 φ j 2 n 0 j 1 2 7 on s d and s w where ν ω 2 g is the wave number in deep water q 2 x y is the free surface forcing term as 20 q 2 x y i ω 2 g φ 1 2 φ 1 z 2 ω 2 g φ 1 z i ω g φ 1 φ 1 and w is the body surface forcing term as 21 w 1 2 i ω χ 1 φ 1 α 1 i ω h x x c 1 2 χ 1

follow molin 1979 and do the same decomposition procedure as 23 φ d 2 φ d l 2 φ d f 2 where the locked potential φ d l 2 satisfies the boundary condition as follows 24 φ d l 2 z 4 ω 2 g φ d l 2 q 2 x y q i 2 x y g on z 0 25 φ d l 2 n 0 on s d and s w and an appropriate radiation condition which may not be written in a close form the free wave component φ d f 2 meets 26 φ d f 2 z 4 ω 2 g φ d f 2 0 on z 0 27 φ d f 2 n 0 on s d and s w and φ d f 2 behaves like an free outgoing wave as x 4 boundary integral equation application of the second green s theorem to the green function and the radiation

shown in fig 2 s v x x 2 w 2 y w 2 represent the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces enclosing the body if a double frequency free surface channel green function g x x 0 2 ω satisfying the linearized free surface condition and the impermeable conditions on the channel bottom and side walls is applied the boundary integral equation can be expressed as 29 α φ j 2 x 0 s b g x x 0 2 ω n φ j

g x x 0 2 ω n φ d l 2 x g x x 0 2 ω φ d l 2 x n d s for the diffraction potential φ d 2 after the above decomposition procedure the second order radiation potentials can be calculated as the same as the first order radiation potentials with the free surface channel green function at the double frequency 2 ω however for the diffraction potential some key points require special attention in the numerical analysis of eq 30 the first one is the efficient computation of the free surface integral as the integrand is highly oscillatory and the integration must be performed from the body to the far field the second one is the accurate computation of forcing terms on the free surface and body surface integrals with the second derivatives of velocity potentials as the first order potential itself is obtained numerically the third one is the effective evaluation of the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals as the behavior of the second order diffraction potential far from the body is unknown discussion on these points will be given in the following sections 4 1 treatment of the free surface integral the accurate evaluation of the free surface integral is crucial to obtain the second order solution for the three dimensional wave body interaction problems in the open sea eatock taylor and chau 1992 divided the free surface into two regions in which the integrals are treated differently in the inner region the integral is performed numerically by discretizing the free surface into planer panels and using a quadrature formula while in the outer region the two dimensional free surface integral is evaluated as a series of the one dimensional radial line integrals in the present study the free surface in a channel is separated into three subdomains and the free surface integrals in them are treated differently as well as shown in fig 2 the inner region is denoted by ω 1 and the two rectangular outer regions are denoted by ω 2 the straight lines x x 1 are the boundaries between the inner and outer domains the inner region ω 1 is bounded by the body waterline γ b the two channel side wall waterlines γ w x 1 x x 1 y w 2 and two exterior boundaries γ v x x 1 the free surface integral in ω 1 is 31 i ω 1 ω 1 g x x 0 2 ω q 2 x y q i 2 x y g d s within this region the free surface is discretized into isoparametric surface elements and integration i ω 1 is performed numerically by applying a quadrature formula as indicated by chau 1989 and teng 1995 the above integral includes the second derivative of velocity potential the order of which can be reduced by employing green s theorem after that it is possible to express the integral containing only the first order derivative plus three line integrals taken along the boundary of ω 1 additionally when the source point x 0 and field point x are close to each other the integrands of the above integrals become singular in order to remove the higher order singularities the free surface integral in the inner region is finally written as 32 i ω 1 i ω 2 g ω 1 g x x 0 2 ω 6 ν 2 k 2 φ i 1 φ s 1 3 x y φ i 1 x y φ s 1 d s i ω 2 g ω 1 g x x 0 2 ω 3 ν 2 φ s 1 φ s 1 x y φ s 1 x y φ s 1 d s i ω 2 g ω 1 x

w g x x 0 2 ω φ 1 x 0 φ s 1 x 0 n d s where x y is the horizontal gradient operator x y n c n cos γ and γ is the angle between the normal vector n and the horizontal plane in addition it is noteworthy that in spite of the fact that φ s 1 x n 0 when x is on the channel side walls the last term in eq 32 the integration on the waterline corresponding to the intersection between channel side walls and clam water surface does not equal zero because of the fact that φ s 1 x 0 n 0 when x 0 is not on the channel side walls the two outer regions ω 2 are rectangular areas and the integrals in these subdomains can be represented in the earth fixed cartesian coordinate system as 33 i ω 2 x 2 x 1 w 2 w 2 g x x 0 2 ω q 2 x y q i 2 x y g d y d x 34 i ω 2 x 1 x 2 w 2 w 2 g x x 0 2 ω q 2 x y q i 2 x y g d y d x the above integrals will be calculated analytically as the free surface integrals contain the first order velocity potential and double frequency free surface channel green function we will firstly give their expressions in the following the first order scattering potential can be expanded with its eigenfunction written as 35 φ s 1 i g a ω m n a m n 1 e λ m n x cos α n w 2 y z m k m z where m n represents the double sums over all nonnegative integers m and n a m n 1 are the first order amplitudes of each wave mode to be determined and and represent the lee side and wave side of the channel respectively k m are the roots of the corresponding dispersion equation 36 ω 2 g k m tan k m h 0 where k m m 1 is real and positive while k 0 i k and k is real and positive z m k m z is a set of vertical eigenfunctions for the linear free surface potential problem defined as 37 z m k m z cos k m z h cos k m h m 0 1 2 the eigen values α n for the transverse oscillations are defined as 38 α

transverse and longitudinal directions after some lengthy reduction the two dimensional free surface integrals can be eventually reduced to analytical solutions as see appendix a for detail derivation

look fairly complicated the results can be obtained quickly with satisfactory accuracy some features of eqs 47 53 which may be remarked are the following firstly the arguments β p q x are the functions of the location of outer regions boundaries and independent of the coordinates of source point x 0 thus β p q x only need to be computed once for each case secondly β p q x for the wave side and lee side of the channel both consist of two terms each of which contains an exponentially decaying series thirdly in the second terms of β p q x it includes a variable σ p q m n s t which is zero for a lot of cases since c q n t are the integrals of the product of trigonometric functions with eigen values of transverse oscillations fourthly for a body symmetrical about the centerline of the channel only even modes of oscillations in transverse direction are involved in eq 48 those make the summation series converge quickly as mentioned above the arguments β p q x are exponentially decaying with respect to x therefore if the value of x is chosen large enough the contribution of the evanescent waves in β p q x is negligible if five figure precision is required for the parameters β p q we can choose x h 1 83 due to the magnitude of k m m 1 being bounded m 1 2 π k m h m π under this condition the evanescent modes in eq 48 can be neglected and eq 47 can then be written as 54 i ω

body surface integral like the free surface integral the body surface integral also contains the second derivatives of the first order velocity potential on the body surface since the first order potential itself is obtained numerically high accuracy of its second derivatives is difficult to be achieved in order to achieve reasonable accuracy stokes theorem is employed to reduce the order of the derivatives in the body surface integral in addition the green function and its derivatives behave in singularity as the field point x approaches the source point x 0 after removing the higher order singularities in the body surface integral the body surface integral is finally expressed as teng 1995 56 i b s b g x x 0 2 ω w n d s 1 2 s b g x x 0 2 ω i ω α 1 χ 1 2 i ω h x x c n α 1 φ 1 x 0

potential is substituted by the first derivatives of velocity potential and green function 4 3 treatment of the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals another important integral in the boundary integral eq 30 is the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals written as 57 i v h 0 w 2 w 2 g x x 0 2 ω x φ d l 2 x g x x 0 2 ω φ d l 2 x x d y d z x x 2 for three dimensional wave body interaction problems in open sea molin 1979 has derived the asymptotic form of the locked waves φ d l 2 and proved that the integral at infinity is an order of o r 1 with respect to the horizontal distance r by exploiting the theorem of stationary phase as r goes to infinity the integral over the far field oscillates towards zero such that it will make no contribution to the second order solution in the open sea however in a channel the scattering waves propagate in a state way to the far field at x it means the integrations over the far field vertical planes will not decay to zero in order to evaluate the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals 57 one possible way is firstly to get the locked potential φ d l 2 x molin et al 2007 have presented both the free wave potential and the locked potential analytically for a second order incident wave interaction with a vertical plate in a wave channel where non propagating modes for the first order scattering potential are excluded for convenience we assume that the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces are located far away from the body in the present study such that the evanescent waves for the first order scattering potential can be neglected thus the locked potential can be expressed as the same in molin et al 2007 58 φ d l 2 i ω a 2 2 n h n a 0 n 1 e i k λ 0 n x cos α n w 2 y z 0 h n z i ω a 2

when m and n both are less than j or larger equal than j such that the vertical eigenfunctions z 0 could be complex therefore unlike φ 1 φ i 2 and φ d f 2 the locked potential φ d l 2 will not decay to zero as the water depth increases with substitution of the locked potential and the double frequency free surface channel green function in eigenfunction expansion into eq 57 and neglecting the evanescent modes the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals can finally be written as see appendix b for detail derivation 65 i v x 2 i ω a 2 4 z 0 κ z 0 n 0 p γ p x 2 e χ 0 p x 0 χ 0 p cos α p w 2 y 0 for the wave side and lee side of the channel where the arguments γ p which are similar to β 0 q given in eq 55 only depend on the locations of the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces 66 γ p x 2 i k λ 0 p χ 0 p e i k λ 0 p χ 0 p x 2 a 0 p 1 h p z κ h p m n λ 0 m λ 0 n χ 0 p e λ 0 m λ 0 n χ 0 p x 2 a 0 m 1 a 0 n 1 λ p m n λ p m n is defined as 67 λ p m n c p m n e m n z κ e n c p m

dissatisfies the homogeneous free surface condition for a channel with a width w if the relative wave number k w is in the range of p 1 π p π there will be p p 1 propagating wave modes to be generated in the wave channel consequently from eq 66 we can see that no matter how far away from the body the incident wave p reflected and p transmitted propagating waves will give contributions to the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals at the wave and lee sides again eq 66 is a very complex expression but it is unnecessary to calculate it the reason is presented in section 4 4 4 4 integral equation for determining the velocity potential further derivation of the integrals over the free surface in the outer regions and up wave and down wave vertical surfaces is given in this section in the above analysis the integration over the control boundary is divided into the integration in the near field surround the body i ω 1 the integrations in the far fields i ω 2 x 1 x 2 and the integrations over the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces i v x 2 thus the integral eq 30 can be written as 69 α φ d 2 x 0 s b g x x 0 2 ω n φ d 2 x d s s b g x x 0 2 ω φ i 2 n w n d s i ω 1 i ω 2 x 1 i ω 2 x 2 i ω 2 x 1 i ω 2 x 2 i v x 2 i v x 2 it can be seen that the boundary integral eq 69 is associated with two groups of coordinate parameters x 1 and x 2 x 1 the right and left boundaries of the inner subdomain can be selected arbitrarily but x 2 the outsides of the outer subdomains should be large enough to let the evanescent modes of the first order potential to be small enough to be neglected for a large x 2 after some calculation we found the relationships 70 μ 0 q 0 i k λ 0 q χ 0 q h q z κ h q 71 σ 0 q 0 n 0 t λ 0 n λ 0 t χ 0 q λ q n t such that 72 β 0 q x 2 γ q x 2 thus i ω 2 x 2 and i v x 2 will cancel each other 73 i ω 2 x 2 i v x 2 0 with application of eq 73 the boundary integral eq 69 can be simplified as 74 α φ d 2 x 0 s b g x x 0 2 ω n φ d 2 x d s s b g x x 0 2 ω φ i 2 n w n d s i ω 1 i ω 2 x 1 i ω 2 x 1 theoretically speaking the locations of the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces could be arbitrary and the same solution will exist irrespective of the value of x 2 it can be seen that the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals are reduced and the free surface integral is substituted by a definite integration i ω 1 in a small area surround the body which can be computed by a numerical method and analytical functions i ω 2 x 1 when calculating the boundary integral eq 74 one only needs to determine the boundaries x x 1 between the inner and outer domains if the value of x 1 is chosen to be close to the principal dimension of the structure along the longitudinal direction of the channel the calculation domain of the inner region of the free surface would be small such that the numerical part i ω 1 can be obtained quickly with less discretized elements at this moment most of the evanescent waves cannot be neglected at x x 1 so that the analytical part i ω 2 x 1 will include the more non propagating modes and the calculation efficiency of i ω 2 x 1 will decrease if the value of x 1 is chosen to be large the situation will be reversed therefore an appropriate selection of the value of x 1 is important to balance the calculation efficiency of the free surface integral and save computing time actually the integrals i ω 2 x 1 are the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals corresponding to those control surfaces located at x x 1 although we do not evaluate the locked potential in the vicinity of the body we can obtain the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals in the near fields by this indirect method moreover although the evanescent waves are neglected in the derivation of the up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals the integrals i ω 2 x 1 retain the occurrence of all modes shown in eq 47 hence the present model can accurately simulate the wave field in the numerical evaluation of eqs 29 and 74 the body surface s b and free surface in the inner region s ω 1 are divided into a number of 6 node quadratic triangular elements or 8 node quadratic quadrilateral elements which are used for modeling both geometry and potentials the body waterline γ b the two channel side wall waterlines γ w and two exterior boundaries γ v are discretized by quadratic line elements and the resulting line integrals are obtained by 3 point gaussian adaptive quadrature then a higher order bem model is set up after solving eqs 29 and 74 the second order velocity potential on the body surface can be determined 5 free surface elevation and hydrodynamic forces once the second order velocity potential is determined the free surface elevation to the second order can be calculated explicitly by the dynamic free surface boundary condition in eq 3 the second order wave free surface elevation includes a double frequency term and a mean term as 75 ζ 2 re η 2 e 2 i ω t η m we divide the total second order complex wave elevation η 2 as 76 η 2 η 21 η 22 where η 21 represents the part of wave elevation associated with quadratic products of the first order quantities 77 η 21 1 2 g ν 2 φ 1 φ 1 1 2 φ 1 φ 1 and η 22 is the part due to the second order potential 78 η 22 2 i ω g φ 2 in the following the same notations are applied to the pressure distribution and wave forces upon using the perturbation expansion and the taylor series expansion the wave forces on a body can be obtained by directly integrating the water pressure on the mean body surface we can write the second order pressure distribution p 2 and wave forces f 2 as 79 p 2 re p 2 e 2 i ω t p m 80 f 2 re f 2 e 2 i ω t f m the same decomposition is used for pressure distribution and wave forces as 81 p 2 p 21 p 22 82 f 2 f 21 f 22 the second order wave pressure terms are given as 83 p 21 ρ 1 4 φ 1 2 i ω 2 χ 1 φ 1 1 2 g h x x c k 84 p 22 2 i ω ρ φ 2 ρ g χ 3 2 and the corresponding second order wave force terms are

case with a fixed body the terms related to the body motion in the above equations equal zero since the second order oscillatory quantities are of the primary interest in the present study the second order steady terms η m p m and f m associated with the first order quantities are not given which can be found in many other papers e g kashiwagi 1991 linton and evans 1992 chen 1994 6 numerical results in order to investigate the effect of channel walls on the second order hydrodynamics properties the cases of wave interaction with a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder a fixed truncated vertical circular cylinder and a freely floating four column structure are considered and the pressure distribution wave run up wave force magnification factor and motion amplitude to the second order are shown respectively 6 1 wave diffraction around a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder in order to confirm the validity and accuracy of the present numerical model we firstly examined the convergence of the computation with three different meshes the first case considered here is a bottom mounted cylinder of radius a in a channel of width w 2 a 5 0 and depth h a 1 0 the cylinder is placed at the centerline of the channel so only one quarter of body surface and free surface need to be discretized based on its geometrical symmetry three meshes mesh a b and c are used in the convergence examination mesh a has n c n z 5 4 elements mesh b n c n z 6 6 elements and mesh c n c n z 7 8 elements on a quarter of the cylinder surface where n c and n z are the number of elements in the circumferential and vertical directions along the cylinder respectively the numbers of elements on the free surface per wavelength are approximately 6 8 and 10 for mesh a b and c respectively a wave with a non dimensional frequency of ν a 2 0 propagates along the x axis and this frequency k w 2 π 3 29 and the corresponding second order frequency κ w 2 π 12 73 both are not close to the transverse resonant frequencies of this channel in addition the results for the case of the same cylinder in open sea obtained on the basis of the method developed by teng 1995 are also plotted in figs 3 5 figs 3 and 4 show the depthwise distributions of the second order pressures on the downstream θ 0 and upstream θ 180 of the cylinder respectively it can be seen that for p 21 the curves from the three different meshes are hardly distinguishable while for p 22 the results from mesh b and c are almost coincident with each other but near the free surface some discrepancies can be observed between the results from mesh a and b or c it can be concluded that the computation with mesh c is convergent for that case accordingly a similar mesh size to mesh c is adopted for the investigation in the following cases of the present paper the comparison shows that p 21 contributed by the quadratic products of the first order quantities has relatively small difference to that in the open sea while p 22 contributed by the second order potential is markedly different from that in the open sea and discrepancy is even greater in the vicinity of the free surface since the most of the wave motion is close to the free surface the effects of the reflected waves on the body hydrodynamics properties are more significant near the free surface for the pressure distribution at deeper position like that in the open sea the behavior of the second order pressure in a channel is also slow attenuation down to the sea bottom and the rates of decay are almost the same with the increase of depth z h p 21 will decay quickly and equals zero at sea bottom owing to the fact that φ 1 0 while p 22 will not decay to zero owing to the behavior of the locked potential φ d l 2 as mentioned in section 4 3 this could cause a lower action point of wave force and generate larger second order moment on a body with large drift the pressure p 22 may not decrease monotonically with depth so that the minimum value may not be at the bottom even though p 21 and p 22 both decrease monotonically with depth the pressure p 2 may not decrease monotonically as well because of the phase difference between them since p 22 is larger than p 21 for estimation of the second order wave forces under these particular conditions it is essential to include the contribution of p 22 in the analysis of the second order oscillatory force fig 5 is the second order wave elevation run up around the circular cylinder as a function of the azimuthal angle θ it can be seen that the variation of the elevation along the waterline of the cylinder has a trend similar to the one in the open sea the maximum elevation occurs neither at the up wave side nor the down wave side of the cylinder 6 2 wave diffraction around a truncated vertical circular cylinder in this section we will consider the effects of the channel walls on the second order horizontal and vertical wave exciting forces acting on a truncated circular cylinder the cases of three axisymmetrical truncated cylinders with different radii 2 a w 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 but same drift d h 0 4 placed symmetrically relative to the center plane of the channel are examined the water depth is h w 1 0 in figures vertical dash lines and dot dash lines show the wavenumbers corresponding to k w 2 π n and κ w 2 π n n 1 2 at which transverse tank resonances for the first and second order problem occur respectively due to the symmetry of the flow only the symmetrical resonance modes are excited it should be noted that irregular frequencies have been removed for all the computed cases by a modified method to that by teng and li 1996 in which a full mesh is applied on the inner free surface of the body yeung and sphaier 1989 have pointed that for the linear problem in a wave channel the hydrodynamic properties of a truncated cylinder are characterized by the presence of spikes at transverse tank resonant frequencies from fig 6 it can be seen that for the second order problem spikes occur not only at the first order transverse tank resonant frequencies but also at transverse tank resonance frequencies corresponding to the second order problem but those second order resonant spikes are much smaller than those at the first order transverse tank resonant frequencies moreover the second order spiky responses are more obvious for a relatively small body and as the frequency increases those spiky responses at the second order transverse tank resonant frequencies gradually vanish for the second order vertical force it is hard to observe the second order spiky responses since the serious interference effects mainly occur in the vicinity of the free surface in order to further illustrate the side wall effects on the second order wave exciting forces fig 7 shows the second order force magnification factor f 2 f o 2 versus non dimensional wavenumber k w 2 π where f o 2 is the force on the same single cylinder in the open sea by the method proposed by teng 1995 the influence of the side walls is readily assessed by the study of the magnification factor when the factors are unity the channel walls have no confining effect compared with the linear problem e g linton and evans 1992 chen 1994 for the second order problem the variation of the magnification factor is seen to be considerable and larger peaks occur at the first order transverse tank resonant frequencies especially for relatively large body although the magnitude of the second order vertical exciting force is smaller than that of the horizontal force it is more affected by the presence of channel walls than the horizontal force for the second order horizontal force when there is only one propagating mode k w 2 π 1 0 side wall effects are small for relatively small body and for relatively large body it probably underestimates the results in the open sea when there are two or more propagating modes k w 2 π 1 0 the results in wave channels will fluctuate around the results in the open sea for the second order vertical force the results of cylinders in the wave channels probably tend to overestimate those in the open sea with the increase of the frequency the side wall effects appear to be greater especially for relatively large body this may be explained as due to the increased influence of reflections from the channel walls at short wavelengths in general both second order horizontal and vertical forces are disturbed seriously by the reflections from the channel walls 6 3 wave interaction with a four column structure in this section we consider the effects of tank wall reflections upon the hydrodynamic forces acting on a simple model of offshore structure as shown in fig 8 a floating structure comprising of four equal columns of vertical circular cylinders arranged at the corners of a square with a horizontal deck is located at the centerline of the channel the principal parameters of the structure are listed in table 1 where a is the radius of the cylinders d is the draft of the cylinders and l stands for the distance between cylinders in the present study two wave channels of same water depth h a 10 0 but different widths w l 2 0 and 4 0 are considered results for the first order problem of the same structure in a channel with width w l 4 0 but infinite depth have been studied and discussed by kashiwagi 1991 for clarity vertical dash lines and dot dash lines in figs 9 and 10 show the wavenumbers at which the first order transverse tank resonances occur for the channel of width w l 2 0 and 4 0 respectively since a wave channel two times wider presents two times as many resonances in the same frequency range the vertical dash line and dot dash line are coincide with each other at some frequencies fig 9 shows the second order forces and moment against the non dimensional wave number k a it can be seen that larger forces and moment occur near k a 0 26 it is due to the fact that the heave and pitch resonance frequencies of the structure are about k a 0 29 and k a 0 25 respectively besides in general large forces and moments occur when the incident wave frequency approaches the transverse tank resonant frequencies but at some transverse tank resonant frequencies it is hard to observe the obvious spiky responses it is probably due to the fact that the discrete frequency mesh adopted for the numerical study is not close to the transverse tank resonant frequencies although the wider tank has more resonant frequencies in the k a range of interest the difference between the wave forces on the cylinders in the wave channels and the open sea is somewhat less in non resonant frequency range furthermore for wave frequency in the ranges of k a 0 9 l λ 0 86 and 1 3 k a 1 8 1 24 l λ 1 72 where λ is wavelength the side wall effects are not great except that the frequency is near the tank resonant frequencies while for other frequency ranges the wave forces on the structure in the channels are affected obviously by side walls compared with those in open sea the reason is that when the span of columns becomes nearly equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength the free surface is expected to be strongly disturbed due to the interference effects between cylinders and channel walls especially for narrow channel the amplitudes of the second order motions in surge heave and pitch are displayed in fig 10 the behaviors of the motion amplitudes have the similar variation to those of the second order wave exciting forces 7 conclusions a numerical model is developed to investigate the effect of the channel side walls on the second order hydrodynamic forces acting on three dimensional bodies of arbitrary geometry in wave channels based on higher order boundary element method in the frequency domain the problem is decomposed into the radiation and diffraction problems the second order radiation problems can be calculated as the same as the first order radiation problems with the double frequency free surface channel green function while for the diffraction problem the evaluation of the integrations over the free surface body surface and up wave and down wave vertical surfaces should be taken much care in the second order numerical analysis the free surface is divided into an inner region and two outer regions for the integrations over the free surface in the inner region and body surface the integral transformations are applied to reduce the order of the derivatives of the first order velocity potential and remove the higher order singularities in the integrals for the integrations over the free surface in the outer regions and up wave and down wave vertical surfaces they are derived analytically by exploiting the free surface channel green function and the first order scattering potential in eigenfunction expansion after some algebra the integrals related to the outsides of outer regions cancel each other and the rapidly converging up wave and down wave vertical surface integrals in the near fields of the wave channel can be eventually evaluated explicitly the problems of wave scattering by a bottom mounted circular cylinder a fixed truncated circular cylinder and a freely floating offshore structure comprising of four columns with a horizontal deck are considered in the present paper the numerical results show that for the second order pressure due to the second order potential it is affected obviously by side walls especially in the vicinity of the free surface for the second order exciting forces the side wall reflections can cause not only larger spikes at the first order transverse tank resonance frequencies but also small spikes at the corresponding second order transverse tank resonance frequencies at last the second order forces and amplitudes for a simple model of offshore structure are displayed when the span of columns becomes nearly equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength the free surface is expected to be seriously disturbed due to the interference effects between cylinders and channel walls especially for narrow channel in general in contrast to the side wall reflection effects on the first order hydrodynamic properties much care should be taken in using laboratory measurements to predict the second order results for the open sea conditions

a integration on the outer regions of free surface in this appendix the detailed derivation for the free surface integrals in the outer regions is given firstly we divide the first order velocity φ 1

has an axis of symmetry about x axis only transverse modes of even multiples of n exist in addition following srokosz 1980 the wave energy fluxes across the wave and lee sides of the channel should satisfy the energy conservation law thus the propagating modes of the reflection and transmission waves satisfy the following equation a10 a 00 1 2 1 a 00 1 2 j 1 j 1 k 2 α j 2 2 k a 0 j 1 2 a 0 j 1 2

21387,many fishes show an excellent swimming ability by agilely oscillating their fins and the caudal fin is a main organ for a fish to propel itself this propulsion mode provides inspiration to the design of biomimetic underwater vehicles on this basis we take an oscillating fin as our study subject and build a computational fluid dynamic model by mimicking the lunate caudal fin of tuna numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the effects of the strouhal number st and reynold number re on the wake structure and hydrodynamic performance of the oscillating caudal fin navier stokes equations are used to solve the unsteady flow for the oscillating caudal fin as well as the user defined function and dynamic mesh methods are applied to realize and track the instant locomotion respectively then the validity and reliability of the numerical method are verified by experiments and convergence tests results show that the fish can obtain a larger instantaneous thrust force when the caudal fin flaps under a higher st but when its propulsive efficiency is mediocre or even worsens this situation usually occurs during the escape or hunting actions of fish meanwhile being in a turbulence flow which corresponds to a larger re is helpful for the caudal fin to obtain a relatively higher thrust force and propulsive efficiency specially a detailed analysis on the connection between the wake vortex topology kinematics and force generation of the caudal fin is performed results suggests that the wake is dominated by one or two sets of complex vortex rings which convect at different oblique angles to the wake flow centerline with various re and st the hydrodynamic performances of the caudal fin strongly depend on the flow dynamics underlying the force production including the orientation interconnection and dissipation rate of the vortex rings such as jet flows inducted by these vortex rings play a critical role in the thrust force generation for an oscillating caudal fin keywords oscillating caudal fin strouhal number reynold number hydrodynamic vortex structure 1 introduction in nature fish and other marine organisms have excellent swimming skills compared to artificial underwater vehicles such as extremely lower noise during swimming li et al 2018 and or higher swimming speed outstanding maneuverability or superior swimming efficiency as early as 1936 gray 1936 reported that the drag power experienced by a dolphin was larger than the estimated muscle power which implies that the swimming efficiency of a dolphin exceeds 100 obviously this phenomenon is not reasonable based on the conservation of energy and is termed gray s paradox further studies found that the output power of dolphin muscles is consumed in the lateral undulating of the body instead of overcoming its swimming resistance as gray considered bale et al 2014 lee et al 2009 although gray s paradox has been solved and confirms that the swimming efficiency of dolphin did not reach 100 percent aquatic animals such as dolphin have an excellent swimming ability according to these studies which inspires the design of innovative unmanned underwater vehicles then based on locomotion characteristics the fish swimming modes have been categorized by some biologists to help other researchers to rapidly understand swimming and shape features wang et al 2019 in which one classification method is based on the fin that plays a major role in the propulsion and is categorized into the mpf median and paired fins mode and bcf body and caudal fin mode an estimated 15 of fish families use non bcf modes as their routine propulsive means while a much greater number of fish families that typically rely on bcf modes for propulsion use mpf modes to maneuver and for stability lauder et al 2002 2003 videler 2012 generally fish can reach relatively higher swimming speeds and propulsive efficiencies in the bcf mode which is instructive and practical for the development efficient navigation and operation of unmanned underwater vehicles in fact the above categories blend into one another and should not be thought of as sharply distinct the kinematic and hydrodynamic performance of fish swimming have been studied through theoretical analyses numerical simulations and experimental approaches by referencing studies on microorganism movements at a low reynold number re and using relative methods in aerodynamics lighthill 1960 1970 proposed the elongated body theory ebt to investigate the fish swimming process the ebt assumes that the shape transformation of fish is smaller in its advance direction and that the lateral forces cancel each other out then the thrust force can be generated only by oscillation of the caudal fin later the ebt became widely used newman and wu 1973 newman 1973 wu 1971 and was applied to studies of the unsteady locomotor performance of fish including the swerve fast start and instantaneous stop weihs 1972 1974 katz and weihs 1979 domenici and blake 1997 meanwhile aiming to overcome the insufficiency of ebt the waving plate theory chopra 1976 and oscillating wing theory wu 1961 were successively proposed and employed to analyze the large amplitude locomotion of the caudal fin with high aspect ratios and the linear and turning swimming of fish in the bcf mode zhu et al 2002 wolfgang et al 1999 liu and bose 1997 jones et al 1997 however in the above studies limited by the computational hardware conditions at that time the potential flow theory was widely used to study the hydrodynamic performance of fish locomotion this theory had to neglect fluid viscosity and adopted simple flows whose analytical solutions were known to make up an imaginary flow field behind the fish oscillating caudal fin as a result the potential flow theory had a better calculation speed but its precision deteriorated when solving unsteady motion and complex interaction problems and even yielded unreasonable results platzer et al 2008 heathcote et al 2008 in recent years with the development of high speed parallel computation and 3d graphic display technologies the computational fluid dynamics cfd method based on the viscous flow theory has gradually been adopted by solving navier stokes n s equations in the computational domain key physical quantities such as velocity and pressure can be obtained in the flow field near a swimming fish with the cfd method then combined with flow field post treatment technology the detailed wake vortex structure of the oscillating caudal fin can be determined shi et al 2019 luo et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 ramamurti et al 2002 carling et al 1998 bottom et al 2016 borazjani 2008 experimental methods have also made progress in studies on fish swimming the conventional contact measurement method has difficulty obtaining real kinematics and hydrodynamics parameters since it affects on the natural swimming movements of experimental fishes therefore based on the tracking flow field mechanism a newly noncontact particle image velocimetry piv technique has been developed and employed to determine the real detailed flow field distribution near swimming fish with image processing and identifying techniques lauder and tytell 2005 maia et al 2017 liu et al 2017 akanyeti et al 2017 thus the reliability of mechanical results based on the potential flow theory is currently difficult to verify in contrast the scales and structure features of vortices in the wake flow field can be compared between piv measurements and simulated results based on the viscous flow theory among fishes in the bcf mode tuna can achieve a relatively higher swimming speed wardle et al 1989 katz et al 2001 and its lunate caudal fin has an excellent propulsive performance newman and wu 1975 liu and bose 1999 however the diversity of the fin morphology decides the specificity of hydrodynamic mechanism so existing analyses were not sufficient zhou et al 2016 despite all of above previous works on oscillating foils caudal fin or swimming fish they are basically independent with each other as previous numerical simulations mostly focus on force generation and propulsive efficiency meanwhile newly developed experimental method of piv is on the flow field distribution and vortex structure actually only noncontact measurement methods like piv can obtain real and natural instant motion state of swimming fish and its caudal fin while accurate imitating these motions plays a much important roles in efficient operation of bionic system therefore two steps are needed to realize above process first building the connection between vortex structure and hydrodynamic performance and second comparing vortex features coming from numerical simulations and vivo piv experiments but in current the number of studies that have systematically examined the relationships between kinematics vortex evolution and force generation underlying the variety laws of the hydrodynamic performance with kinematic parameters for the caudal fin is rare usually 2 d section of the vortex structure is widely used in most cfd simulations for the caudal fin in addition st and re can describe the movements of the caudal fin and the status of its surrounding flow filed respectively so in this paper we analyze the hydrodynamic performance and thrust force generation mechanism of the oscillating caudal fin especially their connection with structure and evolution process of the wake vortex system this paper is organized as follows we first built a numerical model of the caudal fin and subsequently verified the convergence of the algorithm meanwhile the experimental results were compared then the effects of the strouhal number st and reynold number re on the thrust force power and efficiency of the caudal fin were simulated and discussed in detail last we continually analyzed the vortex structure and evolution process of the wake topology behind the oscillating caudal fin and their connection with the hydrodynamic performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 geometric model of caudal fin a geometric model was built by using the lunate caudal fin of bluefin tuna as the prototype zhou et al 2016 xu and wan 2012 to reduce unnecessary disturbances on the flow field the model was shape smoothed using the curve fitting method the 3d model of the caudal fin and its coordinate system are shown in fig 1 where c 0 and s 0 represent the chord length and span length respectively the caudal fin model is symmetrical about the xoy and xoz planes as shown in fig 1 and the aob curve is the leading edge of the fin where point o represents the origin of the coordinate system meanwhile the a o b curve is the trailing edge and point o is an intersection between the trailing edge and the x axis to describe the geometric shape of the caudal fin a series of planes which are parallel to the xoz plane were employed to intercept the aoo a part of the model as shown in fig 1 then intersections between these parallel planes and the leading edge and the chord length of the cross sections in the part i e distance between the leading edge intersection and the trailing edge one in the cross sections are shown in table 1 where all the length values are nondimensionalized by the chord length c 0 of the caudal fin 2 2 motion model of caudal fin in the bcf swimming mode the front part of the fish body basically remains steady and only its tail part makes a periodic oscillating motion around the caudal peduncle to generate a thrust force meanwhile the relatively constant oscillating motions let the fish body maintain a steady forward velocity in their cruise but this velocity should actually be a fluctuation value around the average velocity of the fish in one oscillating period in our numerical simulations the forward velocity of the caudal fin was changed into a steady inflow velocity through coordinate transformation liu and bose 1997 1999 jones et al 1997 zhou et al 2016 borazjani 2008 which could improve the solving accuracy and efficient meanwhile it was also beneficial to compare and verify the numerical and experimental results in other words a natural process in which the caudal fin oscillates to obtain thrust force and subsequently move forward at a fluctuating speed was converted to a simulated process where the caudal fin was kept steady in the forward direction and performed periodic lateral oscillating motions to generate thrust force behind a steady inflow theoretically the above inflow velocity in numerical simulations should be equal to the average forward velocity of the caudal fin in the physical process in the coordinate system the motion model of the caudal fin in the following simulations is shown as fig 2 where v 0 is the constant inflow speed the oscillating movements of the caudal fin are decomposed into a heaving motion along the z axis and a pitching motion around the y axis where the pitching center is located at the leading edge cusp point of the caudal fin p 0 whereas z t and θ t represent the instantaneous heaving amplitude and pitching angle at time t respectively then the periodic kinematics of the caudal fin are expressed in a sinusoidal function such that 1 z t z 0 sin 2 π f t 2 θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t ϕ where z 0 and θ 0 are the maximum heaving amplitude and pitching angle respectively f is the oscillating frequency of the caudal fin and the frequencies of the heaving and pitching motions are set equal to each other ϕ is the phase difference between these two motions of the fin given the reference values of the velocity v 0 chord length and maximum heaving amplitude z 0 and frequency f the reynold number and strouhal number are defined by 3 r e v 0 c 0 ν 4 s t 2 z 0 f v 0 where ν is the water kinematic viscosity coefficient then the caudal fin must overcome the corresponding resistance from the surrounding fluid medium in its oscillating movements such as the instantaneous transverse force f z t along the z axis direction in the heaving motion and the instantaneous moment m y t around the y axis in the pitching motion simultaneously the sum of the components for the fluid reacting force in the forward direction of the caudal fin is defined as the thrust force f x t along the negative x direction and the drag along positive x direction then the nondimensional coefficients of these forces and moment can be determined by the expressions as follows 5 c x t 2 f x t ρ c 0 s 0 v 0 2 6 c z t 2 f z t ρ c 0 s 0 v 0 2 7 c m t 2 m y t ρ c 0 2 s 0 v 0 2 where c x t is the thrust force coefficient c z t is the transverse force coefficient c m t is the moment coefficient and ρ is the density of the fluid medium which is water in this work to describe the macro force of the caudal fin we define the average thrust force coefficient in one oscillating motion period of the caudal fin c t as follows 8 c t 1 t 0 t c x t d t from the aspect of energy conversion the input power p in which is transferred from the fish body to its caudal fin is consumed to overcome the transverse force f z t and moment m y t in the oscillating motions meanwhile the energy which propels the caudal fin to move forward at a certain velocity v 0 by the thrust force f x t can be defined as the useful power p u these powers can be expressed as 9 p u 1 t 0 t f x t v 0 d t 10 p i n 1 t 0 t f z t z t m y t θ t d t after nondimensionalization the corresponding input power coefficient c p is defined by 11 c p p i n ρ v 0 3 c 0 s 0 2 finally based on equations 9 11 the propulsive efficiency of the caudal fin is given as 12 η p u p i n c t v 0 t 0 t c z z t c m c 0 θ t d t c t c p 2 3 numerical method in this work the caudal fin is treated as a rigid body and set to operate in viscous and incompressible flows correspondingly the continuity equation and reynolds averaged navier stockes equation rans can be expressed by the tensor form in the cartesian coordinate system as 13 u i x i 0 14 ρ u i t x j u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s i i j 1 2 3 where u i and u j are the transient velocity components u i and u j are the fluctuating velocity components p is the transient pressure u i u j is the mean value of u i u j s i is the source item and the sum of all other force components that do not belong to the transient term convective term or diffusive term of the governing equations and μ is the dynamic viscosity in addition the subscripts i j 1 2 3 in equations 13 and 14 identify the components along the x y and z axes in the numerical simulations the scales of the computational domain are length width height 11c 0 8c 0 4c 0 the boundary conditions of the domain are set as the fluid medium velocity inlet on the left plane pressure outlet on the right plane and wall on the surfaces of the caudal fin the distance between the central point of the fin leading edge p 0 and the left inlet plane is 2c 0 in the x axis direction this point is located at the center of the domain in the y and z axes then the computational domain and corresponding boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 a at upstream boundary the inflow velocity is fixed while a pressure gradient is set to be zero at downstream boundaries zero gradient condition is imposed for both velocities and pressures on the surfaces of caudal fin no slip condition is employed for velocities the fluid field is computed on an unstructured tetrahedral mesh which are generated by gambit software to improve the solving accuracy of the simulations the partial grid is refined near the caudal fin especially near the tip locations of the leading edge and the trailing edge specifically 2d unstructured triangular meshes are generated on the surfaces of the fin as well as on the six outside boundaries and then 3d tetrahedron meshes were generated within the computational domain with local meshes clustered to the surfaces of the fin to ensure the boundary resolution adjacent to the solid surfaces the entire domain mesh scheme and grid on the surface of the caudal fin are displayed in fig 3 b with the mesh commercial cfd software fluent is employed to solve the control equations in the entire computational domain to realize caudal fin oscillating motions following equations 1 and 2 user defined functions udf are used to secondarily develop the software fluent to define the instantaneous location and status of the caudal fin in the simulations 2 4 experimental set up as previously stated it is difficult to directly measure the real thrust force of the caudal fin during experimental fish natural swimming as a result we performed a series of hydrodynamic experiments to imitate the caudal fin of tuna to verify the numerical simulation method in this work the entire experimental system is made up of the control measure and motor subsystems where the control system is responsible for translating the oscillating motion law of the caudal fin to the corresponding electrical signals and the motor system is used to execute commands from the control system to realize fin movements meanwhile the measure system obtains the instantaneous force and moment on the fin through strain sensors signal gathering and the processing device in the experiments the thrust force along the x axis transverse force along the z axis and moment around the y axis can be measured by a three component balance the sketch of the experimental installations and their connections is shown in fig 4 a specifically to realize sinusoidal oscillating process of the caudal fin nine sets shafts and gears are made up its motion mechanism fig 4 b shows a cross section view of the mechanism in which drive system connects with servo motor and is in charge of power transfer and oscillation system is designed as two joints components and used to transform the input power to pitch and heave motions of the fin the force balance is installed between the caudal fin and the drive shaft as detailed shown in fig 4 c the experiments were performed in a circulating water channel where the inflow speed was set as v 0 two streamline diversion shells which respectively contained shafts and gears of two joints was installed on the front of the caudal fin so the inflow before the fin could be treated as a uniform flow the caudal fin and its motion mechanism in the experiments are shown in fig 5 3 sensitivity and validation of numerical method before performing numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic performance of the oscillating caudal fin the mesh independency must be investigated to select the appropriate mesh density and time step which helps to improve the solving accuracy and efficiency then three different mesh schemes are introduced coarse mesh nominal mesh and fine mesh with mesh quantities of 0 4 million 0 8 million and 1 6 million respectively with these three meshes the other parameters in this simulation are for the caudal fin chord length c 0 0 1 m and span length s 0 2 0c 0 motion period t 2 s maximum pitching angle θ 0 25 phase difference between heave and pitch motions ϕ 90 steady inflow speed v 0 0 1 m s and corresponding re 1 105 so sst k ω sst turbulent model is used in simulations tseng and cheng 2015 kang et al 2013 chang et al 2012 and time step δt t 200 then the variable of the heaving amplitude is set to z 0 0 2 1 0c 0 then three criteria are adopted to determine convergence of each simulated operating condition the first one is residual criteria and the residual value of all variables should be not larger than 10 3 which follows the default settings of fluent the second one is changes of simulating results that is forces moments errors between two adjacent motion periods are no more than 1 and the third one is the conservation of mass and momentum of whole system which means the mass and momentum unbalance errors of stream in and out the system are not larger than 0 1 in addition errors ε i are given to describe the difference between the simulations as follows 15 ε i c t j c t f c t f c t k c t t 400 c t t 400 i 1 2 j c n k t 100 t 200 where ε 1 and ε 2 represent errors of numerical simulations with different mesh schemes and time steps respectively c t c c t n and c t f are the simulated average thrust force coefficient with coarse nominal and fine mesh respectively similarly c t t 100 c t t 200 and c t t 400 are that coefficient with t 100 t 200 and t 400 time step respectively then the numerical results from the above simulations with three meshes are shown in fig 6 a from fig 6 a the trends of the thrust force coefficient c t curves appear generally similar for the three meshes the thrust force coefficient monotonically increases with the increasing heaving amplitude and a larger z 0 c 0 induces a more rapid growth of c t the c t curves of the three meshes remain close when z 0 c 0 0 6 but when z 0 c 0 0 6 this situation changes the c t curve of the nominal meshes remains consistent with that of the fine meshes but that of the coarse mesh appears different from those of the other two curves more concretely the error between the results of the nominal mesh and fine mesh does not exceed 0 8 but that between the coarse mesh and fine mesh is approximately 5 and peaks at 9 37 therefore the nominal mesh can obtain a better solving accuracy while ensuring the calculation efficiency and is adopted in the following simulations then another sensitivity test is performed on the time step using the nominal mesh scheme actually the time step in the simulations decides the oscillating displacement of the caudal fin in a single time step theoretically a smaller time step is beneficial to improving the solving accuracy but too small a time step will increase the amount of calculations and subsequently impact the solving efficiency in this section three different time steps are used in the simulations δt t 100 t 200 and t 400 and the other parameters settings are identical to those for the above mesh sensitivity tests the results are shown in fig 6 b fig 6 b shows that the simulated results with δt t 200 are consistent with those with δt t 400 and the error between these two curves is approximately 1 whereas that between the curves with δt t 100 and δt t 400 reaches approximately 10 31 as a result the time step of δt t 200 is adopted in the following simulations since it can obtain a better solving accuracy and efficiency based on the above mesh scheme and time step other simulations are performed to verify the numerical method by comparison with the experimental results in the experiments the chord length of the caudal fin is c 0 0 1 m the maximum heaving amplitude is z 0 c 0 the pitching angle is θ 0 25 the phase difference between heave and pitch motions is ϕ 90 the motion frequency is f 0 5 hz and the steady inflow speed is v 0 0 33 m s then through the numerical model and method presented in this paper the instantaneous thrust force coefficient c x transverse force coefficient c z moment coefficient c m and experimental results of the oscillating caudal fin in one motion period are shown in fig 7 a c in addition numerical results from references zhang et al 2011 are provided for comparation from fig 7 in one motion cycle the thrust force coefficient c x changes twice periodically but the transverse force coefficient c z and moment coefficient c m change only once the trend of the c m curves has several peak and valley values and its change is relatively irregular the numerical results from the rans method in this work are consistent with those from the panel method from the reference and experimental measurements for c x the results in this work are closer to the experimental results at time nt n is a natural number while the panel method results are better at time n 1 2 t and are generally smaller than those of the others for c z two numerical results are consistent with the experimental results and the difference between the reference and the experimental results is smaller for c m a relatively larger difference appears between both the numerical results and experimental results but the rans curve has a closer trend to that of the experiments there are several reasons to cause experimental errors 1 although the sinusoidal motions of caudal fin can be realized by the whole mechanism as in fig 4 b a little motion delay appears in the mechanism when the phase difference ϕ 90 and at this time the caudal fin has moved to the limit position and should be parallel to the inflow however in our experiments the caudal fin will heave to the maximum amplitude first and then after a short delay it pitches to the direction of inflow which will result in its asynchronous motion and instantaneous coefficient trend differences and offset in fig 7 comparing with the numerical simulations actually this error comes from coupling effects of shafts and gears and it is hard to artificially eliminate 2 the oscillating motion of the caudal fin generates pulsating instant force on the gears which causes the driving gears loose and mesh insufficiently these changes will make an effect on the caudal fin motions and force transfer especially on moment which is the mainly reason for two results trends differences in fig 7 c 3 as shown in fig 4 b although two joints before the caudal fin are contained by streamline diversion shells and the inflow is treated as uniform many researchers have demonstrated upstream object is benefit to thrust force generation of downstream oscillating foil fin as a favorable complex flow field can form near the foil fin shao and pan 2011 liao et al 2003 gopalkrishnan et al 1994 then an extra smaller thrust will generate when the caudal fin moves to the limit position with ϕ 90 as the joint shell just locates right in front of the caudal fin and this will enlarge the measured thrust at t 0 5s as shown in fig 7 a in addition electromagnetic interference from surroundings motors control cabinet and so on also makes nonnegligible impacts on digital collector in experiments which means some errors will appear in the measured force values of the caudal fin especially in smaller amplitude parameters such as moment in fig 7 c and showing irregular trends in summary the numerical method in this work can provide a better solving accuracy 4 results and discussions based on equation 4 the strouhal number st indicates the ratio of the oscillating speed of the caudal fin to its advanced speed steady inflow speed in the simulations which is also the ratio of the corresponding forward displacement to the maximum lateral oscillating distance of the caudal fin for equation 4 some researchers have investigated the effect of st on the propulsive performance of the caudal fin by treating the inflow speed as a variable zhang et al 2011 however there are two problems with this method first when the inflow speed is changed to obtain different st values the corresponding reynold number re will also be changed which implies that the simulation results in these situations cannot reflect the real effect of st on the performance second fishes in the bcf swimming mode usually change the oscillating speed of their caudal fin when they intend to increase their forward swimming speed during this process a method to increase the oscillating amplitude or frequency is generally adopted therefore it is difficult to further analyze the natural process of fish swimming by changing the speed to investigate the st effect on caudal fin propulsion meanwhile the reynold number re reflects the ratio of the inertial force to the viscous force in the caudal fin oscillating process a larger re implies a weaker effect of the viscous force on the caudal fin motions which will further directly impact the structures and distribution features of the vortex system in the wake flow field of the caudal fin in the following sections the effects of st and re on the forces and powers conversion of the caudal fin are analyzed in detail where the parameters of the numerical simulations are set as z 0 0 5c 0 θ 0 25 ϕ 90 st 0 1 0 5 re 1 0 5 0 103 according to reference chang et al 2012 laminar model is used in the following numerical simulations as it has consistent results with k ω sst turbulent model when re 7100 but better convergence 4 1 effects of st and re on thrust force of caudal fin the average thrust force coefficient of the caudal fin c t with different values of st is shown in fig 8 a with the increasing st the c t curves exhibit an increasing trend and a larger st induces a larger increasing rate of c t these results imply that fish can quickly obtain a larger thrust force by increasing st through raising the oscillating frequency of their caudal fin when fish intend to hunt or escape in nature they can rapidly accelerate and act in addition from fig 8 a the trend of the c t st curve at re 1000 is similar to that at re 4000 but these trends are different from those in reference ma van doorne zhang nieuwstadt where although a larger st also corresponds to a higher c t the increasing rate decreases with increasing st as mentioned in the previous section the different c t st curves trends between this work and the reference can be explained by the different st definitions in these two simulations where st varies by adjusting the inflow speed v 0 in the reference which will cause re to also change in other words the trends in the reference result from both st and re actually it is well known that there is a quadratic function relationship between the drag force and the advanced speed in fish swimming which implies that the same relationship should also exist between the thrust force and the oscillating frequency of the caudal fin then the thrust force of the caudal fin can overcome the drag force of the fish body to accelerate itself thus the curve trends shown in fig 8 a are more reasonable after quadric fitting to the curves the coefficients of the quadratic terms are 1 63 and 1 57 for the c t st curves at re 1000 and 4000 respectively in addition from fig 8 a the values of c t will be less than zero with a smaller st and this phenomenon indicates that the force on the caudal fin changes from thrust to drag in these situations the effect of the reynold number re on the average thrust force coefficient c t is shown in fig 8 b as mentioned above the value of re indicates the proportion of the inertial force on the oscillating caudal fin to its viscous force in a certain range of re a stable vortex system can exist in the flow field behind the oscillating caudal fin subsequently with an increasing re the wake flow field will transform to turbulence and the vortex structures will become increasingly blurred thus re will have a relatively smaller value in the following simulations for convenience to display and analyze the caudal fin vortex system from fig 8 b the c t of the caudal fin shows an increasing trend with an increasing re when st 0 4 and 0 5 although in the simulation range of re the thrust force all becomes negative which implies a drag force on the caudal fin and the absolute value of this drag force also appears to decrease in general an increasing re will lead to a drag on the growth of the curves then these curves tend to gradually stabilize in the viscous flow domain the fluid force on the caudal fin can be divided into two parts based on their properties a stress force perpendicular to the surface of the caudal fin and a viscous force tangent to the surface the resultants of these two forces in the advanced direction of the fish will be defined as the thrust force or drag force of the caudal fin therefore in equation 5 f x t is the resultant of the net thrust force in the advanced direction and net drag force in the opposite direction or that of the stress force and viscous force according to the properties hence f x t can be expressed as 16 f x t t t d t s p i n 1 d s s τ 1 j n j d s where t t and d t are the instantaneous net thrust force and net drag force respectively p i is the pressure on the surface element of the caudal fin in the simulations τ ij is a viscous stress tensor n j is a component in the j direction of the unit normal vector to the surface element ds is the area of the surface element and s is the area of the entire caudal fin surfaces then based on the source of the forces equation 15 can be further decomposed as 17 t t t p t ν 1 2 s p i n 1 d s s p i n 1 d s 1 2 s τ 1 j n j d s s τ 1 j n j d s 18 d t d p d ν 1 2 s p i n 1 d s s p i n 1 d s 1 2 s τ 1 j n j d s s τ 1 j n j d s where t p and d p are the pressure components in the advanced direction t υ and d υ are the viscous components in the same direction then considering equations 15 17 and fig 8 b an increasing re implies that the proportion of the viscous force on the caudal fin is reduced relative to the inertial force in other words the inertial force will play a leading role in the total force of the caudal fin which corresponds to the increasing trend of c t shown in fig 8 b thus the inertial force on the surface elements of the caudal fin is the main source of its thrust force meanwhile the viscous force on them will determine the drag force on the caudal fin compared with the laminar flow field the turbulence environment will be more conducive to the caudal fin to generate a thrust force however the increasing rate of c t is slowed with a larger re as shown in fig 8 b so we can deduce that c t will tend to be a constant at a certain st in a turbulence environment and that a continually increasing re will basically have no effect on c t in addition from the aspect of the forces on a swimming fish the thrust force by the caudal fin is mainly used to overcome the forward resistance of the entire fish limited by the structures and muscles of a fish body there is a maximum oscillating frequency for its caudal fin based on fig 8 a b when fish starts to move by oscillating their caudal fin at the maximum frequency in their hunting or escaping actions the corresponding strouhal number st is higher and the reynold number re is smaller then the caudal fin can rapidly obtain a larger thrust force to instantaneously accelerate the fish then with an invariable oscillating frequency and an increasing swimming speed st decreases and re increases as shown in the previous section the reduction of the thrust force for a descending st is larger than its increment for an ascending re so the total thrust force provided to the fish body also decreases moreover increasing the swimming speed induces a larger forward resistance on the fish thus when the thrust force is in dynamic equilibrium with the resistance a steady swimming speed is maintained by the fish instead of continuous acceleration therefore by adjusting st and re through the body and muscles fish can change their force and speed and subsequently have different swimming skills 4 2 effects of st and re on power and efficiency of caudal fin fig 9 a and b show the input power coefficient of the oscillating caudal fin c p versus st and re respectively from fig 9 a with an increasing st the c p curves also show increasing trends and a larger st leads to a higher increasing c p rate meanwhile re has no effect on c p in fact the power to drive the caudal fin to oscillate comes from the corresponding tissues of the fish therefore when a fish accelerates itself by increasing its caudal fin oscillating frequency the power is transferred from the body to the tail will also be increased as mentioned above the forward drag force of a swimming fish is quadratically related to its speed which implies that the corresponding thrust force and input power should also present similarly increasing trends as shown in figs 8 a and fig 9 a however as shown in fig 9 b re only describes the status of the flow field for the caudal fin while c p drives the energy transfer from the fish body to its tail so changes in re basically have no effect on c p in addition although a drag force appears when st 0 2 as shown in fig 8 b the corresponding input power can still be positive as shown in fig 9 b then based on equation 12 with the obtained thrust force and input power the propulsive efficiencies of the caudal fin η versus st and re can be solved and are shown in fig 10 a and b respectively in general η shows an ascending trend with an increasing st corresponding to the situations of a negative thrust force shown in fig 8 a the propulsive efficiency values are less than zero because the output powers are negative in the same situations in fig 10 a however these negative efficiencies do not have physical meanings and are only intended for the completeness of the curve trends for the part of the curves with η 0 the efficiency first increases and subsequently decreasing with an increasing st when re 4000 where the maximum efficiency appears at st 0 4 it is believed that the same curve trend will also appear when re 1000 except that st at the peak efficiency will be larger than that at re 4000 these results also indicate that by improving the oscillating frequency of their caudal fin which is helpful to increase the input power and thrust force fish can obtain a higher acceleration but the propulsive efficiency of this oscillating method is not optimal therefore from the perspective of efficient swimming fish will choose a reasonable oscillating frequency of the caudal fin and advanced speed in regular cruise to maintain a relatively higher efficiency from fig 10 b the efficiency of the caudal fin progressively increases with an increasing re however the increasing rate of η at st 0 4 is larger than that at st 0 5 although re has no influence on c p in fig 9 b and then η is only related to c t according to equation 12 the increasing rate of c t versus re at st 0 4 and 0 5 in fig 8 b is different that is when re increasing from 1 103 to 5 103 c t at st 0 4 and 0 5 increase to 1 97 and 1 49 times respectively as a result η shows similar increasing trends in fig 10 b with c t in fig 8 b but different relative position of two trends lines in each figure based on a previous analysis a higher re implies a reduced proportion of viscous force in the fluid force on the caudal fin then it can be inferred that the viscous force of the fluid is harmful to the caudal fin for achieving a higher propulsive efficiency in fig 10 b the increasing rate of η slows down with the increasing re which corresponds to the trends of the thrust force shown in fig 8 b this phenomenon indicates that the beneficial effect of the flow status that changes to improve the propulsive efficiency of the caudal fin is limited when the caudal fin operates in a fully developed turbulence flow with a larger re the efficiency will basically not be affected by changes of re moreover an intersection point appears between the two efficiency curves of st 0 4 and 0 5 which corresponds to re 3 103 when re 3 103 the propulsive efficiency at st 0 5 is larger than that at st 0 4 when re 3 103 this relationship is reversed in fluid mechanism studies re 2 3 103 is considered as the transition point between laminar flow and turbulence flow ma van doorne zhang nieuwstadt from this perspective the caudal fin can obtain both a large instantaneous thrust force and high propulsive efficiency by high frequency oscillations in laminar flows however for turbulence flows continuous oscillation in this manner will reduce the efficiency therefore in general fish will start to move by oscillating their caudal fins at a high frequency and subsequently reduce this frequency to maintain a relatively higher swimming efficiency after accelerating to the steady advancing status 4 3 vortices structures in periodic motions of caudal fin based on newton s third law for fish the process of generating a thrust force by oscillating the caudal fin can be explained as the reacting force of a jet flow which flow is propelled by the caudal fin in the downstream direction as previously mentioned the real swimming performance of fish can be investigated by comparing and analyzing the vortex structure features in their wake flow field hence in this section the 3d vortex structures are distinguished and discussed according to the q criterion dubief and delcayre 2000 at several characteristic times in a motion cycle of the oscillating caudal fin where q is a second invariant of the local velocity gradient tensor first three views of 3d vortices with re 1000 and st 0 4 are displayed in fig 11 an enlarged 3 d view of the vortices at time t n 1 t is shown in fig 11 d in the oscillation process surface vortices emerge on the incident flow plane of the caudal fin in the y axis direction then these vortices move to the trailing edge of the fin with the flows afterwards a closed vortex ring r1 in fig 11 d is formed and shed off into the wake flow field finally vortex ring r1 moves in the downstream direction and connects with the previous ring r2 in addition the sv and cv shown in fig 11 d represent the partial vortices of a ring along the span and chord directions of the caudal fin respectively from fig 11 a c we can see that the span vortices sv are only formed at time t n 1 2 t and n 1 t which correspond to the lower oscillating speed of the caudal fin while chord vortices cv are formed at time t n 1 4 t and n 3 4 t and correspond to the higher speed of the fin in summary fig 11 shows that there are four characteristics in the process of vortex rings moving to the downstream flow field during the oscillating motions of the caudal fin ⅰ the distribution range of the vortex ring increases and the entire ring becomes fat the reasons for this phenomenon can be that the energy of the vortex core is highest in a vortex ring and decreases from this core to its periphery therefore the increasing distribution range of a single vortex ring implies that its energies gradually dissipate into the surrounding environmental flow field meanwhile when the partial vortex energy of the ring is approximately equal to that of the surrounding flows it is difficult to recognize as a vortex structure by the q criterion and then the vortex ring changes its appearance as shown in fig 11 ii the dissipating rate of the span vortices sv is higher than that of the chord vortices cv this phenomenon is mainly due to the lower oscillating speed of the caudal fin when span vortices form compared to that when chord vortices form which makes the fluid particles in the span vortices have a lower induced speed than that in the chord vortices which corresponds to a lower energy of the span vortex core compared to that of the chord vortex core therefore at the same energy dissipating rate the span vortices will disappear first when the vortex ring moves downstream so the downstream vortex ring becomes fragmented and similar to a horseshoe as shown in fig 11 a c d iii the scales of the entire vortices system are changed during the move downstream so its height in the y axis direction is gradually increasing and its width in the z axis is slightly narrowing as shown in fig 11 b iv the planes of the vortex rings are not parallel to the xoz plane but are distributed with the included angle with the plane the reasons for phenomena iii and iv can be determined from fig 11 d where the jet flows which are perpendicular to the planes of the vortex rings and are marked by yellow arrows are inducted by these vortex rings such as r1 and r2 the jet flows for an acute angle with the positive x axis which indicates that these inducted jet flows can be decomposed into two components in the x and y axis directions then the x component of the jet flows will generate a reaction force on the caudal fin i e thrust force and its y component will result in two rows of vortex rings that are vertically arranged and gradually estranged from each other and the height of the entire vortex system increases 4 4 effects of st and re on vortices structures of caudal fin based on the previous analysis the vortex system features can reflect the propulsive mechanism and performance of an oscillating caudal fin in this section the effects of the strouhal number st and reynold number re on the structure features and evolution process of the caudal fin vortices are further discussed the vortex systems with different st and re are shown in fig 12 the effect of re on the vortex structures of an oscillating caudal fin can be analyzed based on fig 12 a and b comparing these two figures when re 1000 the entire vortex system appears to have a platy structure two adjacent vortex rings are closely tied and there is no obvious boundary between them meanwhile the scale of the single vortex ring of the system is noticeably larger than that at re 4000 in addition the appearance of downstream vortex structures distinctly changes at a smaller reynold number which indicates that these vortices have a lower energy more rapidly dissipate and have a higher rate of energy dissipation rate considering the previous analysis the ratio of the inertial force to the total fluid force on the caudal fin simultaneously increases with the increasing re and the environmental flow field transforms to turbulence therefore in laminar flows a single vortex ring has less energy and a larger dissipating speed but in turbulence flows a steady vortex system can more easily form and its dissipating speed is relatively slower fig 12 b and c show the effect of st on the vortex system of the caudal fin specifically st mainly affects the scales and appearance features of the entire vortex system the larger the strouhal number the more widely the vortex system distributes in the y axis direction meanwhile a series of vortex rings in the system are arranged in a chain row with a smaller st whereas they are arranged in two rows with a larger st furthermore a larger st also leads to a smaller included angle between the jet flow directions of the vortex rings and the xoz plane than that with a smaller st which implies that the x axis components of these jet flows are larger and correspond to a higher thrust force of the caudal fin in these conditions 5 conclusions in this paper the effects of two important nondimensional parameters the strouhal number st and reynold number re on the kinematics and hydrodynamic performance of a bionic oscillating caudal fin are discussed to verify the basic algorithm and numerical model presented in this work an experiment is performed on the oscillating rigid caudal fin after comparing the numerical and experimental results of the instantaneous forces on the caudal fin we determine that these two results are consistent with each other and that the numerical method in this work is reliable then the effects of st and re on the caudal fin are analyzed in detail and several conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 from the aspect of the mechanical property increasing the oscillating frequency of the caudal fin will result in an increasing st then the caudal fin can generate a larger instantaneous thrust force and improve its advanced acceleration in a short time but these motions of the fin will require more input power and the corresponding propulsive efficiency is not much higher therefore the oscillating motions of the caudal fin with a higher st usually occur when fish attempt to hunt or escape after the caudal fin has speed up its corresponding reynold number will increase and the proportion of inertial force that acts on the fin is also increased based on our numerical results this inertial force plays a key role in the thrust force of the oscillating caudal fin while the corresponding viscous force is the main source of advanced resistance for the fin unlike the strouhal number which is decided by caudal fin self oscillation the reynold number only defines the environmental flow field status near the fin so its changes have no influence on the input power for the fin oscillation nevertheless the caudal fin can achieve a higher propulsive efficiency at a larger reynold number in general fish can obtain a larger instantaneous thrust force when their caudal fin oscillates at a higher frequency with a smaller reynold number then after reaching a larger reynold number fish can maintain a relatively higher swimming efficiency by decreasing their caudal fin oscillating frequency 2 from the aspect of vortex system analysis the partial vortex in the chord direction of the caudal fin is mainly formed during high speed fin oscillation when the vortex rings move downstream the partial vortex in the span direction which is formed during low speed fin oscillation dissipates more rapidly and then downstream vortex rings change their appearance the jet flows of these vortex rings generate a reacting force on the caudal fin that is the thrust force in addition the reynold number mainly affects the scale and dissipating rate of a single vortex ring for the caudal fin meanwhile the strouhal number can have an important effect on the appearance

21387,many fishes show an excellent swimming ability by agilely oscillating their fins and the caudal fin is a main organ for a fish to propel itself this propulsion mode provides inspiration to the design of biomimetic underwater vehicles on this basis we take an oscillating fin as our study subject and build a computational fluid dynamic model by mimicking the lunate caudal fin of tuna numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the effects of the strouhal number st and reynold number re on the wake structure and hydrodynamic performance of the oscillating caudal fin navier stokes equations are used to solve the unsteady flow for the oscillating caudal fin as well as the user defined function and dynamic mesh methods are applied to realize and track the instant locomotion respectively then the validity and reliability of the numerical method are verified by experiments and convergence tests results show that the fish can obtain a larger instantaneous thrust force when the caudal fin flaps under a higher st but when its propulsive efficiency is mediocre or even worsens this situation usually occurs during the escape or hunting actions of fish meanwhile being in a turbulence flow which corresponds to a larger re is helpful for the caudal fin to obtain a relatively higher thrust force and propulsive efficiency specially a detailed analysis on the connection between the wake vortex topology kinematics and force generation of the caudal fin is performed results suggests that the wake is dominated by one or two sets of complex vortex rings which convect at different oblique angles to the wake flow centerline with various re and st the hydrodynamic performances of the caudal fin strongly depend on the flow dynamics underlying the force production including the orientation interconnection and dissipation rate of the vortex rings such as jet flows inducted by these vortex rings play a critical role in the thrust force generation for an oscillating caudal fin keywords oscillating caudal fin strouhal number reynold number hydrodynamic vortex structure 1 introduction in nature fish and other marine organisms have excellent swimming skills compared to artificial underwater vehicles such as extremely lower noise during swimming li et al 2018 and or higher swimming speed outstanding maneuverability or superior swimming efficiency as early as 1936 gray 1936 reported that the drag power experienced by a dolphin was larger than the estimated muscle power which implies that the swimming efficiency of a dolphin exceeds 100 obviously this phenomenon is not reasonable based on the conservation of energy and is termed gray s paradox further studies found that the output power of dolphin muscles is consumed in the lateral undulating of the body instead of overcoming its swimming resistance as gray considered bale et al 2014 lee et al 2009 although gray s paradox has been solved and confirms that the swimming efficiency of dolphin did not reach 100 percent aquatic animals such as dolphin have an excellent swimming ability according to these studies which inspires the design of innovative unmanned underwater vehicles then based on locomotion characteristics the fish swimming modes have been categorized by some biologists to help other researchers to rapidly understand swimming and shape features wang et al 2019 in which one classification method is based on the fin that plays a major role in the propulsion and is categorized into the mpf median and paired fins mode and bcf body and caudal fin mode an estimated 15 of fish families use non bcf modes as their routine propulsive means while a much greater number of fish families that typically rely on bcf modes for propulsion use mpf modes to maneuver and for stability lauder et al 2002 2003 videler 2012 generally fish can reach relatively higher swimming speeds and propulsive efficiencies in the bcf mode which is instructive and practical for the development efficient navigation and operation of unmanned underwater vehicles in fact the above categories blend into one another and should not be thought of as sharply distinct the kinematic and hydrodynamic performance of fish swimming have been studied through theoretical analyses numerical simulations and experimental approaches by referencing studies on microorganism movements at a low reynold number re and using relative methods in aerodynamics lighthill 1960 1970 proposed the elongated body theory ebt to investigate the fish swimming process the ebt assumes that the shape transformation of fish is smaller in its advance direction and that the lateral forces cancel each other out then the thrust force can be generated only by oscillation of the caudal fin later the ebt became widely used newman and wu 1973 newman 1973 wu 1971 and was applied to studies of the unsteady locomotor performance of fish including the swerve fast start and instantaneous stop weihs 1972 1974 katz and weihs 1979 domenici and blake 1997 meanwhile aiming to overcome the insufficiency of ebt the waving plate theory chopra 1976 and oscillating wing theory wu 1961 were successively proposed and employed to analyze the large amplitude locomotion of the caudal fin with high aspect ratios and the linear and turning swimming of fish in the bcf mode zhu et al 2002 wolfgang et al 1999 liu and bose 1997 jones et al 1997 however in the above studies limited by the computational hardware conditions at that time the potential flow theory was widely used to study the hydrodynamic performance of fish locomotion this theory had to neglect fluid viscosity and adopted simple flows whose analytical solutions were known to make up an imaginary flow field behind the fish oscillating caudal fin as a result the potential flow theory had a better calculation speed but its precision deteriorated when solving unsteady motion and complex interaction problems and even yielded unreasonable results platzer et al 2008 heathcote et al 2008 in recent years with the development of high speed parallel computation and 3d graphic display technologies the computational fluid dynamics cfd method based on the viscous flow theory has gradually been adopted by solving navier stokes n s equations in the computational domain key physical quantities such as velocity and pressure can be obtained in the flow field near a swimming fish with the cfd method then combined with flow field post treatment technology the detailed wake vortex structure of the oscillating caudal fin can be determined shi et al 2019 luo et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 ramamurti et al 2002 carling et al 1998 bottom et al 2016 borazjani 2008 experimental methods have also made progress in studies on fish swimming the conventional contact measurement method has difficulty obtaining real kinematics and hydrodynamics parameters since it affects on the natural swimming movements of experimental fishes therefore based on the tracking flow field mechanism a newly noncontact particle image velocimetry piv technique has been developed and employed to determine the real detailed flow field distribution near swimming fish with image processing and identifying techniques lauder and tytell 2005 maia et al 2017 liu et al 2017 akanyeti et al 2017 thus the reliability of mechanical results based on the potential flow theory is currently difficult to verify in contrast the scales and structure features of vortices in the wake flow field can be compared between piv measurements and simulated results based on the viscous flow theory among fishes in the bcf mode tuna can achieve a relatively higher swimming speed wardle et al 1989 katz et al 2001 and its lunate caudal fin has an excellent propulsive performance newman and wu 1975 liu and bose 1999 however the diversity of the fin morphology decides the specificity of hydrodynamic mechanism so existing analyses were not sufficient zhou et al 2016 despite all of above previous works on oscillating foils caudal fin or swimming fish they are basically independent with each other as previous numerical simulations mostly focus on force generation and propulsive efficiency meanwhile newly developed experimental method of piv is on the flow field distribution and vortex structure actually only noncontact measurement methods like piv can obtain real and natural instant motion state of swimming fish and its caudal fin while accurate imitating these motions plays a much important roles in efficient operation of bionic system therefore two steps are needed to realize above process first building the connection between vortex structure and hydrodynamic performance and second comparing vortex features coming from numerical simulations and vivo piv experiments but in current the number of studies that have systematically examined the relationships between kinematics vortex evolution and force generation underlying the variety laws of the hydrodynamic performance with kinematic parameters for the caudal fin is rare usually 2 d section of the vortex structure is widely used in most cfd simulations for the caudal fin in addition st and re can describe the movements of the caudal fin and the status of its surrounding flow filed respectively so in this paper we analyze the hydrodynamic performance and thrust force generation mechanism of the oscillating caudal fin especially their connection with structure and evolution process of the wake vortex system this paper is organized as follows we first built a numerical model of the caudal fin and subsequently verified the convergence of the algorithm meanwhile the experimental results were compared then the effects of the strouhal number st and reynold number re on the thrust force power and efficiency of the caudal fin were simulated and discussed in detail last we continually analyzed the vortex structure and evolution process of the wake topology behind the oscillating caudal fin and their connection with the hydrodynamic performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 geometric model of caudal fin a geometric model was built by using the lunate caudal fin of bluefin tuna as the prototype zhou et al 2016 xu and wan 2012 to reduce unnecessary disturbances on the flow field the model was shape smoothed using the curve fitting method the 3d model of the caudal fin and its coordinate system are shown in fig 1 where c 0 and s 0 represent the chord length and span length respectively the caudal fin model is symmetrical about the xoy and xoz planes as shown in fig 1 and the aob curve is the leading edge of the fin where point o represents the origin of the coordinate system meanwhile the a o b curve is the trailing edge and point o is an intersection between the trailing edge and the x axis to describe the geometric shape of the caudal fin a series of planes which are parallel to the xoz plane were employed to intercept the aoo a part of the model as shown in fig 1 then intersections between these parallel planes and the leading edge and the chord length of the cross sections in the part i e distance between the leading edge intersection and the trailing edge one in the cross sections are shown in table 1 where all the length values are nondimensionalized by the chord length c 0 of the caudal fin 2 2 motion model of caudal fin in the bcf swimming mode the front part of the fish body basically remains steady and only its tail part makes a periodic oscillating motion around the caudal peduncle to generate a thrust force meanwhile the relatively constant oscillating motions let the fish body maintain a steady forward velocity in their cruise but this velocity should actually be a fluctuation value around the average velocity of the fish in one oscillating period in our numerical simulations the forward velocity of the caudal fin was changed into a steady inflow velocity through coordinate transformation liu and bose 1997 1999 jones et al 1997 zhou et al 2016 borazjani 2008 which could improve the solving accuracy and efficient meanwhile it was also beneficial to compare and verify the numerical and experimental results in other words a natural process in which the caudal fin oscillates to obtain thrust force and subsequently move forward at a fluctuating speed was converted to a simulated process where the caudal fin was kept steady in the forward direction and performed periodic lateral oscillating motions to generate thrust force behind a steady inflow theoretically the above inflow velocity in numerical simulations should be equal to the average forward velocity of the caudal fin in the physical process in the coordinate system the motion model of the caudal fin in the following simulations is shown as fig 2 where v 0 is the constant inflow speed the oscillating movements of the caudal fin are decomposed into a heaving motion along the z axis and a pitching motion around the y axis where the pitching center is located at the leading edge cusp point of the caudal fin p 0 whereas z t and θ t represent the instantaneous heaving amplitude and pitching angle at time t respectively then the periodic kinematics of the caudal fin are expressed in a sinusoidal function such that 1 z t z 0 sin 2 π f t 2 θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t ϕ where z 0 and θ 0 are the maximum heaving amplitude and pitching angle respectively f is the oscillating frequency of the caudal fin and the frequencies of the heaving and pitching motions are set equal to each other ϕ is the phase difference between these two motions of the fin given the reference values of the velocity v 0 chord length and maximum heaving amplitude z 0 and frequency f the reynold number and strouhal number are defined by 3 r e v 0 c 0 ν 4 s t 2 z 0 f v 0 where ν is the water kinematic viscosity coefficient then the caudal fin must overcome the corresponding resistance from the surrounding fluid medium in its oscillating movements such as the instantaneous transverse force f z t along the z axis direction in the heaving motion and the instantaneous moment m y t around the y axis in the pitching motion simultaneously the sum of the components for the fluid reacting force in the forward direction of the caudal fin is defined as the thrust force f x t along the negative x direction and the drag along positive x direction then the nondimensional coefficients of these forces and moment can be determined by the expressions as follows 5 c x t 2 f x t ρ c 0 s 0 v 0 2 6 c z t 2 f z t ρ c 0 s 0 v 0 2 7 c m t 2 m y t ρ c 0 2 s 0 v 0 2 where c x t is the thrust force coefficient c z t is the transverse force coefficient c m t is the moment coefficient and ρ is the density of the fluid medium which is water in this work to describe the macro force of the caudal fin we define the average thrust force coefficient in one oscillating motion period of the caudal fin c t as follows 8 c t 1 t 0 t c x t d t from the aspect of energy conversion the input power p in which is transferred from the fish body to its caudal fin is consumed to overcome the transverse force f z t and moment m y t in the oscillating motions meanwhile the energy which propels the caudal fin to move forward at a certain velocity v 0 by the thrust force f x t can be defined as the useful power p u these powers can be expressed as 9 p u 1 t 0 t f x t v 0 d t 10 p i n 1 t 0 t f z t z t m y t θ t d t after nondimensionalization the corresponding input power coefficient c p is defined by 11 c p p i n ρ v 0 3 c 0 s 0 2 finally based on equations 9 11 the propulsive efficiency of the caudal fin is given as 12 η p u p i n c t v 0 t 0 t c z z t c m c 0 θ t d t c t c p 2 3 numerical method in this work the caudal fin is treated as a rigid body and set to operate in viscous and incompressible flows correspondingly the continuity equation and reynolds averaged navier stockes equation rans can be expressed by the tensor form in the cartesian coordinate system as 13 u i x i 0 14 ρ u i t x j u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s i i j 1 2 3 where u i and u j are the transient velocity components u i and u j are the fluctuating velocity components p is the transient pressure u i u j is the mean value of u i u j s i is the source item and the sum of all other force components that do not belong to the transient term convective term or diffusive term of the governing equations and μ is the dynamic viscosity in addition the subscripts i j 1 2 3 in equations 13 and 14 identify the components along the x y and z axes in the numerical simulations the scales of the computational domain are length width height 11c 0 8c 0 4c 0 the boundary conditions of the domain are set as the fluid medium velocity inlet on the left plane pressure outlet on the right plane and wall on the surfaces of the caudal fin the distance between the central point of the fin leading edge p 0 and the left inlet plane is 2c 0 in the x axis direction this point is located at the center of the domain in the y and z axes then the computational domain and corresponding boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 a at upstream boundary the inflow velocity is fixed while a pressure gradient is set to be zero at downstream boundaries zero gradient condition is imposed for both velocities and pressures on the surfaces of caudal fin no slip condition is employed for velocities the fluid field is computed on an unstructured tetrahedral mesh which are generated by gambit software to improve the solving accuracy of the simulations the partial grid is refined near the caudal fin especially near the tip locations of the leading edge and the trailing edge specifically 2d unstructured triangular meshes are generated on the surfaces of the fin as well as on the six outside boundaries and then 3d tetrahedron meshes were generated within the computational domain with local meshes clustered to the surfaces of the fin to ensure the boundary resolution adjacent to the solid surfaces the entire domain mesh scheme and grid on the surface of the caudal fin are displayed in fig 3 b with the mesh commercial cfd software fluent is employed to solve the control equations in the entire computational domain to realize caudal fin oscillating motions following equations 1 and 2 user defined functions udf are used to secondarily develop the software fluent to define the instantaneous location and status of the caudal fin in the simulations 2 4 experimental set up as previously stated it is difficult to directly measure the real thrust force of the caudal fin during experimental fish natural swimming as a result we performed a series of hydrodynamic experiments to imitate the caudal fin of tuna to verify the numerical simulation method in this work the entire experimental system is made up of the control measure and motor subsystems where the control system is responsible for translating the oscillating motion law of the caudal fin to the corresponding electrical signals and the motor system is used to execute commands from the control system to realize fin movements meanwhile the measure system obtains the instantaneous force and moment on the fin through strain sensors signal gathering and the processing device in the experiments the thrust force along the x axis transverse force along the z axis and moment around the y axis can be measured by a three component balance the sketch of the experimental installations and their connections is shown in fig 4 a specifically to realize sinusoidal oscillating process of the caudal fin nine sets shafts and gears are made up its motion mechanism fig 4 b shows a cross section view of the mechanism in which drive system connects with servo motor and is in charge of power transfer and oscillation system is designed as two joints components and used to transform the input power to pitch and heave motions of the fin the force balance is installed between the caudal fin and the drive shaft as detailed shown in fig 4 c the experiments were performed in a circulating water channel where the inflow speed was set as v 0 two streamline diversion shells which respectively contained shafts and gears of two joints was installed on the front of the caudal fin so the inflow before the fin could be treated as a uniform flow the caudal fin and its motion mechanism in the experiments are shown in fig 5 3 sensitivity and validation of numerical method before performing numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic performance of the oscillating caudal fin the mesh independency must be investigated to select the appropriate mesh density and time step which helps to improve the solving accuracy and efficiency then three different mesh schemes are introduced coarse mesh nominal mesh and fine mesh with mesh quantities of 0 4 million 0 8 million and 1 6 million respectively with these three meshes the other parameters in this simulation are for the caudal fin chord length c 0 0 1 m and span length s 0 2 0c 0 motion period t 2 s maximum pitching angle θ 0 25 phase difference between heave and pitch motions ϕ 90 steady inflow speed v 0 0 1 m s and corresponding re 1 105 so sst k ω sst turbulent model is used in simulations tseng and cheng 2015 kang et al 2013 chang et al 2012 and time step δt t 200 then the variable of the heaving amplitude is set to z 0 0 2 1 0c 0 then three criteria are adopted to determine convergence of each simulated operating condition the first one is residual criteria and the residual value of all variables should be not larger than 10 3 which follows the default settings of fluent the second one is changes of simulating results that is forces moments errors between two adjacent motion periods are no more than 1 and the third one is the conservation of mass and momentum of whole system which means the mass and momentum unbalance errors of stream in and out the system are not larger than 0 1 in addition errors ε i are given to describe the difference between the simulations as follows 15 ε i c t j c t f c t f c t k c t t 400 c t t 400 i 1 2 j c n k t 100 t 200 where ε 1 and ε 2 represent errors of numerical simulations with different mesh schemes and time steps respectively c t c c t n and c t f are the simulated average thrust force coefficient with coarse nominal and fine mesh respectively similarly c t t 100 c t t 200 and c t t 400 are that coefficient with t 100 t 200 and t 400 time step respectively then the numerical results from the above simulations with three meshes are shown in fig 6 a from fig 6 a the trends of the thrust force coefficient c t curves appear generally similar for the three meshes the thrust force coefficient monotonically increases with the increasing heaving amplitude and a larger z 0 c 0 induces a more rapid growth of c t the c t curves of the three meshes remain close when z 0 c 0 0 6 but when z 0 c 0 0 6 this situation changes the c t curve of the nominal meshes remains consistent with that of the fine meshes but that of the coarse mesh appears different from those of the other two curves more concretely the error between the results of the nominal mesh and fine mesh does not exceed 0 8 but that between the coarse mesh and fine mesh is approximately 5 and peaks at 9 37 therefore the nominal mesh can obtain a better solving accuracy while ensuring the calculation efficiency and is adopted in the following simulations then another sensitivity test is performed on the time step using the nominal mesh scheme actually the time step in the simulations decides the oscillating displacement of the caudal fin in a single time step theoretically a smaller time step is beneficial to improving the solving accuracy but too small a time step will increase the amount of calculations and subsequently impact the solving efficiency in this section three different time steps are used in the simulations δt t 100 t 200 and t 400 and the other parameters settings are identical to those for the above mesh sensitivity tests the results are shown in fig 6 b fig 6 b shows that the simulated results with δt t 200 are consistent with those with δt t 400 and the error between these two curves is approximately 1 whereas that between the curves with δt t 100 and δt t 400 reaches approximately 10 31 as a result the time step of δt t 200 is adopted in the following simulations since it can obtain a better solving accuracy and efficiency based on the above mesh scheme and time step other simulations are performed to verify the numerical method by comparison with the experimental results in the experiments the chord length of the caudal fin is c 0 0 1 m the maximum heaving amplitude is z 0 c 0 the pitching angle is θ 0 25 the phase difference between heave and pitch motions is ϕ 90 the motion frequency is f 0 5 hz and the steady inflow speed is v 0 0 33 m s then through the numerical model and method presented in this paper the instantaneous thrust force coefficient c x transverse force coefficient c z moment coefficient c m and experimental results of the oscillating caudal fin in one motion period are shown in fig 7 a c in addition numerical results from references zhang et al 2011 are provided for comparation from fig 7 in one motion cycle the thrust force coefficient c x changes twice periodically but the transverse force coefficient c z and moment coefficient c m change only once the trend of the c m curves has several peak and valley values and its change is relatively irregular the numerical results from the rans method in this work are consistent with those from the panel method from the reference and experimental measurements for c x the results in this work are closer to the experimental results at time nt n is a natural number while the panel method results are better at time n 1 2 t and are generally smaller than those of the others for c z two numerical results are consistent with the experimental results and the difference between the reference and the experimental results is smaller for c m a relatively larger difference appears between both the numerical results and experimental results but the rans curve has a closer trend to that of the experiments there are several reasons to cause experimental errors 1 although the sinusoidal motions of caudal fin can be realized by the whole mechanism as in fig 4 b a little motion delay appears in the mechanism when the phase difference ϕ 90 and at this time the caudal fin has moved to the limit position and should be parallel to the inflow however in our experiments the caudal fin will heave to the maximum amplitude first and then after a short delay it pitches to the direction of inflow which will result in its asynchronous motion and instantaneous coefficient trend differences and offset in fig 7 comparing with the numerical simulations actually this error comes from coupling effects of shafts and gears and it is hard to artificially eliminate 2 the oscillating motion of the caudal fin generates pulsating instant force on the gears which causes the driving gears loose and mesh insufficiently these changes will make an effect on the caudal fin motions and force transfer especially on moment which is the mainly reason for two results trends differences in fig 7 c 3 as shown in fig 4 b although two joints before the caudal fin are contained by streamline diversion shells and the inflow is treated as uniform many researchers have demonstrated upstream object is benefit to thrust force generation of downstream oscillating foil fin as a favorable complex flow field can form near the foil fin shao and pan 2011 liao et al 2003 gopalkrishnan et al 1994 then an extra smaller thrust will generate when the caudal fin moves to the limit position with ϕ 90 as the joint shell just locates right in front of the caudal fin and this will enlarge the measured thrust at t 0 5s as shown in fig 7 a in addition electromagnetic interference from surroundings motors control cabinet and so on also makes nonnegligible impacts on digital collector in experiments which means some errors will appear in the measured force values of the caudal fin especially in smaller amplitude parameters such as moment in fig 7 c and showing irregular trends in summary the numerical method in this work can provide a better solving accuracy 4 results and discussions based on equation 4 the strouhal number st indicates the ratio of the oscillating speed of the caudal fin to its advanced speed steady inflow speed in the simulations which is also the ratio of the corresponding forward displacement to the maximum lateral oscillating distance of the caudal fin for equation 4 some researchers have investigated the effect of st on the propulsive performance of the caudal fin by treating the inflow speed as a variable zhang et al 2011 however there are two problems with this method first when the inflow speed is changed to obtain different st values the corresponding reynold number re will also be changed which implies that the simulation results in these situations cannot reflect the real effect of st on the performance second fishes in the bcf swimming mode usually change the oscillating speed of their caudal fin when they intend to increase their forward swimming speed during this process a method to increase the oscillating amplitude or frequency is generally adopted therefore it is difficult to further analyze the natural process of fish swimming by changing the speed to investigate the st effect on caudal fin propulsion meanwhile the reynold number re reflects the ratio of the inertial force to the viscous force in the caudal fin oscillating process a larger re implies a weaker effect of the viscous force on the caudal fin motions which will further directly impact the structures and distribution features of the vortex system in the wake flow field of the caudal fin in the following sections the effects of st and re on the forces and powers conversion of the caudal fin are analyzed in detail where the parameters of the numerical simulations are set as z 0 0 5c 0 θ 0 25 ϕ 90 st 0 1 0 5 re 1 0 5 0 103 according to reference chang et al 2012 laminar model is used in the following numerical simulations as it has consistent results with k ω sst turbulent model when re 7100 but better convergence 4 1 effects of st and re on thrust force of caudal fin the average thrust force coefficient of the caudal fin c t with different values of st is shown in fig 8 a with the increasing st the c t curves exhibit an increasing trend and a larger st induces a larger increasing rate of c t these results imply that fish can quickly obtain a larger thrust force by increasing st through raising the oscillating frequency of their caudal fin when fish intend to hunt or escape in nature they can rapidly accelerate and act in addition from fig 8 a the trend of the c t st curve at re 1000 is similar to that at re 4000 but these trends are different from those in reference ma van doorne zhang nieuwstadt where although a larger st also corresponds to a higher c t the increasing rate decreases with increasing st as mentioned in the previous section the different c t st curves trends between this work and the reference can be explained by the different st definitions in these two simulations where st varies by adjusting the inflow speed v 0 in the reference which will cause re to also change in other words the trends in the reference result from both st and re actually it is well known that there is a quadratic function relationship between the drag force and the advanced speed in fish swimming which implies that the same relationship should also exist between the thrust force and the oscillating frequency of the caudal fin then the thrust force of the caudal fin can overcome the drag force of the fish body to accelerate itself thus the curve trends shown in fig 8 a are more reasonable after quadric fitting to the curves the coefficients of the quadratic terms are 1 63 and 1 57 for the c t st curves at re 1000 and 4000 respectively in addition from fig 8 a the values of c t will be less than zero with a smaller st and this phenomenon indicates that the force on the caudal fin changes from thrust to drag in these situations the effect of the reynold number re on the average thrust force coefficient c t is shown in fig 8 b as mentioned above the value of re indicates the proportion of the inertial force on the oscillating caudal fin to its viscous force in a certain range of re a stable vortex system can exist in the flow field behind the oscillating caudal fin subsequently with an increasing re the wake flow field will transform to turbulence and the vortex structures will become increasingly blurred thus re will have a relatively smaller value in the following simulations for convenience to display and analyze the caudal fin vortex system from fig 8 b the c t of the caudal fin shows an increasing trend with an increasing re when st 0 4 and 0 5 although in the simulation range of re the thrust force all becomes negative which implies a drag force on the caudal fin and the absolute value of this drag force also appears to decrease in general an increasing re will lead to a drag on the growth of the curves then these curves tend to gradually stabilize in the viscous flow domain the fluid force on the caudal fin can be divided into two parts based on their properties a stress force perpendicular to the surface of the caudal fin and a viscous force tangent to the surface the resultants of these two forces in the advanced direction of the fish will be defined as the thrust force or drag force of the caudal fin therefore in equation 5 f x t is the resultant of the net thrust force in the advanced direction and net drag force in the opposite direction or that of the stress force and viscous force according to the properties hence f x t can be expressed as 16 f x t t t d t s p i n 1 d s s τ 1 j n j d s where t t and d t are the instantaneous net thrust force and net drag force respectively p i is the pressure on the surface element of the caudal fin in the simulations τ ij is a viscous stress tensor n j is a component in the j direction of the unit normal vector to the surface element ds is the area of the surface element and s is the area of the entire caudal fin surfaces then based on the source of the forces equation 15 can be further decomposed as 17 t t t p t ν 1 2 s p i n 1 d s s p i n 1 d s 1 2 s τ 1 j n j d s s τ 1 j n j d s 18 d t d p d ν 1 2 s p i n 1 d s s p i n 1 d s 1 2 s τ 1 j n j d s s τ 1 j n j d s where t p and d p are the pressure components in the advanced direction t υ and d υ are the viscous components in the same direction then considering equations 15 17 and fig 8 b an increasing re implies that the proportion of the viscous force on the caudal fin is reduced relative to the inertial force in other words the inertial force will play a leading role in the total force of the caudal fin which corresponds to the increasing trend of c t shown in fig 8 b thus the inertial force on the surface elements of the caudal fin is the main source of its thrust force meanwhile the viscous force on them will determine the drag force on the caudal fin compared with the laminar flow field the turbulence environment will be more conducive to the caudal fin to generate a thrust force however the increasing rate of c t is slowed with a larger re as shown in fig 8 b so we can deduce that c t will tend to be a constant at a certain st in a turbulence environment and that a continually increasing re will basically have no effect on c t in addition from the aspect of the forces on a swimming fish the thrust force by the caudal fin is mainly used to overcome the forward resistance of the entire fish limited by the structures and muscles of a fish body there is a maximum oscillating frequency for its caudal fin based on fig 8 a b when fish starts to move by oscillating their caudal fin at the maximum frequency in their hunting or escaping actions the corresponding strouhal number st is higher and the reynold number re is smaller then the caudal fin can rapidly obtain a larger thrust force to instantaneously accelerate the fish then with an invariable oscillating frequency and an increasing swimming speed st decreases and re increases as shown in the previous section the reduction of the thrust force for a descending st is larger than its increment for an ascending re so the total thrust force provided to the fish body also decreases moreover increasing the swimming speed induces a larger forward resistance on the fish thus when the thrust force is in dynamic equilibrium with the resistance a steady swimming speed is maintained by the fish instead of continuous acceleration therefore by adjusting st and re through the body and muscles fish can change their force and speed and subsequently have different swimming skills 4 2 effects of st and re on power and efficiency of caudal fin fig 9 a and b show the input power coefficient of the oscillating caudal fin c p versus st and re respectively from fig 9 a with an increasing st the c p curves also show increasing trends and a larger st leads to a higher increasing c p rate meanwhile re has no effect on c p in fact the power to drive the caudal fin to oscillate comes from the corresponding tissues of the fish therefore when a fish accelerates itself by increasing its caudal fin oscillating frequency the power is transferred from the body to the tail will also be increased as mentioned above the forward drag force of a swimming fish is quadratically related to its speed which implies that the corresponding thrust force and input power should also present similarly increasing trends as shown in figs 8 a and fig 9 a however as shown in fig 9 b re only describes the status of the flow field for the caudal fin while c p drives the energy transfer from the fish body to its tail so changes in re basically have no effect on c p in addition although a drag force appears when st 0 2 as shown in fig 8 b the corresponding input power can still be positive as shown in fig 9 b then based on equation 12 with the obtained thrust force and input power the propulsive efficiencies of the caudal fin η versus st and re can be solved and are shown in fig 10 a and b respectively in general η shows an ascending trend with an increasing st corresponding to the situations of a negative thrust force shown in fig 8 a the propulsive efficiency values are less than zero because the output powers are negative in the same situations in fig 10 a however these negative efficiencies do not have physical meanings and are only intended for the completeness of the curve trends for the part of the curves with η 0 the efficiency first increases and subsequently decreasing with an increasing st when re 4000 where the maximum efficiency appears at st 0 4 it is believed that the same curve trend will also appear when re 1000 except that st at the peak efficiency will be larger than that at re 4000 these results also indicate that by improving the oscillating frequency of their caudal fin which is helpful to increase the input power and thrust force fish can obtain a higher acceleration but the propulsive efficiency of this oscillating method is not optimal therefore from the perspective of efficient swimming fish will choose a reasonable oscillating frequency of the caudal fin and advanced speed in regular cruise to maintain a relatively higher efficiency from fig 10 b the efficiency of the caudal fin progressively increases with an increasing re however the increasing rate of η at st 0 4 is larger than that at st 0 5 although re has no influence on c p in fig 9 b and then η is only related to c t according to equation 12 the increasing rate of c t versus re at st 0 4 and 0 5 in fig 8 b is different that is when re increasing from 1 103 to 5 103 c t at st 0 4 and 0 5 increase to 1 97 and 1 49 times respectively as a result η shows similar increasing trends in fig 10 b with c t in fig 8 b but different relative position of two trends lines in each figure based on a previous analysis a higher re implies a reduced proportion of viscous force in the fluid force on the caudal fin then it can be inferred that the viscous force of the fluid is harmful to the caudal fin for achieving a higher propulsive efficiency in fig 10 b the increasing rate of η slows down with the increasing re which corresponds to the trends of the thrust force shown in fig 8 b this phenomenon indicates that the beneficial effect of the flow status that changes to improve the propulsive efficiency of the caudal fin is limited when the caudal fin operates in a fully developed turbulence flow with a larger re the efficiency will basically not be affected by changes of re moreover an intersection point appears between the two efficiency curves of st 0 4 and 0 5 which corresponds to re 3 103 when re 3 103 the propulsive efficiency at st 0 5 is larger than that at st 0 4 when re 3 103 this relationship is reversed in fluid mechanism studies re 2 3 103 is considered as the transition point between laminar flow and turbulence flow ma van doorne zhang nieuwstadt from this perspective the caudal fin can obtain both a large instantaneous thrust force and high propulsive efficiency by high frequency oscillations in laminar flows however for turbulence flows continuous oscillation in this manner will reduce the efficiency therefore in general fish will start to move by oscillating their caudal fins at a high frequency and subsequently reduce this frequency to maintain a relatively higher swimming efficiency after accelerating to the steady advancing status 4 3 vortices structures in periodic motions of caudal fin based on newton s third law for fish the process of generating a thrust force by oscillating the caudal fin can be explained as the reacting force of a jet flow which flow is propelled by the caudal fin in the downstream direction as previously mentioned the real swimming performance of fish can be investigated by comparing and analyzing the vortex structure features in their wake flow field hence in this section the 3d vortex structures are distinguished and discussed according to the q criterion dubief and delcayre 2000 at several characteristic times in a motion cycle of the oscillating caudal fin where q is a second invariant of the local velocity gradient tensor first three views of 3d vortices with re 1000 and st 0 4 are displayed in fig 11 an enlarged 3 d view of the vortices at time t n 1 t is shown in fig 11 d in the oscillation process surface vortices emerge on the incident flow plane of the caudal fin in the y axis direction then these vortices move to the trailing edge of the fin with the flows afterwards a closed vortex ring r1 in fig 11 d is formed and shed off into the wake flow field finally vortex ring r1 moves in the downstream direction and connects with the previous ring r2 in addition the sv and cv shown in fig 11 d represent the partial vortices of a ring along the span and chord directions of the caudal fin respectively from fig 11 a c we can see that the span vortices sv are only formed at time t n 1 2 t and n 1 t which correspond to the lower oscillating speed of the caudal fin while chord vortices cv are formed at time t n 1 4 t and n 3 4 t and correspond to the higher speed of the fin in summary fig 11 shows that there are four characteristics in the process of vortex rings moving to the downstream flow field during the oscillating motions of the caudal fin ⅰ the distribution range of the vortex ring increases and the entire ring becomes fat the reasons for this phenomenon can be that the energy of the vortex core is highest in a vortex ring and decreases from this core to its periphery therefore the increasing distribution range of a single vortex ring implies that its energies gradually dissipate into the surrounding environmental flow field meanwhile when the partial vortex energy of the ring is approximately equal to that of the surrounding flows it is difficult to recognize as a vortex structure by the q criterion and then the vortex ring changes its appearance as shown in fig 11 ii the dissipating rate of the span vortices sv is higher than that of the chord vortices cv this phenomenon is mainly due to the lower oscillating speed of the caudal fin when span vortices form compared to that when chord vortices form which makes the fluid particles in the span vortices have a lower induced speed than that in the chord vortices which corresponds to a lower energy of the span vortex core compared to that of the chord vortex core therefore at the same energy dissipating rate the span vortices will disappear first when the vortex ring moves downstream so the downstream vortex ring becomes fragmented and similar to a horseshoe as shown in fig 11 a c d iii the scales of the entire vortices system are changed during the move downstream so its height in the y axis direction is gradually increasing and its width in the z axis is slightly narrowing as shown in fig 11 b iv the planes of the vortex rings are not parallel to the xoz plane but are distributed with the included angle with the plane the reasons for phenomena iii and iv can be determined from fig 11 d where the jet flows which are perpendicular to the planes of the vortex rings and are marked by yellow arrows are inducted by these vortex rings such as r1 and r2 the jet flows for an acute angle with the positive x axis which indicates that these inducted jet flows can be decomposed into two components in the x and y axis directions then the x component of the jet flows will generate a reaction force on the caudal fin i e thrust force and its y component will result in two rows of vortex rings that are vertically arranged and gradually estranged from each other and the height of the entire vortex system increases 4 4 effects of st and re on vortices structures of caudal fin based on the previous analysis the vortex system features can reflect the propulsive mechanism and performance of an oscillating caudal fin in this section the effects of the strouhal number st and reynold number re on the structure features and evolution process of the caudal fin vortices are further discussed the vortex systems with different st and re are shown in fig 12 the effect of re on the vortex structures of an oscillating caudal fin can be analyzed based on fig 12 a and b comparing these two figures when re 1000 the entire vortex system appears to have a platy structure two adjacent vortex rings are closely tied and there is no obvious boundary between them meanwhile the scale of the single vortex ring of the system is noticeably larger than that at re 4000 in addition the appearance of downstream vortex structures distinctly changes at a smaller reynold number which indicates that these vortices have a lower energy more rapidly dissipate and have a higher rate of energy dissipation rate considering the previous analysis the ratio of the inertial force to the total fluid force on the caudal fin simultaneously increases with the increasing re and the environmental flow field transforms to turbulence therefore in laminar flows a single vortex ring has less energy and a larger dissipating speed but in turbulence flows a steady vortex system can more easily form and its dissipating speed is relatively slower fig 12 b and c show the effect of st on the vortex system of the caudal fin specifically st mainly affects the scales and appearance features of the entire vortex system the larger the strouhal number the more widely the vortex system distributes in the y axis direction meanwhile a series of vortex rings in the system are arranged in a chain row with a smaller st whereas they are arranged in two rows with a larger st furthermore a larger st also leads to a smaller included angle between the jet flow directions of the vortex rings and the xoz plane than that with a smaller st which implies that the x axis components of these jet flows are larger and correspond to a higher thrust force of the caudal fin in these conditions 5 conclusions in this paper the effects of two important nondimensional parameters the strouhal number st and reynold number re on the kinematics and hydrodynamic performance of a bionic oscillating caudal fin are discussed to verify the basic algorithm and numerical model presented in this work an experiment is performed on the oscillating rigid caudal fin after comparing the numerical and experimental results of the instantaneous forces on the caudal fin we determine that these two results are consistent with each other and that the numerical method in this work is reliable then the effects of st and re on the caudal fin are analyzed in detail and several conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 from the aspect of the mechanical property increasing the oscillating frequency of the caudal fin will result in an increasing st then the caudal fin can generate a larger instantaneous thrust force and improve its advanced acceleration in a short time but these motions of the fin will require more input power and the corresponding propulsive efficiency is not much higher therefore the oscillating motions of the caudal fin with a higher st usually occur when fish attempt to hunt or escape after the caudal fin has speed up its corresponding reynold number will increase and the proportion of inertial force that acts on the fin is also increased based on our numerical results this inertial force plays a key role in the thrust force of the oscillating caudal fin while the corresponding viscous force is the main source of advanced resistance for the fin unlike the strouhal number which is decided by caudal fin self oscillation the reynold number only defines the environmental flow field status near the fin so its changes have no influence on the input power for the fin oscillation nevertheless the caudal fin can achieve a higher propulsive efficiency at a larger reynold number in general fish can obtain a larger instantaneous thrust force when their caudal fin oscillates at a higher frequency with a smaller reynold number then after reaching a larger reynold number fish can maintain a relatively higher swimming efficiency by decreasing their caudal fin oscillating frequency 2 from the aspect of vortex system analysis the partial vortex in the chord direction of the caudal fin is mainly formed during high speed fin oscillation when the vortex rings move downstream the partial vortex in the span direction which is formed during low speed fin oscillation dissipates more rapidly and then downstream vortex rings change their appearance the jet flows of these vortex rings generate a reacting force on the caudal fin that is the thrust force in addition the reynold number mainly affects the scale and dissipating rate of a single vortex ring for the caudal fin meanwhile the strouhal number can have an important effect on the appearance

studies hysteresis behavior partial cavitation hydrofoil 1 introduction cavitation generally appears when the local pressure of the fluid decreases approximately to saturated vapor pressure and nuclei start to form inside the flow cavitation occurs in most of the hydraulic machinery and is characterized as an unsteady and oscillated phenomenon this phenomenon is the reason for lots of consequences such as reduction of performance change of hydrodynamic drag and vibration in hydraulic machinery dular et al 2005 zhu and fang 2012 wu et al 2018 che et al 2019 ilieva and pirovsky 2020 partial cavitation is one of the principal regimes of cavitation which is known as being unstable and entailing complicated interactions of phase change with breakdown and shedding of the cavities wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b because of these complicities and due to the advancement of the experimental methods such as image processing and particle imaging velocimetry piv numerous test facilities have been utilized to enhance the understanding of the complex structure of cavitating flows kravtsova et al 2014b luo et al 2016 peng et al 2016 in test facilities hydrofoils are used widely to study the

partial cavity length and showed an increase in partial cavity length in the presence of ventilation liu et al 2018 yu et al 2018 qin et al 2019 so far cavitation is known as a single solution problem among the researchers which means this phenomenon is studied by reporting only one form of result for each specific flow condition bringing the fundamental question of the present study that cavitation might have two different forms of results for each flow condition based on the flow history as mentioned before visualization and using techniques like image processing have been widely used so far to reach a better comprehension of cavitating flows lv et al 2018 used image processing methods for quantifying cavitation structure and erosion based on statistical theory and analyzed

generated from a gas jet cavitator over a broad range of ventilation and flow conditions and observed that the ventilation demand for the formation of the supercavity is significantly higher than the minimal ventilation demand to sustain the supercavity named as hysteresis phenomenon saalbach et al 2018 investigated cavitation hysteresis in the field of sonochemistry in their experimental setup once the threshold for inertial cavitation was exceeded the excitation amplitude was reduced using a hysteresis effect to maintain inertial cavitation amini et al 2019b reported a hysteresis effect on tip vortex cavitation tvc around a naca16020 hydrofoil amini et al 2019a also studied the effect of gas content and flow conditions on the hysteresis effect on tvc in the test section of epfl high speed cavitation tunnel and found that the pressure threshold for the tvc desinence rises with the enhancement in the amount of dissolved gas content to the best of the authors knowledge no one has reported a hysteresis effect of the cavitation in constant pressure when the angle of attack of the hydrofoil is altering slowly in an increase decrease cycle subsequently to form a loop so the present study is focused on analyzing the effect of hysteresis while the cavitation number is held constant and the variation of partial cavity length is quantified in the different angles of attack due to the fluctuating characteristics of partial cavitation statistical study and image processing techniques are employed to achieve a more accurate and consistent result 2 experimental setup the experiments are conducted in the high speed cavitation tunnel of the institute of applied hydrodynamics and marine technologies hydrotech at iran university of science and technology iust wall plexiglas of 15 mm provides complete visual access to the test section from different sides as shown in fig 1 the water was circulated in a closed loop cycle from the relaxation tank passing through the test sections and returning to the tank the velocity of the flow at the test section is regulated in the span of 5 12 m s for each flow condition twelve pictures are captured in each α starting from 0 ending at 20 by an angle step of 2 the tests are performed at three different freestream velocities since this velocity was not adequate to reduce the cavitation number and form a partial cavity the absolute pressure of the tunnel was reduced using two vacuum pumps in series which are capable of decreasing the total pressure of the tunnel up to a value as low as 0 1 bars the test section is equipped with high speed data acquisition systems for measuring the freestream pressure a pressure box used consisting of 64 pressure transducers in the range of 10 50 and 100 kpa in absolute and differential types for this study the absolute one was calibrated and used the mass flow rate measured using an electromagnetic flowmeter located upstream of the test loop temperature is also measured for having an accurate calculation of saturation vapor pressure and the temperature in the middle of each run is used as the representative temperature of that cycle a k type thermocouple mounted upstream of the test section for measuring and detecting the temperature during the experiments measuring parameters cavitation number σ defined as the following 1 σ p p v 1 2 ρ u 2 where p p v ρ and u are the freestream static pressure saturation vapor pressure the density of water and freestream velocity respectively the raw photographs of the study are taken using a camera lens of a f micro nikkor 105 mm connected to the computer for having better control over capturing procedure the main approach is to visualize the partial cavity by increasing and decreasing the angle of attack and capturing 12 pictures in each angle using the setup depicted in fig 2 the model hydrofoil is symmetric aluminum made naca0015 hydrofoil with 115 mm chord length and a maximum thickness of 17 25 mm in this study cavitation is investigated in different angles of attack so hydrofoil s angle is altered in a range in different steps of experiments for this purpose and for being able to set the exact angle a scaled transparent protractor placed in the outer part of the rear plexiglas of the test section and α changed manually to achieve the desired value 3 results and discussion test runs are conducted in three different mass flow rates leading to freestream velocities of 5 41 5 90 and 6 45 m s respectively in each mass flow rate three cycles of 0 20 0 have been examined the angle of attack s change step has been set to 2 and at each α 12 images are captured to have a statistical study on cavity length the partial cavity length on the hydrofoil l is measured after image processing as shown in fig 3 each test cycle lasted for 20 min so there is a possibility of producing an enhancement in water temperature due to high speed flow passing through the tunnel for a long period for this reason the tunnel s temperature monitored during each cycle for an accurate calculation of the cavitation number defined by eq 1 the values of temperature and freestream pressure are measured in α 20 of each cycle as described previously and reported in table 1 it is worth mentioning that the pressure is recorded with a sampling rate of 1000 hz for a period of 10 s and reported data are obtained by time averaging 3 1 statistical study of the partial cavity length at each angle of attack 12 images are captured for investigating the variation of the partial cavity length this procedure is repeated twice in each cycle one for 0 20 half cycle and the other for the same angles in the reverse half cycle of 20 0 these raw data are then post processed using the open source imagej program calibrated using hydrofoil length and then used for measuring the cavity length for post processing raw images and for achieving images with higher qualities the luminance plane used as color plane extraction and the values of brightness contrast and gamma set to 128 75 and 1 respectively images after being processed for σ 1 86 and α 16 case are presented in fig 4 and fig 5 and respective l c values are reported in table 2 as its obvious from the presented figures the behavior of the partial cavitation brings the point that the variation of the cavity length is considerable so a statistical averaged value obtained for each condition and used in later analyses 3 2 hysteresis in partial cavitation after obtaining statistical averaged values for all cases it is found that the partial cavity length in alpha in 0 20 half cycle is greater than its value in the same alpha in 20 0 half cycle defined as partial cavity length hysteresis for σ 1 72 the partial cavity length is visualized in 2 20 and 20 2 half cycles in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the main novelty of the present study is presenting a new approach for the observation of hysteresis in the partial cavitation phenomenon this is carried out by an increase decrease cycle on the angle of attack in the 0 20 0 loop for showing the repeatability of the obtained results that there exists a difference in partial cavity length between increasing half cycle and decreasing half cycle in a cycle of changing the angle of attack three different experiments performed in different freestream velocities in each velocity three cycles of 0 20 0 replicated and the results are shown in figs 8 10 in all cycles the cavity length in 0 20 half cycle is greater than the cavity length at the same angle in reverse half cycle of 20 0 the relative difference is defined as the hysteresis h by authors of the present study and presented in eq 2 2 h l 0 20 l 20 0 c the hysteresis h between 0 20 and 20 0 is plotted in fig 11 for all cavitation numbers the following figure shows the value of hysteresis defined by eq 2 as shown in fig 11 hysteresis is more remarkable in higher α values and for α 0 to 6 for the first case u 5 41 m s and α 0 to 4 for the next two cases u 5 90 6 45 m s cavitation is not formed on the hydrofoil so there is no hysteresis for these amounts this figure shows the behavior of the hysteresis phenomenon besides the unsteadiness of partial cavitation and shows that the phenomenon is more noticeable in the range of 12 to 16 for all σ values 4 conclusion an experimental study is carried out to investigate the role of gradually changing the angle of attack in a cycle on the formation of the partial cavitation the measurements performed on a symmetrical naca0015 hydrofoil at a high speed cavitation tunnel for u 5 41 5 90 and 6 45 m s and α varying between 0 and 20 the experiments confirm that for all flow conditions there is a difference in partial cavity length in increasing and decreasing half cycles defined as hysteresis repeatability of the phenomenon is proved by replication of the measurement for three loops at each velocity resulting in different cavitation numbers because of the unsteady behavior of partial cavitation the statistical averaged value of obtained data considered as the representative of the specific flow condition accurate estimation of the partial cavity length obtained using statistical study and image processing techniques such as filtering and color plane extraction in image processing chord length defined as the calibrating length and the cavity length is measured in comparison to this length it is proved that the hysteresis phenomenon always occurs in partial cavitation formation but its value has an oscillatory behavior for different cavitation numbers and angles of attack the procedure used in this study is extendable to other regimes of cavitations to be studied experimentally or as validation for numerical studies the

studies hysteresis behavior partial cavitation hydrofoil 1 introduction cavitation generally appears when the local pressure of the fluid decreases approximately to saturated vapor pressure and nuclei start to form inside the flow cavitation occurs in most of the hydraulic machinery and is characterized as an unsteady and oscillated phenomenon this phenomenon is the reason for lots of consequences

cavitation is one of the principal regimes of cavitation which is known as being unstable and entailing complicated interactions of phase change with breakdown and shedding of the cavities wu et al

and obtained the unsteadiness of the cloud cavity and the variation of cavitation features with the angle of attack cavitation has also been studied over the flat hydrofoils with obstacles and the results showed that the presence of obstacle altered the intensity and direction of the transient re entrant jet as well as the pressure distribution at the tail part of the cavity and caused weaker shedding of the cloud cavitation zhang et al 2018 2019a some other researches have been executed on ventilated partial cavitation experimentally and numerically to show the effect of ventilation on partial cavity length and showed an increase in partial cavity length in the presence of ventilation liu et al 2018 yu et al 2018 qin et al 2019 so far cavitation is known as a single solution problem among the researchers which means this phenomenon is studied by reporting only one form of result for each specific flow condition bringing the fundamental question of the present study that

used so far to reach a better comprehension of cavitating flows lv et al 2018 used image processing methods for quantifying cavitation structure and erosion based on statistical theory and analyzed the distribution characteristics of the cavitation structure image processing techniques such as gray level extension image smoothing and median filter are also used to achieve more accurate images

21389,floating structure designs require an environmental condition simulation and corresponding design parameter determination typically the design values are defined by individually calculating the n yr return period however this not only results in overestimation but it also reduces the accuracy of the structural reliability analysis therefore a new environmental design parameter estimation method which is based on the joint distribution of multiple loads and conditional joint probability models was developed a multivariate joint model for the metoceanic parameters of the south china sea based on 30 yrs of annual extremum hindcast data and conditional probability models with one predominant factor were established the most likely pair of other variables were also considered because of the complexity and variability of the environmental conditions environmental parameters with n yr joint return period as well as the structural response surface corresponding to the most unsafe conditions were determined to derive design parameters the possible conservatism of the conventional design standard was assessed by applying this joint design criterion to a semi submersible platform example the results indicate the design response is much more conservative than those obtained using proposed criteria neither multivariate nor conditional joint models the proposed design criteria can significantly reduce construction cost keywords floating structures environmental design parameters single extreme factor multivariate joint model conditional probability model 1 introduction floating structures such as semi submersible platforms and wind power plants must operate under complex marine conditions for a long period of time during severe weather processes external loads such as winds waves and currents may severely damage floating structures see fig 1 the selection of design criteria to define extreme metoceanic loading under marine environmental conditions has become a common way to evaluate the safety structural type and engineering costs thus the design and operation of floating structures require accurate determination of the environmental design parameters which should entail in situ measurements or hindcast datasets the likelihood of the occurrence of an extreme marine event is low however the consequences of such an event can be severe therefore extreme environmental conditions which are often considered to be independent variables are typically determined by simply combining each of the single extreme environmental parameters with an n yr return period in general a long return period is accompanied by severe environmental loads and a high security requirement thus the method of using single extreme factors may yield quite conservative results as each oceanic variable would be considered to be independent in general for the design of offshore and floating structures for the china bohai sea or other seas surrounding china such as a jacket or semi submersible platform environmental design parameters are always determined using 50 yr or 100 yr return values however this method is thought to not only be conservative and arbitrary but also lack a reasonable theoretical basis dong et al 2012 bruserud et al 2018 proposed a joint description of waves and currents for periods corresponding the ultimate and accidental limit states i e 100 and 10 000 years the vessel mooring was designed to satisfy 100 yr extreme conditions with factors of safety and stanisic et al 2019 addressed the reliability of the mooring chain and pile chen et al 2019 performed joint probability analysis of extreme wave heights and surges along china s coasts based on the 35 year extreme data and 50 yr and 100 yr return period events are calculated with the joint probability density function the results indicate that the commonly used empirical method for the coastal water of china might be too conservative in meeting the engineering design criteria raed et al 2020 assessed the extreme hydrodynamic response of a wind turbine semi submersible platform resulting from the extreme sea states which are identified based on iform with a 50 year return period li et al 2020 generated undisturbed irregular wave fields based on the jonswap spectra with different significant wave heights spectral peak periods and spectral factors for the 100 yr cyclone and the second order resonant motions of a deep draft semi submersible under irregular wave excitation were investigated safety and performance assessment for floating structures under extreme environmental conditions with 50 yr or 100 yr return period is necessary in preliminary design stage a conventional method for calculating extreme metoceanic loads entails performing statistical analysis using measured or hindcast obtained environmental variables additionally all of the dynamic environmental parameters corresponding to an n yr return period are selected as design parameters as an example the 100 yr wind speed 100 yr significant wave height and 100 yr current velocity can be adopted as design parameters by using these design parameters the viability of floating structures in a harsh environment can be improved however the probability of different extreme environmental loads appearing in the service sea area is low moreover such loads are less likely to simultaneously occur thus once they are adopted as design parameters the results will not accurately reflect the actual environmental conditions furthermore this will cause parameter significance ambiguity and negatively impact the reliability of the prediction and the corresponding safety analysis yielding unrealistic results dong et al 2012 higher value design parameters are associated with larger design structures and higher investments it is essential to develop a reasonable and reliable estimation of the environmental design criteria for floating structure designs that takes into account the dependency of the environmental variables to reliably estimate the effects of various environmental conditions on marine structures many researchers and research institutions have been focusing on investigating the joint probability distributions of different metoceanic parameters to simulate multiple loads coles and tawn 1994 liu et al 1995 liu et al 1996 morton and bowers 1996 bitner gregersen 2015 antão and guedes soares 2016 vanem 2017 bruserud et al 2018 jäger et al 2019 lin and dong 2019 lin et al 2020 american petroleum institute api code 1995 utilises three different criteria to determine the design conditions for a fixed offshore platform 1 combinations of the return values for the 100 yr wind speed 100 yr current velocity and 100 yr wave height 2 the 100 yr wave height with concomitant wind speed and current velocity and 3 any reasonable combination of wind speed wave height and current velocity which will yield predictions related to a 100 yr structural response such as the base shear force and overturning moment lloyd s register of shipping 1999 proposed the use of combinations of environmental design loads for offshore mobile structures as follows 1 a combination of the return values of the 100 yr wave height 10 yr current velocity and 10 yr wind speed and 2 a combination of the 100 yr wave height and current velocity and 10 yr wind speed the lack of a reasonable theoretical basis for these criteria has prevented designers from reaching a consensus and could lead to completely different results in fact both of these codes are based on the combined effects of the wind waves and currents acting on the marine structures thus accurate information about the extreme environmental loads must be obtained by accounting for the simultaneous occurrence of metoceanic variables such as waves the wind and currents it is for this reason that the construction and solution of a multivariate joint probability distribution model has become a hot topic in the field of marine engineering yue et al 1999 liu et al 2002a dnv rp c205 2007 there has been progress in the area of developing joint probability models with multivariate non gaussian and correlative variables ferreira and guedes soares 2002 proposed a bivariate density function to fit the significant wave height and mean wave period dong et al 2013 proposed a bivariate maximum entropy distribution for the significant wave height and peak period dong et al 2015 presented a trivariate maximum entropy distribution for the significant wave height wind speed and relative direction it provides a good reference for structural design lucas and guedes soares 2015 proposed bivariate distributions for the significant wave height and mean wave period of swells wind sea components and combined sea states muraleedharan et al 2015 modelled the distribution of the significant wave height and associated peak periods by using data from the north atlantic ocean dong et al 2017 constructed a multivariate maximum entropy distribution this model was applied in the joint design of marine environmental elements bruserud et al 2018 established a joint description of waves and hindcast currents and then applied it to a simplified load case after using it to assess the conservatism of the norwegian design standard they found that the norwegian design standard is not necessarily conservative at the uls or als level horn et al 2018 modelled the joint distribution of all relevant environmental parameters with the directional descriptions used in the design of offshore structures sandvik et al 2019 presented three stochastic bivariate time series models of waves in the north sea and evaluated their applicability by performing simulations to explore floating bridge designs cheng et al 2019 investigated the long term joint distribution of the environmental parameters related to the conditions in a norwegian fjord to date studies on the effects of multiple loads on offshore structures have mainly focused on bivariate distribution models liu et al 2002b proposed a bivariate poisson mixed gumbel distribution to estimate the joint probability of wind speeds and wave heights in the east china sea dong et al 2004 2005 2007 2008 applied various poisson bi variable distributions to establish environmental design parameters that can concurrently account for the wind speed and wave height dong et al 2012 considered the service term and risk probability of jacket platforms to calculate the joint occurrence period of wind speed and wave heights ewans and jonathan 2014 applied the conditional extremes model to perform joint estimation of the significant wave height and peak period at a northern north sea location under extreme storm peak conditions vanem 2016 analysed the potential effects of climate change on the joint distribution of the significant wave height and wave period their results indicated a higher correlation in the future climate as a results of climate change chen et al 2019 conducted a joint probability analysis of extreme wave heights and surges along china s coasts to improve the design of coastal structures lin et al 2020 modelled the long term joint distribution of the significant wave height and mean zero crossing wave period using a copula mixture it is well known that the conventional method of independently determining the n yr return period for each metoceanic variable yields conservative results moreover the extent of conservatism is uncertain therefore in this study based on a total of 30 yrs of annual extremum wind wave and current data from the south china sea a single extreme factor distribution model was established then to increase the accuracy of floating structure analysis a combined trivariate multi load joint distribution and conditional joint probability model of principal elements was developed based on the multivariate joint probability and structural extreme response surface results more reasonable and practical criteria for the determination of the environmental design parameters was established the results of this new concept were compared to those of the conventional design method the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to establish a trivariate joint distribution model of the significant wave height wind speed and current velocity based on hindcast data to increase the accuracy of floating structure analysis 2 to propose a new concept for environmental design parameter estimation that has a reasonable theoretical basis a semi submersible model operated at a 1500 m water depth was used to demonstrate the application of the new concept and 3 to assess the possible conservatism of the traditional design standard by applying this joint probability model in a case study this paper is organised as follows a brief introduction to the existing environmental design parameter estimation methods is presented in section 2 then the new concept for environmental design parameter determination is introduced in section 3 a numerical example is validated and assessed in section 4 and some conclusions are reported in section 5 2 existing environmental design parameter estimation theories there is no unified approach to establishing a joint probability model of metoceanic parameters and it is difficult to benchmark different methods some scholars have their own preferred methods and justifications bruserud et al 2018 in this study a multivariate joint distribution model of the environmental variables was constructed by integrating a multivariate copula function into a marginal distribution model of the primary parameters in this section existing environmental design parameter estimation theories including those that entail the use of extreme value distribution types copula theory goodness of fit tests and potential flow theory are briefly introduced 2 1 conventional environmental design parameter estimation methods single extreme factor statistical analysis is a conventional approach that is used to calculate marine environmental design parameters this method extracts the typical 30 yr extremum series data on the wind wave and current parameters from in situ measurement results or hindcast datasets the data is then fit using extreme value distribution functions additionally the n yr return values for various ocean related variables are selected as the design parameters in general the incidence direction of wind wave and current varies in different seasons we should consider any direction combinations of environmental loads in the numerical calculation while the environmental parameters are defined as the extreme values in each year they do not happen simultaneously for structural safety assessment we choose the most unfavourable conditions for checking thus in the following study the environmental loads are assumed in the same incidence direction following the literate xue et al 2018 and a total of eight directions are observed and considered it should be noted that copula models can also be adopted to construct multivariate distribution of environmental variables considering incidence direction with measurement data lin et al 2019 in this study it was assumed that the floating structure was subjected to extreme states of wind speed v w wave height h s and current velocity v c in the same direction then the annual extreme eight direction sequences n ne e se s sw w nw were determined by simulating a hindcast model next a conventional single factor statistical method was used to determine the relationship between the extreme environmental conditions and return periods these parameters were implemented as design input variables to calculate the response of the corresponding platform and thus determine whether the floating structure system can meet the safety requirements the extreme values of the oceanic variables and their associated n yr return period can be calculated when the extreme value series fits an extreme value distribution model such as the gumbel distribution weibull distribution log normal distribution or generalised extreme value distribution model tao et al 2013 in this study the widely used gumbel weibull and pearson type iii distribution models were candidate models to determine the marginal distributions of the directional annual extreme series for wind speed significant wave height and current velocity values 2 2 extreme value distribution types 2 2 1 gumbel distribution the gumbel distribution is widely applied to predict the extreme values of oceanic variables the pdf of which can be expressed as follows 1 f x 1 b exp x a b exp x a b b 0 where x represents an oceanic variable and a and b are the location and scale parameters respectively which can be determined from the data samples commonly used methods are the moment method and least squares method 2 2 2 weibull distribution the three parameter weibull distribution the pdf of which is described by eq 2 has been extensively used to fit data in the fields of meteorology and ocean engineering 2 f x c b x a b c 1 exp x a b c x a where x is the variable and a b and c are the location scale and shape parameters respectively which can be determined by using the maximum likelihood method the mean μ and standard deviation σ can be calculated as follows 3 μ b γ 1 1 c σ λ γ 1 2 c γ 2 1 1 c 1 2 where γ is the gamma function it is worth mentioning that the weibull distribution is not only used to describe the statistical distribution of oceanic variables such as wind speed and wave height but it is also capable of determining the extreme response and long term stress distribution of marine engineering structures 2 2 3 pearson type iii distribution pearson type iii distribution is widely applied for land hydrologic and biological statistics it is also applied as the annual extreme value distribution model for random oceanic variables allowing the determination of the extreme values for the n yr return the pdf of the pearson type iii distribution is 4 f x β α γ α x α 1 exp β x x 0 where x is the variable α and β can be estimated by using the maximum likelihood method and γ is the gamma function 2 3 copula theory copula techniques are widely applied to model the joint distribution of environmental parameters in theory a multivariate distribution function can be established by implementing the appropriate copula functions in a marginal distribution model of the metoceanic parameters if f x is a multivariate distribution function with the marginal distribution of different variables f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n x x 1 x 2 x n then a multivariate copula function c u exists additionally for all x r n n the link between the multivariate distribution function f x and the copula function c u can be obtained by applying sklar s theorem as follows sklar 1959 tao et al 2013 salvadori et al 2014 dong et al 2016 zhai et al 2017 5 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n if f n x n is continuous then c u is unique otherwise c u can be uniquely defined on r a n f 1 r a n f 2 r a n f n thus any multivariate distribution function f x can be constructed by applying a suitable copula function c u and multiple marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n assume that f x 1 x 2 x n is the joint probability density function of the random variables x 1 x 2 x n and that f i x i represents the marginal probability distribution of the x i variables and includes a copula density function then the multivariate joint probability density function can be expressed as follows 6 f x 1 x 2 x n n c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 u 2 u n u 1 u 2 u n i 1 n f i x i c u 1 u 2 u n i 1 n f i x i where c u 1 u 2 u n denotes the density function f i x i is the probability density function of the univariate x i because it is a probability distribution function there are several boundary conditions that copula functions should satisfy 7 c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 u 2 u n 0 u i 0 8 c u 1 u 2 u n 0 u 2 u n c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 0 u n c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 u 2 0 0 9 c u 1 u 2 u n 1 u 2 u n c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 1 u n c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 u 2 1 1 copula techniques have been extensively applied to model different combinations of environmental parameter distributions there are various copula functions such as the plackett copula archimedean copula mixed copula and meta elliptical copula functions that are practically applicable for engineering projects in this study convenient and quick establishment of a joint probability model of the metoceanic parameters required that the copula function had a simple form and relatively small number of unknown parameters 2 4 goodness of fit test the random variables encountered in the field of ocean engineering generally have skewed distributions the parameters of which are unknown in advance furthermore the specific distribution types may also be unknown therefore the statistical hypothesis can only include certain assumptions about the variables distribution function and its parameters the results are typically analysed by using a non parametric hypothesis method such as the kolmogorov smirnov k s test root mean square error rmse determination or the akaike information criterion aic the k s test is a well known goodness of fit test that is used to assess whether the distribution accurately describes the sample data at a given level of significance 10 d n sup x f n x f x 11 p d n d n α α where f x denotes the actual distribution of sample data f n x is the theoretical distribution α is a given significance level if d n d n α the original assumption will be refused otherwise the hypothetical distribution will be accepted to select the best distribution function model the goodness of fit of all of the distributions can be evaluated by calculating the rmse and aic the rmse and aic of the fit can be defined as 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n f n x i f x i 2 13 a i c n ln 1 n k i 1 n f n x i f x i 2 2 k where n represents the number of total data points k is the number of unknown parameters in the copula models smaller rmse and aic values correspond to a better fit to the original data 2 5 potential flow theory and the morison equation for large scale floating structures such as semi submersible platforms three dimensional radiation diffraction theories and the morison equation can be used to quantify the wave loads and structural dynamic response the total velocity potential function for the flow field can be expressed as 14 φ φ i φ d φ r re φ i x y z φ d x y z φ r x y z where φ i φ d and φ r denote the incident wave potential scattered wave potential and radiation potential respectively then the pressure distribution on the wet surface of the floating structure in the wave field can be defined by using the linearised bernoulli equation finally the wave loads can be directly calculated by integrating the overall wet surface pressure of the structure 15 p ρ g z ρ φ t 16 f j m j s p n j d s where p is the wet surface pressure n j represents the outward normal vector of the wet surface s the hydrodynamic loads acting on a slender structure can be represented by the morison equation which consists of two elements i e the drag force and inertial force the morison equation for a moving cylinder can be expressed as follows 17 f h f d f i 1 2 c d ρ d u x x u x x c m ρ π d 2 4 u x c m ρ π d 2 4 x where f h is the hydrodynamic load per unit length of the cylinder c d is the drag coefficient ρ is the sea water density d is the diameter of the slender structure u x and u x are the horizontal velocity and acceleration of water particles respectively x and x are the velocity and acceleration of the slender structure respectively c m and c m are the inertia and added mass coefficients respectively 3 a new concept for environmental design parameter estimation as previously discussed design criteria for environmental parameter determination that are based on the idea of independent single extreme metoceanic parameters cannot reflect the actual marine environmental conditions the consequence is ambiguous probability significance to address the imperfection of the codes we developed a new concept for environmental design parameter estimation that is based on the multivariate joint probability distribution of the environmental variables and the extreme response of the floating structure this concept has two main principles and was applied in subsequent examples the first principle is joint probability the environmental loads acting on floating structures such as the wind waves and currents simultaneously occur therefore after the joint probability distribution function is defined environmental parameter and n yr joint return period combinations can be implemented as the environmental design parameters this would yield results that are consistent with the actual environmental conditions however there are countless environmental parameter and n yr joint return period combinations the structural response surface can be used to yield the environmental parameter combinations associated with the maximum structural response the final environmental design parameters can then be derived by adjusting the precision of the environmental combination grids see fig 2 fig 2 shows a schematic diagram of the design environmental parameters determination that have been meshed twice the first meshing with large variable grid finds the parameters corresponding to maximum structural response the final design parameters can be determined in the second meshing with detailed grids around the first determined parameters the fine mesh area is not necessarily at the top of the structural response surface should be defined based on a large number of hydrodynamic response analyses and environmental variables with a n year joint return period are used as input in numerical software the twice meshing process can reduce time consuming numerical simulations and get accurate results a practical structural response surface will be employed and analysed in the following case study the second principle is conditional probability a conditional distribution for the associated environmental parameters was adopted for the new design criteria for a given sea area there may be a primary parameter such as wind speed current velocity or significant wave height that corresponds to the dominant environmental load on floating structures in different seasons this conditional distribution model can be constructed based on available data and subsequently directly applied dong et al 2015 2017 bruserud et al 2018 thus the predominant n yr return period factor and other concomitant environmental parameters most likely to influence the probability are selected as the environmental design parameters a flowchart for this new concept is depicted in fig 3 3 1 construction of trivariate joint probability model in this study the multivariate distribution function was constructed by combining the marginal distributions of the metoceanic variables with selected copula functions such as the trivariate archimedean copulas the archimedean copulas including the clayton copula frank copula and gumbel houggard copula which have a relatively simple structure and few parameters can be applied to construct multivariate joint probability distributions for dependent random variables dong et al 2016 zhai et al 2017 the archimedean copulas can be expressed as follows genest and mackay 1986 genest and rivest 1993 18 c u 1 u 2 u n ϕ 1 ϕ u 1 ϕ u 2 ϕ u n i 1 n ϕ u i ϕ 0 0 o t h e r w i s e where ϕ denotes the generator of the copula it decreases in intervals of u 0 1 and ϕ 1 0 additionally 19 ϕ 1 t ϕ 1 t 0 t ϕ 0 0 ϕ 0 t where ϕ 1 is the inverse function of ϕ three archimedean copulas were implemented in this study to construct trivariate joint distribution functions they are given as follows 1 trivariate frank copula 20 c u v w θ 1 θ ln 1 exp θ u 1 exp θ v 1 exp θ w 1 exp θ 1 2 θ r 2 trivariate clayton copula 21 c u v w θ u θ v θ w θ 1 θ θ 0 3 trivariate gumbel hougaard copula 22 c u v w θ exp ln u θ ln v θ ln w θ 1 θ θ 1 where c represents the copula function u f x x v f y y and w f z z are the optimised marginal distributions of the independent variables of the x y and z candidate distribution types respectively the goodness of fit tests for the marginal distributions have been previously described in sections 2 2 and 2 4 a larger θ which can be estimated by using the maximum likelihood method indicates a stronger correlation between those variables the copula theory introduced in section 2 3 was used to model the multivariate distribution function goodness of fit tests for different copulas were conducted to select the best copula for the joint distribution model 3 2 conditional distribution of the primary metoceanic parameters in practice there is often a certain oceanic variable such as the wind waves or currents that is the predominant load on the marine structure according to the rules of trivariate copula functions when a dominant variable is determined the trivariate distribution becomes a bivariate conditional distribution which can be expressed as follows 23a f y z x f x y z f x c u v w f y f z 23b f x z y f x y z f y c u v w f x f z 23c f x y z f x y z f z c u v w f x f y the above equations eq 23a c can be used to calculate the conditional distribution probability density of the two concomitant variables and the values corresponding to the maximum density i e the most likely occurrence values the predominant environmental load and the corresponding n yr return period was first determined then combinations of the other concomitant variables and maximum probability of occurrence were considered to be the environmental design parameters 4 numerical example a semi submersible platform which operates at a water depth of 1500 m was used to demonstrate the application of this new concept in this study a trivariate joint probability distribution model of h s v w v c was established in consideration of the correlations between various oceanic variables the maximum drift or mooring line tension was taken as the constraint condition and the multivariate joint design standard for the semi submersible platform was determined for a certain joint return period 4 1 semi submersible platform model this semi submersible is a multi functional platform that consists of two pontoons four columns and four braces the relevant dimensions of the floating platform are presented in table 1 there were 12 mooring lines which consisted of four groups that were symmetrically arranged the longitudinal angles between each group of three mooring lines and the platform were 37 40 and 45 as depicted in fig 4 the mooring lines were made of chains and polyester ropes the main properties of the mooring lines are described in table 2 the hydrodynamic model of the semi submersible is shown in fig 5 4 2 marginal distribution of the metoceanic variables a brief description of the method used to establish a marginal distribution model for the metoceanic data implemented in this case study is presented in this section a 30 yr span of hindcast data i e from 1975 to 2005 from the south china sea were sampled in this study the scatter of the annual extremum data for wind speed significant wave height and current velocity are shown in fig 6 for eight directions the optional marginal distributions must be known to construct the multivariate joint distribution functions these distributions can be used to determine the conventional environmental design parameters and corresponding n yr return period several extreme value distribution functions discussed in section 2 2 were used to model the marginal distribution of the metoceanic variables the maximum likelihood method was employed to estimate the distribution function parameters the goodness of fit test mentioned in section 2 5 was conducted to select the best distribution type for the metoceanic data a comprehensive statistical value t see appendix a was adopted to determine the most suitable marginal distribution type fig 7 a c show the empirical and fitted curves for all of the metoceanic data it can be seen that for most of the directions the tails of the weibull and pearson type iii distribution curves followed the trends of the empirical samples thus these distributions were considered to be better fits the significance level α was 0 05 a goodness of fit test was conducted to determine whether these fits were acceptable the goodness of fit test results for the eastward direction are presented as an example in table 3 the results revealed that the actual values of d n for all distributions for h s v w and v c were smaller than the test value of d n α 0 2417 furthermore none of the rmse values were very large indicating that all of the distributions could pass the k s test and that the fits were good comparison with the aic and comprehensive t results see appendix a for all fits revealed that the weibull distribution yielded the best fit additionally the gumbel distribution results tended to be better than those achieved by the pearson type iii model comprehensive comparison of the test results and fitted curves confirmed that the weibull distribution was most suitable to model the marginal distribution of h s v w and v c and was thus suitable for implementation in a joint distribution model 4 3 trivariate joint distribution of h s v w v c as discussed in section 4 2 the weibull distribution was adopted to model the marginal distribution of h s v w and v c three copula functions i e the gumbel hougaard copula clayton copula and frank copula functions described in section 3 1 were chosen to establish the joint probability distribution model for the environmental parameters the method introduced in section 2 5 was also used to evaluate the goodness of fit of these three joint distribution functions the most suitable copula function was selected according to the comprehensive statistical value t the k s test results for each direction α 0 05 are summarised in table 4 the d n values were less than d n α 0 2417 indicating that the three copula functions passed the k s test and that the fit was valid according to the results for the comprehensive statistical value t for all distributions in each direction the clayton copula function was most suitable for the joint distribution of the oceanic variables followed by the gumbel hougaard copula and the frank copula functions thus the clayton copula was selected as the best fitting model to describe the joint probability distribution of the environmental parameters the trivariate joint return period diagram is shown in fig 8 4 4 conditional probability based on a predominant factor single extreme factor methods regard metoceanic variables as independent variables although these methods are convenient ways to determine the environmental design parameters the design criteria are impractical and conservative dong et al 2015 thus conditional probability models were implemented to ensure that the design criteria were established in consideration of the dependence of all metoceanic variables specifically when one predominant factor is determined the other concomitant environmental factors are regarded as conditional factors combinations of the return value of the predominant factor and the most likely pair of the other variables were selected as the environmental design parameters these parameters were incorporated into the design of the floating structure as variables to calculate the extreme response h s v w and v c were respectively applied as predominant factors the conditional probability contours for the other variables are shown in figs 9 11 4 5 environmental design parameter estimation 4 5 1 single extreme factor method the conventional method for environmental design parameter estimation involves determining the most appropriate distribution model for the primary metoceanic data and individually determining each environmental parameter and corresponding n yr return period let the retfig 7 a c show the empirical and fitted curves for all of the metoceanic data it can be seen that for most of the directions the tails of the weibull and pearson type iii distribution curves followed the trends of the empirical samples thus these distributions were considered to be better fits the significance level α was 0 05 a goodness of fit test was conducted to determine whether these fits were acceptable the goodness of fit test results for the eastward direction are presented as an example in table 3 urn period n i 1 p i then the n yr return period value x p i i for variables x i can be expressed as 24 x p i i f x i 1 1 p i where f x i 1 is the inverse function of the variable s cumulative probability function f x i in this case the respective relationships between the environmental parameters an n yr return period were defined by applying the weibull distribution the environmental design parameters were substituted into the semi submersible platform system and the maximum drift and mooring line tension values were calculated the environmental design parameters and corresponding structural response as determined by using the conventional method are presented in table 5 and fig 12 respectively because the structural response is related to the incidence of each environmental load the drift in the diagram corresponding to the maximum displacement of a semi submersible on the sea surface is s max x max 2 y max 2 the maximum force corresponds to the maximum tension of 12 mooring lines that are attached to a platform that is subject to multi directional environmental loading table 5 presents the return values for h s v w and v c under the condition of a 100 yr return period the corresponding joint return period for h s v w v c was determined by applying a trivariate joint probability model the results demonstrate that the joint return period obtained based on the assumption of independent variables was larger than that calculated based on trivariate joint probability for example under the condition that the return period for each environmental design parameter is 100 yrs the joint return period for h s v w v c as determined on the basis of the independence assumption is 1003 1000000 yrs for the eastward direction in contrast the joint return period as determined under the conditions of a trivariate probability model is 354543 85 yrs this finding indicates that the conventional design criteria are more conservative 4 5 2 multivariate joint probability method the joint distribution model of h s v w v c was constructed by implementing the clayton copula function and applying a marginal distribution to the oceanic variables the joint return period diagram is shown in fig 8 there were numerous environmental combinations for each joint return period the combined values for the environmental parameters were extracted according to a certain grid precision then the combined values were incorporated into the semi submersible platform model and the structural response surface of the semi submersible platform was calculated fig 13 the h s v w v c combinations associated with the maximum drift of the platform were determined for all responses taken as the central points and then used to increase the measurement precision for the relevant environment variables subsequently the grid mesh was refined the environmental parameter combinations were incorporated into the semi submersible platform model and the structural response was calculated again the combination of values for h s v w and v c corresponding to a certain joint return period with the maximum structural response were determined to be the environmental design parameters table 6 presents the results of the multivariate joint probability method for example the environmental design parameters for the eastward direction were determined to be h s 12 55 m v w 13 00 m s and v c 1 10 m s the combined values indicate that for a 100 yr joint return period the structure will be maximally displaced 80 42 m when the significant wave height is 12 55 m the wind speed is 13 00 m s and the current velocity is 1 10 m s 4 5 3 conditional probability method there are three types of conditional distributions in this case i e f v c v w h s v c v w h s f v c h s v w v c h s v w and f h s v w v c h s v w v c the predominant factors of which are h s v w and v c respectively after the predominant factor h s v w or v c was determined the most likely pairs of v w v c h s v c or h s v w were calculated combinations of these parameters were adopted as the environmental design parameters then the joint return period for the conditional design values of h s v w v c was determined table 7 presents the results that were obtained by using the conditional probability method in practice this method takes into account the most likely case of each of the other relevant variables when the predominant environmental load is determined thus it reflects more realistic marine environmental conditions fig 14 illustrates the structural response for each of the corresponding environmental design parameters 4 6 degree of conservatism evaluation fig 15 illustrates the environmental design parameters each with a 100 yr return period that were determined based on five different design criteria 1 represents the environmental design parameters determined by using the conventional method as previously mentioned they are simple combinations of single extreme factors with independently determined 100 yr return period results 2 3 and 4 denote the results of applying conditional distribution under the conditions of a predominant factor and most likely pair of the other variables for a 100 yr return period the predominant factors were the wind waves and currents respectively 5 represents the environmental design parameters that were determined based on trivariate joint distribution and in consideration of the extreme structural response they are combinations of variables with a 100 yr joint return period corresponding to the maximum structural response it is clear that the values for the environmental design parameters determined by using the conventional method were lower than those based on the new design criteria fig 16 shows the joint return period and structural drift results for each of the five design methods the joint return period value corresponding to the environmental design parameters determined by using the proposed method was much smaller than that determined by using the single extreme factor method the maximum response of the structure differed according to the design criteria and the conventional method yielded the highest structural drift value in this case conventional design parameters as input correspond to the maximum structural response the ratio range of response from other design criterions to maximum response in different directions are 0 28 0 57 0 32 0 56 0 17 0 43 0 33 0 50 0 13 0 69 0 23 0 64 0 18 0 59 and 0 34 0 49 it is clear that the conventional design method is conservative and that the proposed design criteria can reduce the construction cost 5 conclusions based on the marginal distributions of the single extreme factors and the results of implementing the multivariate copula functions a trivariate probability distribution model of wind speed significant wave height and current velocity was constructed then a new method that takes into account the correlations between the relevant oceanic variables in the determination of the environmental design parameters was developed lastly the conservatism of the single extreme factor method was assessed the following valuable conclusions were obtained through the case study 1 the use of copula techniques to model different combinations of the marine environmental parameters is applicable in the field of ocean engineering metoceanic data from the south china sea were applied in this study to evaluate the efficacy of the trivariate joint probability model the results confirmed a good fit to the data 2 the joint design method for marine environmental parameters which combines a conditional probability method and multivariate joint probability method accounts for the dependency of oceanic variables thus this study provides a reasonable theoretical basis for the determination of design parameters furthermore the results are believed to more accurately reflect the actual marine conditions 3 the values for the environmental design parameters obtained by using the conventional single extreme factor method were higher than those determined by using the proposed method the values for the corresponding joint return period and structural response were also higher thus the conventional method yields conservative results this means that the proposed design method can significantly reduce the project cost however the structural safety performance needs to be further evaluated a multi load joint distribution can be established by combining univariate marginal distributions for each random variable with copula functions that describe the dependence structure between these variables an advantage of such copula models is that they allow greater flexibility in constructing joint distributions for environmental variables with arbitrary marginal distributions also these marginal distributions and the correlation or dependence structure can be considered separately the structural response surface of the example semi submersible platform is similar thus the deign environmental parameters can also be determined using the proposed method in other sea areas such as north atlantic sea predictably the final results will vary with observed environmental data using the same platform model to obtain a dynamic response solution for floating structures it is urgent that the relationship between the structural response and three or more environmental variables be explored through the use of a reasonable interpolation technique and an intelligent algorithm instead

21389,floating structure designs require an environmental condition simulation and corresponding design parameter determination typically the design values are defined by individually calculating the n yr return period however this not only results in overestimation but it also reduces the accuracy of the structural reliability analysis therefore a new environmental design parameter estimation method which is based on the joint distribution of multiple loads and conditional joint probability models was developed a multivariate joint model for the metoceanic parameters of the south china sea based on 30 yrs of annual extremum hindcast data and conditional probability models with one predominant factor were established the most likely pair of other variables were also considered because of the complexity and variability of the environmental conditions environmental parameters with n yr joint return period as well as the structural response surface corresponding to the most unsafe conditions were determined to derive design parameters the possible conservatism of the conventional design standard was assessed by applying this joint design criterion to a semi submersible platform example the results indicate the design response is much more conservative than those obtained using proposed criteria neither multivariate nor conditional joint models the proposed design criteria can significantly reduce construction cost keywords floating structures environmental design parameters single extreme factor multivariate joint model conditional probability model 1 introduction floating structures such as semi submersible platforms and wind power plants must operate under complex marine conditions for a long period of time during severe weather processes external loads such as winds waves and currents may severely damage floating structures see fig 1 the selection of design criteria to define extreme metoceanic loading under marine environmental conditions has become a common way to evaluate the safety structural type and engineering costs thus the design and operation of floating structures require accurate determination of the environmental design parameters which should entail in situ measurements or hindcast datasets the likelihood of the occurrence of an extreme marine event is low however the consequences of such an event can be severe therefore extreme environmental conditions which are often considered to be independent variables are typically determined by simply combining each of the single extreme environmental parameters with an n yr return period in general a long return period is accompanied by severe environmental loads and a high security requirement thus the method of using single extreme factors may yield quite conservative results as each oceanic variable would be considered to be independent in general for the design of offshore and floating structures for the china bohai sea or other seas surrounding china such as a jacket or semi submersible platform environmental design parameters are always determined using 50 yr or 100 yr return values however this method is thought to not only be conservative and arbitrary but also lack a reasonable theoretical basis dong et al 2012 bruserud et al 2018 proposed a joint description of waves and currents for periods corresponding the ultimate and accidental limit states i e 100 and 10 000 years the vessel mooring was designed to satisfy 100 yr extreme conditions with factors of safety and stanisic et al 2019 addressed the reliability of the mooring chain and pile chen et al 2019 performed joint probability analysis of extreme wave heights and surges along china s coasts based on the 35 year extreme data and 50 yr and 100 yr return period events are calculated with the joint probability density function the results indicate that the commonly used empirical method for the coastal water of china might be too conservative in meeting the engineering design criteria raed et al 2020 assessed the extreme hydrodynamic response of a wind turbine semi submersible platform resulting from the extreme sea states which are identified based on iform with a 50 year return period li et al 2020 generated undisturbed irregular wave fields based on the jonswap spectra with different significant wave heights spectral peak periods and spectral factors for the 100 yr cyclone and the second order resonant motions of a deep draft semi submersible under irregular wave excitation were investigated safety and performance assessment for floating structures under extreme environmental conditions with 50 yr or 100 yr return period is necessary in preliminary design stage a conventional method for calculating extreme metoceanic loads entails performing statistical analysis using measured or hindcast obtained environmental variables additionally all of the dynamic environmental parameters corresponding to an n yr return period are selected as design parameters as an example the 100 yr wind speed 100 yr significant wave height and 100 yr current velocity can be adopted as design parameters by using these design parameters the viability of floating structures in a harsh environment can be improved however the probability of different extreme environmental loads appearing in the service sea area is low moreover such loads are less likely to simultaneously occur thus once they are adopted as design parameters the results will not accurately reflect the actual environmental conditions furthermore this will cause parameter significance ambiguity and negatively impact the reliability of the prediction and the corresponding safety analysis yielding unrealistic results dong et al 2012 higher value design parameters are associated with larger design structures and higher investments it is essential to develop a reasonable and reliable estimation of the environmental design criteria for floating structure designs that takes into account the dependency of the environmental variables to reliably estimate the effects of various environmental conditions on marine structures many researchers and research institutions have been focusing on investigating the joint probability distributions of different metoceanic parameters to simulate multiple loads coles and tawn 1994 liu et al 1995 liu et al 1996 morton and bowers 1996 bitner gregersen 2015 antão and guedes soares 2016 vanem 2017 bruserud et al 2018 jäger et al 2019 lin and dong 2019 lin et al 2020 american petroleum institute api code 1995 utilises three different criteria to determine the design conditions for a fixed offshore platform 1 combinations of the return values for the 100 yr wind speed 100 yr current velocity and 100 yr wave height 2 the 100 yr wave height with concomitant wind speed and current velocity and 3 any reasonable combination of wind speed wave height and current velocity which will yield predictions related to a 100 yr structural response such as the base shear force and overturning moment lloyd s register of shipping 1999 proposed the use of combinations of environmental design loads for offshore mobile structures as follows 1 a combination of the return values of the 100 yr wave height 10 yr current velocity and 10 yr wind speed and 2 a combination of the 100 yr wave height and current velocity and 10 yr wind speed the lack of a reasonable theoretical basis for these criteria has prevented designers from reaching a consensus and could lead to completely different results in fact both of these codes are based on the combined effects of the wind waves and currents acting on the marine structures thus accurate information about the extreme environmental loads must be obtained by accounting for the simultaneous occurrence of metoceanic variables such as waves the wind and currents it is for this reason that the construction and solution of a multivariate joint probability distribution model has become a hot topic in the field of marine engineering yue et al 1999 liu et al 2002a dnv rp c205 2007 there has been progress in the area of developing joint probability models with multivariate non gaussian and correlative variables ferreira and guedes soares 2002 proposed a bivariate density function to fit the significant wave height and mean wave period dong et al 2013 proposed a bivariate maximum entropy distribution for the significant wave height and peak period dong et al 2015 presented a trivariate maximum entropy distribution for the significant wave height wind speed and relative direction it provides a good reference for structural design lucas and guedes soares 2015 proposed bivariate distributions for the significant wave height and mean wave period of swells wind sea components and combined sea states muraleedharan et al 2015 modelled the distribution of the significant wave height and associated peak periods by using data from the north atlantic ocean dong et al 2017 constructed a multivariate maximum entropy distribution this model was applied in the joint design of marine environmental elements bruserud et al 2018 established a joint description of waves and hindcast currents and then applied it to a simplified load case after using it to assess the conservatism of the norwegian design standard they found that the norwegian design standard is not necessarily conservative at the uls or als level horn et al 2018 modelled the joint distribution of all relevant environmental parameters with the directional descriptions used in the design of offshore structures sandvik et al 2019 presented three stochastic bivariate time series models of waves in the north sea and evaluated their applicability by performing simulations to explore floating bridge designs cheng et al 2019 investigated the long term joint distribution of the environmental parameters related to the conditions in a norwegian fjord to date studies on the effects of multiple loads on offshore structures have mainly focused on bivariate distribution models liu et al 2002b proposed a bivariate poisson mixed gumbel distribution to estimate the joint probability of wind speeds and wave heights in the east china sea dong et al 2004 2005 2007 2008 applied various poisson bi variable distributions to establish environmental design parameters that can concurrently account for the wind speed and wave height dong et al 2012 considered the service term and risk probability of jacket platforms to calculate the joint occurrence period of wind speed and wave heights ewans and jonathan 2014 applied the conditional extremes model to perform joint estimation of the significant wave height and peak period at a northern north sea location under extreme storm peak conditions vanem 2016 analysed the potential effects of climate change on the joint distribution of the significant wave height and wave period their results indicated a higher correlation in the future climate as a results of climate change chen et al 2019 conducted a joint probability analysis of extreme wave heights and surges along china s coasts to improve the design of coastal structures lin et al 2020 modelled the long term joint distribution of the significant wave height and mean zero crossing wave period using a copula mixture it is well known that the conventional method of independently determining the n yr return period for each metoceanic variable yields conservative results moreover the extent of conservatism is uncertain therefore in this study based on a total of 30 yrs of annual extremum wind wave and current data from the south china sea a single extreme factor distribution model was established then to increase the accuracy of floating structure analysis a combined trivariate multi load joint distribution and conditional joint probability model of principal elements was developed based on the multivariate joint probability and structural extreme response surface results more reasonable and practical criteria for the determination of the environmental design parameters was established the results of this new concept were compared to those of the conventional design method the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to establish a trivariate joint distribution model of the significant wave height wind speed and current velocity based on hindcast data to increase the accuracy of floating structure analysis 2 to propose a new concept for environmental design parameter estimation that has a reasonable theoretical basis a semi submersible model operated at a 1500 m water depth was used to demonstrate the application of the new concept and 3 to assess the possible conservatism of the traditional design standard by applying this joint probability model in a case study this paper is organised as follows a brief introduction to the existing environmental design parameter estimation methods is presented in section 2 then the new concept for environmental design parameter determination is introduced in section 3 a numerical example is validated and assessed in section 4 and some conclusions are reported in section 5 2 existing environmental design parameter estimation theories there is no unified approach to establishing a joint probability model of metoceanic parameters and it is difficult to benchmark different methods some scholars have their own preferred methods and justifications bruserud et al 2018 in this study a multivariate joint distribution model of the environmental variables was constructed by integrating a multivariate copula function into a marginal distribution model of the primary parameters in this section existing environmental design parameter estimation theories including those that entail the use of extreme value distribution types copula theory goodness of fit tests and potential flow theory are briefly introduced 2 1 conventional environmental design parameter estimation methods single extreme factor statistical analysis is a conventional approach that is used to calculate marine environmental design parameters this method extracts the typical 30 yr extremum series data on the wind wave and current parameters from in situ measurement results or hindcast datasets the data is then fit using extreme value distribution functions additionally the n yr return values for various ocean related variables are selected as the design parameters in general the incidence direction of wind wave and current varies in different seasons we should consider any direction combinations of environmental loads in the numerical calculation while the environmental parameters are defined as the extreme values in each year they do not happen simultaneously for structural safety assessment we choose the most unfavourable conditions for checking thus in the following study the environmental loads are assumed in the same incidence direction following the literate xue et al 2018 and a total of eight directions are observed and considered it should be noted that copula models can also be adopted to construct multivariate distribution of environmental variables considering incidence direction with measurement data lin et al 2019 in this study it was assumed that the floating structure was subjected to extreme states of wind speed v w wave height h s and current velocity v c in the same direction then the annual extreme eight direction sequences n ne e se s sw w nw were determined by simulating a hindcast model next a conventional single factor statistical method was used to determine the relationship between the extreme environmental conditions and return periods these parameters were implemented as design input variables to calculate the response of the corresponding platform and thus determine whether the floating structure system can meet the safety requirements the extreme values of the oceanic variables and their associated n yr return period can be calculated when the extreme value series fits an extreme value distribution model such as the gumbel distribution weibull distribution log normal distribution or generalised extreme value distribution model tao et al 2013 in this study the widely used gumbel weibull and pearson type iii distribution models were candidate models to determine the marginal distributions of the directional annual extreme series for wind speed significant wave height and current velocity values 2 2 extreme value distribution types 2 2 1 gumbel distribution the gumbel distribution is widely applied to predict the extreme values of oceanic variables the pdf of which can be expressed as follows 1 f x 1 b exp x a b exp x a b b 0 where x represents an oceanic variable and a and b are the location and scale parameters respectively which can be determined from the data samples commonly used methods are the moment method and least squares method 2 2 2 weibull distribution the three parameter weibull distribution the pdf of which is described by eq 2 has been extensively used to fit data in the fields of meteorology and ocean engineering 2 f x c b x a b c 1 exp x a b c x a where x is the variable and a b and c are the location scale and shape parameters respectively which can be determined by using the maximum likelihood method the mean μ and standard deviation σ can be calculated as follows 3 μ b γ 1 1 c σ λ γ 1 2 c γ 2 1 1 c 1 2 where γ is the gamma function it is worth mentioning that the weibull distribution is not only used to describe the statistical distribution of oceanic variables such as wind speed and wave height but it is also capable of determining the extreme response and long term stress distribution of marine engineering structures 2 2 3 pearson type iii distribution pearson type iii distribution is widely applied for land hydrologic and biological statistics it is also applied as the annual extreme value distribution model for random oceanic variables allowing the determination of the extreme values for the n yr return the pdf of the pearson type iii distribution is 4 f x β α γ α x α 1 exp β x x 0 where x is the variable α and β can be estimated by using the maximum likelihood method and γ is the gamma function 2 3 copula theory copula techniques are widely applied to model the joint distribution of environmental parameters in theory a multivariate distribution function can be established by implementing the appropriate copula functions in a marginal distribution model of the metoceanic parameters if f x is a multivariate distribution function with the marginal distribution of different variables f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n x x 1 x 2 x n then a multivariate copula function c u exists additionally for all x r n n the link between the multivariate distribution function f x and the copula function c u can be obtained by applying sklar s theorem as follows sklar 1959 tao et al 2013 salvadori et al 2014 dong et al 2016 zhai et al 2017 5 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n if f n x n is continuous then c u is unique otherwise c u can be uniquely defined on r a n f 1 r a n f 2 r a n f n thus any multivariate distribution function f x can be constructed by applying a suitable copula function c u and multiple marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n assume that f x 1 x 2 x n is the joint probability density function of the random variables x 1 x 2 x n and that f i x i represents the marginal probability distribution of the x i variables and includes a copula density function then the multivariate joint probability density function can be expressed as follows 6 f x 1 x 2 x n n c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 u 2 u n u 1 u 2 u n i 1 n f i x i c u 1 u 2 u n i 1 n f i x i where c u 1 u 2 u n denotes the density function f i x i is the probability density function of the univariate x i because it is a probability distribution function there are several boundary conditions that copula functions should satisfy 7 c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 u 2 u n 0 u i 0 8 c u 1 u 2 u n 0 u 2 u n c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 0 u n c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 u 2 0 0 9 c u 1 u 2 u n 1 u 2 u n c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 1 u n c u 1 u 2 u n u 1 u 2 1 1 copula techniques have been extensively applied to model different combinations of environmental parameter distributions there are various copula functions such as the plackett copula archimedean copula mixed copula and meta elliptical copula functions that are practically applicable for engineering projects in this study convenient and quick establishment of a joint probability model of the metoceanic parameters required that the copula function had a simple form and relatively small number of unknown parameters 2 4 goodness of fit test the random variables encountered in the field of ocean engineering generally have skewed distributions the parameters of which are unknown in advance furthermore the specific distribution types may also be unknown therefore the statistical hypothesis can only include certain assumptions about the variables distribution function and its parameters the results are typically analysed by using a non parametric hypothesis method such as the kolmogorov smirnov k s test root mean square error rmse determination or the akaike information criterion aic the k s test is a well known goodness of fit test that is used to assess whether the distribution accurately describes the sample data at a given level of significance 10 d n sup x f n x f x 11 p d n d n α α where f x denotes the actual distribution of sample data f n x is the theoretical distribution α is a given significance level if d n d n α the original assumption will be refused otherwise the hypothetical distribution will be accepted to select the best distribution function model the goodness of fit of all of the distributions can be evaluated by calculating the rmse and aic the rmse and aic of the fit can be defined as 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n f n x i f x i 2 13 a i c n ln 1 n k i 1 n f n x i f x i 2 2 k where n represents the number of total data points k is the number of unknown parameters in the copula models smaller rmse and aic values correspond to a better fit to the original data 2 5 potential flow theory and the morison equation for large scale floating structures such as semi submersible platforms three dimensional radiation diffraction theories and the morison equation can be used to quantify the wave loads and structural dynamic response the total velocity potential function for the flow field can be expressed as 14 φ φ i φ d φ r re φ i x y z φ d x y z φ r x y z where φ i φ d and φ r denote the incident wave potential scattered wave potential and radiation potential respectively then the pressure distribution on the wet surface of the floating structure in the wave field can be defined by using the linearised bernoulli equation finally the wave loads can be directly calculated by integrating the overall wet surface pressure of the structure 15 p ρ g z ρ φ t 16 f j m j s p n j d s where p is the wet surface pressure n j represents the outward normal vector of the wet surface s the hydrodynamic loads acting on a slender structure can be represented by the morison equation which consists of two elements i e the drag force and inertial force the morison equation for a moving cylinder can be expressed as follows 17 f h f d f i 1 2 c d ρ d u x x u x x c m ρ π d 2 4 u x c m ρ π d 2 4 x where f h is the hydrodynamic load per unit length of the cylinder c d is the drag coefficient ρ is the sea water density d is the diameter of the slender structure u x and u x are the horizontal velocity and acceleration of water particles respectively x and x are the velocity and acceleration of the slender structure respectively c m and c m are the inertia and added mass coefficients respectively 3 a new concept for environmental design parameter estimation as previously discussed design criteria for environmental parameter determination that are based on the idea of independent single extreme metoceanic parameters cannot reflect the actual marine environmental conditions the consequence is ambiguous probability significance to address the imperfection of the codes we developed a new concept for environmental design parameter estimation that is based on the multivariate joint probability distribution of the environmental variables and the extreme response of the floating structure this concept has two main principles and was applied in subsequent examples the first principle is joint probability the environmental loads acting on floating structures such as the wind waves and currents simultaneously occur therefore after the joint probability distribution function is defined environmental parameter and n yr joint return period combinations can be implemented as the environmental design parameters this would yield results that are consistent with the actual environmental conditions however there are countless environmental parameter and n yr joint return period combinations the structural response surface can be used to yield the environmental parameter combinations associated with the maximum structural response the final environmental design parameters can then be derived by adjusting the precision of the environmental combination grids see fig 2 fig 2 shows a schematic diagram of the design environmental parameters determination that have been meshed twice the first meshing with large variable grid finds the parameters corresponding to maximum structural response the final design parameters can be determined in the second meshing with detailed grids around the first determined parameters the fine mesh area is not necessarily at the top of the structural response surface should be defined based on a large number of hydrodynamic response analyses and environmental variables with a n year joint return period are used as input in numerical software the twice meshing process can reduce time consuming numerical simulations and get accurate results a practical structural response surface will be employed and analysed in the following case study the second principle is conditional probability a conditional distribution for the associated environmental parameters was adopted for the new design criteria for a given sea area there may be a primary parameter such as wind speed current velocity or significant wave height that corresponds to the dominant environmental load on floating structures in different seasons this conditional distribution model can be constructed based on available data and subsequently directly applied dong et al 2015 2017 bruserud et al 2018 thus the predominant n yr return period factor and other concomitant environmental parameters most likely to influence the probability are selected as the environmental design parameters a flowchart for this new concept is depicted in fig 3 3 1 construction of trivariate joint probability model in this study the multivariate distribution function was constructed by combining the marginal distributions of the metoceanic variables with selected copula functions such as the trivariate archimedean copulas the archimedean copulas including the clayton copula frank copula and gumbel houggard copula which have a relatively simple structure and few parameters can be applied to construct multivariate joint probability distributions for dependent random variables dong et al 2016 zhai et al 2017 the archimedean copulas can be expressed as follows genest and mackay 1986 genest and rivest 1993 18 c u 1 u 2 u n ϕ 1 ϕ u 1 ϕ u 2 ϕ u n i 1 n ϕ u i ϕ 0 0 o t h e r w i s e where ϕ denotes the generator of the copula it decreases in intervals of u 0 1 and ϕ 1 0 additionally 19 ϕ 1 t ϕ 1 t 0 t ϕ 0 0 ϕ 0 t where ϕ 1 is the inverse function of ϕ three archimedean copulas were implemented in this study to construct trivariate joint distribution functions they are given as follows 1 trivariate frank copula 20 c u v w θ 1 θ ln 1 exp θ u 1 exp θ v 1 exp θ w 1 exp θ 1 2 θ r 2 trivariate clayton copula 21 c u v w θ u θ v θ w θ 1 θ θ 0 3 trivariate gumbel hougaard copula 22 c u v w θ exp ln u θ ln v θ ln w θ 1 θ θ 1 where c represents the copula function u f x x v f y y and w f z z are the optimised marginal distributions of the independent variables of the x y and z candidate distribution types respectively the goodness of fit tests for the marginal distributions have been previously described in sections 2 2 and 2 4 a larger θ which can be estimated by using the maximum likelihood method indicates a stronger correlation between those variables the copula theory introduced in section 2 3 was used to model the multivariate distribution function goodness of fit tests for different copulas were conducted to select the best copula for the joint distribution model 3 2 conditional distribution of the primary metoceanic parameters in practice there is often a certain oceanic variable such as the wind waves or currents that is the predominant load on the marine structure according to the rules of trivariate copula functions when a dominant variable is determined the trivariate distribution becomes a bivariate conditional distribution which can be expressed as follows 23a f y z x f x y z f x c u v w f y f z 23b f x z y f x y z f y c u v w f x f z 23c f x y z f x y z f z c u v w f x f y the above equations eq 23a c can be used to calculate the conditional distribution probability density of the two concomitant variables and the values corresponding to the maximum density i e the most likely occurrence values the predominant environmental load and the corresponding n yr return period was first determined then combinations of the other concomitant variables and maximum probability of occurrence were considered to be the environmental design parameters 4 numerical example a semi submersible platform which operates at a water depth of 1500 m was used to demonstrate the application of this new concept in this study a trivariate joint probability distribution model of h s v w v c was established in consideration of the correlations between various oceanic variables the maximum drift or mooring line tension was taken as the constraint condition and the multivariate joint design standard for the semi submersible platform was determined for a certain joint return period 4 1 semi submersible platform model this semi submersible is a multi functional platform that consists of two pontoons four columns and four braces the relevant dimensions of the floating platform are presented in table 1 there were 12 mooring lines which consisted of four groups that were symmetrically arranged the longitudinal angles between each group of three mooring lines and the platform were 37 40 and 45 as depicted in fig 4 the mooring lines were made of chains and polyester ropes the main properties of the mooring lines are described in table 2 the hydrodynamic model of the semi submersible is shown in fig 5 4 2 marginal distribution of the metoceanic variables a brief description of the method used to establish a marginal distribution model for the metoceanic data implemented in this case study is presented in this section a 30 yr span of hindcast data i e from 1975 to 2005 from the south china sea were sampled in this study the scatter of the annual extremum data for wind speed significant wave height and current velocity are shown in fig 6 for eight directions the optional marginal distributions must be known to construct the multivariate joint distribution functions these distributions can be used to determine the conventional environmental design parameters and corresponding n yr return period several extreme value distribution functions discussed in section 2 2 were used to model the marginal distribution of the metoceanic variables the maximum likelihood method was employed to estimate the distribution function parameters the goodness of fit test mentioned in section 2 5 was conducted to select the best distribution type for the metoceanic data a comprehensive statistical value t see appendix a was adopted to determine the most suitable marginal distribution type fig 7 a c show the empirical and fitted curves for all of the metoceanic data it can be seen that for most of the directions the tails of the weibull and pearson type iii distribution curves followed the trends of the empirical samples thus these distributions were considered to be better fits the significance level α was 0 05 a goodness of fit test was conducted to determine whether these fits were acceptable the goodness of fit test results for the eastward direction are presented as an example in table 3 the results revealed that the actual values of d n for all distributions for h s v w and v c were smaller than the test value of d n α 0 2417 furthermore none of the rmse values were very large indicating that all of the distributions could pass the k s test and that the fits were good comparison with the aic and comprehensive t results see appendix a for all fits revealed that the weibull distribution yielded the best fit additionally the gumbel distribution results tended to be better than those achieved by the pearson type iii model comprehensive comparison of the test results and fitted curves confirmed that the weibull distribution was most suitable to model the marginal distribution of h s v w and v c and was thus suitable for implementation in a joint distribution model 4 3 trivariate joint distribution of h s v w v c as discussed in section 4 2 the weibull distribution was adopted to model the marginal distribution of h s v w and v c three copula functions i e the gumbel hougaard copula clayton copula and frank copula functions described in section 3 1 were chosen to establish the joint probability distribution model for the environmental parameters the method introduced in section 2 5 was also used to evaluate the goodness of fit of these three joint distribution functions the most suitable copula function was selected according to the comprehensive statistical value t the k s test results for each direction α 0 05 are summarised in table 4 the d n values were less than d n α 0 2417 indicating that the three copula functions passed the k s test and that the fit was valid according to the results for the comprehensive statistical value t for all distributions in each direction the clayton copula function was most suitable for the joint distribution of the oceanic variables followed by the gumbel hougaard copula and the frank copula functions thus the clayton copula was selected as the best fitting model to describe the joint probability distribution of the environmental parameters the trivariate joint return period diagram is shown in fig 8 4 4 conditional probability based on a predominant factor single extreme factor methods regard metoceanic variables as independent variables although these methods are convenient ways to determine the environmental design parameters the design criteria are impractical and conservative dong et al 2015 thus conditional probability models were implemented to ensure that the design criteria were established in consideration of the dependence of all metoceanic variables specifically when one predominant factor is determined the other concomitant environmental factors are regarded as conditional factors combinations of the return value of the predominant factor and the most likely pair of the other variables were selected as the environmental design parameters these parameters were incorporated into the design of the floating structure as variables to calculate the extreme response h s v w and v c were respectively applied as predominant factors the conditional probability contours for the other variables are shown in figs 9 11 4 5 environmental design parameter estimation 4 5 1 single extreme factor method the conventional method for environmental design parameter estimation involves determining the most appropriate distribution model for the primary metoceanic data and individually determining each environmental parameter and corresponding n yr return period let the retfig 7 a c show the empirical and fitted curves for all of the metoceanic data it can be seen that for most of the directions the tails of the weibull and pearson type iii distribution curves followed the trends of the empirical samples thus these distributions were considered to be better fits the significance level α was 0 05 a goodness of fit test was conducted to determine whether these fits were acceptable the goodness of fit test results for the eastward direction are presented as an example in table 3 urn period n i 1 p i then the n yr return period value x p i i for variables x i can be expressed as 24 x p i i f x i 1 1 p i where f x i 1 is the inverse function of the variable s cumulative probability function f x i in this case the respective relationships between the environmental parameters an n yr return period were defined by applying the weibull distribution the environmental design parameters were substituted into the semi submersible platform system and the maximum drift and mooring line tension values were calculated the environmental design parameters and corresponding structural response as determined by using the conventional method are presented in table 5 and fig 12 respectively because the structural response is related to the incidence of each environmental load the drift in the diagram corresponding to the maximum displacement of a semi submersible on the sea surface is s max x max 2 y max 2 the maximum force corresponds to the maximum tension of 12 mooring lines that are attached to a platform that is subject to multi directional environmental loading table 5 presents the return values for h s v w and v c under the condition of a 100 yr return period the corresponding joint return period for h s v w v c was determined by applying a trivariate joint probability model the results demonstrate that the joint return period obtained based on the assumption of independent variables was larger than that calculated based on trivariate joint probability for example under the condition that the return period for each environmental design parameter is 100 yrs the joint return period for h s v w v c as determined on the basis of the independence assumption is 1003 1000000 yrs for the eastward direction in contrast the joint return period as determined under the conditions of a trivariate probability model is 354543 85 yrs this finding indicates that the conventional design criteria are more conservative 4 5 2 multivariate joint probability method the joint distribution model of h s v w v c was constructed by implementing the clayton copula function and applying a marginal distribution to the oceanic variables the joint return period diagram is shown in fig 8 there were numerous environmental combinations for each joint return period the combined values for the environmental parameters were extracted according to a certain grid precision then the combined values were incorporated into the semi submersible platform model and the structural response surface of the semi submersible platform was calculated fig 13 the h s v w v c combinations associated with the maximum drift of the platform were determined for all responses taken as the central points and then used to increase the measurement precision for the relevant environment variables subsequently the grid mesh was refined the environmental parameter combinations were incorporated into the semi submersible platform model and the structural response was calculated again the combination of values for h s v w and v c corresponding to a certain joint return period with the maximum structural response were determined to be the environmental design parameters table 6 presents the results of the multivariate joint probability method for example the environmental design parameters for the eastward direction were determined to be h s 12 55 m v w 13 00 m s and v c 1 10 m s the combined values indicate that for a 100 yr joint return period the structure will be maximally displaced 80 42 m when the significant wave height is 12 55 m the wind speed is 13 00 m s and the current velocity is 1 10 m s 4 5 3 conditional probability method there are three types of conditional distributions in this case i e f v c v w h s v c v w h s f v c h s v w v c h s v w and f h s v w v c h s v w v c the predominant factors of which are h s v w and v c respectively after the predominant factor h s v w or v c was determined the most likely pairs of v w v c h s v c or h s v w were calculated combinations of these parameters were adopted as the environmental design parameters then the joint return period for the conditional design values of h s v w v c was determined table 7 presents the results that were obtained by using the conditional probability method in practice this method takes into account the most likely case of each of the other relevant variables when the predominant environmental load is determined thus it reflects more realistic marine environmental conditions fig 14 illustrates the structural response for each of the corresponding environmental design parameters 4 6 degree of conservatism evaluation fig 15 illustrates the environmental design parameters each with a 100 yr return period that were determined based on five different design criteria 1 represents the environmental design parameters determined by using the conventional method as previously mentioned they are simple combinations of single extreme factors with independently determined 100 yr return period results 2 3 and 4 denote the results of applying conditional distribution under the conditions of a predominant factor and most likely pair of the other variables for a 100 yr return period the predominant factors were the wind waves and currents respectively 5 represents the environmental design parameters that were determined based on trivariate joint distribution and in consideration of the extreme structural response they are combinations of variables with a 100 yr joint return period corresponding to the maximum structural response it is clear that the values for the environmental design parameters determined by using the conventional method were lower than those based on the new design criteria fig 16 shows the joint return period and structural drift results for each of the five design methods the joint return period value corresponding to the environmental design parameters determined by using the proposed method was much smaller than that determined by using the single extreme factor method the maximum response of the structure differed according to the design criteria and the conventional method yielded the highest structural drift value in this case conventional design parameters as input correspond to the maximum structural response the ratio range of response from other design criterions to maximum response in different directions are 0 28 0 57 0 32 0 56 0 17 0 43 0 33 0 50 0 13 0 69 0 23 0 64 0 18 0 59 and 0 34 0 49 it is clear that the conventional design method is conservative and that the proposed design criteria can reduce the construction cost 5 conclusions based on the marginal distributions of the single extreme factors and the results of implementing the multivariate copula functions a trivariate probability distribution model of wind speed significant wave height and current velocity was constructed then a new method that takes into account the correlations between the relevant oceanic variables in the determination of the environmental design parameters was developed lastly the conservatism of the single extreme factor method was assessed the following valuable conclusions were obtained through the case study 1 the use of copula techniques to model different combinations of the marine environmental parameters is applicable in the field of ocean engineering metoceanic data from the south china sea were applied in this study to evaluate the efficacy of the trivariate joint probability model the results confirmed a good fit to the data 2 the joint design method for marine environmental parameters which combines a conditional probability method and multivariate joint probability method accounts for the dependency of oceanic variables thus this study provides a reasonable theoretical basis for the determination of design parameters furthermore the results are believed to more accurately reflect the actual marine conditions 3 the values for the environmental design parameters obtained by using the conventional single extreme factor method were higher than those determined by using the proposed method the values for the corresponding joint return period and structural response were also higher thus the conventional method yields conservative results this means that the proposed design method can significantly reduce the project cost however the structural safety performance needs to be further evaluated a multi load joint distribution can be established by combining univariate marginal distributions for each random variable with copula functions that describe the dependence structure between these variables an advantage of such copula models is that they allow greater flexibility in constructing joint distributions for environmental variables with arbitrary marginal distributions also these marginal distributions and the correlation or dependence structure can be considered separately the structural response surface of the example semi submersible platform is similar thus the deign environmental parameters can also be determined using the proposed method in other sea areas such as north atlantic sea predictably the final results will vary with observed environmental data using the same platform model to obtain a dynamic response solution for floating structures it is urgent that the relationship between the structural response and three or more environmental variables be explored through the use of a reasonable interpolation technique and an intelligent algorithm instead
