technique the usv dynamics are separated into two subsystems to facilitate the design and stability analysis a time varying variable is constructed to design the desired velocities used as virtual control inputs to stabilize the under actuated outer loop subsystem for the fully actuated inner loop subsystem the actual control force and moment inputs are designed using a switching threshold event triggering mechanism swt etm to drive the actual velocities to the desired ones thereby the inner loop subsystem and the closed loop system are stabilized the proposed etc guarantees global asymptotical convergence of the stabilization error by choosing proper control parameters it also significantly reduces the times for communication and the actuator burden while provides stable and accurate control performance simulation results are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme keywords under actuated surface vessels event triggered control inner outer loop method global asymptotical stabilization non holonomic constraints 1 introduction under actuated surface vessels usvs are nowadays universally used in applications ranging from military to civilian and including reconnaissance operations patrol missions surveillance and search and rescue the model of a usv has no side thruster implying an under actuated property that the number of independent control actuators is less than its degree of freedoms dofs therefore control problems of usvs represent very challenging tasks and have been extensively studied which can be categorized as stabilization reyhanoglu 1997 dong and guo 2005 ghommam et al 2006 ma 2009 mazenc et al 2002 xie and ma 2015 raspa et al 2013 katayama 2010 trajectory tracking jiang 2002 do and pan 2009 katayama and aoki 2014 deng et al 2019 and path following deng et al 2019 li et al 2020 most of the existing design methods are based on the continuous model of the usv and various continuous time approaches have been proposed reyhanoglu 1997 dong and guo 2005 ghommam et al 2006 ma 2009 mazenc et al 2002 xie and ma 2015 jiang 2002 do and pan 2009 since digital devices are used to control the usvs these control algorithms should be discretized and then implemented in digital platforms with a sufficiently small fixed sampling period such that the discrete time controllers are able to emulate the continuous behavior marchand et al 2013 another way to tackle this problem is the application of discrete time design methods based on an approximate discrete model of the usv such as discrete time variable structure control raspa et al 2013 and sampled data control katayama 2010 katayama and aoki 2014 methods the implementation of controllers with digital devices presents many advantages but it poses some issues which in particular is the determination of the sampling period castillo and di gennaro 2012 the sampling period is usually considered constant independently from the state of the system i e the new control value is computed periodically at each sampling time even after the system has achieved the control goal with sufficient accuracy liu and huang 2017 which may results in unnecessary high workloads and utilization of resources moreover the mechanism of periodic implementations requires to renew the actuator state at every sampling instant leading to unnecessary energy consumptions and even actuator attritions li et al 2020 jiao and wang 2016a due to frequent changes of the actuator state since the system resources including bandwidth hardware usage and energy are limited a too fast sampling period is unnecessary while a slower sampling may deteriorate the performance of the system consequently it would be desirable to calculate the new control value only when necessary in order to reduce the burden of communication and augment the life span of the actuators without degrading the performance of the controller the event triggering mechanism etm has emerged as an attractive alternative approach to the traditional periodic implementations demirel et al 2013 compared with periodic sampling control methods the etms take into account the system behavior between the sampling time instants liu and jiang 2015 while the input of a system is not update periodically but only after the occurrence of some internal events generated by some event functions the seemingly first etm for event triggered systems has been obtained in tabuada 2007 where a fixed threshold etm ft etm is proposed to asymptotically stabilize the system and the minimal sampling time is guaranteed to be lower bounded thus infinitely small interval between two consecutive input updates known as zeno phenomenon johansson et al 1999 could be avoided based on the results in tabuada 2007 the author in girard 2015 further considered a dynamic etm by introducing an additional internal dynamic variable to modify the decay rate of the error in addition the ft etm has been improved as a relative threshold etm rt etm in garcia and antsaklis 2011 such that longer update intervals are obtained when the magnitude of the control signal is high and a more precise control performance is guaranteed when the magnitude of the signal is small in xing et al 2017 the authors exploited a switching threshold etm swt etm by combining the ft etm with the rt etm and gave an adaptive event triggered controller etc with desired performance in presence of parametric uncertainties other related work includes etcs for singularly perturbed systems abdelrahim et al 2015 and the recent paper by dolk and heemels 2017 on etms under packet losses note that the usv systems involve control loops with shared limited resources the etm would be a better choice for their control design by which the amount of information exchange actuator executions and energy consumptions is greatly reduced nevertheless the applications of etcs for usvs are still very limited which only can be found in deng et al 2019 deng et al 2019 and li et al 2020 in deng et al 2019 the etc for trajectory tracking of usvs has been proposed such that the communication burden of the system is greatly reduced for path following of usvs the authors in deng et al 2019 studied a fuzzy logic based etm with the aid of the backstepping technique which guarantees the uniform boundedness of all tracking error with input saturation and parametric uncertainties in li et al 2020 an adaptive neural network etc has been proposed where the radial basis function neural network is employed to deal with the uncertain dynamics and the tracking error is proved to converge to zero with a finite time another interesting results have been reported in jiao and wang 2016a fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 and jiao and wang 2016b where the etcs of fully actuated surface vessels are carried out for trajectory tracking jiao and wang 2016a stabilization fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 and both the stabilization and trajectory tracking jiao and wang 2016b however they are not suitable for usvs because the under actuated problem of the system is not addressed besides it is costly and not very practical for a surface vessel that is fully actuated in each dof ashrafiuon et al 2010 although etcs for trajectory tracking and path following of the usv have been well studied by deng et al 2019 deng et al 2019 and li et al 2020 the etcs for its stabilization problems have not been reported yet the stabilization is important for dynamic positioning of the usvs in fixed target operations ashrafiuon et al 2010 such as autonomous docking diving support and offshore drilling and pipe laying operations the success of a dynamically positioned usv depends on its capability for accurate and reliable regulation of its position and yaw angle to a constant setpoint namely the full state stabilization unfortunately the usvs cannot be asymptotically stabilized by any time invariant continuous feedback control law because they are neither linear controllable nor satisfying the brockett s condition brockett et al 1983 that no continuous time invariant feedback control law makes the null solution of the usv error dynamics asymptotically stable in the sense of lyapunov ghommam et al 2006 only discontinuous reyhanoglu 1997 ghommam et al 2006 ma 2009 or continuous time varying dong and guo 2005 mazenc et al 2002 xie and ma 2015 control schemes are possible if all three coordinates are to be stabilized therefore in all these aforementioned control tasks the full state stabilization of the usvs is theoretically the most difficult one xie and ma 2015 do and pan 2009 which means the existing etcs developed for the trajectory tracking or path following cannot be applied for the full state stabilization problem directly motivated by the above considerations this paper provides a positive answer to the above challenging topic on new solutions to the etm for global full state stabilization of the usvs the core of the proposed control scheme is based on an inner outer loop structure with the lyapunov s direct method in which the whole usv system is separated into an under actuated outer loop subsystem and a fully actuated inner loop subsystem separating a control system into two cascaded loops has been used in areas such as power quality control mohan et al 2003 and control of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles wang and liu 2018 cao and lynch 2016 the advantages of the inner outer loop structure include ease of tuning simplicity of implementation and satisfaction on input or state constraints cao and lynch 2016 specifically we first separate the usv dynamics into two subsystems based on the inner outer loop structure to facilitate the design and stability analysis due to the under actuated nature of the usv a time varying auxiliary variable is constructed to derive the desired angular and linear velocities that are smooth and time varying regarded as the virtual control inputs thereby the under actuated outer loop subsystem is stabilized by satisfying the brockett s condition then a switching threshold etc swt etc for the actual surge control force and yaw angle control moment is designed to drive the actual velocities to the desired ones thus the fully actuated outer loop subsystem and the closed loop system are globally asymptotically stabilized moreover the swt etm is employed to get a better combination of the ft and rt etms the occurrence of the zeno phenomenon is successfully avoided simultaneously it is proved that all signals of the closed loop system are globally uniformly bounded and asymptotically converge to the origin of the error dynamics to the authors best knowledge this paper is the first study on the etc for global full state stabilization of the usvs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the usv model and some preliminaries the inner outer loop swt etm and stability analysis are given in sections 3 and 4 simulation results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis in section 5 the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 preliminaries 2 1 problem formulation let the position and attitude coordinates be η x y ψ t where x y and ψ denote the surge displacement sway displacement and yaw angle expressed in the earth fixed frame let the velocity coordinates be v u v r t where u v and r denote the surge sway and yaw velocities expressed in the body fixed frame the parameters m j j 0 and d j j 0 j 1 2 3 denote the vessel inertia including added mass effects and hydrodynamic damping and the available control inputs denoted by τ 1 and τ 2 are the surge control force and yaw control moment the kinematic and dynamic model of the usv studied in reyhanoglu 1997 dong and guo 2005 ghommam et al 2006 ma 2009 mazenc et al 2002 xie and ma 2015 jiang 2002 do and pan 2009 katayama and aoki 2014 deng et al 2019 deng et al 2019 and li et al 2020 can be described as 1 x y ψ c o s ψ s i

and p 6 1 m 33 let η d x d y d ψ d t η d 0 be the desired position and attitude coordinates to be stabilized in the inertial frame let η e η η d x e y e ψ e t and z z 1 z 2 z 3 t denote the stabilization error expressed in the inertial and body fixed frames respectively such that 3 z 1 z 2 z 3 c o s ψ s i n ψ 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ 0 0 0 1 x e y e ψ e differentiating 3 with respect to time yields 4 z 1 u z 2 r z 2 v z 1 r z 3 r as can be seen from the second line of 2 there is no side thruster to provide surway control force exhibiting an under actuated issue of the stabilization task to facilitate the design introduce the state transformation mazenc et al 2002 xie and ma 2015 z 2 z 2 v d into 4 the error dynamics can be transformed into 5 z 1 u z 2 v d r z 2 z 1 r c d u r z 3 r v c u r d v 6 u p 1 v r p 2 u p 3 τ 1 r p 4 u v p 5 r p 6 τ 2 according to 5 and 6 the usv system is separated into two subsystems the outer loop subsystem defined by 5 and the inner loop subsystem defined by 6 since 3 and the state transformation are globally invertible the stabilization of η e to zero reduces to the stabilization of 5 and 6 to zero by applying τ 1 and τ 2 which will be designed in section 3 2 2 useful definitions and lemma the following definitions and lemma will be used for the controller design definition 1 for any variable x r φ x r r is a strictly increasing continuously differentiable function satisfying φ x 0 x 0 and d n φ x d x n l n n definition 2 h t is a periodic function of time satisfying d n h t d t n l n n and lim t d h t d t 0 definition 3 ε t is a function of time satisfying ε t 0 lim t ε t 0 and there exists a constant ρ 0 such that lim t 0 t ε χ d χ ρ for convenience h t ε t and ε i t are simplified as h t ε t and ε t i in the rest of this paper lemma 1 wang 2015 for any constant ϵ 0 and any variable z r the following relationship holds 7 0 z z 2 z 2 ϵ 2 ϵ 3 controller design in this section we propose a time varying swt etc to globally asymptotically stabilize the system as can be seen from 6 the inner loop subsystem is fully actuated which means u and r could be directly controlled by τ 1 and τ 2 therefore the desired linear and angular velocities denoted by u d and r d are used as virtual control variables to stabilize the outer loop subsystem 5 firstly and the actual event triggered control inputs τ 1 and τ 2 are designed to drive u and r to u d and r d the inner outer loop structure is illustrated in fig 1 and the diagram of the swt etc is depicted in fig 2 3 1 stabilization of the outer loop subsystem let e 1 u u d and e 2 r r d denote the linear and angular velocity tracking error then the under actuated outer loop subsystem 5 in terms of the virtual control inputs u d and r d is rewritten as 8 z 1 e 1 u d z 2 v d e 2 r d z 2 z 1 e 2 r d c d e 1 u d e 2 r d z 3 e 2 r d v c e 1 u d e 2 r d d v which is under actuated with u d and r d as control inputs to deal with the under actuated problem of the outer loop subsystem by satisfying the brockett s condition time varying control inputs are preferable by which the usv system could be globally stabilized without singular points in order to achieve our control objective and overcome the above mentioned problems construct a time varying variable as 9 ξ z 3 φ v 1 h t where v 1 1 2 k 1 z 1 2 1 2 z 2 2 k 1 2 k 1 c d v 2 0 k 1 d c and k 1 1 c d k 1 0 φ v 1 and h t are defined in definitions 1 2 the virtual control inputs for the desired velocities are designed as 10 u d k 1 z 1 r d k 2 ξ φ v 1 h t d φ v 1 d v 1 α z 1 2 β v 2 h t where k 2 0 α k 1 k 1 and β k 1 c k 1 the main result on stabilization of the outer loop subsystem is summarized in theorem 1 theorem 1 assuming a perfect inner loop velocity tracking i e e i 0 i 1 2 the virtual control inputs defined by 10 globally asymptotically stabilize the outer loop subsystem 5 with the control parameters satisfying 0 k 1 d c k 1 1 c d k 1 0 and k 2 0 proof with the proposed virtual control law 10 and e i 0 i 1 2 the outer loop subsystem 8 becomes 11 z 1 k 1 z 1 z 2 v d r d z 2 z 1 r d c d k 1 z 1 r d k 1 z 1 r d z 3 r d v c k 1 z 1 r d d v construct the lyapunov function

z 2 v ξ l since d n h t d t n d n φ v 1 d v 1 n l n n according to 9 we obtain z 3 l from 10 and 11 we have u d r d l and z 1 z 2 z 3 v l exploiting the above results one can verify 15 ξ r d d φ v 1 d v 1 v 1 h t φ v 1 h t k 2 ξ l 16 v 2 2 α z 1 z 1 2 β v v 2 k 2 ξ ξ l as a result v 2 is bounded and v 2 is uniformly continuous invoking b a r b a l a t lemma khalil 2002 one can show that lim t v 2 0 which implies that 17 lim t z 1 v ξ 0 note that r d l defined by r d k 2 2 ξ 2 d φ v 1 d v 1 v 1 h t φ v 1 h t d 2 φ v 1 d v 1 2 v 1 2 h t d φ v 1 d v 1 v 1 h t thus z 1 is uniformly continuous as 18 z 1 k 1 z 1 z 2 v d r d z 2 v d r d l and lim t 0 t z 1 χ d χ z 1 0 exists again using b a r b a l a t lemma we have lim t z 1 0 since z 1 k 1 z 1 z 2 v d r d we obtain lim t z 2 r d 0 then substituting 10 and 12 into z 2 r d with 17 yields 19 lim t z 2 φ 1 2 z 2 2 h t 0 recalling definition 2 that lim t d h t d t 0 one can show that lim t v 1 z 2 0 then applying 9 and 17 it is easy to verify that lim t z 3 0 therefore the outer loop subsystem is proved to be globally asymptotically stable in the sense that lim t z 1 z 2 z 3 v 0 remark 3 1 the outer loop subsystem can be stabilized using the desired velocities defined by 10 from which we can see the derivation of r d lies with the construction of the time varying variable ξ such that the brockett s condition is satisfied it should be noted that z 2 cannot be stabilized to the origin if ξ is time invariant without a function of time h t 3 2 stabilization of the inner loop subsystem in this section we consider the inner loop subsystem and design the actual even triggered force and moment control inputs in order to track the desired velocities u d and r d thereby the closed loop system is globally asymptotically stabilized first a continuous time controller ctc is proposed to globally asymptotically stabilize the inner loop subsystem without considering the measurement error among the triggering instants then the ctc is further modified to combine with a proposed swt etm such that the actual event triggered force and moment control inputs are obtained 1 ctc inputs design applying 6 the inner loop velocity error dynamics are obtained as 20 e 1 p 1 v r p 2 u p 3 τ 1 u d e 2 p 4 u v p 5 r p 6 τ 2 r d where u d k 1 u k 1 z 2 r and r d is given in 33 the ctc inputs ϖ i c t i 1 2 are designed as 21 ϖ i c t 1

the main result on continuous time stabilization of the closed loop system is summarized in theorem 2 theorem 2 assuming a perfect implementation of the ctc inputs without the measurement error i e τ

proof with the proposed virtual control law 10 and considering the effect of the velocity tracking error e i 0 between the two subsystems the outer loop subsystem 8 becomes 24 z 1 e 1 k 1 z 1 z 2 v d r z 2 k 1 z 1 r c d e 1 r z 3 r d e 2 v c k 1 z 1 e 1 r d v where u u d e 1 and r r d e 2 substituting 21 in to 20 yields 25 e 1 l 1 e 1 f e 2 l 2 e 2 ξ construct the lyapunov function candidates as 26 v 1 1 2 k 1 z 1 2 1 2 z 2 2 k 1 2 c k 1 d v 2 v 2 v 1 1 2 ξ 2 v 3 v 2 1 2 i 1 2 e i 2 differentiating v 1 v 2 and v 3 along 20 and 24 then substituting 10 into v 1 v 2 and 21 23 and 25 into v 3 with e i 0 we have 27 v 1 α z 1 2 β v 2 e 1 k 1 z 1 c d z 2 r k 1 k 1 d v r 28 v 2 v 1 ξ r d e 2 d φ v 1 d v 1 v 1 h t φ v 1 h t α z 1 2 β v 2 k 2 ξ 2 e 1 f 1 e 2 ξ 29 v 3 v 2 e 1 e 1 e 2 e 2 α z 1 2 β v 2 k 2 ξ 2 l 1 e 1 2 l 2 e 2 2 i 1 2 e i α i p 3 i τ i t x t a x 0 where x z 1 v ξ e 1 e 2 t and a diag α β k 2 l 1 l 2 as a result v 3 is negative semidefinite and hence v 1 v 2 v 3 z 1 z 2 z 2 v ξ e 1 e 2 l since d n h t d t n d n φ v 1 d v 1 n l n n according to 9 and 23 we obtain f 1 z 3 l it can be shown from 10 and 24 25 that u d r d l and z 1 z 2 z 3 v e 1 e 2 l substituting 10 into ξ we have ξ l defined by 30 ξ k 2 ξ e 2 d φ v 1 d v 1 e 1 k 1 z 1 c d z 2 r k 1 k 1 d v r h t exploiting the above results with v 3 one can verify 31 v 3 2 α z 1 z 1 2 β v v 2 k 2 ξ ξ 2 i 1 2 l i e i e i l as a result v 3 is bounded and v 3 is uniformly continuous invoking b a r b a l a t lemma one can show that lim t v 3 0 which implies that 32 lim t z 1 v ξ e 1 e 2 0 exploiting 27 and 28 with 32 we get lim t v 1 v 2 0 note that r d l defined by 33 r d k 2 ξ d φ v 1 d v 1 v 1 h t d φ v 1 d v 1 α z 1 2 β v 2 h t φ v 1 h t 2 d φ v 1 d v 1 α z 1 z 1 β v v h t d 2 φ v 1 d v 1 2 v 1 α z 1 2 β v 2 h t thus z 1 is uniformly continuous as 34 z 1 e 1 k 1 z 1 z 2 v d r d e 2 z 2 v d r d e 2 l and lim t 0 t z 1 χ d χ z 1 0 exists again using b a r b a l a t lemma we have lim t z 1 0 therefore lim t z 2 r d 0 substituting 10 and 26 into z 2 r d with 32 yields 35 lim t z 2 φ 1 2 z 2 2 h t 0 recalling definition 2 that lim t d h t d t 0 one can show that lim t z 2 0 then applying 9 and 32 it is easy to verify that lim t z 3 0 therefore the closed loop system is proved to be globally asymptotically stable in the sense that lim t z 1 z 2 z 3 v e 1 e 2 0 remark 3 2 it is important to mention that u d should not contain u and r d should not contain r such that the ctc inputs are causal without containing themselves substituting 5 27 and 30 ito 33 r d can be calculated applying u d and r d into 21 and 22 one can verify that the ctc control inputs are causal which can be used in real applications 2 etc inputs design inspired by the switching threshold strategy reported in garcia and antsaklis 2011 and xing et al 2017 the swt etm in this paper is designed as 36 τ i t ϖ i t i k t t i k t i k 1 i 1 2 37 t i k 1 inf t r δ i c i τ i t γ i inf t r δ i δ i τ i t d i τ i t γ i where k n is the k th triggering sequence when the controller updates the initial instant is defined by t i 0 0 τ t τ 1 t τ 2 t t is the actual control inputs that will be designed in the next subsection c i d i γ i 0 and 0 δ i 1 are the etm design parameters δ i ϖ i t ϖ i t i k is the measurement error between the inputs of the present moment and the previous triggering instant when the control value of τ i is larger than the prescribed switching threshold γ i i e τ i t γ i the triggering threshold is chosen to be a constant c i namely the ft etm δ i c i is applied such that large impulses of the control input are prevented once the control value becomes small i e τ i t γ i the measurement error δ i is set to be proportional to the control value of τ i namely the rt etm δ i δ i τ i t d i is actived such that a precise control performance is guaranteed whenever anyone of the above triggering conditions in 37 is satisfied the triggering instant will be marked as t i k 1 and the control input value will be updated as ϖ i t i k 1 which is further transmitted to the actuator model of the usv it should be noted that during the time t t i k t i k 1 the control input value is fixed as ϖ i t i k therefore frequent communication and executions of the actuator are avoided the burden of the system is thus significantly reduced the diagram of the swt etc is illustrated in fig 2 from the above analysis the event triggered stabilization problem reduces to the design of a well defined function of ϖ i t regarded as the input of the etm with which the actual etc represented by τ t can be derived using 36 and 37 it is easy to verify that the ctc 21 cascaded with the swt etm 36 37 cannot asymptotically stabilize the closed loop system due to the existence of δ i causing v 3 defined by 29 be v 3 x t a x i 1 2 x δ i which is no longer negative semidefinite from 37 we have δ i max c i δ i γ i d i therefore the boundedness of the closed loop system still holds and all the states asymptotically converge to x 2 max c i δ i γ i d i min α β k 2 l 1 l 2 rather than zero consequently the effect of δ i should be compensated based on the result of the ctc inputs in theorem 2 the etc inputs ϖ i t i 1 2 are modified as 38 ϖ i t 1 δ i α i 2 e i p 3 i α i e i 2 ε t i 2 1 δ i d i 2 e i d i e i 2 ε t i 2 l i ϖ e i where l i 0 and α i are defined in 22 ε t i is a function of time defined in definition 3 l i ϖ 0 and d i max d i 1 δ i c i 1 δ i are the control parameters remark 3 3 the first and third terms of 38 are introduced to drive the value of e i to be smaller when e i is far away from the origin as e i tends to zero the first and second terms of 38 are applied to compensate for the effect induced by the measurement error δ i with which the control accuracy of the etc can be guaranteed moreover it can be verified from remark 3 2 that the etc inputs ϖ i t are causal 4 stability analysis the main result on stabilization of the usv with the proposed etc is summarized in theorem 3 theorem 3 the proposed swt etc τ i t i 1 2 defined by 10 22 and 36 38 globally asymptotically stabilizes the origin of the usv system 5 6 with the control parameters satisfying 0 k 1 d c

that ϖ i t τ i t λ 1 i t c i i e 39 τ i t ϖ i t λ 1 i t c i substituting 39 into 29 v 3 is equal to 40 v 3 x t a x i 1 2 e i α i i 1 2 p 3 i e i ϖ i t λ 1 i t c i then applying 38 into 40 we have 41 v

t t i k t i k 1 such that ϖ i t 1 λ 2 i t δ i τ i t λ 3 i t d i i e 44 τ i t ϖ i t λ 3 i t d i 1 λ 2 i t δ i substituting 44 into 29 v 3 is equal to 45 v 3 x t a x i 1 2 e i α i i 1 2 p 3 i e i ϖ i t

globally bounded and hence z 1 z 2 z 2 v ξ e 1 e 2 l applying 22 23 and 38 with 39 and 44 we obtain τ i t l then applying the above results into 20 24 and 30 we have z 1 v ξ e 1 e 2 l moreover using

l a t lemma one can show that lim t z 1 v ξ e 1 e 2 0 following the same analysis as in 33 35 in the proof of theorem 2 one can conclude that the closed loop system is proved to be globally asymptotically stable in the sense that lim t z 1 z 2 z 3 v e 1 e 2 0 since all signals are globally bounded according to 36 38 there must exist a constant k i ϖ 0 satisfying 53 δ i t ϖ i t k i ϖ t t i k t i k 1 on the other hand it is verified from 37 that 54 lim t t i k δ i t 0 ft etm lim t t i k 1 δ i t c i τ i t γ i rt etm lim t t i k 1 δ i t δ i τ i t d i τ i t γ i therefore by combining 53 with 54 we obtain that the lower bound of the inter execution intervals δ t must satisfy t i k 1 t i k k i ϖ min δ i t i k 1 δ i t i k i e 55 δ t min inf t i k 1 t i k min c i δ i τ i t d i k i ϖ 0 namely the zeno phenomenon is successfully avoided remark 4 1 as the stabilization error asymptotically converges to zero using 38 we get lim t ϖ i t 0 which leads to lim t τ i t 0 by 36 and 44 if the rt etm is adopted without d i i e d i 0 however according to 55 this causes lim t δ t min 0 as a result d i 0 should be added into the rt etm to guarantee δ t min 0 to avoid the zeno phenomenon obviously the smaller value of d i would improve the control accuracy but increase the execution times which will be observed in the simulations remark 4 2 since the rt etm is adopted to guarantee the control accuracy the parameter d i of the swt etm should be small and must satisfy d i c i otherwise the relative term δ i τ i t would be negligible compared with d i when τ i t is small such that the rt etm δ i δ i τ i d i almost becomes the ft etm δ i d i besides the switching threshold γ i should not be too big but must satisfy γ i c i otherwise the measurement error bound of the ft etm would contain the range of the triggering threshold causing the ft etm not properly switch to the rt etm when τ i t γ i on the other hand c i should be chosen to satisfy c i δ i γ i d i when adopting the ft etm which guarantees larger value of the triggering threshold as well as longer update intervals than those of the rt etm when τ i t approximates γ i consequently the swt etm design parameters should satisfy d i δ i γ i d i c i γ i 5 simulations in this section the effectiveness of the proposed swt etc is validated by simulation examples with the usv model parameters m 11 155 kg m 22 105 kg m 33 20 kg m 2 d 11 70 kg s d 22 100 kg s d 33 50 kg m 2 s the initial conditions of the usv system are selected as x 0 15 m y 0 30 m ψ 0 1 rad u 0 0 m s v 0 0 m s r 0 0 rad s the desired position and attitude are chosen as x d 0 m y d 0 m ψ d 0 rad the control parameters are given by k 1 0 1 k 2 0 3 l 1 0 1 l 2 0 1 l 1 ϖ 155 l 2 ϖ 20 the control functions are defined by φ v 1 2 4 tanh v 1 h t sin 0 1 t ε t i 0 3 e 0 01 t i 1 2 according to remark 4 2 the swt etm configurations are given by the switching thresholds γ 1 45 γ 2 8 the ft etm parameters c 1 40 c 2 6 the rt etm parameters δ 1 0 5 d 1 10 δ 2 0 1 d 2 2 and according to 38 choose d 1 27 d 2 5 5 to satisfy d i max d i 1 δ i c i 1 δ i the simulation results of the proposed swt etc 36 38 are given in figs 3 5 as is shown in figs 3 4 a and 5 a all the states of the usv remain bounded and asymptotically converge to zero figs 4 and 5 show that the control torque and moment are updated only when the triggering conditions are satisfied in figs 4 b and 5 b the inter event intervals between two consecutive sampling instants of the swt etc are illustrated from which we can see the lower bound of the intervals exists and is positive without the zeno phenomenon moreover to illustrate the merits of the proposed swt etc and make comparisons simulations of 1 the ft etc using the ft etm of 37 with 36 and 38 2 the rt etc using the rt etm of 37 with 36 and 38 3 the ctc 21 with the fixed sampling interval δ t 0 05 s which are applied to the usv with the same control parameters and initial conditions given above 4 the rt etc b only changing d i of the rt etc above as d 1 1 and d 2 0 2 5 the smooth time varying method proposed in dong and guo 2005 with the control parameters k 1 0 07 k 2 0 1 k 3 1 k 4 1 and δ t 0 05 s are carried out respectively illustrated in figs 6 12 as is shown in figs 6 9 the proposed etcs make all the states of the usv remain bounded and asymptotically converge to zero without the zeno phenomenon however due to the existence of the measurement error the proposed ctc and the method in dong and guo 2005 cannot guarantee asymptotic convergence of the yaw angle though the position coordinates of the usv are stabilized with larger error which can be observed in figs 6 and 12 it can be verified from figs 4 7 and 8 that in the first 7 s the control value of the swt etc and the ft etc is smaller than that of the rt etc and there exists noticeable impulses of the control force τ 1 with the rt etm shown in figs 8 a and 9 a this is because the states of the usv are far away from the origin such that the value of the control inputs τ i is big enough to make the relative measurement error δ i τ i d i larger than the fixed one c i thus the rt etc has to generate large impulses to compensate for the effect of the larger relative measurement error δ i τ i d i while the ft etm applied into the swt etc and the ft etc prevents the control signals from large impulses with the smaller fixed measurement error c i to be compensated for as shown in figs 4 a 7 a 8 a and 9 a as the states converge to the origin after 30 s δ i τ i d i gradually becomes much smaller than c i therefore the swt etc and the rt etc can achieve smaller stabilization error than that of the ft etc besides the ft etc has to execute faster to compensate for the effect of the larger fixed measurement error c i making oscillations of the usv states and larger tracking error shown in figs 6 7 and 11 fig 10 illustrates the energy consumption index curves p 0 t τ 1 2 χ τ 2 2 χ d χ of the aforementioned controllers from which we get the proposed etcs significantly reduce the energy consumptions more strikingly since the swt etc avoids large impulses when the control value is high and executes less times when the control value is small with high control accuracy and smaller control magnitude the energy consumption is therefore the least of the controllers when applying the same parameters on the other hand when the value of d i is chosen to be smaller the value of the measurement error δ i τ i d i decreases such that the stabilization error becomes smaller when applying the rt etc b as shown in fig 6 besides it is verified from figs 4 5 8 and 9 as well as 44 that the magnitude of τ i decreases with the smaller value of d i thus the amount of the energy consumption is the least of all the etcs as shown in fig 10 however as discussed in remark 4 1 the smaller d i would make the triggering threshold sensitive to the measurement error therefore the rt etc b executes much more times than that of the swt etc and the rt etc which can be observed in figs 4 5 8 9 and 11 indeed fig 11 illustrates that the control signals of the rt etc b updates 758 and 302 times in the first 200 s though less than the 4000 times of the continuous time methods by comparison for the swt etc τ 1 and τ 2 are updated only 378 and 141 times respectively hence the communication and actuator burden of the system is significantly reduced despite with slightly larger stabilization error consequently by choosing suitable control parameters the swt etc can get a better trade off between the stabilization error and the system burden from the above discussion we obtain that the proposed swt etc takes the advantages of the ft etc and the rt etc to avoid dramatic and frequent changes of the actuator with a satisfactory control performance and less communication burden which can effectively protect the actuator devices of the usv system 6 conclusion an swt etc for global full state stabilization of the usvs is proposed for the first time based on the inner outer loop structure with lyapunov control design technique which has a simple structure and is easy to be implemented by using the proposed swt etm the control force and moment are modulated only when certain event triggering conditions are satisfied averting the large impulses and frequent updates of the control signal such that reducing the burden of the actuator devices without degrading the control performance in addition it significantly reduces the times for communication while provides stable and accurate performance for the stabilization the proposed swt etc guarantees global asymptotical convergence of the stabilization error by choosing proper control parameters simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the

21340,an event triggered controller etc for global full state stabilization of under actuated surface vessels usvs is proposed based on an inner outer loop structure with lyapunov control design technique the usv dynamics are separated into two subsystems to facilitate the design and stability analysis a time varying variable is constructed to design the desired velocities used as virtual control inputs to stabilize the under actuated outer loop subsystem for the fully actuated inner loop subsystem the actual control force and moment inputs are designed using a switching threshold event triggering mechanism swt etm to drive the actual velocities to the desired ones thereby the inner loop subsystem and the closed loop system are stabilized the proposed etc guarantees global asymptotical convergence of the stabilization error by choosing proper control parameters it also significantly reduces the times for communication and the actuator burden while provides stable and accurate control performance simulation results are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme keywords under actuated surface vessels event triggered control inner outer loop method global asymptotical stabilization non holonomic constraints 1 introduction under actuated surface vessels usvs are nowadays universally used in applications ranging from military to civilian and including reconnaissance operations patrol missions surveillance and search and rescue the model of a usv has no side thruster implying an under actuated property that the number of independent control actuators is less than its degree of freedoms dofs therefore control problems of usvs represent very challenging tasks and have been extensively studied which can be categorized as stabilization reyhanoglu 1997 dong and guo 2005 ghommam et al 2006 ma 2009 mazenc et al 2002 xie and ma 2015 raspa et al 2013 katayama 2010 trajectory tracking jiang 2002 do and pan 2009 katayama and aoki 2014 deng et al 2019 and path following deng et al 2019 li et al 2020 most of the existing design methods are based on the continuous model of the usv and various continuous time approaches have been proposed reyhanoglu 1997 dong and guo 2005 ghommam et al 2006 ma 2009 mazenc et al 2002 xie and ma 2015 jiang 2002 do and pan 2009 since digital devices are used to control the usvs these control algorithms should be discretized and then implemented in digital platforms with a sufficiently small fixed sampling period such that the discrete time controllers are able to emulate the continuous behavior marchand et al 2013 another way to tackle this problem is the application of discrete time design methods based on an approximate discrete model of the usv such as discrete time variable structure control raspa et al 2013 and sampled data control katayama 2010 katayama and aoki 2014 methods the implementation of controllers with digital devices presents many advantages but it poses some issues which in particular is the determination of the sampling period castillo and di gennaro 2012 the sampling period is usually considered constant independently from the state of the system i e the new control value is computed periodically at each sampling time even after the system has achieved the control goal with sufficient accuracy liu and huang 2017 which may results in unnecessary high workloads and utilization of resources moreover the mechanism of periodic implementations requires to renew the actuator state at every sampling instant leading to unnecessary energy consumptions and even actuator attritions li et al 2020 jiao and wang 2016a due to frequent changes of the actuator state since the system resources including bandwidth hardware usage and energy are limited a too fast sampling period is unnecessary while a slower sampling may deteriorate the performance of the system consequently it would be desirable to calculate the new control value only when necessary in order to reduce the burden of communication and augment the life span of the actuators without degrading the performance of the controller the event triggering mechanism etm has emerged as an attractive alternative approach to the traditional periodic implementations demirel et al 2013 compared with periodic sampling control methods the etms take into account the system behavior between the sampling time instants liu and jiang 2015 while the input of a system is not update periodically but only after the occurrence of some internal events generated by some event functions the seemingly first etm for event triggered systems has been obtained in tabuada 2007 where a fixed threshold etm ft etm is proposed to asymptotically stabilize the system and the minimal sampling time is guaranteed to be lower bounded thus infinitely small interval between two consecutive input updates known as zeno phenomenon johansson et al 1999 could be avoided based on the results in tabuada 2007 the author in girard 2015 further considered a dynamic etm by introducing an additional internal dynamic variable to modify the decay rate of the error in addition the ft etm has been improved as a relative threshold etm rt etm in garcia and antsaklis 2011 such that longer update intervals are obtained when the magnitude of the control signal is high and a more precise control performance is guaranteed when the magnitude of the signal is small in xing et al 2017 the authors exploited a switching threshold etm swt etm by combining the ft etm with the rt etm and gave an adaptive event triggered controller etc with desired performance in presence of parametric uncertainties other related work includes etcs for singularly perturbed systems abdelrahim et al 2015 and the recent paper by dolk and heemels 2017 on etms under packet losses note that the usv systems involve control loops with shared limited resources the etm would be a better choice for their control design by which the amount of information exchange actuator executions and energy consumptions is greatly reduced nevertheless the applications of etcs for usvs are still very limited which only can be found in deng et al 2019 deng et al 2019 and li et al 2020 in deng et al 2019 the etc for trajectory tracking of usvs has been proposed such that the communication burden of the system is greatly reduced for path following of usvs the authors in deng et al 2019 studied a fuzzy logic based etm with the aid of the backstepping technique which guarantees the uniform boundedness of all tracking error with input saturation and parametric uncertainties in li et al 2020 an adaptive neural network etc has been proposed where the radial basis function neural network is employed to deal with the uncertain dynamics and the tracking error is proved to converge to zero with a finite time another interesting results have been reported in jiao and wang 2016a fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 and jiao and wang 2016b where the etcs of fully actuated surface vessels are carried out for trajectory tracking jiao and wang 2016a stabilization fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 and both the stabilization and trajectory tracking jiao and wang 2016b however they are not suitable for usvs because the under actuated problem of the system is not addressed besides it is costly and not very practical for a surface vessel that is fully actuated in each dof ashrafiuon et al 2010 although etcs for trajectory tracking and path following of the usv have been well studied by deng et al 2019 deng et al 2019 and li et al 2020 the etcs for its stabilization problems have not been reported yet the stabilization is important for dynamic positioning of the usvs in fixed target operations ashrafiuon et al 2010 such as autonomous docking diving support and offshore drilling and pipe laying operations the success of a dynamically positioned usv depends on its capability for accurate and reliable regulation of its position and yaw angle to a constant setpoint namely the full state stabilization unfortunately the usvs cannot be asymptotically stabilized by any time invariant continuous feedback control law because they are neither linear controllable nor satisfying the brockett s condition brockett et al 1983 that no continuous time invariant feedback control law makes the null solution of the usv error dynamics asymptotically stable in the sense of lyapunov ghommam et al 2006 only discontinuous reyhanoglu 1997 ghommam et al 2006 ma 2009 or continuous time varying dong and guo 2005 mazenc et al 2002 xie and ma 2015 control schemes are possible if all three coordinates are to be stabilized therefore in all these aforementioned control tasks the full state stabilization of the usvs is theoretically the most difficult one xie and ma 2015 do and pan 2009 which means the existing etcs developed for the trajectory tracking or path following cannot be applied for the full state stabilization problem directly motivated by the above considerations this paper provides a positive answer to the above challenging topic on new solutions to the etm for global full state stabilization of the usvs the core of the proposed control scheme is based on an inner outer loop structure with the lyapunov s direct method in which the whole usv system is separated into an under actuated outer loop subsystem and a fully actuated inner loop subsystem separating a control system into two cascaded loops has been used in areas such as power quality control mohan et al 2003 and control of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles wang and liu 2018 cao and lynch 2016 the advantages of the inner outer loop structure include ease of tuning simplicity of implementation and satisfaction on input or state constraints cao and lynch 2016 specifically we first separate the usv dynamics into two subsystems based on the inner outer loop structure to facilitate the design and stability analysis due to the under actuated nature of the usv a time varying auxiliary variable is constructed to derive the desired angular and linear velocities that are smooth and time varying regarded as the virtual control inputs thereby the under actuated outer loop subsystem is stabilized by satisfying the brockett s condition then a switching threshold etc swt etc for the actual surge control force and yaw angle control moment is designed to drive the actual velocities to the desired ones thus the fully actuated outer loop subsystem and the closed loop system are globally asymptotically stabilized moreover the swt etm is employed to get a better combination of the ft and rt etms the occurrence of the zeno phenomenon is successfully avoided simultaneously it is proved that all signals of the closed loop system are globally uniformly bounded and asymptotically converge to the origin of the error dynamics to the authors best knowledge this paper is the first study on the etc for global full state stabilization of the usvs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the usv model and some preliminaries the inner outer loop swt etm and stability analysis are given in sections 3 and 4 simulation results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis in section 5 the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 preliminaries 2 1 problem formulation let the position and attitude coordinates be η x y ψ t where x y and ψ denote the surge displacement sway displacement and yaw angle expressed in the earth fixed frame let the velocity coordinates be v u v r t where u v and r denote the surge sway and yaw velocities expressed in the body fixed frame the parameters m j j 0 and d j j 0 j 1 2 3 denote the vessel inertia including added mass effects and hydrodynamic damping and the available control inputs denoted by τ 1 and τ 2 are the surge control force and yaw control moment the kinematic and dynamic model of the usv studied in reyhanoglu 1997 dong and guo 2005 ghommam et al 2006 ma 2009 mazenc et al 2002 xie and ma 2015 jiang 2002 do and pan 2009 katayama and aoki 2014 deng et al 2019 deng et al 2019 and li et al 2020 can be described as 1 x y ψ c o s ψ s i

and p 6 1 m 33 let η d x d y d ψ d t η d 0 be the desired position and attitude coordinates to be stabilized in the inertial frame let η e η η d x e y e ψ e t and z z 1 z 2 z 3 t denote the stabilization error expressed in the inertial and body fixed frames respectively such that 3 z 1 z 2 z 3 c o s ψ s i n ψ 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ 0 0 0 1 x e y e ψ e differentiating 3 with respect to time yields 4 z 1 u z 2 r z 2 v z 1 r z 3 r as can be seen from the second line of 2 there is no side thruster to provide surway control force exhibiting an under actuated issue of the stabilization task to facilitate the design introduce the state transformation mazenc et al 2002 xie and ma 2015 z 2 z 2 v d into 4 the error dynamics can be transformed into 5 z 1 u z 2 v d r z 2 z 1 r c d u r z 3 r v c u r d v 6 u p 1 v r p 2 u p 3 τ 1 r p 4 u v p 5 r p 6 τ 2 according to 5 and 6 the usv system is separated into two subsystems the outer loop subsystem defined by 5 and the inner loop subsystem defined by 6 since 3 and the state transformation are globally invertible the stabilization of η e to zero reduces to the stabilization of 5 and 6 to zero by applying τ 1 and τ 2 which will be designed in section 3 2 2 useful definitions and lemma the following definitions and lemma will be used for the controller design definition 1 for any variable x r φ x r r is a strictly increasing

this paper lemma 1 wang 2015 for any constant ϵ 0 and any variable z r the following relationship holds 7 0 z z 2 z 2 ϵ 2 ϵ 3 controller design in this section we propose a time varying swt etc to globally asymptotically stabilize the system as can be seen from 6 the inner loop subsystem is fully actuated which means u and r could be directly controlled by τ 1 and τ 2 therefore the desired linear and angular velocities denoted by u d and r d are used as virtual control variables to stabilize the outer loop subsystem 5 firstly and the actual event triggered control inputs τ 1 and τ 2 are designed to drive u and r to u d and r d the inner outer loop structure is illustrated in fig 1 and the diagram of the swt etc is depicted in fig 2 3 1 stabilization of the outer loop subsystem let e 1 u u d and e 2 r r d denote the linear and angular velocity tracking error then the under actuated outer loop subsystem 5 in terms of the virtual control inputs u d and r d is rewritten as 8 z 1 e 1 u d z 2 v d e 2 r d z 2 z 1 e 2 r d c d e 1 u d e 2 r d z 3 e 2 r d v c e 1 u d e 2 r d d v which is under actuated with u d and r d as control inputs to deal with the under actuated problem of the outer loop subsystem by satisfying the brockett s condition time varying control inputs are preferable by which the usv system could be globally stabilized without singular points in order to achieve

z 1 k 1 z 1 z 2 v d r d z 2 v d r d l and lim t 0 t z 1 χ d χ z 1 0 exists again using b a r b a l a t lemma we have lim t z 1 0 since z 1 k 1 z 1 z 2 v d r d we obtain lim t z 2 r d 0 then substituting 10 and 12 into z 2 r d with 17 yields 19 lim t z 2 φ 1 2 z 2 2 h t 0 recalling definition 2 that lim t d h t d t 0 one can show that lim t v 1 z 2 0 then applying 9 and 17 it is easy to verify that lim t z 3 0 therefore the outer loop subsystem is proved to be globally asymptotically stable in the sense that lim t z 1 z 2 z 3 v 0 remark 3 1 the outer loop subsystem can be stabilized using the desired velocities defined by 10 from which we can see the derivation of r d lies with the construction of the time varying variable ξ such that the brockett s condition is satisfied it should be noted that z 2 cannot be stabilized to the origin if ξ is time invariant without a function of time h t 3 2 stabilization of the inner loop subsystem in this section we consider the inner loop subsystem and design the actual even triggered force and moment control inputs in order to track the desired velocities u d and r d thereby the closed loop system is globally asymptotically stabilized first a continuous time controller ctc is proposed to globally asymptotically stabilize the inner loop subsystem without considering the measurement error among the triggering instants then the ctc is further modified to combine with a proposed swt etm such that the actual event triggered force and moment control inputs are obtained 1 ctc inputs design applying 6 the inner loop velocity error dynamics are obtained as 20 e 1 p 1 v r p 2 u p 3 τ 1 u d e 2 p 4 u v p 5 r p 6 τ 2 r d where u d k 1 u k 1 z 2 r and r d is given in 33 the ctc inputs ϖ i c t i 1 2 are designed as 21 ϖ i c t 1

the main result on continuous time stabilization of the closed loop system is summarized in theorem 2 theorem 2 assuming a perfect implementation of the ctc inputs without the measurement error i e τ

proof with the proposed virtual control law 10 and considering the effect of the velocity tracking error e i 0 between the two subsystems the outer loop subsystem 8 becomes 24 z 1 e 1 k 1 z 1 z 2 v d r z 2 k 1 z 1 r c d e 1 r z 3 r d e 2 v c k 1 z 1 e 1 r d v where u u d e 1 and r r d e 2 substituting 21 in to 20 yields 25 e 1 l 1 e 1 f e 2 l 2 e 2 ξ construct the lyapunov function candidates as

have ξ l defined by 30 ξ k 2 ξ e 2 d φ v 1 d v 1 e 1 k 1 z 1 c d z 2 r k 1 k 1 d v r h t exploiting the above results with v 3 one can verify 31 v 3 2 α z 1 z 1 2 β v v 2 k 2 ξ ξ 2 i 1 2 l i e i e i l as a result v 3 is bounded and v 3 is uniformly continuous invoking b a r b a l a t lemma one can show that lim t v 3 0 which implies that 32 lim t z 1 v ξ e 1 e 2 0 exploiting 27 and 28 with 32 we get lim t v 1 v 2 0 note that r d l defined by 33 r d k 2 ξ d φ v 1 d v 1 v 1 h t d φ v 1 d v 1 α z 1 2 β v 2 h t φ v 1 h t 2 d φ v 1 d v 1 α z 1 z 1 β v v h t d 2 φ v 1 d v 1 2 v 1 α z 1 2 β v 2 h t thus z 1 is uniformly continuous as 34 z 1 e 1 k 1 z 1 z 2 v d r d e 2 z 2 v d r d e 2 l and lim t 0 t z 1 χ d χ z 1 0 exists again using b a r b a l a t lemma we have lim t z 1 0 therefore lim t z 2 r d 0 substituting 10 and 26 into z 2 r d with 32 yields 35 lim t z 2 φ 1 2 z 2 2 h t 0 recalling definition 2 that lim t d h t d t 0 one can show that lim t z 2 0 then applying 9 and 32 it is easy to verify that lim t z 3 0 therefore the closed loop system is proved to be globally asymptotically stable in the sense that lim t z 1 z 2 z 3 v e 1 e 2 0 remark 3 2 it is important to mention that u d should not contain u and r d should not contain r such that the ctc inputs are causal without containing themselves substituting 5 27 and 30 ito 33 r d can be calculated applying u d and r d into 21 and 22 one can verify that the ctc control inputs are causal which can be used in real applications 2 etc inputs design inspired by the switching threshold strategy reported in garcia and antsaklis 2011 and xing et al 2017 the swt etm in this paper is designed as 36 τ i t ϖ i t i k t t i k t i k 1 i 1 2 37 t i k 1 inf t r δ i c i τ i t γ i inf t r δ i δ i τ i t d i τ i t γ i where k n is the k th triggering sequence when the controller updates the initial instant is defined by t i 0 0 τ t τ 1 t τ 2 t t is the actual control inputs that will be designed in the next subsection c i d i γ i 0 and 0 δ i 1 are the etm design parameters δ i ϖ i t ϖ i t i k is the measurement error between the inputs of the present moment and the previous triggering instant when the control value of τ i is larger than the prescribed switching threshold γ i i e τ i t γ i the triggering threshold is chosen to be a constant c i namely the ft etm δ i c i is applied such that large impulses of the control input are prevented once the control value becomes small i e τ i t γ i the measurement error δ i is set to be proportional to the control value of τ i namely the rt etm δ i δ i τ i t d i is actived such that a precise control performance is guaranteed whenever anyone of the above triggering conditions in 37 is satisfied the triggering instant will be marked as t i k 1 and the control input value will be updated as ϖ i t i k 1 which is further transmitted to the actuator model of the usv it should be noted that during the time t t i k t i k 1 the control input value is fixed as ϖ i t i k therefore frequent communication and executions of the actuator are avoided the burden of the system is thus significantly reduced the diagram of the swt etc is illustrated in fig 2 from the above analysis the event triggered stabilization problem reduces to the design of a well defined function of ϖ i t regarded as the input of the etm with which the actual etc represented by τ t can be derived using 36 and 37 it is easy to verify that the ctc 21 cascaded with the swt etm 36 37 cannot asymptotically stabilize the closed loop system due to the existence of δ i causing v 3 defined by 29 be v 3 x t a x i 1 2 x δ i which is no longer negative semidefinite from 37 we have δ i max c i δ i γ i d i therefore the boundedness of the closed loop system still holds and all the states asymptotically converge to x 2 max c i δ i γ i d i min α β k 2 l 1 l 2 rather than zero consequently the effect of δ i should be compensated based on the result of the ctc inputs in theorem 2 the etc inputs ϖ i t i 1 2 are modified as 38 ϖ i t 1 δ i α i 2 e i p 3 i α i e i 2 ε t i 2 1 δ i d i 2 e i d i e i 2 ε t i 2 l i ϖ e i where l i 0 and α i are defined in 22 ε t i is a function of time defined in definition 3 l i ϖ 0 and d i max d i 1 δ i c i 1 δ i are the control parameters remark 3 3 the first and third terms of 38 are introduced to drive the value of e i to be smaller when e i is far away from the origin as e i tends to zero the first and second terms of 38 are applied to compensate for the effect induced by the measurement error δ i with which the control accuracy of the etc can be guaranteed moreover it can be verified from remark 3 2 that the etc inputs ϖ i t are causal 4 stability analysis the main result on stabilization of the usv with the proposed etc is summarized in theorem 3 theorem 3 the proposed swt etc τ i t i 1 2 defined by 10 22 and 36 38 globally asymptotically stabilizes the origin of the usv system 5 6 with the control parameters satisfying 0 k 1 d c

threshold γ i according to 37 the stability analysis can be divided into the following two cases based on whether τ i γ i case 1 τ i γ i the ft etm δ i c i in case 1 during the interval t t i k t i k 1 from the first line of 37 we have τ i t ϖ i t c i as a result there exists continuous time varying functions λ 1 i t i 1 2 satisfying λ 1 i t k 0 λ 1 i t k 1 1 and λ 1 i t 1 t t i k t i k 1 such that ϖ i t τ i t λ 1 i t c i i e 39 τ i t ϖ i t λ 1 i t c i substituting 39 into 29 v 3 is equal to 40 v 3 x t a x i 1 2 e i α i i 1 2 p 3 i e i ϖ i t λ 1 i t c i then applying 38 into 40 we have 41 v 3 x t a 2 x i 1 2 e i α i i 1 2 p 3 i e i λ 1 i t c i i 1 2 1 δ i α i e i 2 α i e i 2 ε t i 2 p 3 i d i e i 2 d i e i 2 ε t i 2 where a 2 diag α β k 2 l 1 l 2 and l i l i l i ϖ since e i α i 1 δ i e i α i by applying with λ 1 i t 1 and d i max d i 1 δ i c i 1 δ i we have e i λ 1 i t c i 1 δ i d i e i then 41 is rewritten as 42 v 3 x t a 2 x i 1 2 1 δ i e i α i α i e i 2 α i e i 2 ε t i 2 i 1 2 p 3 i 1 δ i d i e i d i e i 2 d i e i 2 ε t i 2 invoking lemma 1 and note that 1 1 δ i 2 we have 43 v 3 x t a 2 x 2 i 1 2 1 p 3 i ε t i case 2 τ i γ i the rt etm δ i δ i τ i t d i in case 2 during the interval t t i k t i k 1 from the second line of 37 we have τ i t ϖ i t δ i τ i t d i as a result there exists continuous time varying functions λ 2 i t and λ 3 i t i 1 2 satisfying λ 2 i t λ 3 i t 1 t t i k t i k 1 such that ϖ i t 1 λ 2 i t δ i τ i t λ 3 i t d i i e 44 τ i t ϖ i t λ 3 i t d i 1 λ 2 i t δ i substituting 44 into 29 v 3 is equal to 45 v 3 x t a x i 1 2 e i α i i 1 2 p 3 i e i ϖ i t λ 3 i t d i 1 λ 2 i t δ i note that λ 2 i t λ 3 i t 1 and 0 δ i 1 thus 0 1 δ i 1 λ 2 i t δ i 1 δ i according to 38 we have e i ϖ i 0 using d i max d i 1 δ i c i 1 δ i we obtain 46 e i ϖ i t 1 λ 2 i t δ i e i ϖ i t 1 δ i 0 0 λ 3 i t d i 1 λ 2 i t δ i d i 1 δ i d i therefore 45 is rewritten as 47 v 3 x t a x i 1 2 e i α i i 1 2 p 3 i e i ϖ i t 1 δ i d i e i substituting 38 into 47 yields 48 v 3 x t a 2 x i 1 2 e i α i α i e i 2 α i e i 2 ε t i 2 i 1 2 p 3 i d i e i d i e i 2 d i e i 2 ε t i 2 invoking lemma 1 one can obtain 49 v 3 x t a 2 x i 1 2 1 p 3 i ε t i it can be seen from 43 and 49 that 43 always holds regardless of case 1 or case 2 occurs as a result define q t x t a 2 x 0 v 3 satisfies 50 v 3 t q t 2 i 1 2 1 p 3 i ε i t according to definition 3 let ρ i lim t 0 t ε i χ d χ and μ 2 i 1 2 1 p 3 i ρ i note that p 3 and p 6 are constants integrating 50 over time yields 51 v 3 t v 3 0 0 t q χ d χ μ from 26 and 51 we have 52 0 v 3 t v 3 t 0 t q χ d χ v 3 0 μ therefore v 3 t is globally bounded and hence z 1 z 2 z 2 v ξ e 1 e 2 l applying 22 23 and 38 with 39 and 44 we obtain τ i t l then applying the above results into 20 24 and 30 we have z 1 v ξ e 1 e 2 l moreover using 52 we obtain lim t 0 t z 1 2 χ d χ v 3 0 μ α lim t 0 t v 2 χ d χ v 3 0 μ β lim t 0 t ξ 2 χ d χ v 3 0 μ k 2 and lim t 0 t e i 2 χ d χ v 3 0 μ l i therefore we get z 1 v ξ e 1 e 2 l 2 invoking b a r b a l a t lemma one can show that lim t z 1 v ξ e 1 e 2 0 following the same analysis as in 33 35 in the proof of theorem 2 one can conclude that the closed loop system is proved to be globally asymptotically stable in the sense that lim t z 1 z 2 z 3 v e 1 e 2 0 since all signals are globally bounded according to 36 38 there must exist a constant k i ϖ 0 satisfying 53 δ i t ϖ i t k i ϖ t t i k t i k 1 on the other hand it is verified from 37 that 54 lim t t i k δ i t 0 ft etm lim t t i k 1 δ i t c i τ i t γ i rt etm lim t t i k 1 δ i t δ i τ i t d i τ i t γ i therefore by combining 53 with 54 we obtain that the lower bound of the inter execution intervals δ t must satisfy t i k 1 t i k k i ϖ min δ i t i k 1 δ i t i k i e 55 δ t min inf t i k 1 t i k min c i δ i τ i t d i k i ϖ 0 namely the zeno phenomenon is successfully avoided remark 4 1 as the stabilization error asymptotically converges to zero using 38 we get lim t ϖ i t 0 which leads to lim t τ i t 0 by 36 and 44 if the rt etm is adopted without d i i e d i 0 however according to 55 this causes lim t δ t min 0 as a result d i 0 should be added into the rt etm to guarantee δ t min 0 to avoid the zeno phenomenon obviously the smaller value of d i would improve the control accuracy but increase the execution times which will be observed in the simulations remark 4 2 since the rt etm is adopted to guarantee the control accuracy the parameter d i of the swt etm should be small and must satisfy d i c i otherwise the relative term δ i τ i t would be negligible compared with d i when τ i t is small such that the rt etm δ i δ i τ i d i almost becomes the ft etm δ i d i besides the switching threshold γ i should not be too big but must satisfy γ i c i otherwise the measurement error bound of the ft etm would contain the range of the triggering threshold causing the ft etm not properly switch to the rt etm when τ i t γ i on the other hand c i should be chosen to satisfy c i δ i γ i d i when adopting the ft etm which guarantees larger value of the triggering threshold as well as longer update intervals than those of the rt etm when τ i t approximates γ i consequently the swt etm design parameters should satisfy d i δ i γ i d i c i γ i 5 simulations in this section the effectiveness of the proposed swt etc is validated by simulation examples with the usv model parameters m 11 155 kg m 22 105 kg m 33 20 kg m 2 d 11 70 kg s d 22 100 kg s d 33 50 kg m 2 s the initial conditions of the usv system are selected as x 0 15 m y 0 30 m ψ 0 1 rad u 0 0 m s v 0 0 m s r 0 0 rad s the desired position and attitude are chosen as x d 0 m y d 0 m ψ d 0 rad the control parameters are given by k 1 0 1 k 2 0 3 l 1 0 1 l 2 0 1 l 1 ϖ 155 l 2 ϖ 20 the control functions are defined by φ v 1 2 4 tanh v 1 h t sin 0 1 t ε t i 0 3 e 0 01 t i 1 2 according to remark 4 2 the swt etm configurations are given by the switching thresholds γ 1 45 γ 2 8 the ft etm parameters c 1 40 c 2 6 the rt etm parameters δ 1 0 5 d 1 10 δ 2 0 1 d 2 2 and according to 38 choose d 1 27 d 2 5 5 to satisfy d i max d i 1 δ i c i 1 δ i the simulation results of the proposed swt etc 36 38 are given in figs 3 5 as is shown in figs 3 4 a and 5 a all the states of the usv remain bounded and asymptotically converge to zero figs 4 and 5 show that the control torque and moment are updated only when the triggering conditions are satisfied in figs 4 b and 5 b the inter event intervals between two consecutive sampling instants of the swt etc are illustrated from which we can see the lower bound of the intervals exists and is positive without the zeno phenomenon moreover to illustrate the merits of the proposed swt etc and make comparisons simulations of 1 the ft etc using the ft etm of 37 with 36 and 38 2 the rt etc using the rt etm of 37 with 36 and 38 3 the ctc 21 with the fixed sampling interval δ t 0 05 s which are applied to the usv with the same control parameters and initial conditions given above 4 the rt etc b only changing d i of the rt etc above as d 1 1 and d 2 0 2 5 the smooth time varying method proposed in dong and guo 2005 with the control parameters k 1 0 07 k 2 0 1 k 3 1 k 4 1 and δ t 0 05 s are carried out respectively illustrated in figs 6 12 as is shown in figs 6 9 the proposed etcs make all the states of the usv remain bounded and asymptotically converge to zero without the zeno phenomenon however due to the existence of the measurement error the proposed ctc and the method in dong and guo 2005 cannot guarantee asymptotic convergence of the yaw angle though the position coordinates of the usv are stabilized with larger error which can be observed in figs 6 and 12 it can be verified from figs 4 7 and 8 that in the first 7 s the control value of the swt etc and the ft etc is smaller than that of the rt etc and there exists noticeable impulses of the control force τ 1 with the rt etm shown in figs 8 a and 9 a this is because the states of the usv are far away from the origin such that the value of the control inputs τ i is big enough to make the relative measurement error δ i τ i d i larger than the fixed one c i thus the rt etc has to generate large impulses to compensate for the effect of the larger relative measurement error δ i τ i d i while the ft etm applied into the swt etc and the ft etc prevents the control signals from large impulses with the smaller fixed measurement error c i to be compensated for as shown in figs 4 a 7 a 8 a and 9 a as the states converge to the origin after 30 s δ i τ i d i gradually becomes much smaller than c i therefore the swt etc and the rt etc can achieve smaller stabilization error than that of the ft etc besides the ft etc has to execute faster to compensate for the effect of the larger fixed measurement error c i making oscillations of the usv states and larger tracking error shown in figs 6 7 and 11 fig 10 illustrates the energy consumption index curves p 0 t τ 1 2 χ τ 2 2 χ d χ of the aforementioned controllers from which we get the proposed etcs significantly reduce the energy consumptions more strikingly since the swt etc avoids large impulses when the control value is high and executes less times when the control value is small with high control accuracy and smaller control magnitude the energy consumption is therefore the least of the controllers when applying the same parameters on the other hand when the value of d i is chosen to be smaller the value of the measurement error δ i τ i d i decreases such that the stabilization error becomes smaller when applying the rt etc b as shown in fig 6 besides it is verified from figs 4 5 8 and 9 as well as 44 that the magnitude of τ i decreases with the smaller value of d i thus the amount of the energy consumption is the least of all the etcs as shown in fig 10 however as discussed in remark 4 1 the smaller d i would make the triggering threshold sensitive to the measurement error therefore the rt etc b executes much more times than that of the swt etc and the rt etc which can be observed in figs 4 5 8 9 and 11 indeed fig 11 illustrates that the control signals of the rt etc b updates 758 and 302 times in the first 200 s though less than the 4000 times of the continuous time methods by comparison for the swt etc τ 1 and τ 2 are updated only 378 and 141 times respectively hence the communication and actuator burden of the system is significantly reduced despite with slightly larger stabilization error consequently by choosing suitable control parameters the swt etc can get a better trade off between the stabilization error and the system burden from the above discussion we obtain that the proposed swt etc takes the advantages of the ft etc and the rt etc to avoid dramatic and frequent changes of the actuator with a satisfactory control performance and less communication burden which can effectively protect the actuator devices of the usv system 6 conclusion an swt etc for global full state stabilization of the usvs is proposed for the first time based on the inner outer loop structure with lyapunov control design technique which has a simple structure and is easy to be implemented by using the proposed swt etm the control force and moment are modulated only when certain event triggering conditions are satisfied averting the large impulses and frequent updates of the control signal such that reducing the burden of the actuator devices without degrading the control performance in addition it significantly reduces the times for communication while provides stable and accurate performance for the stabilization the proposed swt etc guarantees global asymptotical convergence of the stabilization error by choosing proper control parameters simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the

21341,tidal current energy is considered as one of the most important topics to be analyzed due to the penetration of renewable energy sources into the grid the influence of unsteady wave is playing a crucial role on the tidal currents speed forecasting and its extracted power as well as its integration into the grid the influence is not significant in case of single turbine or ducted tidal turbines that is particularly important when taking in account the wave effect as a significant factor to predict the potential of tidal energy in various locations and evaluate the power losses due to severe weather condition in this work we studied the influence of unsteady wave on the tidal current energy in case of two and three tidal turbines the proposed work is validated by using more than one forecasting model based on ann as well as making an interface with the arduino micro controller using matlab simulink to calculate the power loss due to the wave effect during severe weather conditions results proves that using the wave height as an input for the forecasting models will improve the forecasted speed also wave height will reduce the extracted output power and increase the power losses especially in case of multi turbines due to the increase of wave height keywords unsteady wave tidal currents turbulence forecasting ann 1 introduction tidal power has inspired by the development and advances in wind energy systems fituri and aly 2018 the available power in tidal turbines farm is more predictive than wind farm due to low fluctuation of tidal stream velocity however the stability of tidal speed could be influenced by several factors such as inhomogeneous turbulence and unsteady waves this paper will focus specifically on the effect of surface wave behaviour under severe weather and storm condition ann is used to consider the effect of unsteady waves on tidal power forecasting and evaluate the power losses due to the presence of surface waves ann is data driven forecasting tool with a strong capability for pattern recognition in contrary to the traditional forecasting methods the bio inspired ann models can explore and adapt the relationship between the inputs even if the underlaying physical mechanism is unknown however regarding this work pearson correlation has been tested by the author in previous work to examine the strength of relationship for tidal speed versus wave height and tidal stream direction the results are consistent with the literature findings and asserted on the effect of wave height and its impact which is direction shift on the potential tidal power although the correlation with the wave height is stronger it should be emphasized that minor shift in stream direction will reflect on significant reduction in the extractable power fituri and aly 2018 zhang et al 1998 fituri et al 2017 the effect could induce poor power quality and reduce the extractable net power from the instream turbines farm the influence is insignificant in case of single turbine or ducted tidal systems however considerable losses are expected in tidal farm model that is particularly important when taking in account the influence as a significant factor to assess the potential sites of open stream tidal energy and estimate the resulted power losses due to winter condition according to previous findings the wave induced fluctuation in tidal velocity will increase the load on the turbine blade and reduce the expected blade lifetime lu and lu 2017 it is difficult to perform systematic evaluation of unsteady wave effect on the overall performance of tidal turbines farm due to the uncertainty of tidal turbulence among other limited studies colucci et al 2014 asserted on the presence of tidal current and wave interaction despite of the fact that the impact is more significant at specific locations de jesus et al de jesus et al 2016 stated that unsteady wave impact will change the angle of attack on the fast flowing tidal currents thus reducing the extractable energy for the whole turbines farm understanding the fundamentals of wave tidal interaction is essential to create scenarios analysis and evaluate the expected energy losses under storm condition various models have been used by lewis et al 2014 and hashemi et al 2015 to facilitate the issue of wave induced prediction losses the results show approximately 5 10 output power reduction for every extra meter in the wave height apparently this will negatively impact the accuracy of assessment for tidal resources in this work different criteria used to test the effect of unsteady waves on the potential capacity of instream tidal turbines in this work different criteria introduced for testing and evaluating the effect of unsteady waves on the potential capacity of instream tidal power based on equation 1 current speed is the most important factor on the produced power as the speed influenced by the wave height and direction the extractable power will be altered the assumption and its results indirectly endorse previous findings from tidal wave interaction studies colucci et al 2014 hashemi et al 2015 for instance colucci et al 2014 reached a conclusion that wave direction and current speed interact on each other to conclude tidal power is the most reliable and predictable source of renewable energy and the motion of tidal stream is uniform under normal weather condition however the wind generated ocean surface waves associated with severe weather and storm condition can alter the speed and direction of open stream tidal currents and consequently affect the potential capacity of tidal power in other words due to the unsteady surface waves the speed of tidal stream is fluctuated and the direction of motion is changed as a result the optimal blade pitch angle of tidal turbine will be shifted that will reflect on the extractable power will be reduced for this reason evaluation of wave effect is vital for tidal power

severe weather case and evaluate the impacts every valuable factor considering within the forecasting strategies can contribute in to clear the fog and alleviate the complexity of the turbine s ambient noise the main novelty of the work lies in the development of new low cost predictor that is used for measuring the effect of unsteady waves on the tidal energy systems adding the wave effect predictor will positively impact the optimal control strategy towards more stable and cost effective grid connected models the new model could also be beneficial for the isolated and particular purpose mini grid the model is tested with various locations and turbine types the next step is to take the developed prototype to the commercialization the model gives comparison analysis about the effect of unsteady wave in terms of height and direction deflection to the extractable tidal power the results can be shown for different turbines farms with similar or different turbines size and type from various locations it is worth mentioning that re adjusting the tip speed ratio can compensate and lower the losses to the minimum value the model can calculate the various cases for different concepts 2 the main structure of artificial neural network ann neural network algorithm is used with optimization criteria such as mean square error to obtain higher accuracy the matrix of

backwards to modify the weights and bias values for minimizing the error bp neural network algorithm needs many repetitions to converge however there is always the possibility to get stuck in a local minimum often due to false weight dimension choice rbf uses the cover s theorem which states a non linearly separable problem is highly separable in high dimensional space than it is in low dimensional space nodes in hidden layer perform the radial basis transformation which is basically increasing the dimensions of input feature vector and by doing that defining optimal receptors and spread of the radial basis function input units distribute the values to the hidden layer units uniformly without multiplying them with weights hidden units are known as rbf units because their

effectively to enhance the forecast precision for each step more hidden layers are used each layer consists of some neurons the efficiency of ann is influenced by the weights and number of hidden layers not merely the condition of the system parameters at the designated time the results compared with previous studies aly and el hawary 2014 hibbert et al 2015 observational data source one year

proposed forecasted models in this part we tried to use three different simple models based on ann to show the importance of using our proposed input with that simple model it could be applied to more complicated models and the accuracy will be increased like models used in aly and el hawary 2014 and aly 2020a the first model is fed by the time in minutes and the second model is fed by the time in minutes and wave height and the third model is fed by the time in minutes wave height and direction all models are used for the instream tidal speed forecasting several approaches are used to compare the accuracy of the models one method is mean absolute error mae in this method the sum of the difference between actual and predicted values to the predicted values for each pair of data is calculated aly 2020a the formula shown in equation 2 2 m a p e 1 n 1 n x i y i y i x 100 where x the predicted value y the actual value n the number of observations normalized mean square error nmse is commonly used to compare between different models also in this tool the summation is rated to the mean of the actual values aly 2020a see equation 3 3 n r m s e 1 n 1 n x i y i 2 y testing the correlation between the actual and forecasted variables by the r index as follows aly 2020a 4 r n x i y i y i x i n x i 2 x i 2 n y i 2 y i 2 a common way to select weights probably is to use prior knowledge learning theory training the neural network by time series data and applying learning rules is a less complicated method to improve the weights and achieve more accurate estimation the output of each layer is a function of the input and it can be expressed as follows 5 y j t i 1 n w i j x i t b i 6 y k t j 1 p 1 w j k y j t b i 7 y m t i 1 p 2 w k m y k t b i where y j t and y k t are the outputs of hidden layers and y m t is the estimated output of the ann the n p 1 p 2 and m are the number of neurons for each layer w i j w j k and w k m are the adjustable weights associated with each layer b i is the ith bias neuron to achieve a well constructed network ann needs to be tested with different topology i e number of layers and neurons in terms of training process faster algorithm is the best selection to reduces the convergence time other aspects such as pattern of data and accuracy criteria have been taken into the account aly 2012 hundreds of runs are done to choose the best number or hidden layers and neurons for this proposed work as well as the best function 3 1 first model in this model the time is fed to ann and trained for forecasting the output tidal current speed as shown in fig 2 fig 2 shows the first proposed model which has the time fed as an input to the ann and the output is the tidal current speed fig 3 shows the relation between the time and the speed for the trained data using ann as a forecasting tool fig 4 shows a zoomed version of fig 3 table 1 shows a comparison for different models by calculating the percentage of absolute mean square error for the forecasted trained and untrained data as we see in fig 3 and table 1 the absolute mean square error is 0 083 fig 5 shows the relation between the time and the speed for the untrained data using ann as a forecasting tool fig 6 is a zoomed version of fig 5 for the untrained data less accuracy with 0 18 error has been noticed which is acceptable compared to the trained data 3 2 second model as it is shown in fig 7 a new variable wave height is added to ann input layer and trained for new current speed forecasting fig 7 show the second proposed model which has the time and wave height fed as input to the ann and the output is the tidal current speed the relation between the time wave height and the speed with the trained data using ann as a forecasting tool is illustrated in fig 8 fig 9 shows a zoomed version of fig 8 as we see in fig 8 and table 1 the percentage of the absolute mean square error is 0 065 fig 10 shows the relation between the time wave and the speed for the untrained data using ann as a forecasting tool fig 11 shows a zoomed version of fig 10 fig 10 shows 0 131 of absolute mean square error as can be seen the error is reduced for both trained and untrained data due to wave height was considered as an additional input factor in the proposed ann model 3 3 third model three variables are used in this model time wave height and the direction are fed to ann and trained for forecasting the output tidal current speed considering the tidal current direction in addition to the two previous variables aims to learn more about the uncertainty of current speed and the tidal turbine ambient environment fig 12 shows the third proposed model which has the time wave height and direction fed as input to the ann and the output is the predicted values of tidal current speed fig 13 shows the relation between the time and the speed for the trained data using ann as a forecasting tool fig 14 shows a zoomed version of fig 13 the best accuracy achieved in fig 13 where the percentage of the absolute mean square error is 0 034 as seen in table 1 fig 15 shows the relation between the time and the speed for the untrained data using ann as a forecasting tool the main improvement in this work is obtained by including more forecasting predictors the proposed model three prediction parameters seems to be appropriate to eliminate the forecast errors caused by unsteady waves as it can be seen in the figures the results also show that the prediction using radial basis function neural network is more accurate when considering the wave effect in the proposed ann tool three models are compared using trained and untrained data the resulted error ratio is registered in table 1 simulation and results analysis in the proposed ann tool three models are compared using trained and untrained data and the resulted errors nrmse is illustrated in table 1 table 2 shows the configuration of different training scenarios with associated errors for most accurate forecast model the number of neurons and hidden layers have been also listed in table 2 as it is shown in the table 1 the best model is the third model as the nrmse for the trained data is 0 034 compared to the second model which is 0 065 and the first model at 0 083 based on these results we can reach a conclusion that tidal speed forecasting has improved by adding wave height and direction as extra predictors the best accuracy is achieved by training with two hidden layers and 50 neurons more improvement might be reached by using more complicated network however that will be associated with higher cost and computational time so far the proposed model seems to be appropriate to eliminate the forecast errors caused by unsteady waves in the literature on time direction based error was tackled by turbine blade pitch angle tracking algorithms different tools are still needed to evaluate the effect of each parameter and set the proper weights as it is shown in the table 1 the best model is the third model as the mape for the trained data is 0 034 compared to the second model which is 0 065 and the first model which is 0 083 however quantifying oblique waves effect and estimating the wave height impact on the instream tidal energy is a recent research topic in this regard more accurate forecasting models is vital for advanced control strategies the direction caused error is tackled by turbine blade pitch angle tracking algorithms while the wave tidal interaction is more complex and need more work to deal with the uncertainty lastly bearing in mind that although improvement has been seen with the above mentioned hybrid tidal wave forecasting model yet it is not sufficient to precisely consider the wave effect on the tidal system performance rather we can build the forecasting speed time model and consequentially evaluate the wave effect in certain speed height conditions then estimate the power losses to specifically quantify the wave induced influence with a better approximation method as it is clarified next the suggested approach is extended to include theoretical modeling and low cost arduino board to estimate and compensate the influence of unsteady waves to achieve a well constructed network ann needs to be tested with different topology i e number of layers and neurons in terms of training process faster algorithm is the best selection to reduces the convergence time other aspects such as pattern of data and accuracy criteria have been also taken into the account the flowchart of the ann based forecasting process can be divided into three stages see fig 16 first data sets are loaded second training data to create a model lastly compare the output values with the actual values and calculate the errors 4 wave

velocity 5 low cost estimator as a validation model for wave influenced tidal power system the extractable power of tidal resources can be overestimated due to the uncertainty of the daily ambient environment characteristics one of these observations that may impact the overall performance of instream tidal turbines farm is unsteady waves behaviour severe weather that cause higher surface wave level leads to tidal fluctuation accordingly reduce the captured power and induce poor power quality the proposed low cost model will focus on the impact of unsteady waves on the overall produced power for all instream tidal turbines farms suggested in specific locations identification and evaluation of the wave effect on the system performance is required also it is vital to estimate the related losses and ensure the reliability for tidal powered projects arduino model mega 2560 has been used to build the low cost estimator for the issue mentioned above mega 2560 is a microcontroller board interfaced with the computer and operated by a programmable matlab code sathya and valluvan 2019a 2019b the proposed polynomial function is created based on the results from the previous studies and has been implemented with five different tidal turbines farms the resulted losses asserted that the impact is more significant for multiple turbines than a single turbine the designed simulink model illustrates several scenarios by computer simulation and evaluates the expected losses for different wave heights two examples for power losses due to wave effect have been selected to be illustrated in this paper the impact is neglected for the low tidal speed close to or equals to turbine cut in speed the efficiency of tidal turbine operating in high current speed is highly impacted by the high waves however the impact is evaluated in previous study by implementing a virtual model hashemi et al 2015 further research with real data from tidal turbines is still required to develop our understanding about unsteady wave effect at various conditions figs 17 and 18 illustrate the simulink supported low cost arduino model the model could be used initially with any wave height measurement device for testing purpose in the costal area furthermore it can be extended to estimate an optimal generation unit sizing and support load shedding technique the curves in figures 19 and 20 display the wave induced power losses over the speed changes with two selected wave heights 1 5 m 2 5 m more power losses have been seen with higher wave elevation whereas increasing the turbine blade diameter led to less wave effect the feasibility of the low cost model in on site control for tidal power systems will be tested in the future work the simulink graphs figs 19 20 show how the proposed arduino model fig 21 estimates the power losses in five turbines groups for each farm the expected generated power has been estimated during the presence of 2 5 and 1 5 m respectively the graphs show lower power losses percentage with 1 5 m height than 2 5 m the losses also could be reduced by increasing the ratio of the actual turbine output efficiency constant and tracking the changes in the pitch angle we can also conclude that the unsteady wave effect varies due to the selected turbines blade cross section the proposed simulink design verifier consists of wave height measuring unit manual or data file as an input to the first component after that the effect on wave speed is calculated and the losses in constrained generated power from different five turbines farms are specified and displayed the main novelty of the work lies in the development of new low cost predictor that is used for measuring the effect of unsteady waves on the tidal energy systems adding the wave effect predictor will positively impact the optimal control strategy towards more stable and cost effective grid connected models the new model could also be beneficial for the isolated and particular purpose mini grid the model is tested with various locations and turbine types the next step is to take the developed prototype to the commercialization the initial model needs to be extended to cover other wave aspects such as wave period the model gives comparison analysis about the effect of unsteady wave in terms of height and direction shift to the extractable tidal power the results can be shown for different turbines farms with similar or different turbines size and type from various locations it is worth mentioning that re adjusting tip speed ratio can compensating and lowering the minimum losses the model can calculate various cases for different concepts 6 discussion and recommendations the authors have presented predictive neural models for estimating the forecast error ratio to quantify the influence of wave height variation stream direction shift on the potential of extractable in stream tidal energy the paper is focusing on proposing implementing and evaluating an accurate wave influenced tidal speed forecasting model as well as simulink supported arduino analyzer to assess and predict the power losses caused by unsteady ocean surface waves recommendations can be stated as follows when using ann to predict ocean variables we recommend radial basis function rbf due to its excellent performance with nonlinearity and uncertainty back propagation technique is also recommended as it provides feedback from the output layer to the hidden layers and utilize it for optimal error correction but for tidal instream rbf worked better considering wave height as an input parameter in tidal speed forecasting is not appropriate if the ocean currents are steady while direction shift may interrupt the uniform motion of currents due to other environmental impact apart from wave effect during ebb to flood condition this impact is out of the scope of this paper while appealing with its simplicity arduino predictive model can perform poorly when the current speed is less than cut in velocity or higher than cut off velocity similar performance is expected with a wave height higher than and or close to 4 m however for wave height 4m safety issues may appear mostly with medium scale turbines and the system may require shutdown lastly wave effect is minimum during normal weather when the wave height is less than 1 m the influence during calm weather can be neglected because it does not affect the performance of tidal energy farm this conclusion has been reached after scale model test was conducted on horizontal axis turbine with and without surface waves luznik et al 2011 7 conclusions in this paper we studied the effect of unsteady ocean waves on the forecasted and actual tidal currents speed and its generated power losses different ann forecasting models have been proposed and tested to evaluate the wave induced effect on the prediction of tidal current speed and extractable power three different models are proposed for error assessment the best fit model is obtained by associating wave height stream direction and current speed over a specific time and this will led to a valuable error reduction the proposed arduino microcontroller can be developed after quantifying all aspects of wave effect to create an accurate losses estimator and compensator also it can be associated with the adaptive filtering system to generate control command alongside with filtering results or tip speed ratio tsr controller the model needs to be extended and validated in the future by using simulated data for certain location of tidal farm finally the assumption of wave induced losses has been developed and validated in this work constrained tidal power equation and extended mathematical model has also been developed the proposed ann scenarios are focusing on the assessment during unsteady waves and severe weather conditions wave behaviour impact may not exist during normal weather condition the future work could also be extended to include investigation and analysis for other impacts of wave influenced instream tidal system such as poor power quality and tidal farm layout optimization

21341,tidal current energy is considered as one of the most important topics to be analyzed due to the penetration of renewable energy sources into the grid the influence of unsteady wave is playing a crucial role on the tidal currents speed forecasting and its extracted power as well as its integration into the grid the influence is not significant in case of single turbine or ducted tidal turbines that is particularly important when taking in account the wave effect as a significant factor to predict the potential of tidal energy in various locations and evaluate the power losses due to severe weather condition in this work we studied the influence of unsteady wave on the tidal current energy in case of two and three tidal turbines the proposed work is validated by using more than one forecasting model based on ann as well as making an interface with the arduino micro controller using matlab simulink to calculate the power loss due to the wave effect during severe weather conditions results proves that using the wave height as an input for the forecasting models will improve the forecasted speed also wave height will reduce the extracted output power and increase the power losses especially in case of multi turbines due to the increase of wave height keywords unsteady wave tidal currents turbulence forecasting ann 1 introduction tidal power has inspired by the development and advances in wind energy systems fituri and aly 2018 the available power in tidal turbines farm is more predictive than wind farm due to low fluctuation of tidal stream velocity however the stability of tidal speed could be influenced by several factors such as inhomogeneous turbulence and unsteady waves this paper will focus specifically on the effect of surface wave behaviour under severe weather and storm condition ann is used to consider the effect of unsteady waves on tidal power forecasting and evaluate the power losses due to the presence of surface waves ann is data driven forecasting tool with a strong capability for pattern recognition in contrary to the traditional forecasting methods the bio inspired ann models can explore and adapt the relationship between the inputs even if the underlaying physical mechanism is unknown however regarding this work pearson correlation has been tested by the author in previous work to examine the strength of relationship for tidal speed versus wave height and tidal stream direction the results are consistent with the literature findings and asserted on the effect of wave height and its impact which is direction shift on the potential tidal power although the correlation with the wave height is stronger it should be emphasized that minor shift in stream direction will reflect on significant reduction in the extractable power fituri and aly 2018 zhang et al 1998 fituri et al 2017 the effect could induce poor power quality and reduce the extractable net power from the instream turbines farm the influence is insignificant in case of single turbine or ducted tidal systems however considerable losses are expected in tidal farm model that is particularly important when taking in account the influence as a significant factor to assess the potential sites of open stream tidal energy and estimate the resulted power losses due to winter condition according to previous findings the wave induced fluctuation in tidal velocity will increase the load on the turbine blade and reduce the expected blade lifetime lu and lu 2017 it is difficult to perform systematic evaluation of unsteady wave effect on the overall performance of tidal turbines farm due to the uncertainty of tidal turbulence among other limited studies colucci et al 2014 asserted on the presence of tidal current and wave interaction despite of the fact that the impact is more significant at specific locations de jesus et al de jesus et al 2016 stated that unsteady wave impact will change the angle of attack on the fast flowing tidal currents thus reducing the extractable energy for the whole turbines farm understanding the fundamentals of wave tidal interaction is essential to create scenarios analysis and evaluate the expected energy losses under storm condition various models have been used by lewis et al 2014 and hashemi et al 2015 to facilitate the issue of wave induced prediction losses the results show approximately 5 10 output power reduction for every extra meter in the wave height apparently this will negatively impact the accuracy of assessment for tidal resources in this work different criteria used to test the effect of unsteady waves on the potential capacity of instream tidal turbines in this work different criteria introduced for testing and evaluating the effect of unsteady waves on the potential capacity of instream tidal power based on equation 1 current speed is the most important factor on the produced power as the speed influenced by the wave height and direction the extractable power will be altered the assumption and its results indirectly endorse previous findings from tidal wave interaction studies colucci et al 2014 hashemi et al 2015 for instance colucci et al 2014 reached a conclusion that wave direction and current speed interact on each other to conclude tidal power is the most reliable and predictable source of renewable energy and the motion of tidal stream is uniform under normal weather condition however the wind generated ocean surface waves associated with severe weather and storm condition can alter the speed and direction of open stream tidal currents and consequently affect the potential capacity of tidal power in other words due to the unsteady surface waves the speed of tidal stream is fluctuated and the direction of motion is changed as a result the optimal blade pitch angle of tidal turbine will be shifted that will reflect on the extractable power will be reduced for this reason evaluation of wave effect is vital for tidal power

are the outputs of hidden layers and y m t is the estimated output of the ann the n p 1 p 2 and m are the number of neurons for each layer w i j w j k and w k m are the adjustable weights associated with each layer b i is the ith bias neuron to achieve a well constructed network ann needs to be tested with different topology i e number of layers and neurons in terms of training process faster algorithm is the best selection to reduces the convergence time other aspects such as pattern of data and accuracy criteria have been taken into the account aly 2012 hundreds of runs are done to choose the best number or hidden layers and neurons for this proposed work as well as the best function 3 1 first model in this model the time is fed to ann and trained for forecasting the output tidal current speed as shown in fig 2 fig 2 shows the first proposed model which has the time fed as an input to the ann and the output is the tidal current speed fig 3 shows the relation between the time and the speed for the trained data using ann as a forecasting tool fig 4 shows a zoomed version of fig 3 table 1 shows a comparison for different models by calculating the percentage of absolute mean square error for the forecasted trained and untrained data as we see in fig 3 and table 1 the absolute mean square error is 0 083 fig 5 shows the relation between the time and the speed for the untrained data using ann as a forecasting tool fig 6 is a zoomed version of fig 5 for the untrained data less accuracy with 0 18 error has been noticed which is acceptable compared to the trained data 3 2 second model as it is shown in fig 7 a new variable wave height is added to ann input layer and trained for new current speed forecasting fig 7 show the second proposed model which has the time and wave height fed as input to the ann and the output is the tidal current speed the relation between the time wave height and the speed with the trained data using ann as a forecasting tool is illustrated in fig 8 fig 9 shows a zoomed version of fig 8 as we see in fig 8 and table 1 the percentage of the absolute mean square error is 0 065 fig 10 shows the relation between the time wave and the speed for the untrained data using ann as a forecasting tool fig 11 shows a zoomed version of fig 10 fig 10 shows 0 131 of absolute mean square error as can be seen the error is reduced for both trained and untrained data due to wave height was considered as an additional input factor in the proposed ann model 3 3 third model three variables are used in this model time wave height and the direction are fed to ann and trained for forecasting the output tidal current speed considering the tidal current direction in addition to the two previous variables aims to learn more about the uncertainty of current speed and the tidal turbine ambient environment fig 12 shows the third proposed model which has the time wave height and direction fed as input to the ann and the output is the predicted values of tidal current speed fig 13 shows the relation between the time and the speed for the trained data using ann as a forecasting tool fig 14 shows a zoomed version of fig 13 the best accuracy achieved in fig 13 where the percentage of the absolute mean square error is 0 034 as seen in table 1 fig 15 shows the relation between the time and the speed for the untrained data using ann as a forecasting tool the main improvement in this work is obtained by including more forecasting predictors the proposed model three prediction parameters seems to be appropriate to eliminate the forecast errors caused by unsteady waves as it can be seen in the figures the results also show that the prediction using radial basis function neural network is more accurate when considering the wave effect in the proposed ann tool three models are compared using trained and untrained data the resulted error ratio is registered in table 1 simulation and results analysis in the proposed ann tool three models are compared using trained and untrained data and the resulted errors nrmse is illustrated in table 1 table 2 shows the configuration of different training scenarios with associated errors for most accurate forecast model the number of neurons and hidden layers have been also listed in table 2 as it is shown in the table 1 the best model is the third model as the nrmse for the trained data is 0 034 compared to the second model which is 0 065 and the first model at 0 083 based on these results we can reach a conclusion that tidal speed forecasting has improved by adding wave height and direction as extra predictors the best accuracy is achieved by training with two hidden layers and 50 neurons more improvement might be reached by using more complicated network however that will be associated with higher cost and computational time so far the proposed model seems to be appropriate to eliminate the forecast errors caused by unsteady waves in the literature on time direction based error was tackled by turbine blade pitch angle tracking algorithms different tools are still needed to evaluate the effect of each parameter and set the proper weights as it is shown in the table 1 the best model is the third model as the mape for the trained data is 0 034 compared to the second model which is 0 065 and the first model which is 0 083 however quantifying oblique waves effect and estimating the wave height impact on the instream tidal energy is a recent research topic in this regard more accurate forecasting models is vital for advanced control strategies the direction caused error is tackled by turbine blade pitch angle tracking algorithms while the wave tidal interaction is more complex and need more work to deal with the uncertainty lastly bearing in mind that although improvement has been seen with the above mentioned hybrid tidal wave forecasting model yet it is not sufficient to precisely consider the wave effect on the tidal system performance rather we can build the forecasting speed time model and consequentially evaluate the wave effect in certain speed height conditions then estimate the power losses to specifically quantify the wave induced influence with a better approximation method as it is clarified next the suggested approach is extended to include theoretical modeling and low cost arduino board to estimate and compensate the influence of unsteady waves to achieve a well constructed network ann needs to be tested with different topology i e number of layers and neurons in terms of training process faster algorithm is the best selection to reduces the convergence time other aspects such as pattern of data and accuracy criteria have been also taken into the account the flowchart of the ann based forecasting process can be divided into three stages see fig 16 first data sets are loaded second training data to create a model lastly compare the output values with the actual values and calculate the errors 4 wave effect modeling the formula of produced tidal power is given as follows p t i d a l 1 2 ρ a c p v t i d a l 3 where v t i d a l is current speed a t turbine s blade area and c p the efficiency ρ is

velocity 5 low cost estimator as a validation model for wave influenced tidal power system the extractable power of tidal resources can be overestimated due to the uncertainty of the daily ambient environment characteristics one of these observations that may impact the overall performance of instream tidal turbines farm is unsteady waves behaviour severe weather that cause higher surface wave level leads to tidal fluctuation accordingly reduce the captured power and induce poor power quality the proposed low cost model will focus on the impact of unsteady waves on the overall produced power for all instream tidal turbines farms suggested in specific locations identification and evaluation of the wave effect on the system performance is required also it is vital to estimate the related losses and ensure the reliability for tidal powered projects arduino model mega 2560 has been used to build the low cost estimator for the issue mentioned above mega 2560 is a microcontroller board interfaced with the computer and operated by a programmable matlab code sathya and valluvan 2019a 2019b the proposed polynomial function is created based on the results from the previous studies and has been implemented with five different tidal turbines farms the resulted losses asserted that the impact is more significant for multiple turbines than a single turbine the designed simulink model illustrates several scenarios by computer simulation and evaluates the expected losses for different wave heights two examples for power losses due to wave effect have been selected to be illustrated in this paper the impact is neglected for the low tidal speed close to or equals to turbine cut in speed the efficiency of tidal turbine operating in high current speed is highly impacted by the high waves however the impact is evaluated in previous study by implementing a virtual model hashemi et al 2015 further research with real data from tidal turbines is still required to develop our understanding about unsteady wave effect at various conditions figs 17 and 18 illustrate the simulink supported low cost arduino model the model could be used initially with any wave height measurement device for testing purpose in the costal area furthermore it can be extended to estimate an optimal generation unit sizing and support load shedding technique the curves in figures 19 and 20 display the wave induced power losses over the speed changes with two selected wave heights 1 5 m 2 5 m more power losses have been seen with higher wave elevation whereas increasing the turbine blade diameter led to less wave effect the feasibility of the low cost model in on site control for tidal power systems will be tested in the future work the simulink graphs figs 19 20 show how the proposed arduino model fig 21 estimates the power losses in five turbines groups for each farm the expected generated power has been estimated during the presence of 2 5 and 1 5 m respectively the graphs show lower power losses percentage with 1 5 m height than 2 5 m the losses also could be reduced by increasing the ratio of the actual turbine output efficiency constant and tracking the changes in the pitch angle we can also conclude that the unsteady wave effect varies due to the selected turbines blade cross section the proposed simulink design verifier consists of wave height measuring unit manual or data file as an input to the first component after that the effect on wave speed is calculated and the losses in constrained generated power from different five turbines farms are specified and displayed the main novelty of the work lies in the development of new low cost predictor that is used for measuring the effect of unsteady waves on the tidal energy systems adding the wave effect predictor will positively impact the optimal control strategy towards more stable and cost effective grid connected models the new model could also be beneficial for the isolated and particular purpose mini grid the model is tested with various locations and turbine types the next step is to take the developed prototype to the commercialization the initial model needs to be extended to cover other wave aspects such as wave period the model gives comparison analysis about the effect of unsteady wave in terms of height and direction shift to the extractable tidal power the results can be shown for different turbines farms with similar or different turbines size and type from various locations it is worth mentioning that re adjusting tip speed ratio can compensating and lowering the minimum losses the model can calculate various cases for different concepts 6 discussion and recommendations the authors have presented predictive neural models for estimating the forecast error ratio to quantify the influence of wave height variation stream direction shift on the potential of extractable in stream tidal energy the paper is focusing on proposing implementing and evaluating an accurate wave influenced tidal speed forecasting model as well as simulink supported arduino analyzer to assess and predict the power losses caused by unsteady ocean surface waves recommendations can be stated as follows when using ann to predict ocean variables we recommend radial basis function rbf due to its excellent performance with nonlinearity and uncertainty back propagation technique is also recommended as it provides feedback from the output layer to the hidden layers and utilize it for optimal error correction but for tidal instream rbf worked better considering wave height as an input parameter in tidal speed forecasting is not appropriate if the ocean currents are steady while direction shift may interrupt the uniform motion of currents due to other environmental impact apart from wave effect during ebb to flood condition this impact is out of the scope of this paper while appealing with its simplicity arduino predictive model can perform poorly when the current speed is less than cut in velocity or higher than cut off velocity similar performance is expected with a wave height higher than and or close to 4 m however for wave height 4m safety issues may appear mostly with medium scale turbines and the system may require shutdown lastly wave effect is minimum during normal weather when the wave height is less than 1 m the influence during calm weather can be neglected because it does not affect the performance of tidal energy farm this conclusion has been reached after scale model test was conducted on horizontal axis turbine with and without surface waves luznik et al 2011 7 conclusions in this paper we studied the effect of unsteady ocean waves on the forecasted and actual tidal currents speed and its generated power losses different ann forecasting models have been proposed and tested to evaluate the wave induced effect on the prediction of tidal current speed and extractable power three different models are proposed for error assessment the best fit model is obtained by associating wave height stream direction and current speed over a specific time and this will led to a valuable error reduction the proposed arduino microcontroller can be developed after quantifying all aspects of wave effect to create an accurate losses estimator and compensator also it can be associated with the adaptive filtering system to generate control command alongside with filtering results or tip speed ratio tsr controller the model needs to be extended and validated in the future by using simulated data for certain location of tidal farm finally the assumption of wave induced losses has been developed and validated in this work constrained tidal power equation and extended mathematical model has also been developed the proposed ann scenarios are focusing on the assessment during unsteady waves and severe weather conditions wave behaviour impact may not exist during normal weather condition the future work could also be extended to include investigation and analysis for other impacts of wave influenced instream tidal system such as poor power quality and tidal farm layout optimization

21342,the floating platform with taut or semi taut mooring systems is the main option for oil and gas exploitations in deep sea however it has been reported that the reciprocating motion of the mooring line tends to induce the seabed trench near the anchor which consequently reduces the anchor capacity in this paper two parts of work have been carried out to enhance the understanding of the seabed trench firstly the dimensions of reported trenches in the field as well as their formation conditions are summarized and four feature points are proposed to describe the trench profile secondly a numerical method considering mooring line dynamics to predict the final trench profiles is proposed which contains two simulation modules i e mooring line dynamics and seabed trenching the method is verified using the data from the field and centrifuge tests the influences of the mooring line tension and soil strength on trench profiles are comprehensively investigated further the results show that obvious trenches are likely to form when the amplitude of mooring line tension variation is large and the soil shear strength is low the main impact of the formed trenches is that the loading direction at the pad eye tends to be horizontal keywords seabed trench mooring line anchor capacity chain soil interaction prediction model 1 introduction with the exploitations of oil and gas from offshore to deep sea areas the floating platform shows more advantages compared with the bottom fixed offshore platform floating platforms in deepwater areas are subjected to all kinds of environmental loads e g wind wave and current loads in order to meet the operational requirements the platforms need to be positioned utilizing the taut semi taut or catenary mooring systems which are usually made up of a group of mooring lines and anchors fig 1 different from the taut or semi taut mooring systems the catenary mooring system is featured with a certain length of the mooring line lying horizontally on the seabed at all design load levels the upper end of the mooring line is connected to the floating platform fairlead while its bottom end is fixed at the anchor pad eye for the mooring systems the anchors are usually embedded in the seabed soil and the pad eyes are set below the seabed to increase the anchor bearing capacity consequently part of the mooring chain will be buried in the soil it was found that the movement of the fpso caused the mooring chains to cut into the soil repeatedly leading to obvious trenches in front of the suction anchors bhattacharjee et al 2014 considering the failure risk of the mooring systems the anchors for the fpso were re installed as well as the mooring lines the existence of seabed trenches brought the new problem of anchor bearing capacity which attracted wide attention in both engineering and research communities arslan et al 2015 numerically studied the influence of seabed trenches on the bearing capacity of the suction anchor considering the potential influence of the trench alderlieste et al 2016 suggested a downward shift of pad eye location on the anchor sassi et al 2018 performed a series of centrifuge tests to investigate the bearing capacity of suction anchors with and without the existence of trenches which verified the numerical results by arslan et al 2015 based on numerical simulations feng et al 2019 assessed the effect of the trench width on the suction anchor bearing capacity and pointed out that the ultimate bearing capacity reduced significantly as the loading direction at the anchor pad eye turned to horizontal it is obvious that the mooring line inclination at the pad eye is critical for the anchor capacity with the existence of seabed trenches the formation of seabed trenches is thought to be related to the interaction between the mooring line and seabed sassi et al 2017 versteele et al 2017 some researches have been carried out to investigate the chain seabed interaction neubecker and randolph 1995 proposed closed form expressions for the load transfer and chain profile wang et al 2010a wang et al 2010b and guo et al 2016 expanded the chain soil interaction into three dimensional space however the above researches only focused on the static or quasi static chain seabed interaction failing to consider the mooring line dynamics wung et al 1995 xiong et al 2016 2017 and shen et al 2018 established novel numerical models to consider the dynamic interaction between the mooring chain and seabed in all these studies an ideal seabed without the seabed trench was adopted there were a few studies focusing on the chain soil interaction and the formation of seabed trenches sassi et al 2017 carried out a series of centrifuge tests to simulate the trenching process and pointed out that the mooring line motion under cyclic loadings is critical for the trench formation thus it is important to predict the mooring line motion accurately under cyclic loads for the long suspended mooring line the simulation method considering the effects of mooring line inertia and its dynamic interaction with the seabed will give a more accurate prediction versteele et al 2017 proposed a two dimensional model for simulating the trench development but the analytical tool casci is a static 2d chain soil interaction finite difference scheme o neill et al 2018 used a modified approach to predict the trench profile based on the analytical solutions developed by neubecker and randolph 1995 while the method also did not consider the mooring line dynamics aiming to predict the final seabed trench profiles this paper firstly summarizes all the reported field cases related to seabed trenches as well as their formation conditions e g the arrangement of mooring lines and seabed soil properties then the whole mooring system is set up numerically and the repeated cutting of the soil by the mooring lines is simulated considering the dynamic responses of mooring lines a novel prediction method is proposed and verified by the trench data measured in the gulf of guinea and centrifuge tests the effects of mooring line tension and soil strength on the trench profiles are jointly assessed finally the influences of trenches on the mooring line tension at the fairlead and the pad eye are evaluated the new method proposed in this paper can predict final trench profiles in the field 2 summary of seabed trenches in the field there have been three reported cases of the seabed trenches in the field since 2014 the seabed trenches were first discovered in 2014 when an inspection of the suction anchor was performed bhattacharjee et al 2014 this hazardous phenomenon brought the concern of anchor capacity in both engineering and research communities after that more trench inspections in front of the anchors were carried out and more information about this issue was available the details about the reported trenches are summarized as follows case 1 during the seabed survey of the serpentina fpso the trenches in front of the suction anchors were first found in the gulf of guinea bhattacharjee et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 a the water depth where the fpso located is about 475 m a single point mooring system with 9 mooring lines chains and wire ropes was adopted the seabed soil is soft clay and the anchor pad eye was located at about 9 m below the seabed mudline a total of 9 trenches were found near the dip down points the points where the mooring lines begin to embed into the soil the depths of seabed trenches were among 4 7 m the trench lengths and widths were among 25 40 m and 4 10 m respectively the horizontal distance between the trench edges and the anchor edges was about 1 3 m case 2 as shown in figs 2 b 12 seabed trenches were reported around the fpso named ah001 in the north sea hess 2015 the site water depth is about 140 m and the seabed soil where the trenches appeared is soft clay the pad eyes of the pile anchors were embedded at 10 m below the seabed the depths of seabed trenches in front of the piles were up to 10 m the trench lengths were among 135 166 m and the widths were among 25 35 m case 3 the latest report on the seabed trenches was from colliat et al 2018 the trenches were also found in the gulf of guinea and the water depth is about 1300 m the seabed soil is soft clay fig 2 c shows two typical shapes of different trenches colliat et al 2018 investigated the trenches for both the fpsos and off loading terminal buoys olts taking the fpsos as an example a total number of 60 90 trenches were detected in the field the anchor pad eye depths were among 12 15 m the trench depths were among 0 5 m the trench lengths and widths were among 90 100 m and 0 7 m respectively the main information about the above reported trenches is summarized in table 1 some common characteristics of trench formation conditions are found in these cases the semi taut mooring strategy was mainly adopted and all the anchor pad eyes were deeply embedded below the mudline under these two conditions the cyclic movements of the upper floating structures lead to repeated cutting of the soil by the chain it is also found that the seabed soils are the soft clay this kind of clay has a low shear strength and is easy to be remolded and carried away by the water flow the surficial soil in the north sea is very soft clay and the clay thickness is more than 16 m hess 2015 o neill et al 2018 the clay in the gulf of guinea where a large number of trenches were reported is characterized by the low unit weight high sensitivity and very high plasticity colliat et al 2010 it should be noted that the trenches were mainly discovered in front of suction anchors and pile anchors but the trench formation has no relation to the types of anchors all the cases in which the pad eye is embedded below the seabed are likely to encounter the issue of trench formation according to fig 2 a the trench profile in the vertical plane generally looks like a triangle in addition there exists an inner tunnel at the deepest position of the trench due to the repeated disturbance of the anchor chain a 3 dimensional trench profile is presented in fig 3 a it is found that the trench can be described by four shape parameters i e the trench length l n trench depth d n trench width b and horizontal distance from the trench edge to the anchor edge s n in the vertical plane the trench profile can be plotted by four feature points a b c d and three shape parameters l n d n s n as shown in fig 3 b thus these feature points are used to describe the characteristics of trench profiles in the field 3 prediction method for the trench profiles in this section a novel method considering mooring line dynamics is proposed to predict the trench profiles based on the concise trench profile mentioned above this prediction model consists of two simulation modules the first one is the mooring line dynamics module in which the dynamic interaction between the mooring line and the seabed is considered the other one is the seabed trenching module including the formed tunnel stability judgment and the soil excavation evaluation 3 1 mooring line dynamics module fig 4 shows all the forces acting on the segment of mooring line in water and soil respectively including the submerged weights of line segment in water and soil w w w s the fluid forces in two orthogonal directions f n f τ the soil resistances in two orthogonal directions q n q τ the inertia forces m aτ m aτ of line segment are also considered in this module the normal and tangential fluid forces f n and f τ are calculated by morison s equation morison et al 1950 the morison s equation is mainly used to calculate the fluid force of slender structure which was used to calculate the fluid force acting on the mooring line in many previous researches e g xiong et al 2016 2017 and shen et al 2018 1a f n 1 2 c d n ρ w d e f f d l v n v n c m 1 ρ w v 0 d v n d t 1b f τ 1 2 c d τ ρ w d e f f d l v τ v τ c m 1 ρ w v 0 d v τ d t where ρ w is the water density d eff is the effective diameter of the mooring chain dl is the segment length v 0 is the volume of water displaced by the mooring line v n and v τ are the relative velocities between seawater and line segment in the normal and tangential direction respectively c dn and c dτ are the normal and tangential drag coefficients respectively which should be experimentally determined in the flume based on the test results wilson 1960 recommended c dn 1 2 for the anchor chain and suggested that the c dt c dn

the normal component q n and the tangential component q τ of the soil resistances acting on the mooring line segment are expressed as degenkamp and dutta 1989 2a q n e n d b d l q 2b q τ e τ d b d l f

s u where s u is the undrained shear strength of soil yen and tofani 1984 the bearing capacity factor n c rises linearly from 5 14 at the seabed mudline to 7 6 at the depth of 6d b and n c remains 7 6 when the depth is more than 6d b α is a reduction factor and α 1 is recommended for clay degenkamp and dutta 1989 eq 3b is the general approach for calculating the tangential resistance between the chain and soil which was also adopted by xiong et al 2016 2017 and sun et al 2019 in this paper the mooring line is simulated by truss element which can only sustain the tension force along the axial direction the element length of 5d b is adopted which is enough to guarantee the computational accuracy after the verification during the calculations of the dynamic module the generalized α method gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 is adopted to discretize the time domain and the newton raphson equation is used to solve the governing equations iteratively in this study the time step δt in the calculation satisfies the following condition 4 δ t d l e ρ c where ρ c is material s density of the mooring line e is the elastic modulus before the simulation the sensitivity study was conducted and the selected time step was proved to be suitable for the dynamic calculation in the mooring line dynamics module the pad eye is fixed at a certain depth the rotation and movement of the anchor are not considered 3 2 seabed trenching module 3 2 1 formation process of the seabed trench as shown in fig 5 sassi et al 2017 proposed possible phases for trench formation in the deep sea environment as follows phase 1 during the mooring line pre tensioning phase an initial weak plane in the seabed appears as the chain cuts through the soil phase 2 with the reciprocating movement of the floating structure the mooring line repeatedly cuts into the seabed and simultaneously induces turbulence near the seabed the erosion of surficial soil appears in the zone near the dip down point phase 3 as the time goes on softening fluidization and removal of seabed soil make the shallow trench become deeper and longer during this phase the possible current near the seabed accelerates the process of soil erosion phase 4 with the increase of seabed trench profiles the trench walls become unstable and then collapse the collapsed soil mass is gradually removed from the trench bottom by the turbulence and current phase 5 at the same time an inner tunnel at the deepest location of the trench progressively moves along the mooring chain towards the anchor pad eye in fact the formation process of the seabed trench is quite complicated except for the phase 1 other phases may take place simultaneously due to the complexity of the trench development this paper focuses only on the final trench profiles in this paper the mooring line motion is always in the vertical plane without the out of plane motion thus the trench width is assumed as the mooring chain width for simplification though it underestimates the trench width since the trenching formation is a gradual development process the seabed trenching module is designed to acquire the trench profile step by step in the mooring line dynamics module it is assumed that the soil repeatedly disturbed by the mooring chain is washed away by the flow the remained soil near the trench bottom will form a square tunnel with the development of the tunnel the upper soil becomes unstable and collapses and then is carried away by the current finally the observed trench profile comes into being 3 2 2 simulation of seabed trenching 3 2 2 1 determination of disturbed soil zone based on the mooring line dynamics module the mooring line configurations at different time can be obtained the typical mooring line configurations in one cycle are presented in fig 6 a a disturbed soil zone appears between upper and lower boundaries where the soil is repeatedly cut by the mooring chain the soil in this zone is assumed to be fully disturbed and then washed away as a result an inner tunnel will appear in this paper only the motion of the mooring line in the vertical plane is considered and the inner tunnel is assumed to be a square one as shown in fig 6 b the dimension of a square tunnel b is a function of the maximum diameter of chain cross section and b 3 6d b is adopted in this paper according to the chain type bhattacharjee et al 2014 the tunnel depth h is the vertical distance from the seabed mudline to the upper boundary although the trench width is not the focus of this paper a brief discussion related to the trench width development is provided here at the beginning of the trench formation the trench width is mainly influenced by the motion of the chain then the soil instability of trench walls results in the increase of the trench width if the chain motion is in the vertical plane without the trench wall collapse the trench width is just slightly larger than the maximum diameter of chain cross section however if the localized soil collapses and is washed away by the near bottom water flow the trench width will be much larger 3 2 2 2 tunnel stability and excavation strategy the stability criterion of the square tunnel proposed by wilson et al 2013 is adopted to assess the tunnel stability by a dimensionless stability parameter n which is related to the tunnel dimensions and soil properties 5 n n 0 γ h s u n γ where γ is soil effective unit weight n 0 is the lower bound result for weightless case which can be expressed as wilson et al 2013 6 n 0 1 3 k b s u h b 1 55 1 7 l n h b 1 9 where k is the soil strength gradient the recommended value for n γ in eq 5 is calculated from following equations wilson et al 2013 7a n γ 1 05 h b 0 30 k b s u 0 15 7b n γ 1 01 h b 0 24 k b s u 0 15 after the tunnel stability judgement the trench profile can be acquired as shown in fig 7 if the upper soil is unstable n 0 according to the stability judgement the soil will collapse along an upright line with two end points collapse seabed point a and collapse point b the intersection of upper and lower boundaries is named as the pivot point c and dip down point d refers to the intersection of lower boundary and the seabed therefore the trench profile can be concisely described by these four points 3 3 prediction model for the trench profiles by combining the above two modules mooring line dynamics module and seabed trenching module the whole procedure for predicting the trench profiles is shown in fig 8 in the mooring line dynamics module a group of necessary parameters mooring radius water depth pad eye depth mooring line parameters soil properties should be input during the pretention stage the fairlead will be towed with a relative low speed moving towards the target equilibrium position and the pre tension configuration of the mooring line can be obtained then the cyclic motion path of the fairlead is set simulating the movement of the floating structures after several cycles the disturbed soil zone induced by the mooring line becomes stable and the upper and lower boundaries are obtained as the inputs of the seabed trenching module during this process the stability criterion of the square tunnel is used to judge the tunnel stability if the stability parameter n is less than zero the soil above the tunnel will collapse wilson et al 2013 the collapsed soil is assumed to be washed away at once and the trench profile can be updated with four feature points based on the new trench profile the mooring line dynamics module is carried out again the above procedures should be continuously repeated until a stable trench profile is obtained 4 verification of prediction model and analysis in this section the field data measured in the gulf of guinea bhattacharjee et al 2014 as well as the centrifuge test results sassi et al 2017 will be used for the method verification then the effects of the mooring line tension and soil strength on the trench formation will be evaluated 4 1 parameters from the field data 4 1 1 seabed soil properties the seabed soil in the gulf of guinea has been detected and reported by ehlers et al 2005 colliat et al 2010 and kuo and bolton 2013 it is found that there exists a surface biogenic crust with a thickness of 1 2 m and the normal consolidated soft clay is below the crust with the characteristics of the light weight high sensitivity and strong in situ structure the soil strength gradient is among 1 0 1 5 kpa m and the saturated soil weight is among 12 15 kn m3 colliat et al 2010 kuo and bolton 2013 which is a typical kind of light soil in the simulation the soil effective unit weight is set to be 3 kn m3 corresponding to its soil saturated unit weight 13 kn m3 and the variation of s u with the depth z m is set as fig 9 8a s u 6 k p a 0 z 2 8b s u 1 25 z z 2 in this paper the remolding or water entrainment of the soil has not been considered this is because the trench formation is a quite complicated process in which many physical mechanisms have not been well understood 4 1 2 mooring line parameters in the field the mooring lines consist of four different segments the bottom segment connected to the anchor pad eye is the ground chain 90 mm r3 chain i e the nominal chain diameter is 90 mm with the length of 130 m a long wire rope 68 mm spiral strand wire rope is connected to the bottom ground chain and its length is among 780 895 m the third segment is the top chain 107 mm r3 chain and it only has 50 m in length the turret chain 120 mm r3 chain with 15 m in length is the last part the more details about the mooring lines can be obtained in table 2 4 1 3 other parameters the motion of the fpso mainly contains the high frequency and low frequency motions the high frequency motion featured by the predominant heave has a frequency similar to that of waves 8 10 s the low frequency motion is caused by the platform sway and surge and generally leads to large horizontal drift as well as a significant oscillation of the mooring line tension it has been acknowledged that the trench formation is mainly influenced by the chain motion sassi et al 2017 colliat et al 2018 in general the low frequency motion of the floating facility leads to a significant dynamic motion of the whole mooring line inducing larger disturbed soil zone in the seabed thus the process of trench formation is promoted in this paper the low frequency motion is adopted due to its great influence on the trench formation the period of low frequency motion in the gulf of guinea ranges from 100 s to 200 s thus the period of 100 s is adopted in the simulation colliat et al 2018 according to colliat et al 2018 the maximum offset displacement for the fpso can be assumed as 4 of the water depth based on the specified cyclic period and offset amplitude the cyclic displacement applied at the fairlead is set as shown in fig 10 in all cases by comparing the mooring line configurations between the 4th and 5th cycles it is found that the upper and lower boundaries remain unchanged thus 5 cycles are adopted in the simulation 4 2 verification and discussion of the mooring line tension effect based on the field data bhattacharjee et al 2014 it is known that the mooring radius was among 808 894 m in the simulation since no accurate information about the mooring radius was available the average value of the mooring radius 851 m was adopted the mooring line length in the field was among 975 1090 m but the mooring line tension was not known as shown in table 3 five typical cases with different mooring line lengths were designed to investigate the effect of line tension on the trench profiles a pair of static cases s3 upper and s3 lower were also calculated based on the static catenary equations these static cases corresponded to the d3 condition the s3 upper and s3 lower cases refer to the conditions when the fairlead is located at the farthest and nearest positions from the pad eye respectively the initial configurations of the mooring lines with different lengths are shown in fig 11 the fairlead is at the target equilibrium position after the pretention stage under d1 condition the mooring line is fully straightened with the increase of the mooring line length the mooring line gradually cuts deeper into the soil and its dip down and touch down points move far away from the anchor at the same time the reverse catenary shape in the soil becomes more typical the mooring line configurations and the upper and lower boundaries under dynamic and static conditions are shown in fig 12 it is found that the upper boundaries under dynamic and static conditions are very close but for the lower boundaries the mooring line under dynamic condition cuts deeper into the soil than that under static condition these results indicate that the mooring line will disturb a larger range of seabed soil under dynamic condition the variations of the mooring line tension at the fairlead in different cases are presented in fig 13 under d1 condition the maximum tension at the fairlead is more than 25 000 kn which is far more than the breaking strength of the wire rope 3710 kn shown in table 2 so it does not meet the design requirements it is obvious that the maximum tension of the mooring line gradually decreases with the increase of the mooring line length but the difference between the minimum tension of the mooring lines is relatively small the comparisons of mooring line tension under dynamic and static conditions are shown in fig 14 it is found that the mooring line tension under the dynamic condition shows a more obvious oscillating trend comparisons of final trench profiles simulated by this prediction model with that in situ and in the centrifuge tests sassi et al 2017 are presented in fig 15 solid lines are the predicted results by this prediction model and solid colors represent the actual trench profiles fig 15 a shows that d2 and d3 cases fit the trench 1 and trench 3 profiles in situ red and green regions quite well though the trench depths in the simulation are always larger than that in the field this is due to the assumption in the prediction model that the disturbed soil will be totally washed away while the actual trench formation is also influenced by soil collapse and erosion in the field part of the collapsed soil will remain on the trench bottom and not affected by the flow because of the shadowing effect however it is hard to give an accurate value for the mass ratio of the washed away soil to the collapsed soil it is also found that the trench profile is influenced by the mooring line tension under d2 condition the mooring line is straightened because of the high line tension which makes the disturbed soil zone near the anchor the final trench depth is quite close to the pad eye depth and the tunnel extends to the pad eye with the reduction of the mooring line tension the ability of the mooring line to disturb the soil is weakened thus the final trench depth also declines and the trench gradually moves away from the anchor with the increase of the mooring line tension the trench depth and length show an increasing trend while the horizontal distance between trench and anchor decreases aiming to simulate the trench formation in the equatorial guinea sassi et al 2017 a series of centrifuge tests have been performed as shown in fig 15 b the soil adopted in the centrifuge tests is the typical soft clay from the gulf of guinea the soil strength gradient in the tests is 1 30 kn m which is quite close to the value of 1 25 kn m in this paper it should be noted that in the centrifuge tests only the vertical similarity scale amplifies n times and the lateral scale remains unchanged which cannot represent the true dynamic responses of the mooring chain thus the centrifuge results cannot provide accurate simulations of the trench profiles in the field it is true that the predicted trench profiles cannot match the trench profiles in the centrifuge tests very well fig 15 b this is due to the influence of near bottom water flow on trench formation in the centrifuge tests the bottom current was not simulated due to the technical limitation these test data sassi et al 2017 are not applicable to the cases of strong bottom current however these test results still reveal the general relationship between the trench profile and the mooring line tension which is consistent with the prediction results and field data the comparisons of final trench profiles under dynamic and static conditions are presented in fig 16 compared with the trench in the field the trench length under static condition black line is much smaller and the depth is just about one third of the value in the field in addition the position of the trench is also further away from the anchor but the predicted trench length considering mooring line dynamics is quite close to the length in the field the trench depth is a little larger than the field data mainly because of the assumption that the disturbed and collapsed soil will be totally washed away the model considering the mooring line dynamics gives a more accurate prediction of final trench profile in the field compared with the trench profiles in the centrifuge tests the result under the static condition significantly underestimates the trench length and depth in particular it provides a very poor prediction under the very high tension condition by contrast the result considering dynamic response can cover the trench profiles under four loading conditions the above comparisons with the field trenches and centrifuge test results validate that the effect of mooring line dynamics cannot be ignored in the prediction of final trench profile 4 3 effect of seabed soil property except for the mooring line tension soil property is an important factor for trench formation sassi et al 2017 therefore some simulation cases considering different soil strengths were conducted the normally consolidated clay was assumed as the seabed soil and the soil strength gradients k were selected to be 1 00 1 25 1 50 2 00 and 3 00 kpa m fig 17 the s u in eq 5 is in the denominator and all soil strengths at the mudline are zero this is not a problem in the numerical calculation because the stability judgment begins from the pad eye to the mudline and the calculation will be terminated before reaching the mudline s u 0 other parameters are consistent with the d3 condition the mooring line tension at the fairlead with different soil strength profiles is shown in fig 18 it is found that the soil strength has a limited influence on the fairlead tension with the increase of the soil strength the maximum line tension shows a slight reduction but the variation trend of line tension remains unchanged the initial mooring line configurations with different soil strengths are presented in fig 19 it shows that the soil strength has little effect on the whole configuration but it changes the configurations of mooring lines in the soil greatly with the very low soil strength e g 1 kpa m the soil cannot sustain the chain weight so there is a long section of mooring line being embedded in the soil as the soil strength increases it is hard for the mooring line to cut into the soil leading to the more obvious reverse catenary shape of the mooring line the final trench profiles with different soil strengths are plotted in fig 20 as the soil strength promotes from 1 kpa m to 3 kpa m the final trench depth and length decrease while the distance between the anchor and trench increases it is confirmed that the trench is more likely to form in the soil with a low shear strength the influence of soil density was also examined by setting different effective unit weights in general the clay effective unit weight is among 1 kn m3 to 8 kn m3 the calculation results show that the effective weights of clay have little influence on the trench profiles the differences in the trench length are less than 2 5 thus the influence of soil density is just mentioned in this part 5 discussions 5 1 effects of mooring line tension and soil strength on trench profiles the influences of mooring line tension and soil strength on the trench formation have been studied separately in section 4 it has been acknowledged that these two factors play important roles on the trench profile but the enough case studies are still lacked to investigate the joint influence between these two factors in this section a total of 25 cases were simulated in order to describe the final trench profile three normalized parameters d final l final s final are defined as the ratios of the trench depth d n length l n and anchor trench distance s n to the pad eye depth d pad respectively 9a d f i n a l d n d p a d 9b l f i n a l l n d p a d 9c s f i n a l s n d p a d another two dimensionless parameters normalized tension ratio and soil strength are used to describe the magnitude of the tension variation and soil strength normalized tension ratio η t is defined as 10 η t t f a i r m a x t f a i r m i n t p r e where t fair max and t fair min represent the maximum and minimum tensions at the fairlead respectively t pre is the pre tension force at the fairlead and the value of t pre can be obtained at the end of the pretention stage the normalized soil strength η su is the ratio of soil strength gradient k to soil effective unit weight γ defined as 11 η s u k γ the relationship between these normalized parameters of trench profiles d final l final s final normalized tension ratio and soil strength η t η su is presented in fig 21 as shown in fig 21 a with the increase of η t and the decrease of η su the trench depth gradually increases the maximum value appears under the highest tension ratio and lowest soil strength condition only under the high η t more than 1 0 condition can the variation of η su value significantly influence the trench depth the variation of normalized final length with normalized tension ratio and soil strength is shown in fig 21 b the maximum trench length 5 4d pad appears under the highest η t and lowest η su condition which is similar to the trend of the trench depth fig 21 c presents the relationship between the normalized anchor trench distance s final and two dimensionless parameters η t η su the maximum value 8d pad appears under the lowest η t and lowest η su condition while the minimum value 0 28d pad is found under highest η t and lowest η su condition under the latter condition the trench will have a significant influence on the anchor capacity due to so small anchor trench distance 5 2 seabed trench influence on the mooring line tension this section focuses on the influence of trenches on the mooring line tension taking d3 as an example the initial seabed profile and the seabed profiles after 2nd and 5th excavations are shown in fig 22 the different trench profiles are selected to investigate the influence of the different soil losses on the mooring line tension the tension variations at the fairlead and the pad eye after different excavations are presented in fig 23 it is found that the tension at the fairlead with seabed trenches has little change compared with that on the initial seabed with the existence of the seabed trenches the maximum tension at the pad eye has a slight increase while the minimum value deceases to some extent which leads to greater tension oscillation at the pad eye the tension inclination angles at the fairlead and the pad eye to the horizontal direction are shown in fig 24 compared with that on the initial seabed the inclination angle at the fairlead with seabed trenches remains unchanged however the tension inclination angle at the pad eye with the trenches has a certain degree of reduction this is because the soil loss due to the seabed trenches reduces the total soil resistance thus the mooring line is easier to cut into the soil from the above analysis it is found that the existence of the trench mainly influences the tension on the pad eye the relationship between horizontal and vertical tension components at the pad eye is illustrated in fig 25 the main impact of the seabed trench is that the loading direction of the pad eye tends to be horizontal without considering the trench effect the anchor capacity will increase because the horizontal capacity of anchor is generally higher than the uplift capacity however with the existence of the seabed trench the horizontal capacity has a significant reduction according to the research of feng et al 2019 therefore the anchor capacity should be paid more attention to if the seabed trench appears in the field some measures can be taken to eliminate the trench influence on the anchor capacity the catenary mooring scheme featured with a certain length of line lying horizontally on the seabed makes the touch down point move away from the anchor and reduces the soil disturbance which is a useful approach to avoid the trench formation if the trench has come into being replacing the anchor with a new one is an optional method bhattacharjee et al 2014 in addition filling in the trench with the sands or gravels is an alternative method hess 2015 6 conclusions this paper focuses on seabed trenches around the mooring system of the floating structure firstly all the reported trenches in the field are summarized as well as their formation conditions e g the arrangement of mooring lines and soil properties based on the typical dimensions of the trenches a concise trench profile characterized by four feature points is proposed considering mooring line dynamics a numerical method which includes two modules mooring line dynamics module and seabed trenching module is established to predict the final trench profiles then the prediction model is verified by the trench profiles measured in the gulf of guinea and the centrifuge tests furthermore a group of cases are carried out to study the effect of the mooring line tension and soil strength on the final trench profiles it is found that trenches are likely to form with high mooring line tension variation and low soil strength the influence of the trenches on the mooring line tension is also evaluated the results show that the trench has little effect on the tension and inclination at the fairlead the main impact of the seabed trench is that the loading direction of the pad eye tends to be horizontal with the existence of seabed trench the anchor horizontal capacity shows a significant reduction therefore some measures should be taken to avoid mooring system failure the proposed method considering the mooring line dynamics makes a good prediction of the final trench profile but it cannot simulate the development of the trench profile with time in addition the trench profile width is not assessed in this paper in the future research work more efforts should be made to simulate the trench evolution process and determine the trench profile in 3 dimension credit authorship contribution statement lizhong wang

21342,the floating platform with taut or semi taut mooring systems is the main option for oil and gas exploitations in deep sea however it has been reported that the reciprocating motion of the mooring line tends to induce the seabed trench near the anchor which consequently reduces the anchor capacity in this paper two parts of work have been carried out to enhance the understanding of the seabed trench firstly the dimensions of reported trenches in the field as well as their formation conditions are summarized and four feature points are proposed to describe the trench profile secondly a numerical method considering mooring line dynamics to predict the final trench profiles is proposed which contains two simulation modules i e mooring line dynamics and seabed trenching the method is verified using the data from the field and centrifuge tests the influences of the mooring line tension and soil strength on trench profiles are comprehensively investigated further the results show that obvious trenches are likely to form when the amplitude of mooring line tension variation is large and the soil shear strength is low the main impact of the formed trenches is that the loading direction at the pad eye tends to be horizontal keywords seabed trench mooring line anchor capacity chain soil interaction prediction model 1 introduction with the exploitations of oil and gas from offshore to deep sea areas the floating platform shows more advantages compared with the bottom fixed offshore platform floating platforms in deepwater areas are subjected to all kinds of environmental loads e g wind wave and current loads in order to meet the operational requirements the platforms need to be positioned utilizing the taut semi taut or catenary mooring systems which are usually made up of a group of mooring lines and anchors fig 1 different from the taut or semi taut mooring systems the catenary mooring system is featured with a certain length of the mooring line lying horizontally on the seabed at all design load levels the upper end of the mooring line is connected to the floating platform fairlead while its bottom end is fixed at the anchor pad eye for the mooring systems the anchors are usually embedded in the seabed soil and the pad eyes are set below the seabed to increase the anchor bearing capacity consequently part of the mooring chain will be buried in the soil it was found that the movement of the fpso caused the mooring chains to cut into the soil repeatedly leading to obvious trenches in front of the suction anchors bhattacharjee et al 2014 considering the failure risk of the mooring systems the anchors for the fpso were re installed as well as the mooring lines the existence of seabed trenches brought the new problem of anchor bearing capacity which attracted wide attention in both engineering and research communities arslan et al 2015 numerically studied the influence of seabed trenches on the bearing capacity of the suction anchor considering the potential influence of the trench alderlieste et al 2016 suggested a downward shift of pad eye location on the anchor sassi et al 2018 performed a series of centrifuge tests to investigate the bearing capacity of suction anchors with and without the existence of trenches which verified the numerical results by arslan et al 2015 based on numerical simulations feng et al 2019 assessed the effect of the trench width on the suction anchor bearing capacity and pointed out that the ultimate bearing capacity reduced significantly as the loading direction at the anchor pad eye turned to horizontal it is obvious that the mooring line inclination at the pad eye is critical for the anchor capacity with the existence of seabed trenches the formation of seabed trenches is thought to be related to the interaction between the mooring line and seabed sassi et al 2017 versteele et al 2017 some researches have been carried out to investigate the chain seabed interaction neubecker and randolph 1995 proposed closed form expressions for the load transfer and chain profile wang et al 2010a wang et al 2010b and guo et al 2016 expanded the chain soil interaction into three dimensional space however the above researches only focused on the static or quasi static chain seabed interaction failing to consider the mooring line dynamics wung et al 1995 xiong et al 2016 2017 and shen et al 2018 established novel numerical models to consider the dynamic interaction between the mooring chain and seabed in all these studies an ideal seabed without the seabed trench was adopted there were a few studies focusing on the chain soil interaction and the formation of seabed trenches sassi et al 2017 carried out a series of centrifuge tests to simulate the trenching process and pointed out that the mooring line motion under cyclic loadings is critical for the trench formation thus it is important to predict the mooring line motion accurately under cyclic loads for the long suspended mooring line the simulation method considering the effects of mooring line inertia and its dynamic interaction with the seabed will give a more accurate prediction versteele et al 2017 proposed a two dimensional model for simulating the trench development but the analytical tool casci is a static 2d chain soil interaction finite difference scheme o neill et al 2018 used a modified approach to predict the trench profile based on the analytical solutions developed by neubecker and randolph 1995 while the method also did not consider the mooring line dynamics aiming to predict the final seabed trench profiles this paper firstly summarizes all the reported field cases related to seabed trenches as well as their formation conditions e g the arrangement of mooring lines and seabed soil properties then the whole mooring system is set up numerically and the repeated cutting of the soil by the mooring lines is simulated considering the dynamic responses of mooring lines a novel prediction method is proposed and verified by the trench data measured in the gulf of guinea and centrifuge tests the effects of mooring line tension and soil strength on the trench profiles are jointly assessed finally the influences of trenches on the mooring line tension at the fairlead and the pad eye are evaluated the new method proposed in this paper can predict final trench profiles in the field 2 summary of seabed trenches in the field there have been three reported cases of the seabed trenches in the field since 2014 the seabed trenches were first discovered in 2014 when an inspection of the suction anchor was performed bhattacharjee et al 2014 this hazardous phenomenon brought the concern of anchor capacity in both engineering and research communities after that more trench inspections in front of the anchors were carried out and more information about this issue was available the details about the reported trenches are summarized as follows case 1 during the seabed survey of the serpentina fpso the trenches in front of the suction anchors were first found in the gulf of guinea bhattacharjee et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 a the water depth where the fpso located is about 475 m a single point mooring system with 9 mooring lines chains and wire ropes was adopted the seabed soil is soft clay and the anchor pad eye was located at about 9 m below the seabed mudline a total of 9 trenches were found near the dip down points the points where the mooring lines begin to embed into the soil the depths of seabed trenches were among 4 7 m the trench lengths and widths were among 25 40 m and 4 10 m respectively the horizontal distance between the trench edges and the anchor edges was about 1 3 m case 2 as shown in figs 2 b 12 seabed trenches were reported around the fpso named ah001 in the north sea hess 2015 the site water depth is about 140 m and the seabed soil where the trenches appeared is soft clay the pad eyes of the pile anchors were embedded at 10 m below the seabed the depths of seabed trenches in front of the piles were up to 10 m the trench lengths were among 135 166 m and the widths were among 25 35 m case 3 the latest report on the seabed trenches was from colliat et al 2018 the trenches were also found in the gulf of guinea and the water depth is about 1300 m the seabed soil is soft clay fig 2 c shows two typical shapes of different trenches colliat et al 2018 investigated the trenches for both the fpsos and off loading terminal buoys olts taking the fpsos as an example a total number of 60 90 trenches were detected in the field the anchor pad eye depths were among 12 15 m the trench depths were among 0 5 m the trench lengths and widths were among 90 100 m and 0 7 m respectively the main information about the above reported trenches is summarized in table 1 some common characteristics of trench formation conditions are found in these cases the semi taut mooring strategy was mainly adopted and all the anchor pad eyes were deeply embedded below the mudline under these two conditions the cyclic movements of the upper floating structures lead to repeated cutting of the soil by the chain it is also found that the seabed soils are the soft clay this kind of clay has a low shear strength and is easy to be remolded and carried away by the water flow the surficial soil in the north sea is very soft clay and the clay thickness is more than 16 m hess 2015 o neill et al 2018 the clay in the gulf of guinea where a large number of trenches were reported is characterized by the low unit weight high sensitivity and very high plasticity colliat et al 2010 it should be noted that the trenches were mainly discovered in front of suction anchors and pile anchors but the trench formation has no relation to the types of anchors all the cases in which the pad eye is embedded below the seabed are likely to encounter the issue of trench formation according to fig 2 a the trench profile in the vertical plane generally looks like a triangle in addition there exists an inner tunnel at the deepest position of the trench due to the repeated disturbance of the anchor chain a 3 dimensional trench profile is presented in fig 3 a it is found that the trench can be described by four shape parameters i e the trench length l n trench depth d n trench width b and horizontal distance from the trench edge to the anchor edge s n in the vertical plane the trench profile can be plotted by four feature points a b c d and three shape parameters l n d n s n as shown in fig 3 b thus these feature points are used to describe the characteristics of trench profiles in the field 3 prediction method for the trench profiles in this section a novel method considering mooring line dynamics is proposed to predict the trench profiles based on the concise trench profile mentioned above this prediction model consists of two simulation modules the first one is the mooring line dynamics module in which the dynamic interaction between the mooring line and the seabed is considered the other one is the seabed trenching module including the formed tunnel stability judgment and the soil excavation evaluation 3 1 mooring line dynamics module fig 4 shows all the forces acting on the segment of mooring line in water and soil respectively including the submerged weights of line segment in water and soil w w w s the fluid forces in two orthogonal directions f n f τ the soil resistances in two orthogonal directions q n q τ the inertia forces m aτ m aτ of line segment are also considered in this module the normal and tangential fluid forces f n and f τ are calculated by morison s equation morison et al 1950 the morison s equation is mainly used to calculate the fluid force of slender structure which was used to calculate the fluid force acting on the mooring line in many previous researches e g xiong et al 2016 2017 and shen et al 2018 1a f n 1 2 c d n ρ w d e f f d l v n v n c m 1 ρ w v 0 d v n d t 1b f τ 1 2 c d τ ρ w d e f f d l v τ v τ c m 1 ρ w v 0 d v τ d t where ρ w is the water density d eff is the effective diameter of the mooring chain dl is the segment length v 0 is the volume of water displaced by the mooring line v n and v τ are the relative velocities between seawater and line segment in the normal and tangential direction respectively c dn and c dτ are the normal and tangential drag coefficients respectively which should be experimentally determined in the flume based on the test results wilson 1960 recommended c dn 1 2 for the anchor chain and suggested that the c dt c dn values of different cylinders were among 0 01 to 0 03 in this paper c dn 1 2 and c dt c dn 0 02 were adopted c m is the additional mass coefficient and c m 1 was selected in this paper korotkin 2009 the normal component q n and the tangential component q τ of the soil resistances acting on the mooring line segment are expressed as degenkamp and dutta 1989 2a q n e n d b d l q 2b q τ e τ d b d l f

the chain dragging tests in clay degenkamp and dutta 1989 and q and f are the average normal and tangential resistances on the chain segment respectively which can be calculated by 3a q n c s u 3b f α

when the depth is more than 6d b α is a reduction factor and α 1 is recommended for clay degenkamp and dutta 1989 eq 3b is the general approach for calculating the tangential resistance between the chain and soil which was also adopted by xiong et al 2016 2017 and sun et al 2019 in this paper the mooring line is simulated by truss element which can only sustain the tension force along the axial direction the element length of 5d b is adopted which is enough to guarantee the computational accuracy after the verification during the calculations of the dynamic module the generalized α method gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 is adopted to discretize the time domain and the newton raphson equation is used to solve the governing equations iteratively in this study the time step δt in the calculation satisfies the following condition 4 δ t d l e ρ c where ρ c is material s density of the mooring line e is the elastic modulus before the simulation the sensitivity study was conducted and the selected time step was proved to be suitable for the dynamic calculation in the mooring line dynamics module the pad eye is fixed at a certain depth the rotation and movement of the anchor are not considered 3 2 seabed trenching module 3 2 1 formation process of the seabed trench as shown in fig 5 sassi et al 2017 proposed possible phases for trench formation in the deep sea environment as follows phase 1 during the mooring line pre tensioning phase an initial weak plane in the seabed appears as the chain cuts through the soil phase 2 with the reciprocating movement of the floating structure the mooring line repeatedly cuts into the seabed and simultaneously induces turbulence near the seabed the erosion of surficial soil appears in the zone near the dip down point phase 3 as the time goes on softening fluidization and removal of seabed soil make the shallow trench become deeper and longer during this phase the possible current near the seabed accelerates the process of soil erosion phase 4 with the increase of seabed trench profiles the trench walls become unstable and then collapse the collapsed soil mass is gradually removed from the trench bottom by the turbulence and current phase 5 at the same time an inner tunnel at the deepest location of the trench progressively moves along the mooring chain towards the anchor pad eye in fact the formation process of the seabed trench is quite complicated except for the phase 1 other phases may take place simultaneously due to the complexity of the trench development this paper focuses only on the final trench profiles in this paper the mooring line motion is always in the vertical plane without the out of plane motion thus the trench width is assumed as the mooring chain width for simplification though it underestimates the trench width since the trenching formation is a gradual development process the seabed trenching module is designed to acquire the trench profile step by step in the mooring line dynamics module it is assumed that the soil repeatedly disturbed by the mooring chain is washed away by the flow the remained soil near the trench bottom will form a square tunnel with the development of the tunnel the upper soil becomes unstable and collapses and then is carried away by the current finally the observed trench profile comes into being 3 2 2 simulation of seabed trenching 3 2 2 1 determination of disturbed soil zone based on the mooring line dynamics module the mooring line configurations at different time can be obtained the typical mooring line configurations in one cycle are presented in fig 6 a a disturbed soil zone appears between upper and lower boundaries where the soil is repeatedly cut by the mooring chain the soil in this zone is assumed to be fully disturbed and then washed away as a result an inner tunnel will appear in this paper only the motion of the mooring line in the vertical plane is considered and the inner tunnel is assumed to be a square one as shown in fig 6 b the dimension of a square tunnel b is a function of the maximum diameter of chain cross section and b 3 6d b is adopted in this paper according to the chain type bhattacharjee et al 2014 the tunnel depth h is the vertical distance from the seabed mudline to the upper boundary although the trench width is not the focus of this paper a brief discussion related to the trench width development is provided here at the beginning of the trench formation the trench width is mainly influenced by the motion of the chain then the soil instability of trench walls results in the increase of the trench width if the chain motion is in the vertical plane without the trench wall collapse the trench width is just slightly larger than the maximum diameter of chain cross section however if the localized soil collapses and is washed away by the near bottom water flow the trench width will be much larger 3 2 2 2 tunnel stability and excavation strategy the stability criterion of the square tunnel proposed by wilson et al 2013 is adopted to assess the tunnel stability by a dimensionless stability parameter n which is related to the tunnel dimensions and soil properties 5 n n 0 γ h s u n γ where γ is soil effective unit weight n 0 is the lower bound result for weightless case which can be expressed as wilson et al 2013 6 n 0 1 3 k b s u h b 1 55 1 7 l n h b 1 9 where k is the soil strength gradient the recommended value for n γ in eq 5 is calculated from following equations wilson et al 2013 7a n γ 1 05 h b 0 30 k b s u 0 15 7b n γ 1 01 h b 0 24 k b s u 0 15 after the tunnel stability judgement the trench profile can be acquired as shown in fig 7 if the upper soil is unstable n 0 according to the stability judgement the soil will collapse along an upright line with two end points collapse seabed point a and collapse point b the intersection of upper and lower boundaries is named as the pivot point c and dip down point d refers to the intersection of lower boundary and the seabed therefore the trench profile can be concisely described by these four points 3 3 prediction model for the trench profiles by combining the above two modules mooring line dynamics module and seabed trenching module the whole procedure for predicting the trench profiles is shown in fig 8 in the mooring line dynamics module a group of necessary parameters mooring radius water depth pad eye depth mooring line parameters soil properties should be input during the pretention stage the fairlead will be towed with a relative low speed moving towards the target equilibrium position and the pre tension configuration of the mooring line can be obtained then the cyclic motion path of the fairlead is set simulating the movement of the floating structures after several cycles the disturbed soil zone induced by the mooring line becomes stable and the upper and lower boundaries are obtained as the inputs of the seabed trenching module during this process the stability criterion of the square tunnel is used to judge the tunnel stability if the stability parameter n is less than zero the soil above the tunnel will collapse wilson et al 2013 the collapsed soil is assumed to be washed away at once and the trench profile can be updated with four feature points based on the new trench profile the mooring line dynamics module is carried out again the above procedures should be continuously repeated until a stable trench profile is obtained 4 verification of prediction model and analysis in this section the field data measured in the gulf of guinea bhattacharjee et al 2014 as well as the centrifuge test results sassi et al 2017 will be used for the method verification then the effects of the mooring line tension and soil strength on the trench formation will be evaluated 4 1 parameters from the field data 4 1 1 seabed soil properties the seabed soil in the gulf of guinea has been detected and reported by ehlers et al 2005 colliat et al 2010 and kuo and bolton 2013 it is found that there exists a surface biogenic crust with a thickness of 1 2 m and the normal consolidated soft clay is below the crust with the characteristics of the light weight high sensitivity and strong in situ structure the soil strength gradient is among 1 0 1 5 kpa m and the saturated soil weight is among 12 15 kn m3 colliat et al 2010 kuo and bolton 2013 which is a typical kind of light soil in the simulation the soil effective unit weight is set to be 3 kn m3 corresponding to its soil saturated unit weight 13 kn m3 and the variation of s u with the depth z m is set as fig 9 8a s u 6 k p a 0 z 2 8b s u 1 25 z z 2 in this paper the remolding or water entrainment of the soil has not been considered this is because the trench formation is a quite complicated process in which many physical mechanisms have not been well understood 4 1 2 mooring line parameters in the field the mooring lines consist of four different segments the bottom segment connected to the anchor pad eye is the ground chain 90 mm r3 chain i e the nominal chain diameter is 90 mm with the length of 130 m a long wire rope 68 mm spiral strand wire rope is connected to the bottom ground chain and its length is among 780 895 m the third segment is the top chain 107 mm r3 chain and it only has 50 m in length the turret chain 120 mm r3 chain with 15 m in length is the last part the more details about the mooring lines can be obtained in table 2 4 1 3 other parameters the motion of the fpso mainly contains the high frequency and low frequency motions the high frequency motion featured by the predominant heave has a frequency similar to that of waves 8 10 s the low frequency motion is caused by the platform sway and surge and generally leads to large horizontal drift as well as a significant oscillation of the mooring line tension it has been acknowledged that the trench formation is mainly influenced by the chain motion sassi et al 2017 colliat et al 2018 in general the low frequency motion of the floating facility leads to a significant dynamic motion of the whole mooring line inducing larger disturbed soil zone in the seabed thus the process of trench formation is promoted in this paper the low frequency motion is adopted due to its great influence on the trench formation the period of low frequency motion in the gulf of guinea ranges from 100 s to 200 s thus the period of 100 s is adopted in the simulation colliat et al 2018 according to colliat et al 2018 the maximum offset displacement for the fpso can be assumed as 4 of the water depth based on the specified cyclic period and offset amplitude the cyclic displacement applied at the fairlead is set as shown in fig 10 in all cases by comparing the mooring line configurations between the 4th and 5th cycles it is found that the upper and lower boundaries remain unchanged thus 5 cycles are adopted in the simulation 4 2 verification and discussion of the mooring line tension effect based on the field data bhattacharjee et al 2014 it is known that the mooring radius was among 808 894 m in the simulation since no accurate information about the mooring radius was available the average value of the mooring radius 851 m was adopted the mooring line length in the field was among 975 1090 m but the mooring line tension was not known as shown in table 3 five typical cases with different mooring line lengths were designed to investigate the effect of line tension on the trench profiles a pair of static cases s3 upper and s3 lower were also calculated based on the static catenary equations these static cases corresponded to the d3 condition the s3 upper and s3 lower cases refer to the conditions when the fairlead is located at the farthest and nearest positions from the pad eye respectively the initial configurations of the mooring lines with different lengths are shown in fig 11 the fairlead is at the target equilibrium position after the pretention stage under d1 condition the mooring line is fully straightened with the increase of the mooring line length the mooring line gradually cuts deeper into the soil and its dip down and touch down points move far away from the anchor at the same time the reverse catenary shape in the soil becomes more typical the mooring line configurations and the upper and lower boundaries under dynamic and static conditions are shown in fig 12 it is found that the upper boundaries under dynamic and static conditions are very close but for the lower boundaries the mooring line under dynamic condition cuts deeper into the soil than that under static condition these results indicate that the mooring line will disturb a larger range of seabed soil under dynamic condition the variations of the mooring line tension at the fairlead in different cases are presented in fig 13 under d1 condition the maximum tension at the fairlead is more than 25 000 kn which is far more than the breaking strength of the wire rope 3710 kn shown in table 2 so it does not meet the design requirements it is obvious that the maximum tension of the mooring line gradually decreases with the increase of the mooring line length but the difference between the minimum tension of the mooring lines is relatively small the comparisons of mooring line tension under dynamic and static conditions are shown in fig 14 it is found that the mooring line tension under the dynamic condition shows a more obvious oscillating trend comparisons of final trench profiles simulated by this prediction model with that in situ and in the centrifuge tests sassi et al 2017 are presented in fig 15 solid lines are the predicted results by this prediction model and solid colors represent the actual trench profiles fig 15 a shows that d2 and d3 cases fit the trench 1 and trench 3 profiles in situ red and green regions quite well though the trench depths in the simulation are always larger than that in the field this is due to the assumption in the prediction model that the disturbed soil will be totally washed away while the actual trench formation is also influenced by soil collapse and erosion in the field part of the collapsed soil will remain on the trench bottom and not affected by the flow because of the shadowing effect however it is hard to give an accurate value for the mass ratio of the washed away soil to the collapsed soil it is also found that the trench profile is influenced by the mooring line tension under d2 condition the mooring line is straightened because of the high line tension which makes the disturbed soil zone near the anchor the final trench depth is quite close to the pad eye depth and the tunnel extends to the pad eye with the reduction of the mooring line tension the ability of the mooring line to disturb the soil is weakened thus the final trench depth also declines and the trench gradually moves away from the anchor with the increase of the mooring line tension the trench depth and length show an increasing trend while the horizontal distance between trench and anchor decreases aiming to simulate the trench formation in the equatorial guinea sassi et al 2017 a series of centrifuge tests have been performed as shown in fig 15 b the soil adopted in the centrifuge tests is the typical soft clay from the gulf of guinea the soil strength gradient in the tests is 1 30 kn m which is quite close to the value of 1 25 kn m in this paper it should be noted that in the centrifuge tests only the vertical similarity scale amplifies n times and the lateral scale remains unchanged which cannot represent the true dynamic responses of the mooring chain thus the centrifuge results cannot provide accurate simulations of the trench profiles in the field it is true that the predicted trench profiles cannot match the trench profiles in the centrifuge tests very well fig 15 b this is due to the influence of near bottom water flow on trench formation in the centrifuge tests the bottom current was not simulated due to the technical limitation these test data sassi et al 2017 are not applicable to the cases of strong bottom current however these test results still reveal the general relationship between the trench profile and the mooring line tension which is consistent with the prediction results and field data the comparisons of final trench profiles under dynamic and static conditions are presented in fig 16 compared with the trench in the field the trench length under static condition black line is much smaller and the depth is just about one third of the value in the field in addition the position of the trench is also further away from the anchor but the predicted trench length considering mooring line dynamics is quite close to the length in the field the trench depth is a little larger than the field data mainly because of the assumption that the disturbed and collapsed soil will be totally washed away the model considering the mooring line dynamics gives a more accurate prediction of final trench profile in the field compared with the trench profiles in the centrifuge tests the result under the static condition significantly underestimates the trench length and depth in particular it provides a very poor prediction under the very high tension condition by contrast the result considering dynamic response can cover the trench profiles under four loading conditions the above comparisons with the field trenches and centrifuge test results validate that the effect of mooring line dynamics cannot be ignored in the prediction of final trench profile 4 3 effect of seabed soil property except for the mooring line tension soil property is an important factor for trench formation sassi et al 2017 therefore some simulation cases considering different soil strengths were conducted the normally consolidated clay was assumed as the seabed soil and the soil strength gradients k were selected to be 1 00 1 25 1 50 2 00 and 3 00 kpa m fig 17 the s u in eq 5 is in the denominator and all soil strengths at the mudline are zero this is not a problem in the numerical calculation because the stability judgment begins from the pad eye to the mudline and the calculation will be terminated before reaching the mudline s u 0 other parameters are consistent with the d3 condition the mooring line tension at the fairlead with different soil strength profiles is shown in fig 18 it is found that the soil strength has a limited influence on the fairlead tension with the increase of the soil strength the maximum line tension shows a slight reduction but the variation trend of line tension remains unchanged the initial mooring line configurations with different soil strengths are presented in fig 19 it shows that the soil strength has little effect on the whole configuration but it changes the configurations of mooring lines in the soil greatly with the very low soil strength e g 1 kpa m the soil cannot sustain the chain weight so there is a long section of mooring line being embedded in the soil as the soil strength increases it is hard for the mooring line to cut into the soil leading to the more obvious reverse catenary shape of the mooring line the final trench profiles with different soil strengths are plotted in fig 20 as the soil strength promotes from 1 kpa m to 3 kpa m the final trench depth and length decrease while the distance between the anchor and trench increases it is confirmed that the trench is more likely to form in the soil with a low shear strength the influence of soil density was also examined by setting different effective unit weights in general the clay effective unit weight is among 1 kn m3 to 8 kn m3 the calculation results show that the effective weights of clay have little influence on the trench profiles the differences in the trench length are less than 2 5 thus the influence of soil density is just mentioned in this part 5 discussions 5 1 effects of mooring line tension and soil strength on trench profiles the influences of mooring line tension and soil strength on the trench formation have been studied separately in section 4 it has been acknowledged that these two factors play important roles on the trench profile but the enough case studies are still lacked to investigate the joint influence between these two factors in this section a total of 25 cases were simulated in order to describe the final trench profile three normalized parameters d final l final s final are defined as the ratios of the trench depth d n length l n and anchor trench distance s n to the pad eye depth d pad respectively 9a d f i n a l d n d p a d 9b l f i n a l l n d p a d 9c s f i n a l s n d p a d another two dimensionless parameters normalized tension ratio and soil strength are used to describe the magnitude of the tension variation and soil strength normalized tension ratio η t is defined as 10 η t t f a i r m a x t f a i r m i n t p r e where t fair max and t fair min represent the maximum and minimum tensions at the fairlead respectively t pre is the pre tension force at the fairlead and the value of t pre can be obtained at the end of the pretention stage the normalized soil strength η su is the ratio of soil strength gradient k to soil effective unit weight γ defined as 11 η s u k γ the relationship between these normalized parameters of trench profiles d final l final s final normalized tension ratio and soil strength η t η su is presented in fig 21 as shown in fig 21 a with the increase of η t and the decrease of η su the trench depth gradually increases the maximum value appears under the highest tension ratio and lowest soil strength condition only under the high η t more than 1 0 condition can the variation of η su value significantly influence the trench depth the variation of normalized final length with normalized tension ratio and soil strength is shown in fig 21 b the maximum trench length 5 4d pad appears under the highest η t and lowest η su condition which is similar to the trend of the trench depth fig 21 c presents the relationship between the normalized anchor trench distance s final and two dimensionless parameters η t η su the maximum value 8d pad appears under the lowest η t and lowest η su condition while the minimum value 0 28d pad is found under highest η t and lowest η su condition under the latter condition the trench will have a significant influence on the anchor capacity due to so small anchor trench distance 5 2 seabed trench influence on the mooring line tension this section focuses on the influence of trenches on the mooring line tension taking d3 as an example the initial seabed profile and the seabed profiles after 2nd and 5th excavations are shown in fig 22 the different trench profiles are selected to investigate the influence of the different soil losses on the mooring line tension the tension variations at the fairlead and the pad eye after different excavations are presented in fig 23 it is found that the tension at the fairlead with seabed trenches has little change compared with that on the initial seabed with the existence of the seabed trenches the maximum tension at the pad eye has a slight increase while the minimum value deceases to some extent which leads to greater tension oscillation at the pad eye the tension inclination angles at the fairlead and the pad eye to the horizontal direction are shown in fig 24 compared with that on the initial seabed the inclination angle at the fairlead with seabed trenches remains unchanged however the tension inclination angle at the pad eye with the trenches has a certain degree of reduction this is because the soil loss due to the seabed trenches reduces the total soil resistance thus the mooring line is easier to cut into the soil from the above analysis it is found that the existence of the trench mainly influences the tension on the pad eye the relationship between horizontal and vertical tension components at the pad eye is illustrated in fig 25 the main impact of the seabed trench is that the loading direction of the pad eye tends to be horizontal without considering the trench effect the anchor capacity will increase because the horizontal capacity of anchor is generally higher than the uplift capacity however with the existence of the seabed trench the horizontal capacity has a significant reduction according to the research of feng et al 2019 therefore the anchor capacity should be paid more attention to if the seabed trench appears in the field some measures can be taken to eliminate the trench influence on the anchor capacity the catenary mooring scheme featured with a certain length of line lying horizontally on the seabed makes the touch down point move away from the anchor and reduces the soil disturbance which is a useful approach to avoid the trench formation if the trench has come into being replacing the anchor with a new one is an optional method bhattacharjee et al 2014 in addition filling in the trench with the sands or gravels is an alternative method hess 2015 6 conclusions this paper focuses on seabed trenches around the mooring system of the floating structure firstly all the reported trenches in the field are summarized as well as their formation conditions e g the arrangement of mooring lines and soil properties based on the typical dimensions of the trenches a concise trench profile characterized by four feature points is proposed considering mooring line dynamics a numerical method which includes two modules mooring line dynamics module and seabed trenching module is established to predict the final trench profiles then the prediction model is verified by the trench profiles measured in the gulf of guinea and the centrifuge tests furthermore a group of cases are carried out to study the effect of the mooring line tension and soil strength on the final trench profiles it is found that trenches are likely to form with high mooring line tension variation and low soil strength the influence of the trenches on the mooring line tension is also evaluated the results show that the trench has little effect on the tension and inclination at the fairlead the main impact of the seabed trench is that the loading direction of the pad eye tends to be horizontal with the existence of seabed trench the anchor horizontal capacity shows a significant reduction therefore some measures should be taken to avoid mooring system failure the proposed method considering the mooring line dynamics makes a good prediction of the final trench profile but it cannot simulate the development of the trench profile with time in addition the trench profile width is not assessed in this paper in the future research work more efforts should be made to simulate the trench evolution process and determine the trench profile in 3 dimension credit authorship contribution statement lizhong wang

21343,severe sloshing in a membrane type liquefied natural gas lng tank excited by random sea wave easily causes overturning of liquid cargo ship and structural damage of tank besides the baffles maybe the porous material layer pasted tight to the inner periphery of the tanks is another way to mitigate sloshing and reduce potential risks caused by severe sloshing the computational fluid dynamics cfd code openfoam was employed to study sloshing wave interaction with porous material layer the improved ihfoam used to simulate porous breakwater was validated against with available experimental data good agreements are obtained three intrinsic parameters of porous material layer such as porosity n thickness ratio w a and average diameter ratio d 50 w were varied to obtain optimized parameters in mitigating sloshing by conducting two dimensional numerical tests and the corresponding critical value that reduced sloshing dynamics pressure at utmost was found the tank with optimized porous material layer manifested well in mitigating sloshing in comparison with the case with solid vertical baffle finally the optimized porous material layer was installed around the inner periphery of the membrane type lng tank excited by both regular and irregular excitation to discuss effects of porous material layer on mitigating sloshing under extreme conditions keywords sloshing mitigation porous material layer lng tank parameters optimization 1 introduction sloshing is the violent motion of the free surface of a fluid in a partially filled container which is a classic problem in hydrodynamics it has a wide range of applications in ocean and offshore engineering fields particularly in cargo ship carrying the partially filled container with fluids and marine structural vibration passive control dou et al 2020 thus sloshing became a very important practical issue in the last decades due to the increased activities in the liquefied natural gas lng transport lin 2007 numerically and analytically studied fluid sloshing in a rectangular tank by varying forcing frequencies chen and xue 2018 studied the influence of liquid filling level on pressure frequency response and observed the process of the transition from a soft spring response to a hard spring response su and liu 2017 and saripilli and sen 2018 thought that the coupling effects of ship motion responses and sloshing is essential for the preliminary design of lng carriers ikealumba and wu 2017 discussed the importance of including ship motion that would induce sloshing they found that by including sloshing the overall pressure on the tank walls were increased by up to 31 while the spill time was increased by up to 100 s due to air back flowing into the storage tanks considering the compressibility of liquid vapor inside tank calderon sanchez et al 2018 researched the effect of phase change on sloshing pressure in lng tanks they concluded that the peak pressure is dampened when phase change is considered tai et al 2019 thought that a plunging wave with different stages induces different forces on the structures similarly different sloshing wave can also cause different motion responses of lng carriers effect of sloshing on lng transport is therefore noticeable even a small amount of liquid sloshing about below decks can seriously affect a ship s stability as the liquid cargo ship rolls the liquid pours to one side which moves the ship s center of gravity if this moves beyond a critical point the ship cannot right itself and will capsize specially extreme localized slamming loads caused by the severe sloshing wave can be devastating for both the containment system and the ship structure malenica et al 2017 xue et al 2019 luo et al 2020 to minimize the potential sloshing damage the control of the sloshing behavior by using the baffles or other anti sloshing devices is a subject of interest in the recent years akyildiz and unal 2005 experimentally investigated the relationship between different solid baffle configuration and pressure distribution in a three dimensional tank the result showed that vertical baffle located in the middle of tank bottom reduces fluid motion pronouncedly xue and lin 2011 numerically studied the detailed mechanism of ring baffles on reducing violent viscous liquid sloshing in prismatic tanks by developing a large eddy simulation les model newtank based on virtual boundary force vbf and volume of fluid vof methods wang et al 2016 2017 analyzed the transient lateral sloshing in a partially filled cylindrical and toroidal tank with multi various baffles of different configurations by using a coupled multimodal method and scaled boundary finite element method yu et al 2017 experimentally conducted sloshing in a rectangular tank with two floating plates at three different filling levels under rolling excitation xue et al 2017 conducted a series of model tests in a rectangular tank on a shake table under harmonic surging excitation in their studies immersed bottom mounted vertical baffles vertical baffles flushing with free surface surface piercing bottom mounted vertical baffles and perforated vertical baffles were tried out in a wide frequency ranges as potential passive sloshing damping devices it concluded that the vertical baffle flushing with free surface and the perforated vertical baffle are two more effective tools in reducing the dynamic impact pressure among the four baffle configurations chu et al 2018 investigated the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular water tank with multiple bottom mounted baffles and concluded that the natural frequency of the tank was altered by the multiple baffles and was related to the effective water depth above the baffles sanapala et al 2018 achieved the optimal ring baffle design in controlling free surface sloshing waves in a rectangular tank subjected to vertical harmonic as well as bhuj earthquake excitations by performing systematic numerical tests chen et al 2018 conducted investigations of sloshing in microalgae farming tanks with baffles the evolution of vortices the trace of the particles due to baffles and the effects of baffle length and location on liquid mixing and resonant frequencies were concerned xiang et al 2019 concluded that artificial islands at suitable locations in plain reservoir can attenuate the wave heights by approximately 10 30 kargbo et al 2019 and xue et al 2020 carried out a series of simulations of multiphase sloshing interaction with baffle submersed block and observed how the position and size of the baffle and block affect the interfacial wave in stratified fluids apart from stationary type baffle in above studies koh et al 2013 have ever numerically studied a novel sloshing mitigation device i e the constrained floating baffle based on the improved consistent particle method ning et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 proposed an anti sloshing technique by using floating foams and found that the maximum wave height and dynamic pressure were greatly reduced as the foam layer thickness increases at the resonant condition zheng et al 2020b studied effects of porous bottom layer on single and multilayered fluids sloshing dynamics by using navier stokes equation coupling with brinkman model in fact the perforated baffles or slat screens are also commonly used as sloshing suppressing devices molin and remy 2013 performed experimental and numerical study of the sloshing motion in a rectangular tank subjected to swaying and rolling excitations with a perforated screen jin et al 2014 conducted an experimental study on sloshing in a tank with an inner horizontal perforated plate wei et al 2015 experimentally investigated anti sloshing effects of the vertical screen on the tank bottom filled with shallow water and concluded that the slat screen was an effective method in reducing sloshing kumar and sinhamahapatra 2016 adopted a finite element method by using pressure formulation to study dynamic properties of rectangular rigid containers with single slotted internal elements and screens they found that best dynamic advantages and reduced weight penalty without sacrificing benefits of rigidity or stiffness were achieved cho and kim 2016 theoretically and experimentally investigated the effect of dual vertical porous baffles on the sloshing reduction inside a rectangular tank it was shown that the dual vertical porous baffles can significantly suppress sloshing motions when properly designed by selecting optimal porosity submergence depth and installation position marivani and hamed 2017 developed a pressure drop model for studying sloshing in a tank with the slat screens by considering the effects of the screen pattern characterized by the effective solidity ratio and the slat ratio they concluded that decreasing the slat height would increase the inherent damping of the tld for slat screens with the same physical solidity ratio yu et al 2019 2020 experimentally studied effects of vertical slat screen on reducing sloshing in a tank by varying solidity ratio slot size location and slat screen number whether it is a solid baffle or a perforated screen they need to be fixed to the inner periphery wall of the lng tank to mitigate sloshing which may lead to another problem of stress concentration at the welding point between the baffles and the lng tank walls porous structures have been widely used in harbors and coastlines due to their good performance in absorbing wave energy karunarathna and lin 2006 thought that flow resistances inside the porous bed results in wave energy dissipation zhan et al 2010 demonstrated the effective performance of the porous media wave absorber in the absorption of reflected waves by simulating wave propagation over a submerged bar zheng et al 2020a studied interaction both wave and coral reef flat that can be seen as porous media in a wave basin thus porous media layer pasted tight to the inner periphery wall of the lng tank without welding was proposed to mitigate fluid sloshing slamming in this study not only in the liquid cargo ship design but also in the inshore area protection artificial measures are usually used to reduce wave impact for example in order to lessen the scour of breakwater porous material protection layer made up of a jumble of gravels is usually adopted to resist the wave attack in fact many theoretical and numerical studies of determining how the fluid flows inside and outside of the porous layer have been done extensively the motion of steady fluid in 1 d porous media is well known as darcy theory which proposed that hydraulic gradient i is linear with average flux u furthermore to illustrate more realistic of fluid motion including turbulence inside of porous zone polubarinova kochina 1962 proposed a new scheme of hydraulic gradient in consideration of unsteady flow 1 1 i a p u b p u u c p u t where a p is linear drag coefficient s m b p is nonlinear drag coefficient s2 m2 c p is added mass coefficient s2 m van gent 1995 suggested specific values for these empirical coefficients comparing to theoretical study of fluid motion in porous layer numerical study on porous layer has also progressed hugely based on empirical formulas of van gent and improved rans governing equations liu et al 1999 redetermined empirical coefficient suggested by van gent and applied modified values into simulating wave overtopped breakwater caisson within porous armor numerical results reached good agreements with experimental results concerning with wave height and overtopping mass hsu et al 2002 firstly proposed volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stocks varans combined with k ε turbulence model closure within the porous media the new model had an advantage of bypassing boundary setting on the interface of porous layer and outside flow which was a necessity in liu s previous model recently del jesus et al 2012 advanced the applicability of varans which allows the spatial gradient of porosity and built numerical model called ih 3vof new model can simulate multiple different porosity media layers which is practical in animating the real breakwater constituent higuera et al 2014a developed new model called ihfoam which was also based on varans with k ε and k ω s s t turbulence models the new model optimized the 3 d dimensional effect of flowing through porous media furthermore a simulation of a high mound breakwater with composite porous layers is presented in their companion paper higuera et al 2014b except for finite volume method fvm new methods based on lagrange description of liquid motion like particle methods are becoming popular recently however the simulation of flow through porous media is at the beginning stage main simulations are limited in 2 d situations which is a problem of this method shao 2010 akbari and namin 2013 luo and koh 2017 khayyer et al 2018 based on the energy dissipating property of porous material the scenario of installing porous media layer inside the lng tank to reduce sloshing should be a meaningful attempt however the related studies are rarely reported therefore liquid sloshing in tanks with porous material layer are conducted numerically based on the porous media solver ihfoam in openfoam and dynamic mesh part of which governing equations are derived from varans combined with the vof model in this study porous empirical coefficients are following with the formula suggested by van gent 1995 which will be explained in the following sections 2 mathematical model and numerical implementation 2 1 mathematical model the vof method introduced by hirt and nichols 1981 defined a scalar α to account for the ratio of each fluid in a control volume unit each phase in two phase flow gets access to join into same governing equations by transforming two fluids into a single integrated fluid accordingly this mixed fluid property is determined by the original two fluids and the ratio α i e ρ ρ 1 α ρ 2 1 α μ μ 1 α μ 2 1 α where μ is dynamic viscosity therefore the incompressible and viscous navier stokes equations were written as follows including continuity eq 2 momentum eq 3 vof function advection eq 4 2 u i x i 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j x j τ j i p x i ρ g i σ κ α x i 4 α t u i α x i 0 where σ is surface tension coefficient κ is two phase interface curvature τ is shear stress p is instantaneous effective pressure in addition for unifying the scheme of source term in 3 for surface tension σ is relative minor in large scale simulation next derivation this term will be neglected to illustrate the flow through porous media the approach of simulating the porous zone is necessary however the internal structure of porous materials is intricated which consists of uncountable pores and solid parts direct numerical simulation of the flowing through each precise pore is difficult to achieve therefore it is necessary to generalize the fluid behaviors in porous zones for numerical simulation for getting the mean behavior of fluid in these zones spaces in porous zones are averaged over a length which is larger than pore size but smaller than spatial scale of physical fluid variables this volume averaging in control volumes is known as the volume averaged rans varans hsu et al 2002 del jesus et al 2012 derived similar final equations about varans combing k ε turbulence model hsu et al 2002 assumed porosity as a constant in space and took the porosity term out of the spatial gradient operators del jesus et al 2012 proposed modified equations which allowed porosity varied in space some important derivation parts will be mentioned here for further details see these two literatures assuming a represents a scalar property the intrinsic volume averaging in a control volume can be expressed with darcy s volume averaging operator as 5 a 1 v v f a d v where v f is the integrating portion of v when adding superscript f into averaging volume changes correspondingly from v into v f 6 a f 1 v f v f a d v the scheme of a f is exactly the volume averaging in the assumption of varans accordingly porosity n can be simply defined as a n a f where the original complex internal structure of porous materials is expressed concisely by volume averaging of a based on the above assumptions substituting u i in rans with the introduced operator form i e u u f u the meanings of terms are shown in table 1 varans become as follows 7 u i f x i 0 8 ρ u i f t ρ u j f u i f

implementation will be discussed in this section 2 2 1 numerical procedure whole procedure includes three main parts i e 1 fields setting 2 vof calculation and correction loop 3 pressure velocity loop as shown in fig 1 the mules multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution in the figure indicates an alpha correction loop this additional loop is designed to correct the alpha value inside the porous media which has been explained in higuera et al 2014a 2 2 2 boundary condition two main boundary conditions are used in this study in the simulation of fixed impermeable walls a no slip boundary is applied on these wall surfaces no slip boundary satisfies two principals 1 velocity of wall is equal to the velocity of near controlled volumes 2 shear stress on controlled volume closed to boundary is tangential to the wall rules 1 is easy to implement in the governing equations by eq 15 15 u c e l l s u r f a c e u w a l l the cellsurface subscript is the face where controlled volume share with the boundary rules 2 is achieved by assuming tangential shear stress is linear to the velocity gradient along normal direction to wall i e newton s law of viscosity 16 τ c e l l s u r f a c e τ w a l l μ u d where symbol is the normal direction to the boundary wall symbol is tangential direction to the boundary wall d is the distance along normal direction from boundary face to cell center μ is dynamic viscosity the moving wall boundary of sloshing tank wall is identical to no slip boundary with only prescribing wall s moving velocity usually tank moving velocity is known before calculating therefore this moving boundary has no difference with no slip wall boundary another boundary is used for simulating wave inlet which requires a prescribed flux through the surfaces of controlled volume for all the controlled volumes shared faces with this boundary the values of velocity including magnitude and direction and vof ratio α are setting according to corresponding wave theory taking 2 d airy wave for example free surface height and velocity field are known as 17 η h 2 cos k x ω t ψ 18 u h 2 ω cosh k z sinh k h cos k x ω t ψ 19 w h 2 ω sinh k z sinh k h sin k x ω t ψ where k 2 π l ω 2 π l ψ is wave phase shift knowing the free surface height on the boundary the values of ratio α of all controlled volumes near the boundary are able to be determined also the velocities of these controlled volumes are known and can be substituted into the face velocity term of the convection term of momentum equation 2 2 3 turbulence model the k ε turbulence model is adopted for simulating the turbulence both inside and outside porous media similar to varans the turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence dissipation ε are also in volume averaged expressions details about k ε turbulence model expression and coefficient can be seen from del jesus et al 2012 3 model validation before validation it is necessary to note that although ihfoam is a typical solver developed for solving flowing through porous model ihfoam is also capable of solving two phase flow problems when setting porosity n 1 and dismissing forchheimer parameters therefore all numerical tests next are solved independently by ihfoam this section consists of four parts firstly a mesh convergence test will be given for validating the convergence of ihfoam secondly a validation of 2 d sloshing in a rectangular tank will be conducted in comparison with the results from liu and lin 2009 then a validation of 3 d sloshing in a membrane type lng tank is performed by comparing with the experiment results from luo et al 2016 finally the validation of the porous model ihfoam is carried out by comparing the experiment of breakwater and dam break two cases in liu et al 1999 3 1 mesh convergence analysis and validation of 2 d rectangular tank sloshing mesh convergence and validation in 2 d rectangular tank are conducted here according the setup from liu and lin 2009 a 2 d rigid tank filled with water tank length is 2 a 1 0 m water depth is h 0 5 m as shown in fig 2 is under horizontal harmonic motion u a ω cos ω t where the velocity amplitude a 0 002 m and excitation frequency ω 5 29 rad s for mesh convergence test three mesh sizes are chosen for analysis which are 8 mm 8 mm 5 mm 5 mm 2 mm 2 mm also named as coarse mesh normal mesh fine mesh the surface elevation near the right wall is chosen for comparing as shown in fig 3 the results indicate that the calculated elevation on the right wall show good agreements among three mesh systems only small discrepancy occurs on the peak value fig 3 b shows that the peak surface elevation calculated by coarse mesh system has a relatively large discrepancy with that of other two mesh system which indicates the well convergence of numerical results as the shrinking of mesh size it means that normal mesh system has already showed good accuracy besides it is noted that in coarse mesh system the initial wave amplitude is not equal to 0 i e free surface height is not exactly 0 5 m which results from the vof method requiring the mesh size near free surface should be fine enough to precisely track free surface once mesh system is fine enough i e normal and fine mesh system in our case such problem can be solved therefore the normal mesh size is chosen for the following computations furthermore the result calculated by normal mesh system is compared with the results from liu and lin 2009 fig 4 good agreements are obtained in the same tank size and water depth another sloshing case under large amplitude horizontal harmonic motion u a ω cos ω t a 0 05 m ω 3 0 rad s is simulated according to the numerical results from gómez goñi et al 2013 basically fair agreements are obtained in fig 5 3 2 validation of 3 d membrane type sloshing previous part is carried out in a 2 d tank which means the third dimension in cartesian coordinate only consists of a cell in realistic sloshing situation 3 d cases are more common and essential therefore a membrane type 3 d tank sloshing case is validated in this part about membrane type tank size is referred to luo et al 2016 which has not presented here water filling rate h h 0 5 the tank is subjected to horizontal harmonic motion 25 25 y a t t r sin ω t π t t r a sin ω t π t t r where t r 10 s is a linear ramping factor which is used to avoid sudden jerk when initiating tank s motion amplitude a 0 005 m frequency ω 6 618 rad s total pressure at measurement point p1 is taken as comparison about the specific location of p1 referred to luo et al 2016 laminar and turbulence situations are both simulated and compared with experimental results fig 6 the relationship between simulated results and experimental results is evaluated by calculating their each correlation coefficient 26 the results of correlation coefficient in both situations are closed to 1 table 2 indicating good agreements with experimental results 26 c o r r e l x y x x y y x x 2 y y 2 3 3 validation of porous model 3 3 1 breakwater with porous armor this section is about the validation of porous layer applied in a caisson breakwater in coastal area context since the governing equations of ihfoam adopts the empirical coefficients formulas suggested by van gent 1995 i e linear drag coefficient α p nonlinear drag coefficient β p added mass coefficient c a it is indispensable to prescribe the value of these coefficients before running porous model given a group of coefficient values has already been validated in liu et al 1999 s numerical model an identical case will be set up here with same coefficient values to validate the accuracy of porous model calculated by ihfoam 2 d numerical flume x z plane is set here where geometric length is given in fig 7 the porous armor is erected next to the impermeable caisson the relevant parameters of porous armor are porosity n 0 5 d 50 0 05 m empirical coefficients α p 200 β p 1 1 c a 0 34 such coefficient values are also adopted in hsu et al 2002 still water height is 0 28 m regular wave trains propagate from the left boundary to right breakwater each wave period t 1 4 s wave height h 0 105 m for assuring 13 waves arrive at breakwater calculating time is set as 18 2s three wave height gauges locate at x 0 27 m x 3 3 m x 7 025 m respectively suppose left boundary as origin location x 0 the right boundary behind impermeable breakwater is the outlet for overtopping wave gets through the passing flux through this boundary is also measured the mesh size in the whole computational domain is firstly discretized by 500 150 uniform grids for improving the water surface recognition the size of mesh unit near water surface is scaled down minimal one is 1 cm 0 5 cm time step is self adaptable to convergent rate and data output interval is 0 1 s k ε turbulence model is applied in the whole computing area a wave making validation is firstly conducted by comparing two common wave generation ways and analytical solution on wave height on present 2 d numerical flume gauge 1 to simplify the validation wave reflection produced by encountering breakwater has not been taken into account the displacement of surface elevation at gauge 1 fig 8 validates the accuracy of piston type wave generation and static wave generation overall two wave making methods both have satisfied accuracy piston type method has better consistency with analytical results while requiring proper time before generating stable wave on the contrary wave generated by inlet boundary almost agrees with analytical solution in the first wave train indicating this method is more stable two methods all show greater wave height in wave trough which can be explained by the minor nonlinearity of wave given more manageable of inlet wave generation method in ihfoam and little error with analytical solution static wave generation way is finally adopted in this simulation about wave generation wang et al 2019 have done comprehensive works on the secondary development of piston type wave making based on openfoam class libraries the measured time histories of wave height on gauge 2 3 have been compared with both the numerical and experimental results presented in liu et al 1999 for matching the wave phase 1 4 t phase shift of presented results has already been done in fig 9 present results show better agreements with the experiment results in liu s especially the wave height near the porous armor of breakwater fig 9 b where the breaking wave has occurred furthermore the overtopping mass of breakwater under time simulated time is measured at the outlet of overtopping wave fig 10 comparing with liu s results present results have a relative larger overtopping mass considering discrepancies are relatively minor and the results with porous armor still show good agreements in increasing trend with liu s results the validation results is still satisfactory 3 3 2 porous dam break this validation part is more relevant with the simulation next part a porous rectangular zone is installed at the middle area of a 2 d rectangular tank by manually elevating water attitude at one side a break dam with flowing through middle porous media is reached experiment and numerical simulation have been investigated in liu et al 1999 here a validation on this simulation on free surface elevation variance under time is investigated 2 d rectangular tank size is 0 892 m long 0 58 m high porous zone is installed at the centers of tank with 0 29 m long from location 0 30 m 0 59 m and 0 37 m high which separates the tank into two sides an elevated water rectangular zone is 0 28 long and 0 15 m high in the left side 2 cm horizontally away from left side of porous media the based water elevation of tank is 0 025 m porous media consists of glass beads n 0 39 d 50 0 003 m keeping forchheimer empirical coefficients as the same values as last part α p 200 β p 1 1 c a 0 34 uniform mesh system 0 005 m tall 0 0025 m high is used to divide the whole computational region calculating time sets 4 s the free surface elevation of whole tank is taken as comparison in fig 11 while partial discrepancy occurs outside the porous media the free surface inside porous media reaches good agreement 4 implementation of porous model in sloshing after validating a list of problems calculated by ihfoam the porous model adopted in sloshing context will be investigated comprehensively in this part forchheimer empirical coefficients are kept the same as validation part α p 200 β p 1 1 c a 0 34 in particular the porous layer arrangement and the parameters choices thickness ratio w a porosity n average diameter d 50 will be taken into account for model optimization 4 1 study on the arrangement of porous model according to the conclusions in akyildiz and ünal 2005 adopting solid vertical baffle in tank is an efficient way for sloshing dampening especially when baffle erected at the middle of tank bottom therefore to evaluate the dampening effect of adopting porous layer solid vertical baffle erected at the center of tank bottom is also conducted here as a comparison firstly based on the previous 2 d rectangular size in validation part a width d 5 cm height h 3 4 h porous baffle is erected at the center of tank bottom fig 12 the relevant parameters on porous material in this case are consistent with the parameters set in the breakwater validation case i e n 0 5 d 50 0 05 m water depth h and external excitation is the same as the 2 d validation case u a ω cos ω t where ω 5 29 rad s a 0 002 m except for measuring free surface elevation at right tank wall a pressure probe is installed at the right wall vertical distance c from tank bottom is 0 005 m probing pressure values are subtracted by its initial pressure when t 0 s fig 13 the results show significant decreasing in both surface elevation and dynamic pressure with porous baffle although the effect of porous baffle is not comparable with solid baffle nevertheless the adoption of porous baffle has eliminated the pressure jet originally occurred in the unbaffled tank to further diminish the dynamic pressure near the surrounding wall an alternative layout of attaching porous layer to the surrounding wall is proposed to verify the effect of new layout similarly based on the original size of 2 d tank a width w 5 cm porous layer is pasted to the surrounding wall fig 14 porous parameters water depth external excitation is the same as previous one the time histories of dynamic pressure fig 15 b shows further mitigating of pressure fluctuation in comparison with previous porous baffle while the maximum of surface elevation near the wall fig 15 a increases a little the effect of new arrangement is still encouraging for dynamic pressure is the main concern in sloshing 4 2 parameters optimization in this part for the sake of further improving the dampening effect of porous layer in sloshing context a set of parameters optimizations which mainly focus on thickness of porous layer w porosity n and average diameters d 50 will be conducted accordingly before optimization some fundamental relationships among these parameters will be informed to understand these parameters for a typical porous material it usually consists of abundant small gravels or other tiny materials to balance the shape of these compositions a mean diameter d 50 is usually employed for porosity n it is a unique characteristic of porous material which denotes how much the air percent occupies in a porous materials unit therefore porosity value is among 0 1 furthermore these parameters have a relationship when the arrangement mode of compositions is prescribed e g if compressing a think porous layer into a thin one while d 50 is constant usually n and w will shrink however in numerical way it is possible to robustly let w decline while keeping other two parameters as constant which might indicate a different arrangement mode of the materials unity about the question of gravel arrangements will not be discussed here since it is more related to specific application of porous layer 4 2 1 thickness ratio to make the thickness parameter more universal a thickness ratio is w a adopted for optimizing thickness where a is the half of tank horizontal length under the previous scenario of sloshing in 2 d rectangular tank keeping porosity n d 50 as constant 0 5 and 0 05 m derived from breakwater validation case a list of different thickness ratio w a ranging from 0 1 to 1 0 are simulated the results on correspondent time histories of surface height near the wall and dynamic pressure at p are shown in fig 16 and fig 17 considering surface height the increasing thickness of porous layer contributes to the decline of maximum surface height during the sloshing while such a declining trend manifest positive correlation with thickness when w a 0 4 the decreasing trend is not pronounced any more considering dynamic pressure still the increasing thickness contributes to the mitigating of the amplitude of pressure fluctuation it is encouraged to note that the decreasing rate of dynamic fluctuation is not utterly consistent with the increasing of thickness indicating the existence of certain thickness ratio for maximally decreasing the dynamic pressure such value roughly ranges among 0 1 0 4 thus a more detailed simulation about thickness ratio is conducted subsequently as shown in fig 18 among 0 1 0 4 the trend of maximum surface elevation and pressure is consistent with the analysis made previously for maximum surface elevation after w a 0 3 the declining rate turns to slow for dynamic pressure extreme maximum positive negative pressure appears at w a 0 30 0 24 despite a little discrepancy pressure dampening changed little among 0 20 0 30 since it is hard and robust to determine a most satisfactory thickness value for model optimization here it is more reasonable to suggest an optimized thickness ratio w a interval in 0 20 0 30 for decreasing the dynamic pressure on tank wall during sloshing to simplify the optimization next part a specific thickness ratio w a 0 25 among this suggested range is employed for next part 4 2 2 porosity after optimizing thickness ratio w a similarly keeping w a d 50 as 0 25 and 0 05 m different porosity n among 0 1 1 0 are simulated fig 19 it is noted that when porosity n is set as 1 0 the effect of porous layer has been removed also when setting porosity n as 0 1 where the porous among porous layer is rather fine in the extreme situation the porous layer is equal to impermeable layer such porosity setting is impractical and require more iterations for calculating convergence which has not presented here from results fig 19 it is interesting to find that the effect of varied porosity is similar to thickness ratio where the increasing of porosity lead to the decline of maximum surface elevation and there is extreme point for porosity to reach the minimum dynamic pressure in this case maximum positive negative pressure congruously reach the minimum when porosity n 0 51 therefore for the optimization results of porosity porosity ranging among 0 45 0 55 is suggested for pressure dampening porosity n 0 51 is selected for next step optimization 4 2 3 average diameter finally an optimization parameter of average diameters d 50 is conducted a ratio to the thickness of porous layer is taken for illustrating this parameter conveniently i e d 50 w keeping other two parameters as suggested values w a 0 25 n 0 51 a series of simulations are conducted fig 20 from results it is noted that the varied d 50 values both manifest monotonous relationship with maximum surface elevation and dynamic pressure however when d 50 w is smaller than 0 05 in this case this specific d 50 threshold is 0 00625 m the increasing declining rate of the trend is pronounced when d 50 w is greater than 0 05 the declining trend of maximum positive pressure is tiny finally a suggested d 50 w interval is determined as 0 05 0 4 4 2 4 results of optimization in this section by conducting a series sloshing simulation in 2 d rectangular tank equipped with interior porous layer the optimized parameters for porous layer is finally determined as w a among 0 2 0 3 n among 0 45 0 55 recommend n 0 51 when considering optimal pressure dampening d 50 w among 0 05 0 4 implementing optimized parameters w a 0 25 n 0 51 d 50 w 0 2 for porous layers in comparison with unoptimized one and solid baffle fig 21 a fig 21 b the improvement of optimization is pronounced especially the fluctuation amplitude of dynamic pressure red line marked with circles is comparable to solid baffle dashed line 5 dampening analysis after getting the optimized model of porous layer it is also crucial to know how porous material mitigates sloshing therefore three techniques are used in this section on the optimized porous layer optimized parameters are determined as w a 0 25 n 0 51 d 50 w 0 2 during 2 d rectangular tank sloshing 50 filling rate in section 4 rectangular tank under horizontal harmonic motion u b ω cos ω t where ω 5 29 rad s b 0 002 m firstly the wave surface elevation history near the right wall is analyzed by using the fast fourier transform fft technique a frequency domain comparison of no porous layer case and adopting porous layer case are presented in fig 22 the highest peak in two figures is the external excitation converting it into circular frequency i e 5 235 rad s is closed with realistic external excitation value 5 29 rad s except for this peak value 1 667 hz is also the common frequency peak in both figures which denotes a higher order resonant frequency a significant difference is that after adopting porous layer a third peak appears at 0 733 hz this frequency is the resonant frequency of the tank with porous layer which transforms from natural frequency 0 845 hz where in fig 22 a natural frequency has not been filtered out for too closed to external frequency therefore it is reasonable to say that the sloshing dampening of porous layer has relationship with the decline of tank natural resonant frequency 0 88 ω 0 which avoids the frequency of external excitation ω 0 this effect is similar to adopting solid baffle song et al 2012 furthermore a vorticity field during sloshing is investigated fig 23 at selected typical instants of vorticity field the intense vorticity appears at the interface of porous layer near the water surface which consumes the kinematic energy of water particle adjacent to the wall so that restraining the displacement of water surface near the wall however solid baffle usually generates intense vorticity near the end side of baffle according to xue et al 2013 to understand a detailed distribution of pressure near the wall when implementing porous layer a series of pressure probe are set at right wall with varied vertical distance away from tank bottom the results are presented in pressure elevation coupled graph as shown in fig 24 where pressure peak and trough appear successively according to the color contrast it can be reached out that the maximum pressure locates near the still water surface z 0 5 m above z 0 525 m dynamic pressure rapidly disappeared also indicating the maximum value of water surface displacement below z 0 4 m similarly dynamic pressure declines quickly also a tiny phase lag appears at the pressure near the water indicating a buffering function of porous material layer 6 application of porous material layer in 3 d membrane type lng tank in real lng ship a membrane type tank is usually adopted for more volume capacity since previous sloshing is under simple 2 d rectangular tank it is of more practical significance to adopt the optimized porous layer into 3 d membrane type tank for dampening sloshing a scaled down dimension of membrane type tank is presented in fig 25 where the locations of all pressure probes have been identified furthermore according to the arranging way of porous material layer previously the profile of a membrane tank with porous layer is also presented due to the induced sloshing wave in our study mainly slams the lateral tank rather than the bottom side the porous material layer has not covered the bottom wall parameter value are determined from the suggested intervals in the end of section 4 w a 0 2 n 0 51 d 50 w 0 1 it is noted that for membrane type tank the definition of a is obscure here a is taken as the length of membrane type tank the calculation domain is divided into 40 196 132 uniform grids in x y z dimension correspondent filling rate and external excitation will talk in the next part for simulating different sloshing conditions 6 1 1 dimension regular excitation in the view of previous excitation is small amplitude a larger amplitude horizontal harmonic motion y a sin ω t π is applied in this case where amplitude a 0 01 m natural frequency ω is determined by the directions of tank length 2 a as 7 136 rad s considering a large amplitude might cause a sudden jerk at the beginning of sloshing a linear ramping method is also applied ramping time is 5s also concerning the filling rate of tank is contributed to the sloshing five different filling levels are conducted here the results are shown in fig 26 a list of typical instants of the sloshing happening in two type tanks in 0 5 filling levels h b are shown in fig 27 firstly in p1 p3 the maximum dynamic pressure positive and negative all get mitigated in different extents indicating the dampening function of dynamic pressure behave quite well in these sloshing situations secondly in probe 4 the almost zero value of armored tank case demonstrates the inhibition of maximum surface height near the tank wall since probe 4 locates at a higher attitude in tank than other probes see fig 25 thirdly with respect to different filling levels although the largest pressures have not shown in a same filling level in different probes it is still essential to note that an intermediate filling level signifies a more serious sloshing damage like h b 0 5 0 6 overall the performance of porous layer applied into membrane type tank on pressure dampening is promising 6 2 3 dimension irregular excitation in real seaway lng tank is faced with several dimension excitations which are known as surge sway heave roll pitch yaw a figure could help to understand these norms fig 28 since the final motion of tank is determined collectively by wave and ship it is rather complex to illustrate the final tank motion considering simulating more realistic condition of tank motion also simplifying the illustration a three dimension tank motion on y z plane is simulated including sway heave and roll which have been concluded as one of the dominant excitations affecting tank stability in luo et al 2016 the modified pierson moskowits mpm wave spectrum and scaled response amplitude operators rao parameters will be introduced for calculating the irregular excitation 6 2 1 irregular tank motion since real seal wave consists of a series of random regular waves statistically the final wave motion is the results of the sum of all regular wave motion e g a unidimensional irregular tank motion could be described as eq 27 27 η t k 1 n η k cos ω e t θ k where η k ω e k θ k is respectively the amplitude the encounter frequency and phase angle of k th regular wave component θ k is determined as random value between 0 2 π ω e k is the specific ship tank frequency after encountering wave excitation therefore the encounter frequency could be derived from wave frequency and some other parameters which is known as 28 ω e k ω k ω k 2 u 0 cos χ g where ω k is the wave frequency of k th wave component u 0 is the ship speed χ is wave encounter angle also has been identified in fig 28 in view of the situation simulated is at y z plane i e beam sea where cos χ 0 the encounter frequency ω e k is equal to the wave frequency ω k the calculating of η k might be a little complex 29 since different ship designs manifest distinct motion characteristics when encountering wave motion usually a practical method based on the assumption that motion of ship is linear with wave motion is adopted which is known as amplitude response operator rao i e the term r η ζ ω k χ u in 29 the rao is determined by both wave and ship usually numerical simulation could help to calculate kim et al 2008 the rao data in this study is referred from luo et al 2016 which is based on a fully loaded lng ship sailing at the speed of 10 366 m s except for the rao in 29 ω 1 k ω 2 k term bound integrating band which centers at specific wave frequency ω in mathematical way ω 1 k ω 2 k are calculated as ω 1 k ω k δ 1 k ω 2 k ω k δ 2 k δ 1 k ω k ω k 1 2 δ 2 k ω k 1 ω k 2 to simplify the calculating assuming δ 1 k δ 2 k 0 02 s is set for increment furthermore mpm wave spectrum is adopted in for simulating real wave motions equation 30 is the specific formula where significant wave height h 1 3 is 4 m domain wave period t is 4 π s since the main wave frequencies in mpm spectrum cluster among 0 2 rad s the random wave frequencies values are all in this interval 29 η k 2 r η ζ ω k χ u 2 ω 2 k ω 1 k s ω d ω 30 s ω 4 π 3 h 1 3 2 ω 5 t 4 exp 16 π 3 ω 4 t 4 to get a more intense sloshing situations the membrane type tank size is extended 100 times i e the c m unit in fig 25 is replaced by m unit so that the tank natural resonant frequency are among the given irregular wave frequency interval again a ramp of tank motion is adopted in the very beginning of sloshing the final tank motions in three each dimension for 120 s is presented in fig 29 the roll motion is defined as rotating around the center of tank bottom wall reference point for rotation from the conclusion of last part that the intermediate filling level usually leads to higher pressure peak this part sloshing is only conducted in 0 5 filling level tanks additionally irregular excitations of each dimension in 3 freedoms 3dof are also separately conducted to the tank to evaluate the effect of porous layer in each excitation component 6 2 2 sloshing results the time history of dynamic pressure of pressure probe p2 locates closely to still water surface are shown in fig 30 lists of typical instants of the sloshing happening in two tanks are shown in fig 31 firstly the comparisons of two colors fig 30 indicate the dampening function of porous layer when being applied to a real scale of a membrane type tank secondly the pressure fluctuates most intensely in the sway excitation where the pressure dampening effect of porous layer is significant a bunch of pressure jets or slamming phenomena are eliminated in the tank with porous layer red line in sway excitation context although in the pure heave excitation context the tank with porous layer has not performed well during a certain time when a large up and down displacement occurs this phenomenon can be explained by the buffering phenomenon in porous layer in which the liquid in porous layer behave relatively slower than outer liquid under excitation by the squeezing of liquid outside porous layer the pressure in certain point tends to rise rather than decline as we usually think this phenomenon can be also identified in the fourth picture in fig 31 120 s where the liquid in porous layer kept higher attitude than the liquid outsides nevertheless this adverse pressure trend doesn t lead to serious danger in 3dof excitation for its peak value is smaller than the peak in pure sway excitation plus the pure heave motion seldom occurs in real seaway thus the effect of porous layer in the real scale of membrane type tank is good 7 conclusions in this study with the aid of the numerical solver ihfoam a new sloshing dampening way of pasting porous material layer to the interior periphery of the tank was investigated firstly for validating ihfoam four validation scenarios have been conducted respectively focusing on solving convergence 2 d tank sloshing 3 d membrane tank sloshing and porous model the results show good agreements with experimental results in literature secondly in a 2 d rectangular tank the imagine of applying porous layer into tank is put forward comparing with solid vertical baffle with respect to maximum elevation and dynamic pressure amplitude the effect of porous layer model is investigated the results indicate that porous layer has good capacity of dampening sloshing further the porous layer model is optimized by changing three intrinsic parameters thickness ratio w a porosity n and average diameters ratio d 50 w the results show all parameters manifest monotonic effect on maximum elevation but it is interesting to find that there are certain values for w a and n where dynamic pressure declines to minimum therefore a group of values for three parameters are suggested i e w a among 0 2 0 3 n among 0 45 0 55 recommend n 0 51 when considering optimal pressure dampening d 50 w among 0 05 0 4 for the optimized porous layer model to understand the dampening nature of porous material layer fft analysis vorticity fields and pressure elevation coupled graph are conducted the results indicated that porous material layer shift the natural frequency of original tank into a smaller one i e 0 88 ω 0 a violent vortices is generated near the interface of porous layer with outside water near the water surface about the pressure distribution the strongest pressure impact occurs near the water surface elevation of tank wall which also explains why a strong vortices occur in this area finally the porous layer is applied into the 3 d membrane tank where a violent 1 dimensional excitation and a 3 dimension irregular excitation are employed respectively in 1 dimensional violent sloshing case the mitigating effect of porous layer is demonstrated well in different filling levels in 3 dimensional irregular excitation case in which a real scale membrane type tank is chosen the porous layer help to remove the dominant pressure jets occurring in the tank without porous layer therefore from above numerical cases the adopting of porous material layer is verified to be a useful way to dampen liquid

21343,severe sloshing in a membrane type liquefied natural gas lng tank excited by random sea wave easily causes overturning of liquid cargo ship and structural damage of tank besides the baffles maybe the porous material layer pasted tight to the inner periphery of the tanks is another way to mitigate sloshing and reduce potential risks caused by severe sloshing the computational fluid dynamics cfd code openfoam was employed to study sloshing wave interaction with porous material layer the improved ihfoam used to simulate porous breakwater was validated against with available experimental data good agreements are obtained three intrinsic parameters of porous material layer such as porosity n thickness ratio w a and average diameter ratio d 50 w were varied to obtain optimized parameters in mitigating sloshing by conducting two dimensional numerical tests and the corresponding critical value that reduced sloshing dynamics pressure at utmost was found the tank with optimized porous material layer manifested well in mitigating sloshing in comparison with the case with solid vertical baffle finally the optimized porous material layer was installed around the inner periphery of the membrane type lng tank excited by both regular and irregular excitation to discuss effects of porous material layer on mitigating sloshing under extreme conditions keywords sloshing mitigation porous material layer lng tank parameters optimization 1 introduction sloshing is the violent motion of the free surface of a fluid in a partially filled container which is a classic problem in hydrodynamics it has a wide range of applications in ocean and offshore engineering fields particularly in cargo ship carrying the partially filled container with fluids and marine structural vibration passive control dou et al 2020 thus sloshing became a very important practical issue in the last decades due to the increased activities in the liquefied natural gas lng transport lin 2007 numerically and analytically studied fluid sloshing in a rectangular tank by varying forcing frequencies chen and xue 2018 studied the influence of liquid filling level on pressure frequency response and observed the process of the transition from a soft spring response to a hard spring response su and liu 2017 and saripilli and sen 2018 thought that the coupling effects of ship motion responses and sloshing is essential for the preliminary design of lng carriers ikealumba and wu 2017 discussed the importance of including ship motion that would induce sloshing they found that by including sloshing the overall pressure on the tank walls were increased by up to 31 while the spill time was increased by up to 100 s due to air back flowing into the storage tanks considering the compressibility of liquid vapor inside tank calderon sanchez et al 2018 researched the effect of phase change on sloshing pressure in lng tanks they concluded that the peak pressure is dampened when phase change is considered tai et al 2019 thought that a plunging wave with different stages induces different forces on the structures similarly different sloshing wave can also cause different motion responses of lng carriers effect of sloshing on lng transport is therefore noticeable even a small amount of liquid sloshing about below decks can seriously affect a ship s stability as the liquid cargo ship rolls the liquid pours to one side which moves the ship s center of gravity if this moves beyond a critical point the ship cannot right itself and will capsize specially extreme localized slamming loads caused by the severe sloshing wave can be devastating for both the containment system and the ship structure malenica et al 2017 xue et al 2019 luo et al 2020 to minimize the potential sloshing damage the control of the sloshing behavior by using the baffles or other anti sloshing devices is a subject of interest in the recent years akyildiz and unal 2005 experimentally investigated the relationship between different solid baffle configuration and pressure distribution in a three dimensional tank the result showed that vertical baffle located in the middle of tank bottom reduces fluid motion pronouncedly xue and lin 2011 numerically studied the detailed mechanism of ring baffles on reducing violent viscous liquid sloshing in prismatic tanks by developing a large eddy simulation les model newtank based on virtual boundary force vbf and volume of fluid vof methods wang et al 2016 2017 analyzed the transient lateral sloshing in a partially filled cylindrical and toroidal tank with multi various baffles of different configurations by using a coupled multimodal method and scaled boundary finite element method yu et al 2017 experimentally conducted sloshing in a rectangular tank with two floating plates at three different filling levels under rolling excitation xue et al 2017 conducted a series of model tests in a rectangular tank on a shake table under harmonic surging excitation in their studies immersed bottom mounted vertical baffles vertical baffles flushing with free surface surface piercing bottom mounted vertical baffles and perforated vertical baffles were tried out in a wide frequency ranges as potential passive sloshing damping devices it concluded that the vertical baffle flushing with free surface and the perforated vertical baffle are two more effective tools in reducing the dynamic impact pressure among the four baffle configurations chu et al 2018 investigated the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular water tank with multiple bottom mounted baffles and concluded that the natural frequency of the tank was altered by the multiple baffles and was related to the effective water depth above the baffles sanapala et al 2018 achieved the optimal ring baffle design in controlling free surface sloshing waves in a rectangular tank subjected to vertical harmonic as well as bhuj earthquake excitations by performing systematic numerical tests chen et al 2018 conducted investigations of sloshing in microalgae farming tanks with baffles the evolution of vortices the trace of the particles due to baffles and the effects of baffle length and location on liquid mixing and resonant frequencies were concerned xiang et al 2019 concluded that artificial islands at suitable locations in plain reservoir can attenuate the wave heights by approximately 10 30 kargbo et al 2019 and xue et al 2020 carried out a series of simulations of multiphase sloshing interaction with baffle submersed block and observed how the position and size of the baffle and block affect the interfacial wave in stratified fluids apart from stationary type baffle in above studies koh et al 2013 have ever numerically studied a novel sloshing mitigation device i e the constrained floating baffle based on the improved consistent particle method ning et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 proposed an anti sloshing technique by using floating foams and found that the maximum wave height and dynamic pressure were greatly reduced as the foam layer thickness increases at the resonant condition zheng et al 2020b studied effects of porous bottom layer on single and multilayered fluids sloshing dynamics by using navier stokes equation coupling with brinkman model in fact the perforated baffles or slat screens are also commonly used as sloshing suppressing devices molin and remy 2013 performed experimental and numerical study of the sloshing motion in a rectangular tank subjected to swaying and rolling excitations with a perforated screen jin et al 2014 conducted an experimental study on sloshing in a tank with an inner horizontal perforated plate wei et al 2015 experimentally investigated anti sloshing effects of the vertical screen on the tank bottom filled with shallow water and concluded that the slat screen was an effective method in reducing sloshing kumar and sinhamahapatra 2016 adopted a finite element method by using pressure formulation to study dynamic properties of rectangular rigid containers with single slotted internal elements and screens they found that best dynamic advantages and reduced weight penalty without sacrificing benefits of rigidity or stiffness were achieved cho and kim 2016 theoretically and experimentally investigated the effect of dual vertical porous baffles on the sloshing reduction inside a rectangular tank it was shown that the dual vertical porous baffles can significantly suppress sloshing motions when properly designed by selecting optimal porosity submergence depth and installation position marivani and hamed 2017 developed a pressure drop model for studying sloshing in a tank with the slat screens by considering the effects of the screen pattern characterized by the effective solidity ratio and the slat ratio they concluded that decreasing the slat height would increase the inherent damping of the tld for slat screens with the same physical solidity ratio yu et al 2019 2020 experimentally studied effects of vertical slat screen on reducing sloshing in a tank by varying solidity ratio slot size location and slat screen number whether it is a solid baffle or a perforated screen they need to be fixed to the inner periphery wall of the lng tank to mitigate sloshing which may lead to another problem of stress concentration at the welding point between the baffles and the lng tank walls porous structures have been widely used in harbors and coastlines due to their good performance in absorbing wave energy karunarathna and lin 2006 thought that flow resistances inside the porous bed results in wave energy dissipation zhan et al 2010 demonstrated the effective performance of the porous media wave absorber in the absorption of reflected waves by simulating wave propagation over a submerged bar zheng et al 2020a studied interaction both wave and coral reef flat that can be seen as porous media in a wave basin thus porous media layer pasted tight to the inner periphery wall of the lng tank without welding was proposed to mitigate fluid sloshing slamming in this study not only in the liquid cargo ship design but also in the inshore area protection artificial measures are usually used to reduce wave impact for example in order to lessen the scour of breakwater porous material protection layer made up of a jumble of gravels is usually adopted to resist the wave attack in fact many theoretical and numerical studies of determining how the fluid flows inside and outside of the porous layer have been done extensively the motion of steady fluid in 1 d porous media is well known as darcy theory which proposed that hydraulic gradient i is linear with average flux u furthermore to illustrate more realistic of fluid motion including turbulence inside of porous zone polubarinova kochina 1962 proposed a new scheme of hydraulic gradient in consideration of unsteady flow 1 1 i a p u b p u u c p u t where a p is linear drag coefficient s m b p is nonlinear drag coefficient s2 m2 c p is added mass coefficient s2 m van gent 1995 suggested specific values for these empirical coefficients comparing to theoretical study of fluid motion in porous layer numerical study on porous layer has also progressed hugely based on empirical formulas of van gent and improved rans governing equations liu et al 1999 redetermined empirical coefficient suggested by van gent and applied modified values into simulating wave overtopped breakwater caisson within porous armor numerical results reached good agreements with experimental results concerning with wave height and overtopping mass hsu et al 2002 firstly proposed volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stocks varans combined with k ε turbulence model closure within the porous media the new model had an advantage of bypassing boundary setting on the interface of porous layer and outside flow which was a necessity in liu s previous model recently del jesus et al 2012 advanced the applicability of varans which allows the spatial gradient of porosity and built numerical model called ih 3vof new model can simulate multiple different porosity media layers which is practical in animating the real breakwater constituent higuera et al 2014a developed new model called ihfoam which was also based on varans with k ε and k ω s s t turbulence models the new model optimized the 3 d dimensional effect of flowing through porous media furthermore a simulation of a high mound breakwater with composite porous layers is presented in their companion paper higuera et al 2014b except for finite volume method fvm new methods based on lagrange description of liquid motion like particle methods are becoming popular recently however the simulation of flow through porous media is at the beginning stage main simulations are limited in 2 d situations which is a problem of this method shao 2010 akbari and namin 2013 luo and koh 2017 khayyer et al 2018 based on the energy dissipating property of porous material the scenario of installing porous media layer inside the lng tank to reduce sloshing should be a meaningful attempt however the related studies are rarely reported therefore liquid sloshing in tanks with porous material layer are conducted numerically based on the porous media solver ihfoam in openfoam and dynamic mesh part of which governing equations are derived from varans combined with the vof model in this study porous empirical coefficients are following with the formula suggested by van gent 1995 which will be explained in the following sections 2 mathematical model and numerical implementation 2 1 mathematical model the vof method introduced by hirt and nichols 1981 defined a scalar α to account for the ratio of each fluid in a control volume unit each phase in two phase flow gets access to join into same governing equations by transforming two fluids into a single integrated fluid accordingly this mixed fluid property is determined by the original two fluids and the ratio α i e ρ ρ 1 α ρ 2 1 α μ μ 1 α μ 2 1 α where μ is dynamic viscosity therefore the incompressible and viscous navier stokes equations were written as follows including continuity eq 2 momentum eq 3 vof function advection eq 4 2 u i x i 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j x j τ j i p x i ρ g i σ κ α x i 4 α t u i α x i 0 where σ is surface tension coefficient κ is two phase interface curvature τ is shear stress p is instantaneous effective pressure in addition for unifying the scheme of source term in 3 for surface tension σ is relative minor in large scale simulation next derivation this term will be neglected to illustrate the flow through porous media the approach of simulating the porous zone is necessary however the internal structure of porous materials is intricated which consists of uncountable pores and solid parts direct numerical simulation of the flowing through each precise pore is difficult to achieve therefore it is necessary to generalize the fluid behaviors in porous zones for numerical simulation for getting the mean behavior of fluid in these zones spaces in porous zones are averaged over a length which is larger than pore size but smaller than spatial scale of physical fluid variables this volume averaging in control volumes is known as the volume averaged rans varans hsu et al 2002 del jesus et al 2012 derived similar final equations about varans combing k ε turbulence model hsu et al 2002 assumed porosity as a constant in space and took the porosity term out of the spatial gradient operators del jesus et al 2012 proposed modified equations which allowed porosity varied in space some important derivation parts will be mentioned here for further details see these two literatures assuming a represents a scalar property the intrinsic volume averaging in a control volume can be expressed with darcy s volume averaging operator as 5 a 1 v v f a d v where v f is the integrating portion of v when adding superscript f into averaging volume changes correspondingly from v into v f 6 a f 1 v f v f a d v the scheme of a f is exactly the volume averaging in the assumption of varans accordingly porosity n can be simply defined as a n a f where the original complex internal structure of porous materials is expressed concisely by volume averaging of a based on the above assumptions substituting u i in rans with the introduced operator form i e u u f u the meanings of terms are shown in table 1 varans become as follows 7 u i f x i 0 8 ρ u i f t ρ u j f u i f x j p f x i ρ g i ρ u i u j f x j x j μ x j u i f ρ u i u j f x j 1 v f a int p ρ δ i j τ i j ρ n j d a 9 α t u i f α x i 0 the second line of eq 8 is consistent with the terms in rans the third line represents the additional friction and inertia force brought by porous media which can be replaced by the scheme proposed by van gent 1995 10 a p α p 1 n 3 n 2 ν g d 50 2 b p β p 1 7 5 k c 1 n n 2 1 g d 50 c p 1 g c a γ p 1 g 1 n n it is noted that kc is the keulegan carpenter number which represents additional friction due to unsteady situation for kc is hard to estimate before the calculation starts and is less influential than other empirical coefficients this term 7 5 k c is neglected in the next derivation by substituting these coefficients into forchheimer equation the gradient hydraulic i is derived as 11 i α p 1 n 3 n 2 ν g d 50 2 u i f β p 1 n n 2 1 g d 50 u i f u i f c p u i f t it is noted that i is a non dimensional term to keep dimensions the same when adding i into momentum equation i is multiplied by ρ g above equations consist of intrinsic averaging term e g u i f however out of porous media the intrinsic averaging term is not meaningful to reach equations consistency inside and outside the porous media the intrinsic averaging terms are all substituted by volume averaging terms e g u i f u i n with above considerations the final expression of varans is

implementation will be discussed in this section 2 2 1 numerical procedure whole procedure includes three main parts i e 1 fields setting 2 vof calculation and correction loop 3 pressure velocity loop as shown in fig 1 the mules multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution in the figure indicates an alpha correction loop this additional loop is designed to correct the alpha value inside the porous media which has been explained in higuera et al 2014a 2 2 2 boundary condition two main boundary conditions are used in this study in the simulation of fixed impermeable walls a no slip boundary is applied on these wall surfaces no slip boundary satisfies two principals 1 velocity of wall is equal to the velocity of near controlled volumes 2 shear stress on controlled volume closed to boundary is tangential to the wall rules 1 is easy to implement in the governing equations by eq 15 15 u c e l l s u r f a c e u w a l l the cellsurface subscript is the face where controlled volume share with the boundary rules 2 is achieved by assuming tangential shear stress is linear to the velocity gradient along normal direction to wall i e newton s law of viscosity 16 τ c e l l s u r f a c e τ w a l l μ u d where symbol is the normal direction to the boundary wall symbol is tangential direction to the boundary wall d is the distance along normal direction from boundary face to cell center μ is dynamic viscosity the moving wall boundary of sloshing tank wall is identical to no slip boundary with only prescribing wall s moving velocity usually tank moving velocity is known before calculating therefore this moving boundary has no difference with no slip wall boundary another boundary is used for simulating wave inlet which requires a prescribed flux through the surfaces of controlled volume for all the controlled volumes shared faces with this boundary the values of velocity including magnitude and direction and vof ratio α are setting according to corresponding wave theory taking 2 d airy wave for example free surface height and velocity field are known as 17 η h 2 cos k x ω t ψ 18 u h 2 ω cosh k z sinh k h cos k x ω t ψ 19 w h 2 ω sinh k z sinh k h sin k x ω t ψ where k 2 π l ω 2 π l ψ is wave phase shift knowing the free surface height on the boundary the values of ratio α of all controlled volumes near the boundary are able to be determined also the velocities of these controlled volumes are known and can be substituted into the face velocity term of the convection term of momentum equation 2 2 3 turbulence model the k ε turbulence model is adopted for simulating the turbulence both inside and outside porous media similar to varans the turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence dissipation ε are also in volume averaged expressions details about k ε turbulence model expression and coefficient can be seen from del jesus et al 2012 3 model validation before validation it is necessary to note that although ihfoam is a typical solver developed for solving flowing through porous model ihfoam is also capable of solving two phase flow problems when setting porosity n 1 and dismissing forchheimer parameters therefore all numerical tests next are solved independently by ihfoam this section consists of four parts firstly a mesh convergence test will be given for validating the convergence of ihfoam secondly a validation of 2 d sloshing in a rectangular tank will be conducted in comparison with the results from liu and lin 2009 then a validation of 3 d sloshing in a membrane type lng tank is performed by comparing with the experiment results from luo et al 2016 finally the validation of the porous model ihfoam is carried out by comparing the experiment of breakwater and dam break two cases in liu et al 1999 3 1 mesh convergence analysis and validation of 2 d rectangular tank sloshing mesh convergence and validation in 2 d rectangular tank are conducted here according the setup from liu and lin 2009 a 2 d rigid tank filled with water tank length is 2 a 1 0 m water depth is h 0 5 m as shown in fig 2 is under horizontal harmonic motion u a ω cos ω t where the velocity amplitude a 0 002 m and excitation frequency ω 5 29 rad s for mesh convergence test three mesh sizes are chosen for analysis which are 8 mm 8 mm 5 mm 5 mm 2 mm 2 mm also named as coarse mesh normal mesh fine mesh the surface elevation near the right wall is chosen for comparing as shown in fig 3 the results indicate that the calculated elevation on the right wall show good agreements among three mesh systems only small discrepancy occurs on the peak value fig 3 b shows that the peak surface elevation calculated by coarse mesh system has a relatively large discrepancy with that of other two mesh system which indicates the well convergence of numerical results as the shrinking of mesh size it means that normal mesh system has already showed good accuracy besides it is noted that in coarse mesh system the initial wave amplitude is not equal to 0 i e free surface height is not exactly 0 5 m which results from the vof method requiring the mesh size near free surface should be fine enough to precisely track free surface once mesh system is fine enough i e normal and fine mesh system in our case such problem can be solved therefore the normal mesh size is chosen for the following computations furthermore the result calculated by normal mesh system is compared with the results from liu and lin 2009 fig 4 good agreements are obtained in the same tank size and water depth another sloshing case under large amplitude horizontal harmonic motion u a ω cos ω t a 0 05 m ω 3 0 rad s is simulated according to the numerical results from gómez goñi et al 2013 basically fair agreements are obtained in fig 5 3 2 validation of 3 d membrane type sloshing previous part is carried out in a 2 d tank which means the third dimension in cartesian coordinate only consists of a cell in realistic sloshing situation 3 d cases are more common and essential therefore a membrane type 3 d tank sloshing case is validated in this part about membrane type tank size is referred to luo et al 2016 which has not presented here water filling rate h h 0 5 the tank is subjected to horizontal harmonic motion 25 25 y a t t r sin ω t π t t r a sin ω t π t t r where t r 10 s is a linear ramping factor which is used to avoid sudden jerk when initiating tank s motion amplitude a 0 005 m frequency ω 6 618 rad s total pressure at measurement point p1 is taken as comparison about the specific location of p1 referred to luo et al 2016 laminar and turbulence situations are both simulated and compared with experimental results fig 6 the relationship between simulated results and experimental results is evaluated by calculating their each correlation coefficient 26 the results of correlation coefficient in both situations are closed to 1 table 2 indicating good agreements with experimental results 26 c o r r e l x y x x y y x x 2 y y 2 3 3 validation of porous model 3 3 1 breakwater with porous armor this section is about the validation of porous layer applied in a caisson breakwater in coastal area context since the governing equations of ihfoam adopts the empirical coefficients formulas suggested by van gent 1995 i e linear drag coefficient α p nonlinear drag coefficient β p added mass coefficient c a it is indispensable to prescribe the value of these coefficients before running porous model given a group of coefficient values has already been validated in liu et al 1999 s numerical model an identical case will be set up here with same coefficient values to validate the accuracy of porous model calculated by ihfoam 2 d numerical flume x z plane is set here where geometric length is given in fig 7 the porous armor is erected next to the impermeable caisson the relevant parameters of porous armor are porosity n 0 5 d 50 0 05 m empirical coefficients α p 200 β p 1 1 c a 0 34 such coefficient values are also adopted in hsu et al 2002 still water height is 0 28 m regular wave trains propagate from the left boundary to right breakwater each wave period t 1 4 s wave height h 0 105 m for assuring 13 waves arrive at breakwater calculating time is set as 18 2s three wave height gauges locate at x 0 27 m x 3 3 m x 7 025 m respectively suppose left boundary as origin location x 0 the right boundary behind impermeable breakwater is the outlet for overtopping wave gets through the passing flux through this boundary is also measured the mesh size in the whole computational domain is firstly discretized by 500 150 uniform grids for improving the water surface recognition the size of mesh unit near water surface is scaled down minimal one is 1 cm 0 5 cm time step is self adaptable to convergent rate and data output interval is 0 1 s k ε turbulence model is applied in the whole computing area a wave making validation is firstly conducted by comparing two common wave generation ways and analytical solution on wave height on present 2 d numerical flume gauge 1 to simplify the validation wave reflection produced by encountering breakwater has not been taken into account the displacement of surface elevation at gauge 1 fig 8 validates the accuracy of piston type wave generation and static wave generation overall two wave making methods both have satisfied accuracy piston type method has better consistency with analytical results while requiring proper time before generating stable wave on the contrary wave generated by inlet boundary almost agrees with analytical solution in the first wave train indicating this method is more stable two methods all show greater wave height in wave trough which can be explained by the minor nonlinearity of wave given more manageable of inlet wave generation method in ihfoam and little error with analytical solution static wave generation way is finally adopted in this simulation about wave generation wang et al 2019 have done comprehensive works on the secondary development of piston type wave making based on openfoam class libraries the measured time histories of wave height on gauge 2 3 have been compared with both the numerical and experimental results presented in liu et al 1999 for matching the wave phase 1 4 t phase shift of presented results has already been done in fig 9 present results show better agreements with the experiment results in liu s especially the wave height near the porous armor of breakwater fig 9 b where the breaking wave has occurred furthermore the overtopping mass of breakwater under time simulated time is measured at the outlet of overtopping wave fig 10 comparing with liu s results present results have a relative larger overtopping mass considering discrepancies are relatively minor and the results with porous armor still show good agreements in increasing trend with liu s results the validation results is still satisfactory 3 3 2 porous dam break this validation part is more relevant with the simulation next part a porous rectangular zone is installed at the middle area of a 2 d rectangular tank by manually elevating water attitude at one side a break dam with flowing through middle porous media is reached experiment and numerical simulation have been investigated in liu et al 1999 here a validation on this simulation on free surface elevation variance under time is investigated 2 d rectangular tank size is 0 892 m long 0 58 m high porous zone is installed at the centers of tank with 0 29 m long from location 0 30 m 0 59 m and 0 37 m high which separates the tank into two sides an elevated water rectangular zone is 0 28 long and 0 15 m high in the left side 2 cm horizontally away from left side of porous media the based water elevation of tank is 0 025 m porous media consists of glass beads n 0 39 d 50 0 003 m keeping forchheimer empirical coefficients as the same values as last part α p 200 β p 1 1 c a 0 34 uniform mesh system 0 005 m tall 0 0025 m high is used to divide the whole computational region calculating time sets 4 s the free surface elevation of whole tank is taken as comparison in fig 11 while partial discrepancy occurs outside the porous media the free surface inside porous media reaches good agreement 4 implementation of porous model in sloshing after validating a list of problems calculated by ihfoam the porous model adopted in sloshing context will be investigated comprehensively in this part forchheimer empirical coefficients are kept the same as validation part α p 200 β p 1 1 c a 0 34 in particular the porous layer arrangement and the parameters choices thickness ratio w a porosity n average diameter d 50 will be taken into account for model optimization 4 1 study on the arrangement of porous model according to the conclusions in akyildiz and ünal 2005 adopting solid vertical baffle in tank is an efficient way for sloshing dampening especially when baffle erected at the middle of tank bottom therefore to evaluate the dampening effect of adopting porous layer solid vertical baffle erected at the center of tank bottom is also conducted here as a comparison firstly based on the previous 2 d rectangular size in validation part a width d 5 cm height h 3 4 h porous baffle is erected at the center of tank bottom fig 12 the relevant parameters on porous material in this case are consistent with the parameters set in the breakwater validation case i e n 0 5 d 50 0 05 m water depth h and external excitation is the same as the 2 d validation case u a ω cos ω t where ω 5 29 rad s a 0 002 m except for measuring free surface elevation at right tank wall a pressure probe is installed at the right wall vertical distance c from tank bottom is 0 005 m probing pressure values are subtracted by its initial pressure when t 0 s fig 13 the results show significant decreasing in both surface elevation and dynamic pressure with porous baffle although the effect of porous baffle is not comparable with solid baffle nevertheless the adoption of porous baffle has eliminated the pressure jet originally occurred in the unbaffled tank to further diminish the dynamic pressure near the surrounding wall an alternative layout of attaching porous layer to the surrounding wall is proposed to verify the effect of new layout similarly based on the original size of 2 d tank a width w 5 cm porous layer is pasted to the surrounding wall fig 14 porous parameters water depth external excitation is the same as previous one the time histories of dynamic pressure fig 15 b shows further mitigating of pressure fluctuation in comparison with previous porous baffle while the maximum of surface elevation near the wall fig 15 a increases a little the effect of new arrangement is still encouraging for dynamic pressure is the main concern in sloshing 4 2 parameters optimization in this part for the sake of further improving the dampening effect of porous layer in sloshing context a set of parameters optimizations which mainly focus on thickness of porous layer w porosity n and average diameters d 50 will be conducted accordingly before optimization some fundamental relationships among these parameters will be informed to understand these parameters for a typical porous material it usually consists of abundant small gravels or other tiny materials to balance the shape of these compositions a mean diameter d 50 is usually employed for porosity n it is a unique characteristic of porous material which denotes how much the air percent occupies in a porous materials unit therefore porosity value is among 0 1 furthermore these parameters have a relationship when the arrangement mode of compositions is prescribed e g if compressing a think porous layer into a thin one while d 50 is constant usually n and w will shrink however in numerical way it is possible to robustly let w decline while keeping other two parameters as constant which might indicate a different arrangement mode of the materials unity about the question of gravel arrangements will not be discussed here since it is more related to specific application of porous layer 4 2 1 thickness ratio to make the thickness parameter more universal a thickness ratio is w a adopted for optimizing thickness where a is the half of tank horizontal length under the previous scenario of sloshing in 2 d rectangular tank keeping porosity n d 50 as constant 0 5 and 0 05 m derived from breakwater validation case a list of different thickness ratio w a ranging from 0 1 to 1 0 are simulated the results on correspondent time histories of surface height near the wall and dynamic pressure at p are shown in fig 16 and fig 17 considering surface height the increasing thickness of porous layer contributes to the decline of maximum surface height during the sloshing while such a declining trend manifest positive correlation with thickness when w a 0 4 the decreasing trend is not pronounced any more considering dynamic pressure still the increasing thickness contributes to the mitigating of the amplitude of pressure fluctuation it is encouraged to note that the decreasing rate of dynamic fluctuation is not utterly consistent with the increasing of thickness indicating the existence of certain thickness ratio for maximally decreasing the dynamic pressure such value roughly ranges among 0 1 0 4 thus a more detailed simulation about thickness ratio is conducted subsequently as shown in fig 18 among 0 1 0 4 the trend of maximum surface elevation and pressure is consistent with the analysis made previously for maximum surface elevation after w a 0 3 the declining rate turns to slow for dynamic pressure extreme maximum positive negative pressure appears at w a 0 30 0 24 despite a little discrepancy pressure dampening changed little among 0 20 0 30 since it is hard and robust to determine a most satisfactory thickness value for model optimization here it is more reasonable to suggest an optimized thickness ratio w a interval in 0 20 0 30 for decreasing the dynamic pressure on tank wall during sloshing to simplify the optimization next part a specific thickness ratio w a 0 25 among this suggested range is employed for next part 4 2 2 porosity after optimizing thickness ratio w a similarly keeping w a d 50 as 0 25 and 0 05 m different porosity n among 0 1 1 0 are simulated fig 19 it is noted that when porosity n is set as 1 0 the effect of porous layer has been removed also when setting porosity n as 0 1 where the porous among porous layer is rather fine in the extreme situation the porous layer is equal to impermeable layer such porosity setting is impractical and require more iterations for calculating convergence which has not presented here from results fig 19 it is interesting to find that the effect of varied porosity is similar to thickness ratio where the increasing of porosity lead to the decline of maximum surface elevation and there is extreme point for porosity to reach the minimum dynamic pressure in this case maximum positive negative pressure congruously reach the minimum when porosity n 0 51 therefore for the optimization results of porosity porosity ranging among 0 45 0 55 is suggested for pressure dampening porosity n 0 51 is selected for next step optimization 4 2 3 average diameter finally an optimization parameter of average diameters d 50 is conducted a ratio to the thickness of porous layer is taken for illustrating this parameter conveniently i e d 50 w keeping other two parameters as suggested values w a 0 25 n 0 51 a series of simulations are conducted fig 20 from results it is noted that the varied d 50 values both manifest monotonous relationship with maximum surface elevation and dynamic pressure however when d 50 w is smaller than 0 05 in this case this specific d 50 threshold is 0 00625 m the increasing declining rate of the trend is pronounced when d 50 w is greater than 0 05 the declining trend of maximum positive pressure is tiny finally a suggested d 50 w interval is determined as 0 05 0 4 4 2 4 results of optimization in this section by conducting a series sloshing simulation in 2 d rectangular tank equipped with interior porous layer the optimized parameters for porous layer is finally determined as w a among 0 2 0 3 n among 0 45 0 55 recommend n 0 51 when considering optimal pressure dampening d 50 w among 0 05 0 4 implementing optimized parameters w a 0 25 n 0 51 d 50 w 0 2 for porous layers in comparison with unoptimized one and solid baffle fig 21 a fig 21 b the improvement of optimization is pronounced especially the fluctuation amplitude of dynamic pressure red line marked with circles is comparable to solid baffle dashed line 5 dampening analysis after getting the optimized model of porous layer it is also crucial to know how porous material mitigates sloshing therefore three techniques are used in this section on the optimized porous layer optimized parameters are determined as w a 0 25 n 0 51 d 50 w 0 2 during 2 d rectangular tank sloshing 50 filling rate in section 4 rectangular tank under horizontal harmonic motion u b ω cos ω t where ω 5 29 rad s b 0 002 m firstly the wave surface elevation history near the right wall is analyzed by using the fast fourier transform fft technique a frequency domain comparison of no porous layer case and adopting porous layer case are presented in fig 22 the highest peak in two figures is the external excitation converting it into circular frequency i e 5 235 rad s is closed with realistic external excitation value 5 29 rad s except for this peak value 1 667 hz is also the common frequency peak in both figures which denotes a higher order resonant frequency a significant difference is that after adopting porous layer a third peak appears at 0 733 hz this frequency is the resonant frequency of the tank with porous layer which transforms from natural frequency 0 845 hz where in fig 22 a natural frequency has not been filtered out for too closed to external frequency therefore it is reasonable to say that the sloshing dampening of porous layer has relationship with the decline of tank natural resonant frequency 0 88 ω 0 which avoids the frequency of external excitation ω 0 this effect is similar to adopting solid baffle song et al 2012 furthermore a vorticity field during sloshing is investigated fig 23 at selected typical instants of vorticity field the intense vorticity appears at the interface of porous layer near the water surface which consumes the kinematic energy of water particle adjacent to the wall so that restraining the displacement of water surface near the wall however solid baffle usually generates intense vorticity near the end side of baffle according to xue et al 2013 to understand a detailed distribution of pressure near the wall when implementing porous layer a series of pressure probe are set at right wall with varied vertical distance away from tank bottom the results are presented in pressure elevation coupled graph as shown in fig 24 where pressure peak and trough appear successively according to the color contrast it can be reached out that the maximum pressure locates near the still water surface z 0 5 m above z 0 525 m dynamic pressure rapidly disappeared also indicating the maximum value of water surface displacement below z 0 4 m similarly dynamic pressure declines quickly also a tiny phase lag appears at the pressure near the water indicating a buffering function of porous material layer 6 application of porous material layer in 3 d membrane type lng tank in real lng ship a membrane type tank is usually adopted for more volume capacity since previous sloshing is under simple 2 d rectangular tank it is of more practical significance to adopt the optimized porous layer into 3 d membrane type tank for dampening sloshing a scaled down dimension of membrane type tank is presented in fig 25 where the locations of all pressure probes have been identified furthermore according to the arranging way of porous material layer previously the profile of a membrane tank with porous layer is also presented due to the induced sloshing wave in our study mainly slams the lateral tank rather than the bottom side the porous material layer has not covered the bottom wall parameter value are determined from the suggested intervals in the end of section 4 w a 0 2 n 0 51 d 50 w 0 1 it is noted that for membrane type tank the definition of a is obscure here a is taken as the length of membrane type tank the calculation domain is divided into 40 196 132 uniform grids in x y z dimension correspondent filling rate and external excitation will talk in the next part for simulating different sloshing conditions 6 1 1 dimension regular excitation in the view of previous excitation is small amplitude a larger amplitude horizontal harmonic motion y a sin ω t π is applied in this case where amplitude a 0 01 m natural frequency ω is determined by the directions of tank length 2 a as 7 136 rad s considering a large amplitude might cause a sudden jerk at the beginning of sloshing a linear ramping method is also applied ramping time is 5s also concerning the filling rate of tank is contributed to the sloshing five different filling levels are conducted here the results are shown in fig 26 a list of typical instants of the sloshing happening in two type tanks in 0 5 filling levels h b are shown in fig 27 firstly in p1 p3 the maximum dynamic pressure positive and negative all get mitigated in different extents indicating the dampening function of dynamic pressure behave quite well in these sloshing situations secondly in probe 4 the almost zero value of armored tank case demonstrates the inhibition of maximum surface height near the tank wall since probe 4 locates at a higher attitude in tank than other probes see fig 25 thirdly with respect to different filling levels although the largest pressures have not shown in a same filling level in different probes it is still essential to note that an intermediate filling level signifies a more serious sloshing damage like h b 0 5 0 6 overall the performance of porous layer applied into membrane type tank on pressure dampening is promising 6 2 3 dimension irregular excitation in real seaway lng tank is faced with several dimension excitations which are known as surge sway heave roll pitch yaw a figure could help to understand these norms fig 28 since the final motion of tank is determined collectively by wave and ship it is rather complex to illustrate the final tank motion considering simulating more realistic condition of tank motion also simplifying the illustration a three dimension tank motion on y z plane is simulated including sway heave and roll which have been concluded as one of the dominant excitations affecting tank stability in luo et al 2016 the modified pierson moskowits mpm wave spectrum and scaled response amplitude operators rao parameters will be introduced for calculating the irregular excitation 6 2 1 irregular tank motion since real seal wave consists of a series of random regular waves statistically the final wave motion is the results of the sum of all regular wave motion e g a unidimensional irregular tank motion could be described as eq 27 27 η t k 1 n η k cos ω e t θ k where η k ω e k θ k is respectively the amplitude the encounter frequency and phase angle of k th regular wave component θ k is determined as random value between 0 2 π ω e k is the specific ship tank frequency after encountering wave excitation therefore the encounter frequency could be derived from wave frequency and some other parameters which is known as 28 ω e k ω k ω k 2 u 0 cos χ g where ω k is the wave frequency of k th wave component u 0 is the ship speed χ is wave encounter angle also has been identified in fig 28 in view of the situation simulated is at y z plane i e beam sea where cos χ 0 the encounter frequency ω e k is equal to the wave frequency ω k the calculating of η k might be a little complex 29 since different ship designs manifest distinct motion characteristics when encountering wave motion usually a practical method based on the assumption that motion of ship is linear with wave motion is adopted which is known as amplitude response operator rao i e the term r η ζ ω k χ u in 29 the rao is determined by both wave and ship usually numerical simulation could help to calculate kim et al 2008 the rao data in this study is referred from luo et al 2016 which is based on a fully loaded lng ship sailing at the speed of 10 366 m s except for the rao in 29 ω 1 k ω 2 k term bound integrating band which centers at specific wave frequency ω in mathematical way ω 1 k ω 2 k are calculated as ω 1 k ω k δ 1 k ω 2 k ω k δ 2 k δ 1 k ω k ω k 1 2 δ 2 k ω k 1 ω k 2 to simplify the calculating assuming δ 1 k δ 2 k 0 02 s is set for increment furthermore mpm wave spectrum is adopted in for simulating real wave motions equation 30 is the specific formula where significant wave height h 1 3 is 4 m domain wave period t is 4 π s since the main wave frequencies in mpm spectrum cluster among 0 2 rad s the random wave frequencies values are all in this interval 29 η k 2 r η ζ ω k χ u 2 ω 2 k ω 1 k s ω d ω 30 s ω 4 π 3 h 1 3 2 ω 5 t 4 exp 16 π 3 ω 4 t 4 to get a more intense sloshing situations the membrane type tank size is extended 100 times i e the c m unit in fig 25 is replaced by m unit so that the tank natural resonant frequency are among the given irregular wave frequency interval again a ramp of tank motion is adopted in the very beginning of sloshing the final tank motions in three each dimension for 120 s is presented in fig 29 the roll motion is defined as rotating around the center of tank bottom wall reference point for rotation from the conclusion of last part that the intermediate filling level usually leads to higher pressure peak this part sloshing is only conducted in 0 5 filling level tanks additionally irregular excitations of each dimension in 3 freedoms 3dof are also separately conducted to the tank to evaluate the effect of porous layer in each excitation component 6 2 2 sloshing results the time history of dynamic pressure of pressure probe p2 locates closely to still water surface are shown in fig 30 lists of typical instants of the sloshing happening in two tanks are shown in fig 31 firstly the comparisons of two colors fig 30 indicate the dampening function of porous layer when being applied to a real scale of a membrane type tank secondly the pressure fluctuates most intensely in the sway excitation where the pressure dampening effect of porous layer is significant a bunch of pressure jets or slamming phenomena are eliminated in the tank with porous layer red line in sway excitation context although in the pure heave excitation context the tank with porous layer has not performed well during a certain time when a large up and down displacement occurs this phenomenon can be explained by the buffering phenomenon in porous layer in which the liquid in porous layer behave relatively slower than outer liquid under excitation by the squeezing of liquid outside porous layer the pressure in certain point tends to rise rather than decline as we usually think this phenomenon can be also identified in the fourth picture in fig 31 120 s where the liquid in porous layer kept higher attitude than the liquid outsides nevertheless this adverse pressure trend doesn t lead to serious danger in 3dof excitation for its peak value is smaller than the peak in pure sway excitation plus the pure heave motion seldom occurs in real seaway thus the effect of porous layer in the real scale of membrane type tank is good 7 conclusions in this study with the aid of the numerical solver ihfoam a new sloshing dampening way of pasting porous material layer to the interior periphery of the tank was investigated firstly for validating ihfoam four validation scenarios have been conducted respectively focusing on solving convergence 2 d tank sloshing 3 d membrane tank sloshing and porous model the results show good agreements with experimental results in literature secondly in a 2 d rectangular tank the imagine of applying porous layer into tank is put forward comparing with solid vertical baffle with respect to maximum elevation and dynamic pressure amplitude the effect of porous layer model is investigated the results indicate that porous layer has good capacity of dampening sloshing further the porous layer model is optimized by changing three intrinsic parameters thickness ratio w a porosity n and average diameters ratio d 50 w the results show all parameters manifest monotonic effect on maximum elevation but it is interesting to find that there are certain values for w a and n where dynamic pressure declines to minimum therefore a group of values for three parameters are suggested i e w a among 0 2 0 3 n among 0 45 0 55 recommend n 0 51 when considering optimal pressure dampening d 50 w among 0 05 0 4 for the optimized porous layer model to understand the dampening nature of porous material layer fft analysis vorticity fields and pressure elevation coupled graph are conducted the results indicated that porous material layer shift the natural frequency of original tank into a smaller one i e 0 88 ω 0 a violent vortices is generated near the interface of porous layer with outside water near the water surface about the pressure distribution the strongest pressure impact occurs near the water surface elevation of tank wall which also explains why a strong vortices occur in this area finally the porous layer is applied into the 3 d membrane tank where a violent 1 dimensional excitation and a 3 dimension irregular excitation are employed respectively in 1 dimensional violent sloshing case the mitigating effect of porous layer is demonstrated well in different filling levels in 3 dimensional irregular excitation case in which a real scale membrane type tank is chosen the porous layer help to remove the dominant pressure jets occurring in the tank without porous layer therefore from above numerical cases the adopting of porous material layer is verified to be a useful way to dampen liquid

21344,the shipping industry has been facing increasing pressure to reduce environmental emissions for instance starting in 2020 the international maritime organization imo required a reduction of the global sulfur limit for shipping fuels outside designated sulfur emission control areas seca from 3 5 to 0 5 on a mass basis other pollutants are also being targeted for short term and long term reduction aiming at providing sustainable fuel solutions for the stage of tank to propeller this manuscript evaluates various shipping fuel options focusing on quantitatively comparing the fuel consumption and emissions of major air pollutants a bottom up emission inventory model is developed by analyzing and optimizing multiple sources of load factors specific fuel consumption and emission factors rather than taking deterministic emission leading values this work improves the model quality by considering external factors and the latest emission data and processing a detailed ship by ship calculation for the ship database collected by the shipboard automatic identification system ais the amounts of carbon dioxide for the main engine auxiliary engine and auxiliary boilier are firstly calculated and then the fuel consumption per nautical mile are computed by integrating co2 intensity next ship exhaust gases are calculated for two categories i gases impacting the global warming potential gwp and ii the non gwp gases besides sustainable solutions within one specific ship fleet this work firstly establishes a nautical mile based fuel consumption per unit of capacity bin for major merchant ships to serve as a basis for finding an optimized fuel solution among different ship types in addition to addressing the typical ship source pollutants this work also focuses on negative environmental effects resulting from bca because it has not been thoroughly considered in the literatures despite its contribution to gwp to illustrate the value and applicability of the proposed approach a case study is solved to estimate the cumulative fuel consumption and gwp related gas emission inventory for a transoceanic trip from houston to rotterdam the results demonstrate that the gwp gas emissions of heavy fuel oil with scrubber are 38 more than those of one lng dual engine option explicit consideration is also given to bca emissions the results indicate that the blended fuel aimed at satisfying the imo 2020 sulfur cap does not perform well in bca emission control graphical abstract image 1 keywords tank to propeller fuel consumption ship emission inventory

on maritime transportation since more than 90 of the global trade is facilitated by marine transportation international maritime organization 2019 because of the extensive maritime transportation activities there is a substantial impact on air pollution the international maritime organization imo has been working on reducing greenhouse gases ghg emissions and other pollutants such as sulfur oxides nitrogen oxidizes the latest marine environment protection committee mepc regulation annex vi of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ship marpol called 2020 sulfur cap is set to globally reduce the fuel sulfur content on board from 3 5 mass to 0 5 mass outside the emission control areas eca the new ambitious convention brings many challenges and opportunities for each stage of the whole shipping fuel supply chain towards complying with the marpol convention the shipping companies and oil refineries have made various improvements the current standard for shipping fuel is iso 8217 2017 and its latest revision which was published on sep 18 2019 named as iso pas 23263 2019 it defines general requirements and serves to confirm the compliant fuels of iso 8217 2017 with maximum of 0 50 sulfur content and it addresses quality considerations and the range of marine fuels as well a new category very low sulfur fuel oil vlsfo with sulfur content range between 0 1 and 0 5 was introduced to serve as the blended imo fuel oil for non ecas in line with iso 8217 2017 besides the proven imo 2015 eca grade distillate fuel marine gas oil with maximum of 0 1 sulfur content is still an available option for shipowners to comply with the 2020 sulfur cap the high sulfur fuel oil hfso 3 5 maximum sulfur content is considered as an attractive option for shipping industry because of the low fuel price but the hfso driven vessels should be equipped with pollutant reduction devices mostly scrubbers to continue serving for worldwide trade under the current marpol convention as a clean fossil fuel liquefied natural gas lng has been applied to marine transportation for one decade many new vessels adopt this technique to meet the latest imo rule and it is widely accepted as an effective way to comply with the imo s long term environment prevention strategy so far those four fuel solutions are the most common ones for decision makers of the global commercial fleet the increasingly intense greenhouse effects have brought more concerns than ever before motivated by its mission of safe secure clean and sustainable shipping imo has implemented many strategies regulations and rules to reduce greenhouse gases ghg emissions from ships the major greenhouse gases co2 ch4 n2o and o3 have been studied for years to take effective measures to limit their emissions brynolf et al 2014a comer et al 2017 dnv gl 2019a ipcc panel 2014 luo and wang 2017 olmer et al 2017 pavlenko et al 2020 smith et al 2014 the global warming potential gwp was firstly proposed by intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and the 100 year gwp gwp100 was adopted by the nations framework convention on climate change and its kyoto protocol ipcc panel 2014 however black carbon aerosol bca has not been widely considered by the shipping industry and related research among all particulate phase species bca has its uniqueness stable at high temperature strong absorption of solar radiation and insolubility in water alcohol and other liquids amap 2015 it is worth noting that an individual soot particle can be aggregated to form external structures which is subject to forming a mixture of coated particles to reduce the albedo of the surface and to contribute to a continuous warming effect amap 2015 as the dominant form of light absorbing particulate matter in the atmosphere bca emission has been linked with negative influences on earth s climate change especially on the vulnerable arctic region ipcc panel 2014 sharafian et al 2019 one recent study olmer et al 2017 pointed out that bca is the second largest contributor to ship induced gwp emissions larger than ch4 and n2o moreover black carbon is a major contributor to the human heart and lung disease as well bond et al 2013 as a result there is no reason to ignore bca emissions and this paper considers it as a major pollutant for the global warming potential consequence in assessing the environmental impacts of shipping fuels it is necessary to adopt a life cycle assessment lca approach for the whole supply chain of alternative fuels several studies bengtsson 2011 bengtsson et al 2012 brynolf et al 2014b have considered the extraction of raw material fuel production fuel transportation and storage and bunkering as the well to tank stage and ship operation with the produced fuel as the tank to propeller stage an important segment of the lca is the tank to propeller ttp stage which is responsible for the bulk of emissions for carbonaceous fuels and is under the direct control of the shipping industry this manuscript will focus on the ttp segment to provide ship fleet manager a reliable reference to estimate the fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions including both gwp gases and non gwp gases during the cruising mode in non secas by adopting imo 2020 compliant fuel options 2 relevant works accurate determination of shipping fuel emissions is critically important in benchmarking and accomplishing the long term carbon reduction goal to show a more reasonable estimation of the shipping fuel consumption and ship exhaust gas emissions this work thoroughly searched the relevant works on the topic the marine environment protection committee mepc a subcommittee of imo has been working to streamline the process of collecting and calculating fuel combustion data in one of the early studies on estimating emissions from the shipping industry eyring et al 2005 analyzed 11 types of ships and 117 500 engines and divided them into 132 subgroups they estimated total fuel consumption by the following expression 1 f c i 1 132 f c i i 1 132 p i f m c r i τ i s f o c i where p i is the engine power f m c r i is the maximum continuous rated τ i is the engine operation time and s f o c i is the specific fuel oil consumption value following eyring et al s study there have been several research contributions including the two important studies port of long beach emission inventory starcrest consulting group 2014 and imo 3rd ghg study smith et al 2014 which presented similar approaches with minor revision to calculate the shipping fuel consumption another study moreno gutiérrez et al 2015 determined the engine operation time by calculating the result of average speed divided ship navigation distance while considering the ship s sailing process and ignoring the auxiliary boiler emission w stian glomvik rakke 2016 presented a detailed approach to calculating the brake power by introducing total resistance ship speed and sea margin a recent study olmer et al 2017 by the international council on clean transportation icct proposed a new approach to calculate the fuel consumption by dividing carbon dioxide intensity for specific fuel by the total co2 emissions for one ship in a year since most studies established the mechanism models of ship fuel consumption using eq 1 the quality of estimated outputs largely relies on the accuracy of ship engine operation time engine actual delivered power and the specific fuel oil consumption sfoc on the other hand several studies made their contributions using statistical models of ship exhaust gas emission a gaussian process model was proposed yuan and nian 2018 by using seven influencing factors including speed mean draft trim wind speed wind direction wave height and wave direction also a multi linear regression method was proposed uyanik et al 2019 to estimate the main engine fuel rate results from this method indicate high collinearity between variables of the main engine revolutions per minute and shaft power beyond the shipping fuel consumption research contributions have been made in the area of estimating exhaust gas emissions from the ships some previous work evaluated the shipping emission on the basis of geographical characteristics one way is to calculate shipping emission in a specific area then expand the estimation around the world while the other is to estimate the global shipping emission and then assign the specific values to a defined zone recent studies have adopted either the bottom up approaches or top down methods to quantitatively analyze emissions caused by maritime activities the top down approach is a method to calculate the total emissions without considering the vessel characteristics and the estimated values are assigned to the different ships in a specific fleet or area it is an accessible way to evaluate regional emission inventories but the ship data tend to have a large number of uncertainties as a result of ocean going vessels traveling among continents and the fuel oil characteristics and prices cannot be consistent from port to port as well a more realistic approach is the bottom up approach which is based on calculating the emission by a ship in a specific position and the total emissions are estimated by aggregating these estimates over time and the fleet the united states environmental protection agency us epa epa 2000 proposed the theoretical basis for the ship emission calculation as shown in equation 2 2 e m i s s i o n s v c c d w t m o d e e f l f m o d e h p d w t t v c c d w t m o d e where vcc is the vessel class dwt is the deadweight ton ef is the emissions factor lf is the mode specific load factor hp is the horsepower of the engine and t is the running time of engine based on equation 2 several studies eyring et al 2005 kwon et al 2019 moreno gutiérrez et al 2019 rakke 2016 smith et al 2014 starcrest consulting group 2014 wan et al 2019 estimated the shipping emissions with different assumptions and updated information to reduce the uncertainties as a widely accepted way the ship emission calculation usually begins with inputting ship static information including the ship s identification ship name mmsi code imo registry physical properties deadweight ton length overall design speed draught etc and engine properties main engine brake horsepower stroke type rpm installed power of auxiliary engine boiler operation characteristics then a great number of valuable ship dynamic information such as ship s actual speed position engine operation status can be provided by the automatic information system ais onboard combined these two categories of information with ship consumption calculation a specific ship exhaust gas emission can be determined by multiplying the ship energy consumption by the emission factors of different air pollutants accordingly many uncertainties are associated with the bottom up calculations of ship emission firstly ships within different types have many options of marine propulsion among them diesel engines slow speed engine medium speed engine high speed engine gas turbine engine electric motors and lng fueled engines are the typical ones secondly one ship in a whole trip may experience several operation modes cruising mode at sea reduced speed mode in designated areas maneuvering mode for inbound and outbound operation and hoteling mode for in port operation uncertainties underlie all the operation modes particularly during the switch period of two modes as a result of frequent rudder and engine orders ji et al 2017 thirdly ship s exhaust gas sources main engine me and auxiliary engine ae are the major ones for cruising mode while another emission source auxiliary boiler ab should never be neglected when a ship is in maneuvering and hoteling mode epa 2000 goldsworthy and galbally 2011 olmer et al 2017 smith et al 2014 starcrest consulting group 2014 wan et al 2019 lastly but not least ship activities in one trip may involve uncertainties underly ship routes selection operation time and speed in ecas and non ecas loading status in full or ballast and geographical and meteorological conditions many contributions epa 2000 goldsworthy and galbally 2011 jalkanen et al 2009 moreno gutiérrez et al 2019 olmer et al 2017 smith et al 2014 starcrest consulting group 2014 have made to reduce the uncertainties of ship emission in the tank to propeller stage and among them the most effective way is to improve the accuracy of the engine load factor specific fuel oil consumption and emission factor recently the shipping community has become increasingly concerned with the negative impact of black carbon aerosol bca emissions because they contribute to global warming by absorbing solar radiation lu et al 2020 talukdar et al 2019 lack and corbett 2012 pointed out that bca emissions increased at low engine loads and ship speed fuel quality and exhaust gas scrubbing may bring a significant influence on black carbon aerosol emission compared to the common shipping residual fuel oil most low sulfur fuels can be deemed as applicable solutions of bca abatement yet the newly compliant vlsfo tells another story the bca emission tends to have a positive linear relationship with the fuel s aromatic content and one latest study proposed by finland and germany 2019 to the imo advised that the blended vlsfo increased bca emission up to 85 percent due to its high proportion of aromatic compounds under the imo 2020 sulfur cap alternative fuels such as lng low sulfur distillate oil biodiesel and methanol are typical abatement strategies for bca besides the electrostatic precipitators and selective catalytic reduction served as the main exhaust treatment for bca abatement this work is aiming at estimating the fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions during the cruising mode in non secas by adopting imo 2020 compliant fuel options the ships characteristics and machinery data are collected from the llyod s maritime database with the given data of ship capacity draught length between perpendicular main engine type power service speed etc multiple sources are employed to extract the important energy based emission factors and the sfc data collected from two major sources recalculated as carbon dioxide intensity to convert energy based emission factors to fuel based emission factors 3 methodology 3 1 description of methodology as previously mentioned the bottom up approach is more reliable than the top down method since it deals with more uncertainties fig 1 is a flowchart showing the key tasks and collected data in the proposed methodology we have compared all the milestone works of this field and constructed the fuel consumption and shipping emission models by covering more operational uncertainties adverse weather impacts for ship cruising hull fouling effects for shipping fuel consumption and ship draught adjustment adopting the latest ship dimension and machinery data from lloyd s list intelligence and collecting the dynamic data for six major types of merchant ships from shipboard ais in order to provide a close to reality shipping emission data the paper makes a great effort to minimize the deterministic input values and to consider the emission for main engine auxilary engine and auxilary boiler for a large sample ship size 337 in total as the imo 2020 sulfur cap is an ambitious move for global shipping especially for the non ecas the study focuses on the cruising mode at sea and the ship service speed is defined as the speed over ground which is 80 of the normal continuous rating ncr speed six ship types bulk carriers general cargo ships container ships oil tankers lng carriers and lpg tankers are studied in this research since their shares of transportation capacities top other merchant ships among world fleet unctad 2019 in addition this paper considers the four proven shipping fuel solutions hfo with scrubber mgo vlsfo and lng instead of paying attention on the future promising fuel options such as biofuels ammonia and liquid hydrogen there is no doubt that shipbuilding has an evident large scale trend and our focus is the oceangoing vessels so the 2 stroke slow speed engine is our major analysis object for oil fueled main engine while the 4 stroke engine is assumed for the auxiliary engine as for lng fueled ships the common techniques may involve steam turbines gas turbines lean burn spark ignited lbsi engines low pressure injection dual fuel lpdf engines and high pressure injection dual fuel hpdf engines no gas turbine or steam turbine engines are analyzed in this research because they have limited future international shipping applications and are less efficient compared to other lng engines therefore the lpdf and hpdf solutions are adopted for the cruising mode emission calculation when lng is taken as the fuel solution to determine the environmental impacts as a bottom up emission approach this work has completed individual calculations ship by ship using the detailed calculation process shown in fig 1 in general the given parameters displaying in the yellow block cover ship characteristic data energy based emission factors specific fuel consumption sfc data ais information and fleet voyage plan this study firstly preprocesses the collected ship characteristic data from the lloyd s maritime intelligence unit lmiu then the load factors are worked out by integrating ship characteristics and external influential factors such as the hull fouling factor the draught adjusted factor and extreme weather factor the emission factors are compared and validated among ten sources and after the ae and ab power demand is calculated case by case the total co2 emissions per nautical mile by one fuel option can be determined next the fuel consumption is obtained by adopting a converted emission factor which is integrated into the fuel based emission factor with the sfc data then the study proposed a new variable to show the amounts of fuel consumption and gwp related gas emissions per nautical mile for one unit of capacity bin so that every unit of transported merchants can be connected with fuel consumption and co2 equivalent emissions finally the emission outputs of other pollutants nox sox co and pm are finalized by inputting relevant emission factors fleet voyage information and real time data from shipboard ais by introducing a unique allocation unit i e shipping air pollutants per nautical mile per capacity bin the work presents a heuristic approach to reasonably estimate fuel consumption gwp emissions and common non gwp air pollutants instead of adopting deterministic values of load factors this study considered many external factors in the calculation process and the simple linear regression of sfc is avoided by calculating fuel based emission factors also the proposed model firstly compared four proven imo 2020 fuel solutions with consideration of lng dual engines in addition this manuscript integrated black carbon aerosol emission with other three common gwp air pollutants and the auxiliary boiler is not neglected in this study as well lmit provided real time ais data for the defined ship types and routes python 3 0 was adopted in this study to collect and to preprocess the ship characteristic data jmp 15 and stattools 7 6 were applied to process the ship by ship calculations for fuel consumption and marine exhaust gas emissions and they were served to analyze the calculated data and to make regression models for the case study as well 3 2 merchant ship exhaust gas emissions some previous studies used a linear relationship between ship emissions per nautical mile and the total emissions as the shipping speed was presumed as a constant value this assumption is reasonable for the cruising mode especially for the non ecas since it is a common practice to adopt auto pilot mode when the ship is navigating in the stable external environment at the deep sea the paper works on the cruising mode emissions for marine air pollutants when the selected merchant ships are navigating in the non ecas comparing the amount of ship exhaust pollutants emitted by the selected merchant ships when different fuel options are adopted 3 e m p m i j k p m e m c r i j k l f m e i j k e f m e i j k p a e m c r i j k l f a e i j k e f a e i j k p a b e p i j k e f a b i j k v a c t 1 i ship class j fuel option k air

for the main engine auxiliary engine and auxiliary boiler exhaust gases specifically the main engine maximum continuous rating mcr power is obtained by lloyd s database dividing 0 9 since ncr conventionally equals to 85 95 mcr the ae maximum continuous rating power is calculated by using the vessel ratio of auxiliary engines main engines shown in the tables s 7 of supplemental material the ab effective power demand is determined by the ship capacity bins within the specific ship class see tables s 2 of supplemental material 3 3 main engine load factor this study compares the load factor sfc and emission factor for six previous studies and table 1 shows the summary of the major studies one can find that most of the studies took the shipping speed as the key parameter for load factor to simplify the calculation however a more robust is needed to cover uncertainties during the voyage and to deal with different vessel types ages and engines with different leading factors as shown in table 1 the main engine load factor tends to be greater than the actual value since seldom of them considered the safety margin and navigation environment impacts referred from the icct report olmer et al 2017 this study substituted the transient speed with an adjusted ship speed and the negative effects of hull roughness weather adjusted factors and draught coefficient are added in the load factor equation see equation 4 4 l f v a c t v m c r 3 h f f i w a c d a f i where vact is the actual ship speed which equals to the speed over ground multiplying the speed adjusted speed vmcr is the speed when me is in maximum continuous rating mode which is assumed as 1 064 times the normal continuous rating speed because the cruise speeds proposed by lloyd s data are 94 of the maximum speed moreno gutiérrez et al 2015 hff is the hull fouling factor which is determined by the ship age length between perpendiculars and the coefficient of marine biofouling wac weather adjustment coefficient and daf draught adjustment factor see supplemental document for details 3 4 ship fuel emission factor a key element to reflect the actual emissions from theoretical calculations is to adopt the accurate emission factor overall an emission factor is a coefficient which allows to transforming activity data into air polluter emissions as a critical parameter for the typical fuel converter emission factor has been analyzed for many decades ipcc has an emission factor database ipcc efdb ipcc 2019 the eu has the emep eea database emission factors emep eea 2019 and the usa epa has ap 42 a compilation of emission factors while in australia there are some npi emission factors within the emissions estimation handbooks npi 2017 besides these open access data sources many works have specified emission factor estimation in the maritime sector the imo has published three emission studies on shipping fuel options and the emission factors for each fuel have been keeping updating as they have great ambitions to build a low carbon and sulfur ecofriendly shipping environment besides the international council on clean transportation icct pays plenty of attention to emission control in both aviation and marine transportation and their emission factor data for me ae and ab have been adopted by many scholars to avoid confusion when comparing fuels the fuel solutions which meet the 0 50 sulfur limit under marpol annex vi in this research are defined as below mgo distillate marine dm fuels specified in iso 8217 2017 i e dma are defined with maximum of 0 1 sulfur content hfo residual marine rm fuels are as specified as rmd 80 in iso 8217 2017 with max 2 5 sulfur content in this study very low sulfur fuel oil vlsfo rm are as specified in iso 8217 2017 i e maximum 0 50 vlsfo rm lng has been deemed as the clean fossil fuel and a great number of maritime applications have proven it as an ideal alternative for traditional shipping fuels dnv gl 2019b the typical characteristics of the three oil based fuels can be found in tables s 6 in the supplemental materials although some other fuel options such as liquefied hydrogen ammonia methanol and biodiesel have a potential future for marine transportation the above mentioned four fuels are currently useable and their merits and disadvantages are listed in table 2 as shown in tables s 1 of the supplemental document the selected ships are mega ocean going vessels thus the two stroke ssd the engine is main focus for diesel based main engines table 3 listed the emission factors of currently compliant fuel options emission factor for hfo with the maximum sulfur content of 2 5 for slow speed diesel engine which is served as a benchmark for the major option for the prior imo 2020 shipping fuel is collected from the icct study olmer et al 2017 as a widely applied retrofit option to meet the 2020 sulfur cap an open loop scrubber is adopted in the study so no addition of alkali is needed the scrubber is modeled to reduce the emissions of so2 from hfo with 2 percent sulfur content to the same levels as the so2 emissions from a fuel within 0 5 percent of sulfur content and the reduction required by the scrubber unit is thus 95 percent the fuel consumption increases with a scrubber van der linde 2009 and a 2 percent increase is assumed in this study the scrubber unit is modeled to remove 50 percent of the particulate matters as the open loop scrubber for reducing black carbon aerosol ranging from 25 to 70 a 40 percentage reduction of bca is assumed in this study moreover emission factors for hfo with scrubber include a 2 percent energy consumption penalty as well as for vlsfo bca emission factor is assumed to be 35 percent more than that of hfo since a recent study finland 2019 criticized vlsfo even increased the bca emission by 10 85 comparing with high sulfur fuel oils making the newly blended fuel limited acceptable for the arctic transportation see tables s 10 in the supplemental material for bca fuel based emission factors moreover emission factors for co2 ch4 and n2o of hfo with scrubber vlsfo mgo lpdf and hpdf are calculated from the greet model anl 2016 and the icct latest report pavlenko et al 2020 while the sox nox pm and co are collected from the icct study olmer et al 2017 for lng fueled options the lng lpdf and hpdf are the main engine types while lpdf is mostly applied for lng carriers and large scale container ship and hpdf another slow speed two stroke engine is a proven solution for bulk carriers general cargo ships and gas tankers furthermore the lpdf engine has a medium speed version which will not be discussed in this study because it usually serves as the main power for cruising ships passenger ferries and offshore support vessels emission factors of co2 ch4 and n2o for the dual engines are collected from the latest study pavlenko et al 2020 and the emission factors of sox nox pm and co for dual engine are collected from two studies kristensen 2015 man b man 2012 3 5 fuel consumption per unit of capacity bin fuel consumption is determined by many variables which can be categorized as engine attributes engine type load maintenance state and fuel types rm dm lng etc to mathematically determine the fuel consumption it is necessary to convert the energy based emission factors of marine fuel options to fuel based emission factors by introducing the sfc specifically the amounts of co2 emission combusting from marine fuels are called co2 intensity of the fuel which is listed in table 4 this study covers the shipping fuel emissions by all the emission sources on board and the fuel consumption is calculated by co2 emissions of me ae and ab then the calculated fuel consumption is adopted to compute the fuel consumption per unit of capacity bin on a distance basis to compare the energy consumption of each ship class the calculation process is taken on a ship by ship basis for our collected ship database and the eqn 5 is listed below 5 f c c b i j c b t i c l a s s j f u e l e m c o 2 m e i j c b t e m c o 2 a e i j c b t e m c o 2 a b i j c b t c o 2 i n t e n s i t y c a p a

2 a b i j c b t amount of co2 emission per unit of capacity bin per nautical mile emitted by auxiliary boiler since many variances lie on the sample size ship capacity bins and ship main power systems the cumulative fuel consumption and emissions are hard to find the most sustainable fuel options thereafter the capacity bin is introduced among all the six ship classes to calculate the fuel consumption and gwp co2 equivalent emissions per nautical mile per unit of capacity bin 3 6 global warming potential related gas emission calculation this paper adopted the ipcc fifth report gwp100 values for co2 ch4 and n2o and the bca gwp100 was referred from bond s study bond et al 2013 the below equation shows the way to calculate the fleet s total emission of ghgs by considering the

timeline of imo s initial ghg strategy up to 20 reduction in the carbon intensity of international shipping needs to be accomplished this year the gwp related ship exhaust gases are determined as co2 ch4 n2o and bca in this paper although other substances like cf4 and hfc 152a were also deemed as air pollutants for gwp this research does not consider these non combustion emissions such as refrigerants and halogenated hydrocarbons due to the wide variations of the emissions factors of non combustion sources and little significance to overall shipping ghg emissions and the non gwp gas emission estimations follow the typical way to integrate emission factors of sox nox pm and co with the calculated fuel consumption 4 results and discussion fig 2 shows the fuel consumption and shipping exhaust gas emissions contributing to global warming potential for the six ship types and five designated fuel options under imo 2020 sulfur cap in general the total values of fuel consumption per nautical mile for container ships surpass those of the other five ship classes while the gwp related gas emissions show the same trend as well focusing on emission amounts only co2 emissions consistently account for more than 90 among the four gwp related gases and for the two common abatement option hfo with scrubber and vlsfo the bca is the second pollutant then ch4 and n2o while for lng based fuel options lpdf and hpdf the emission sequence after co2 is ch4 n2o and bca as for the shipping emission sources the air pollutants emitted by the main engine are ten times more than those emitted by auxiliary engine and auxiliary boiler also the cruise power demand of boilers for bulk carriers container ships and general cargo ships are assumed zero in this study based on the ship maneuvering experiences next one conclusion can be made that the lng based fuels have great emission controls on co2 n2o and bca and the amounts of bca emissions only account for 1 5 of hfo with scrubber and vlsfo based on our calculation see tables s 9 in the supplemental information for detail however the only issue for lng fueled ship is the ch4 emission which is around 20 times more than that of oil based fuel options and mgo vlsfo present an obvious strength on methane emission control while hpdf beats lpdf within the lng based fuel options specifically the data for bulk carrier indicates that hfo with scrubber emits the most amounts of co2 ch4 and n2o among the three oil based fuels while the vlsfo emits the most bca compared to hfo with scrubber option the lpdf and hpdf can reduce co2 emissions by 28 and 36 respectively and the emissions of n2o are dropped by 61 and 64 as well as for general cargo ships the shipping pollutants emitted by the auxiliary engine have a remarkable rise than other ship classes that is because most general cargo ships require more power from ae causing the ratio of ae me much higher than other ships although the methane emissions from fig 2 indicate a sharp rise for lpdf and hpdf it does not conclude that those two are not eco friendly options as the gwp is calculated depending on the four pollutant emissions and co2 emissions may make a great difference on the other hand the cumulative results between lng tankers and lpg tankers change dramatically mainly because of the larger ship size of lng tankers besides the gwp related gas emissions other pollutants resulting from the ship activities should be considered as well this study compared the nautical mile based emissions of co pm nox and sox for five fuel options among six merchant ships and the calculated mean emission values with 5 confidence interval are shown in fig 3 the amounts of nox emission dominate the selected pollutants and the lng fueled engines display a less nox emission than that of oil fueled engines as for pm the most amount of emission occurs when hfo with scrubber is chosen and still lpdf and hpdf emits less pm than oil based fuels speaking to sox emission vlsfo and hfo with scrubber top other options but co emissions tell another story the hpdf option shows the worst co emission therefore one conclusion can be made that the lpdf is the best shipping fuel option based on the cumulative emission results of co pm nox and sox to compare the fuel consumption and co2 equivalent emission between different ship classes the nautical mile based fuel consumption co2 equivalent emission per capacity bin was brought to categorize six ship types into three groups figs 4 6 presents the relationship between co2 equivalent emissions per nautical mile per unit of capacity bin for six ship types and the values of dwt ltc and teu respectively and the corresponding fuel consumption are shown in fig s 1 and fig s 2 in the supplemental information overall all unit emission values display a decreasing trend as the capacity bin increases suggesting larger size ships exhibit better environmental performance specifically bulk carrier as shown in fig 4a outperforms general cargo ship fig 4b on exhaust gas emissions there is no clear pattern for general cargo ships with less than 15 000 dwt capacity but the unit emission drops along with the increment of capacity bins when the dwt value grows over 15 000 moreover lng based options are more eco friendly than oil based options on either bulk carrier or general cargo ship liquid tank capacity is set as the capacity bin unit for the three tankers in this study fig 5 illustrates the most sustainable option is the oil tanker as a result of its overall large ship scale in general the oil based fuels do not perform as well as the two lng fueled engines and hpdf shows a better performance than lpdf on co2 equivalent emissions among these three tankers furthermore the difference between oil based engines and lng based engines is tremendous when the ship size is small based on our calculated outputs lng tankers with ltc of 30 000 cubic meters presents the most unit co2 equivalent emission indicating the investment of lng tanker in this scale may not be a wise choice when ltc grows to 150 000 ltc the value is dropped below 0 004 kg n m ltc and there is no big difference when the ltc locates in the range of 150 000 and 180 000 except for two abnormal ship types with their ltc of 173 400 the unit emission value for lpg tanker shown in fig 5b plunges to 0 005kg n m ltc when the x axis value exceeds 23000 cubic meters but there are two exceptional data points i e ltc 36 000 and ltc 38 000 for oil tankers the co2 equivalent unit emission is below 0 004 kg n m ltc at the time when ltc surpasses 180 000 cubic meters or stays in the range between 100 000 and 130 000 therefore the recommended tanker sizes from the perspective of co2 equivalent emission savings are as follows lng tanker with liquid tank capacity larger than 150 000 cubic meters lpg tanker with ltc greater than 23 000 oil tanker whose ltc in the range between 100 thousand and 130 thousand and greater than 180 thousand cubic meters the capacity bin of container ships is unique among all the six merchant ships and the unit of the fuel consumption which is the y axis in fig 6a is kilogram fuel per teu per nautical mile 0 04 kg fuel per teu every nautical mile is achieved when the shipping capacity surpasses 5000 teu the lowest value of fuel consumption occurs when the teu is 18 982 of which the values of mgo vlsfo lpdf and hpdf are 87 5 91 4 83 9 and 84 4 respectively as much as that of hfo with scrubber as for fig 6b the capacity unit co2 equivalent emission goes below 0 1 kg n m teu once the capacity bin reaches 5000 teu at that point when taking hfo with scrubber as a benchmark the mgo emission can be saved by 13 6 while the unit emission saving for vlsfo lpdf and hpdf are 5 8 31 1 and 38 4 respectively thus the small size container ship whose teu is less than 5 000 is not a recommended choice when considering the fuel cost and gwp gas emission next the bca emissions for our database were calculated based on the unit of capacity bin for every nautical mile fig 7 shows the bca emissions for two capacity bin groups one can conclude that the two lng fuel options can reduce bca emissions into a neglectable level specifically for dwt basis fleets shown in fig 7a general cargo ship may emit around 2 5 times more black carbons than bulk carriers while the bca emission can be saved up to 94 times by replacing oil based fuels with lng fuel options as for the ltc basis shown in fig 7b the best bca emission control tanker is lng tankers it emits 65 less black carbons than lpg tankers meanwhile oil tankers only emit 7 more than lng tankers when employing same fuel options for container ships suppose the benchmark choice is hfo with scrubber by substituting it with other options the bca emissions decreased 82 for mgo 98 for lpdf and hpdf however the vlsfo emits 25 more black carbons than the benchmark fuel option to sum up ghg emissions follow the rank of hfo with scrubber vlsfo mgo lpdf hpdf while the order for non ghg emissions is hfo with scrubber vlsfo mgo hpdf lpdf specifically the two lng options outperform the three oil options on emissions of non gwp emissions except for the ch4 emission which is reasonable because of the concern of methane slip and co emission for hpdf is as well interior than others on the other hand the between group calculated results confirmed the large size ships of our database tend to have a good performance on fuel saving and gwp gas emission control in detail bulk carriers generally have lower values of the gwp gas emissions per dwt than general cargo ships the three tankers which share the liquid tank capacity as the capacity bin have little difference on emission control for large size tankers but lpg tankers have better co2 equivalent emission records for medium size tankers ranging from 20 000 to 100 000 cubic meters set teu as a unique capacity bin unit container ships emit more air pollutants per unit than other ship types which is attributed to its fast serving speed and large transport capability per teu for black carbon emissions vlsfo serving as a newly blended imo 2020 compliant option is surprisingly to emit the largest amount of bca among all the fuel options while hpdf and lpdf have overwhelming performance in bca emission control over the two residual oil options 60 to 100 times bca emissions will be saved by taking lng fuel options rather than hfo and vlsfo based on our calculations the recommended ship types when considering bca emission are bulk carriers and lng tankers respectively for the dwt group and the ltc group 5 case study the proposed mathematical models for fuel consumption and gwp gas emissions are employed on a specific case for trans ocean cruising from houston located in the north america eca to rotterdam located in north sea seca from oct 1 2019 to oct 31 2019 aiming to find an optimized fuel option by minimizing the fuel consumption and environmental impacts based on the ais collected data there were 234 ships navigating from houston to rotterdam during oct 1 2019 to oct 31 2019 the total distance of this voyage is 5089 nautical miles of which 3615 nm for non eca cruising collected data from lloyd s database the dwt of six major merchant ships accounts for 90 of all the listed vessels as shown in the outer circle of the below figure and the inner circle of fig 9 represents the vessel numbers of each ship type next this study will focus on calculating the total fuel consumption and ship exhaust gas emissions for the cruising mode of the six merchant ship class in the non eca areas shown as the red line in the fig 8 based on the model previously proposed as dwt is the unit of capacity bin for bulk carrier and general cargo ship the relationship between dwt and the capacity bin units of the container ships and the three tankers should be found to proceed with the fuel consumption this study adopted the regression model proposed by to calculate teu from dwt abramowski et al 2018 in the meanwhile a fit regression model was built by the liquid tank capacity and dwt for lng lpg and oil tankers see fig s 3 of the supplemental information from the perspective of fuel consumption the least energy saving solution for each ship class is always the hfo with scrubber shown in fig 10 particularly for bulk carriers other options can save up to 39 fuel by discarding this scrubber solution the container ships take the most value of fuel consumption ranging from 81 936 to 97 768 tons since they contribute the most transported dwt and their design speed is much higher than that of other options on the other side lng carriers and lpg tankers share the least fuel consumption as there were 6 lng tankers and 5 lpg tankers navigating from us eca to north sea seca at that time leading no evident difference between the lng fueled engines and oil fueled engines by considering the operating expense only the lng based fuel options lpdf and hpdf are the best strategy because of the least amount of fuel consumption and the lowest energy price of lng when using the emission model to calculate the gwp related exhaust gas emissions it can be deduced that the hfo with scrubber is the option with the highest amounts of co2 equivalent emissions so it is set as the benchmark to show the emission reduction of other four fuel options see fig 11 hpdf as the most effective fuel option for emission abatement is able to reduce the emission of co2 equivalent by around 36 39 for the six ship types taken bulk carrier as an instance the gwp related gases emissions for hfo with scrubber is 39 502 tons while that of hpdf is 24 433 tons furthermore the vlsfo option does not show much difference as the benchmark solution the percentage of reduced co2 equivalent ranges from 4 to 7 as for the most co2 equivalent ship class the container ship emits around 237 278 tons of gwp related gases when hfo with scrubber is taken for cruising in the non eca of this study and when the mgo is adopted 205 235 tons of co2 equivalent will be exhausted while for vlsfo lpdf and hpdf are 223 640 163 696 146 312 tons respectively suppose the first scenario employs hfo with scrubber for the six merchant ships the total co2 equivalent emission may surge to 340 344 tons for the whole non eca cruising voyage alternatively the number may reduce to 209 990 tons when all the merchant ships employ hpdf engines as the most eco friendly scenario 38 gwp related gases may be dropped compared to the first scenario see fig 12 it is widely recognized that the newly blended marine fuel option vlsfo is a compliant solution with high cost performance ratio under imo 2020 sulfur cap more and more liquefied gas tankers either newly building orders or existed ones tend to install or retrofit lng fueled engines to meet the long term marine environmental requirements of imo as a result this case study defined a most practical fuel scenario which assumed vlsfo as the major option for bulker carriers general cargo ships container ships and oil tankers in the meanwhile the lng hpdf engines were assumed to be installed on the lng and lpg carriers then the total amount of co2 equivalent emission for the case is 3 077 411 tons with the 37 232 tons contributed by bulk carriers 16718 tons by general cargo ships 223 640 tons by container ships 5158 tons by lng carriers 4067 tons by lpg carriers and 20 596 tons by oil tankers 6 conclusions towards enhancing the sustainable development of the shipping industry fuel economy and safety concerns are among the most important factors to create future roadmaps for the operation and the growth of the global ship fleets focusing on optimizing calculations of shipping fuel consumption and ship exhaust gas emissions this study provides a holistic bottom up methodology by integrating and evolving several approaches to reduce the uncertainties to our knowledge this manuscript is the first work to cover both the newly blended fuel and the bca emission impacts and the fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions from 337 ships within six major merchant ship types have been calculated and analyzed to find the most sustainable solutions by in group comparison and between group comparison in general the calculated values from the mathematical model confirmed that the large size ships are preferred from the perspective of maritime sustainability and the two lng fuel options displayed great potential for fuel savings and reductions in the emissions of co2 n2o and bca although ch4 emission may be an issue for lng fueled ships their overall gwp gas emissions were better than other options as for the sustainable preferred ship fleet bulk carriers outperformed general cargo ships on both nautical mile based fuel consumption and co2 equivalent emissions per unit of dwt while for the unit of liquid tank capacity there is little difference in ghg emissions among lng tanker lpg tanker and oil tanker when the liquid tank size surpasses 100 thousand cubic meters the recommended tanker size is lng tanker with ltc larger than 150 000 cubic meters lpg tanker greater than 23 000 and oil tanker whose ltc in the range between 100 000 and 130 000 and greater than 180 000 m3 among all the proven fuel options under imo 2020 sulfur cap the hfo with scrubber is the least favorable for both gwp and non gwp gases while the lng fueled engines lpdf and hpdf are recommended to meet the green shipping requirement hpdf took a slight lead for gwp related gas emission control whereas lpdf offers superior emission control for co pm nox and sox the case study confirmed 36 39 co2 equivalent emissions were reduced by replacing hfo with scrubber option with hpdf as a second dominated gwp gas following co2 bca emission follows the rank vlsfo hfo with scrubber mgo hpdf lpdf from high to low because of bca s high emission rate vlsfo fails to show great improvement on gwp gas emission control compared to hfo with scrubber meanwhile the two lng based fuel options show the least global warming potential benefiting from lower bca and co2 emissions based on this work there are three main recommendations for future research the first recommendation is to apply the approach developed in this work for ship navigation in the reduced speed zones and ship maneuvering in the harbor areas another recommendation is tantamount to employ machine learning or deep learning techniques to integrate the safety characteristics of these fuel options with calculated emissions data finally since methanol hydrogen and ammonia may soon enter into the shipping fuel market it will be beneficial to carry out a study similar to this work to optimize fuel efficiency and to limit air pollutant emission from the tank to propeller stage for these promising fuel options credit authorship contribution statement chenxi ji proposed the approach

21344,the shipping industry has been facing increasing pressure to reduce environmental emissions for instance starting in 2020 the international maritime organization imo required a reduction of the global sulfur limit for shipping fuels outside designated sulfur emission control areas seca from 3 5 to 0 5 on a mass basis other pollutants are also being targeted for short term and long term reduction aiming at providing sustainable fuel solutions for the stage of tank to propeller this manuscript evaluates various shipping fuel options focusing on quantitatively comparing the fuel consumption and emissions of major air pollutants a bottom up emission inventory model is developed by analyzing and optimizing multiple sources of load factors specific fuel consumption and emission factors rather than taking deterministic emission leading values this work improves the model quality by considering external factors and the latest emission data and processing a detailed ship by ship calculation for the ship database collected by the shipboard automatic identification system ais the amounts of carbon dioxide for the main engine auxiliary engine and auxiliary boilier are firstly calculated and then the fuel consumption per nautical mile are computed by integrating co2 intensity next ship exhaust gases are calculated for two categories i gases impacting the global warming potential gwp and ii the non gwp gases besides sustainable solutions within one specific ship fleet this work firstly establishes a nautical mile based fuel consumption per unit of capacity bin for major merchant ships to serve as a basis for finding an optimized fuel solution among different ship types in addition to addressing the typical ship source pollutants this work also focuses on negative environmental effects resulting from bca because it has not been thoroughly considered in the literatures despite its contribution to gwp to illustrate the value and applicability of the proposed approach a case study is solved to estimate the cumulative fuel consumption and gwp related gas emission inventory for a transoceanic trip from houston to rotterdam the results demonstrate that the gwp gas emissions of heavy fuel oil with scrubber are 38 more than those of one lng dual engine option explicit consideration is also given to bca emissions the results indicate that the

on maritime transportation since more than 90 of the global trade is facilitated by marine transportation international maritime organization 2019 because of the extensive maritime transportation activities there is a substantial impact on air pollution the international maritime organization imo has been working on reducing greenhouse gases ghg emissions and other pollutants such as sulfur oxides nitrogen oxidizes the latest marine environment protection committee mepc regulation annex vi of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ship marpol called 2020 sulfur cap is set to globally reduce the fuel sulfur content on board from 3 5 mass to 0 5 mass outside the emission control areas eca the new ambitious convention brings many challenges and opportunities for each stage of the whole shipping fuel supply chain towards complying with the marpol convention the shipping companies and oil refineries have made various improvements the current standard for shipping fuel is iso 8217 2017 and its latest revision which was published on sep 18 2019 named as iso pas 23263 2019 it defines general requirements and serves to confirm the compliant fuels of iso 8217 2017 with maximum of 0 50 sulfur content and it addresses quality considerations and the range of marine fuels as well a new category very low sulfur fuel oil vlsfo with sulfur content range between 0 1 and 0 5 was introduced to serve as the blended imo fuel oil for non ecas in line with iso 8217 2017 besides the proven imo 2015 eca grade distillate fuel marine gas oil with maximum of 0 1 sulfur content is still an available option for shipowners to comply with the 2020 sulfur cap the high sulfur fuel oil hfso 3 5 maximum sulfur content is considered as an attractive option for shipping industry because of the low fuel price but the hfso driven vessels should be equipped with pollutant reduction devices mostly scrubbers to continue serving for worldwide trade under the current marpol convention as a clean fossil fuel liquefied natural gas lng has been applied to marine transportation for one decade many new vessels adopt this technique to meet the latest imo rule and it is widely accepted as an effective way to comply with the imo s long term environment prevention strategy so far those four fuel solutions are the most common ones for decision makers of the global commercial fleet the increasingly intense greenhouse effects have brought more concerns than ever before motivated by its mission of safe secure clean and sustainable shipping imo has implemented many strategies regulations and rules to reduce greenhouse gases ghg emissions from ships the major greenhouse gases co2 ch4 n2o and o3 have been studied for years to take effective measures to limit their emissions brynolf et al 2014a comer et al 2017 dnv gl 2019a ipcc panel 2014 luo and wang 2017 olmer et al 2017 pavlenko et al 2020 smith et al 2014 the global warming potential gwp was firstly proposed by intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and the 100 year gwp gwp100 was adopted by the nations framework convention on climate change and its kyoto protocol ipcc panel 2014 however black carbon aerosol bca has not been widely considered by the shipping industry and related research among all particulate phase species bca has its uniqueness stable at high temperature strong absorption of solar radiation and insolubility in water alcohol and other liquids amap 2015 it is worth noting that an individual soot particle can be aggregated to form external structures which is subject to forming a mixture of coated particles to reduce the albedo of the surface and to contribute to a continuous warming effect amap 2015 as the dominant form of light absorbing particulate matter in the atmosphere bca emission has been linked with negative influences on earth s climate change especially on the vulnerable arctic region ipcc panel 2014 sharafian et al 2019 one recent study olmer et al 2017 pointed out that bca is the second largest contributor to ship induced gwp emissions larger than ch4 and n2o moreover black carbon is a major contributor to the human heart and lung disease as well bond et al 2013 as a result there is no reason to ignore bca emissions and this paper considers it as a major pollutant for the global warming potential consequence in assessing the environmental impacts of shipping fuels it is necessary to adopt a life cycle assessment lca approach for the whole supply chain of alternative fuels several studies bengtsson 2011 bengtsson et al 2012 brynolf et al 2014b have considered the extraction of raw material fuel production fuel transportation and storage and bunkering as the well to tank stage and ship operation with the produced fuel as the tank to propeller stage an important segment of the lca is the tank to propeller ttp stage which is responsible for the bulk of emissions for carbonaceous fuels and is under the direct control of the shipping industry this manuscript will focus on the ttp segment to provide ship fleet manager a reliable reference to estimate the fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions including both gwp gases and non gwp gases during the cruising mode in non secas by adopting imo 2020 compliant fuel options 2 relevant works accurate determination of shipping fuel emissions is critically important in benchmarking and accomplishing the long term carbon reduction goal to show a more reasonable estimation of the shipping fuel consumption and ship exhaust gas emissions this work thoroughly searched the relevant works on the topic the marine environment protection committee mepc a subcommittee of imo has been working to streamline the process of collecting and calculating fuel combustion data in one of the early studies on estimating emissions from the shipping industry eyring et al 2005 analyzed 11 types of ships and 117 500 engines and divided them into 132 subgroups they estimated total fuel consumption by the following expression 1 f c i 1 132 f c i i 1 132 p i f m c r i τ i s f o c i where p i is the engine power f m c r i is the maximum continuous rated τ i is the engine operation time and s f o c i is the specific fuel oil consumption value following eyring et al s study there have been several research contributions including the two important studies port of long beach emission inventory starcrest consulting group 2014 and imo 3rd ghg study smith et al 2014 which presented similar approaches with minor revision to calculate the shipping fuel consumption another study moreno gutiérrez et al 2015 determined the engine operation time by calculating the result of average speed divided ship navigation distance while considering the ship s sailing process and ignoring the auxiliary boiler emission w stian glomvik rakke 2016 presented a detailed approach to calculating the brake power by introducing total resistance ship speed and sea margin a recent study olmer et al 2017 by the international council on clean transportation icct proposed a new approach to calculate the fuel consumption by dividing carbon dioxide intensity for specific fuel by the total co2 emissions for one ship in a year since most studies established the mechanism models of ship fuel consumption using eq 1 the quality of estimated outputs largely relies on the accuracy of ship engine operation time engine actual delivered power and the specific fuel oil consumption sfoc on the other hand several studies made their contributions using statistical models of ship exhaust gas emission a gaussian process model was proposed yuan and nian 2018 by using seven influencing factors including speed mean draft trim wind speed wind direction wave height and wave direction also a multi linear regression method was proposed uyanik et al 2019 to estimate the main engine fuel rate results from this method indicate high collinearity between variables of the main engine revolutions per minute and shaft power beyond the shipping fuel consumption research contributions have been made in the area of estimating exhaust gas emissions from the ships some previous work evaluated the shipping emission on the basis of geographical characteristics one way is to calculate shipping emission in a specific area then expand the estimation around the world while the other is to estimate the global shipping emission and then assign the specific values to a defined zone recent studies have adopted either the bottom up approaches or top down methods to quantitatively analyze emissions caused by maritime activities the top down approach is a method to calculate the total emissions without considering the vessel characteristics and the estimated values are assigned to the different ships in a specific fleet or area it is an accessible way to evaluate regional emission inventories but the ship data tend to have a large number of uncertainties as a result of ocean going vessels traveling among continents and the fuel oil characteristics and prices cannot be consistent from port to port as well a more realistic approach is the bottom up approach which is based on calculating the emission by a ship in a specific position and the total emissions are estimated by aggregating these estimates over time and the fleet the united states environmental protection agency us epa epa 2000 proposed the theoretical basis for the ship emission calculation as shown in equation 2 2 e m i s s i o n s v c c d w t m o d e e f l f m o d e h p d w t t v c c d w t m o d e where vcc is the vessel class dwt is the deadweight ton ef is the emissions factor lf is the mode specific load factor hp is the horsepower of the engine and t is the running time of engine based on equation 2 several studies eyring et al 2005 kwon et al 2019 moreno gutiérrez et al 2019 rakke 2016 smith et al 2014 starcrest consulting group 2014 wan et al 2019 estimated the shipping emissions with different assumptions and updated information to reduce the uncertainties as a widely accepted way the ship emission calculation usually begins with inputting ship static information including the ship s identification ship name mmsi code imo registry physical properties deadweight ton length overall design speed draught etc and engine properties main engine brake horsepower stroke type rpm installed power of auxiliary engine boiler operation characteristics then a great number of valuable ship dynamic information such as ship s actual speed position engine operation status can be provided by the automatic information system ais onboard combined these two categories of information with ship consumption calculation a specific ship exhaust gas emission can be determined by multiplying the ship energy consumption by the emission factors of different air pollutants accordingly many uncertainties are associated with the bottom up calculations of ship emission firstly ships within different types have many options of marine propulsion among them diesel engines slow speed engine medium speed engine high speed engine gas turbine engine electric motors and lng fueled engines are the typical ones secondly one ship in a whole trip may experience several operation modes cruising mode at sea reduced speed mode in designated areas maneuvering mode for inbound and outbound operation and hoteling mode for in port operation uncertainties underlie all the operation modes particularly during the switch period of two modes as a result of frequent rudder and engine orders ji et al 2017 thirdly ship s exhaust gas sources main engine me and auxiliary engine ae are the major ones for cruising mode while another emission source auxiliary boiler ab should never be neglected when a ship is in maneuvering and hoteling mode epa 2000 goldsworthy and galbally 2011 olmer et al 2017 smith et al 2014 starcrest consulting group 2014 wan et al 2019 lastly but not least ship activities in one trip may involve uncertainties underly ship routes selection operation time and speed in ecas and non ecas loading status in full or ballast and geographical and meteorological conditions many contributions epa 2000 goldsworthy and galbally 2011 jalkanen et al 2009 moreno gutiérrez et al 2019 olmer et al 2017 smith et al 2014 starcrest consulting group 2014 have made to reduce the uncertainties of ship emission in the tank to propeller stage and among them the most effective way is to improve the accuracy of the engine load factor specific fuel oil consumption and emission factor recently the shipping community has become increasingly concerned with the negative impact of black carbon aerosol bca emissions because they contribute to global warming by absorbing solar radiation lu et al 2020 talukdar et al 2019 lack and corbett 2012 pointed out that bca emissions increased at low engine loads and ship speed fuel quality and exhaust gas scrubbing may bring a significant influence on black carbon aerosol emission compared to the common shipping residual fuel oil most low sulfur fuels can be deemed as applicable solutions of bca abatement yet the newly compliant vlsfo tells another story the bca emission tends to have a positive linear relationship with the fuel s aromatic content and one latest study proposed by finland and germany 2019 to the imo advised that the blended vlsfo increased bca emission up to 85 percent due to its high proportion of aromatic compounds under the imo 2020 sulfur cap alternative fuels such as lng low sulfur distillate oil biodiesel and methanol are typical abatement strategies for bca besides the electrostatic precipitators and selective catalytic reduction served as the main exhaust treatment for bca abatement this work is aiming at estimating the fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions during the cruising mode in non secas by adopting imo 2020 compliant fuel options the ships characteristics and machinery data are collected from the llyod s maritime database with the given data of ship capacity draught length between perpendicular main engine type power service speed etc multiple sources are employed to extract the important energy based emission factors and the sfc data collected from two major sources recalculated as carbon dioxide intensity to convert energy based emission factors to fuel based emission factors 3 methodology 3 1 description of methodology as previously mentioned the bottom up approach is more reliable than the top down method since it deals with more uncertainties fig 1 is a flowchart showing the key tasks and collected data in the proposed methodology we have compared all the milestone works of this field and constructed the fuel consumption and shipping emission models by covering more operational uncertainties adverse weather impacts for ship cruising hull fouling effects for shipping fuel consumption and ship draught adjustment adopting the latest ship dimension and machinery data from lloyd s list intelligence and collecting the dynamic data for six major types of merchant ships from shipboard ais in order to provide a close to reality shipping emission data the paper makes a great effort to minimize the deterministic input values and to consider the emission for main engine auxilary engine and auxilary boiler for a large sample ship size 337 in total as the imo 2020 sulfur cap is an ambitious move for global shipping especially for the non ecas the study focuses on the cruising mode at sea and the ship service speed is defined as the speed over ground which is 80 of the normal continuous rating ncr speed six ship types bulk carriers general cargo ships container ships oil tankers lng carriers and lpg tankers are studied in this research since their shares of transportation capacities top other merchant ships among world fleet unctad 2019 in addition this paper considers the four proven shipping fuel solutions hfo with scrubber mgo vlsfo and lng instead of paying attention on the future promising fuel options such as biofuels ammonia and liquid hydrogen there is no doubt that shipbuilding has an evident large scale trend and our focus is the oceangoing vessels so the 2 stroke slow speed engine is our major analysis object for oil fueled main engine while the 4 stroke engine is assumed for the auxiliary engine as for lng fueled ships the common techniques may involve steam turbines gas turbines lean burn spark ignited lbsi engines low pressure injection dual fuel lpdf engines and high pressure injection dual fuel hpdf engines no gas turbine or steam turbine engines are analyzed in this research because they have limited future international shipping applications and are less efficient compared to other lng engines therefore the lpdf and hpdf solutions are adopted for the cruising mode emission calculation when lng is taken as the fuel solution to determine the environmental impacts as a bottom up emission approach this work has completed individual calculations ship by ship using the detailed calculation process shown in fig 1 in general the given parameters displaying in the yellow block cover ship characteristic data energy based emission factors specific fuel consumption sfc data ais information and fleet voyage plan this study firstly preprocesses the collected ship characteristic data from the lloyd s maritime intelligence unit lmiu then the load factors are worked out by integrating ship characteristics and external influential factors such as the hull fouling factor the draught adjusted factor and extreme weather factor the emission factors are compared and validated among ten sources and after the ae and ab power demand is calculated case by case the total co2 emissions per nautical mile by one fuel option can be determined next the fuel consumption is obtained by adopting a converted emission factor which is integrated into the fuel based emission factor with the sfc data then the study proposed a new variable to show the amounts of fuel consumption and gwp related gas emissions per nautical mile for one unit of capacity bin so that every unit of transported merchants can be connected with fuel consumption and co2 equivalent emissions finally the emission outputs of other pollutants nox sox co and pm are finalized by inputting relevant emission factors fleet voyage information and real time data from shipboard ais by introducing a unique allocation unit i e shipping air pollutants per nautical mile per capacity bin the work presents a heuristic approach to reasonably estimate fuel consumption gwp emissions and common non gwp air pollutants instead of adopting deterministic values of load factors this study considered many external factors in the calculation process and the simple linear regression of sfc is avoided by calculating fuel based emission factors also the proposed model firstly compared four proven imo 2020 fuel solutions with consideration of lng dual engines in addition this manuscript integrated black carbon aerosol emission with other three common gwp air pollutants and the auxiliary boiler is not neglected in this study as well lmit provided real time ais data for the defined ship types and routes python 3 0 was adopted in this study to collect and to preprocess the ship characteristic data jmp 15 and stattools 7 6 were applied to process the ship by ship calculations for fuel consumption and marine exhaust gas emissions and they were served to analyze the calculated data and to make regression models for the case study as well 3 2 merchant ship exhaust gas emissions some previous studies used a linear relationship between ship emissions per nautical mile and the total emissions as the shipping speed was presumed as a constant value this assumption is reasonable for the cruising mode especially for the non ecas since it is a common practice to adopt auto pilot mode when the ship is navigating in the stable external environment at the deep sea the paper works on the cruising mode emissions for marine air pollutants when the selected merchant ships are navigating in the non ecas comparing the amount of ship exhaust pollutants emitted by the selected merchant ships when different fuel options are adopted 3 e m p m i j k p m e m c r i j k l f m e i j k e f m e i j k p a e m c r i j k l f a e i j k e f a e i j k p a b e p i j k e f a b i j k v a c t 1 i ship class j fuel option k air

for the main engine auxiliary engine and auxiliary boiler exhaust gases specifically the main engine maximum continuous rating mcr power is obtained by lloyd s database dividing 0 9 since ncr conventionally equals to 85 95 mcr the ae maximum continuous rating power is calculated by using the vessel ratio of auxiliary engines main engines shown in the tables s 7 of supplemental material the ab effective power demand is determined by the ship capacity bins within the specific ship class see tables s 2 of supplemental material 3 3 main engine load factor this study compares the load factor sfc and emission factor for six previous studies and table 1 shows the summary of the major studies one can find that most of the studies took the shipping speed as the key parameter for load factor to simplify the calculation however a more robust is needed to cover uncertainties during the voyage and to deal with different vessel types ages and engines with different leading factors as shown in table 1 the main engine load factor tends to be greater than the actual value since seldom of them considered the safety margin and navigation environment impacts referred from the icct report olmer et al 2017 this study substituted the transient speed with an adjusted ship speed and the negative effects of hull roughness weather adjusted factors and draught coefficient are added in the load factor equation see equation 4 4 l f v a c t v m c r 3 h f f i w a c d a f i where vact is the actual ship speed which equals to the speed over ground multiplying the speed adjusted speed vmcr is the speed when me is in maximum continuous rating mode which is assumed as 1 064 times the normal continuous rating speed because the cruise speeds proposed by lloyd s data are 94 of the maximum speed moreno gutiérrez et al 2015 hff is the hull fouling factor which is determined by the ship age length between perpendiculars and the coefficient of marine biofouling wac weather adjustment coefficient and daf draught adjustment factor see supplemental document for details 3 4 ship fuel emission factor a key element to reflect the actual emissions from theoretical calculations is to adopt the accurate emission factor overall an emission factor is a coefficient which allows to transforming activity data into air polluter emissions as a critical parameter for the typical fuel converter emission factor has been analyzed for many decades ipcc has an emission factor database ipcc efdb ipcc 2019 the eu has the emep eea database emission factors emep eea 2019 and the usa epa has ap 42 a compilation of emission factors while in australia there are some npi emission factors within the emissions estimation handbooks npi 2017 besides these open access data sources many works have specified emission factor estimation in the maritime sector the imo has published three emission studies on shipping fuel options and the emission factors for each fuel have been keeping updating as they have great ambitions to build a low carbon and sulfur ecofriendly shipping environment besides the international council on clean transportation icct pays plenty of attention to emission control in both aviation and marine transportation and their emission factor data for me ae and ab have been adopted by many scholars to avoid confusion when comparing fuels the fuel solutions which meet the 0 50 sulfur limit under marpol annex vi in this research are defined as below mgo distillate marine dm fuels specified in iso 8217 2017 i e dma are defined with maximum of 0 1 sulfur content hfo residual marine rm fuels are as specified as rmd 80 in iso 8217 2017 with max 2 5 sulfur content in this study very low sulfur fuel oil vlsfo rm are as specified in iso 8217 2017 i e maximum 0 50 vlsfo rm lng has been deemed as the clean fossil fuel and a great number of maritime applications have proven it as an ideal alternative for traditional shipping fuels dnv gl 2019b the typical characteristics of the three oil based fuels can be found in tables s 6 in the supplemental materials although some other fuel options such as liquefied hydrogen ammonia methanol and biodiesel have a potential future for marine transportation the above mentioned four fuels are currently useable and their merits and disadvantages are listed in table 2 as shown in tables s 1 of the supplemental document the selected ships are mega ocean going vessels thus the two stroke ssd the engine is main focus for diesel based main engines table 3 listed the emission factors of currently compliant fuel options emission factor for hfo with the maximum sulfur content of 2 5 for slow speed diesel engine which is served as a benchmark for the major option for the prior imo 2020 shipping fuel is collected from the icct study olmer et al 2017 as a widely applied retrofit option to meet the 2020 sulfur cap an open loop scrubber is adopted in the study so no addition of alkali is needed the scrubber is modeled to reduce the emissions of so2 from hfo with 2 percent sulfur content to the same levels as the so2 emissions from a fuel within 0 5 percent of sulfur content and the reduction required by the scrubber unit is thus 95 percent the fuel consumption increases with a scrubber van der linde 2009 and a 2 percent increase is assumed in this study the scrubber unit is modeled to remove 50 percent of the particulate matters as the open loop scrubber for reducing black carbon aerosol ranging from 25 to 70 a 40 percentage reduction of bca is assumed in this study moreover emission factors for hfo with scrubber include a 2 percent energy consumption penalty as well as for vlsfo bca emission factor is assumed to be 35 percent more than that of hfo since a recent study finland 2019 criticized vlsfo even increased the bca emission by 10 85 comparing with high sulfur fuel oils making the newly blended fuel limited acceptable for the arctic transportation see tables s 10 in the supplemental material for bca fuel based emission factors moreover emission factors for co2 ch4 and n2o of hfo with scrubber vlsfo mgo lpdf and hpdf are calculated from the greet model anl 2016 and the icct latest report pavlenko et al 2020 while the sox nox pm and co are collected from the icct study olmer et al 2017 for lng fueled options the lng lpdf and hpdf are the main engine types while lpdf is mostly applied for lng carriers and large scale container ship and hpdf another slow speed two stroke engine is a proven solution for bulk carriers general cargo ships and gas tankers furthermore the lpdf engine has a medium speed version which will not be discussed in this study because it usually serves as the main power for cruising ships passenger ferries and offshore support vessels emission factors of co2 ch4 and n2o for the dual engines are collected from the latest study pavlenko et al 2020 and the emission factors of sox nox pm and co for dual engine are collected from two studies kristensen 2015 man b man 2012 3 5 fuel consumption per unit of capacity bin fuel consumption is determined by many variables which can be categorized as engine attributes engine type load maintenance state and fuel types rm dm lng etc to mathematically determine the fuel consumption it is necessary to convert the energy based emission factors of marine fuel options to fuel based emission factors by introducing the sfc specifically the amounts of co2 emission combusting from marine fuels are called co2 intensity of the fuel which is listed in table 4 this study covers the shipping fuel emissions by all the emission sources on board and the fuel consumption is calculated by co2 emissions of me ae and ab then the calculated fuel consumption is adopted to compute the fuel consumption per unit of capacity bin on a distance basis to compare the energy consumption of each ship class the calculation process is taken on a ship by ship basis for our collected ship database and the eqn 5 is listed below 5 f c c b i j c b t i c l a s s j f u e l e m c o 2 m e i j c b t e m c o 2 a e i j c b t e m c o 2 a b i j c b t c o 2 i n t e n s i t y c a p a

2 a b i j c b t amount of co2 emission per unit of capacity bin per nautical mile emitted by auxiliary boiler since many variances lie on the sample size ship capacity bins and ship main power systems the cumulative fuel consumption and emissions are hard to find the most sustainable fuel options thereafter the capacity bin is introduced among all the six ship classes to calculate the fuel consumption and gwp co2 equivalent emissions per nautical mile per unit of capacity bin 3 6 global warming potential related gas emission calculation this paper adopted the ipcc fifth report gwp100 values for co2 ch4 and n2o and the bca gwp100 was referred from bond s study bond et al 2013 the below equation shows the way to calculate the fleet s total emission of ghgs by considering the

timeline of imo s initial ghg strategy up to 20 reduction in the carbon intensity of international shipping needs to be accomplished this year the gwp related ship exhaust gases are determined as co2 ch4 n2o and bca in this paper although other substances like cf4 and hfc 152a were also deemed as air pollutants for gwp this research does not consider these non combustion emissions such as refrigerants and halogenated hydrocarbons due to the wide variations of the emissions factors of non combustion sources and little significance to overall shipping ghg emissions and the non gwp gas emission estimations follow the typical way to integrate emission factors of sox nox pm and co with the calculated fuel consumption 4 results and discussion fig 2 shows the fuel consumption and shipping exhaust gas emissions contributing to global warming potential for the six ship types and five designated fuel options under imo 2020 sulfur cap in general the total values of fuel consumption per nautical mile for container ships surpass those of the other five ship classes while the gwp related gas emissions show the same trend as well focusing on emission amounts only co2 emissions consistently account for more than 90 among the four gwp related gases and for the two common abatement option hfo with scrubber and vlsfo the bca is the second pollutant then ch4 and n2o while for lng based fuel options lpdf and hpdf the emission sequence after co2 is ch4 n2o and bca as for the shipping emission sources the air pollutants emitted by the main engine are ten times more than those emitted by auxiliary engine and auxiliary boiler also the cruise power demand of boilers for bulk carriers container ships and general cargo ships are assumed zero in this study based on the ship maneuvering experiences next one conclusion can be made that the lng based fuels have great emission controls on co2 n2o and bca and the amounts of bca emissions only account for 1 5 of hfo with scrubber and vlsfo based on our calculation see tables s 9 in the supplemental information for detail however the only issue for lng fueled ship is the ch4 emission which is around 20 times more than that of oil based fuel options and mgo vlsfo present an obvious strength on methane emission control while hpdf beats lpdf within the lng based fuel options specifically the data for bulk carrier indicates that hfo with scrubber emits the most amounts of co2 ch4 and n2o among the three oil based fuels while the vlsfo emits the most bca compared to hfo with scrubber option the lpdf and hpdf can reduce co2 emissions by 28 and 36 respectively and the emissions of n2o are dropped by 61 and 64 as well as for general cargo ships the shipping pollutants emitted by the auxiliary engine have a remarkable rise than other ship classes that is because most general cargo ships require more power from ae causing the ratio of ae me much higher than other ships although the methane emissions from fig 2 indicate a sharp rise for lpdf and hpdf it does not conclude that those two are not eco friendly options as the gwp is calculated depending on the four pollutant emissions and co2 emissions may make a great difference on the other hand the cumulative results between lng tankers and lpg tankers change dramatically mainly because of the larger ship size of lng tankers besides the gwp related gas emissions other pollutants resulting from the ship activities should be considered as well this study compared the nautical mile based emissions of co pm nox and sox for five fuel options among six merchant ships and the calculated mean emission values with 5 confidence interval are shown in fig 3 the amounts of nox emission dominate the selected pollutants and the lng fueled engines display a less nox emission than that of oil fueled engines as for pm the most amount of emission occurs when hfo with scrubber is chosen and still lpdf and hpdf emits less pm than oil based fuels speaking to sox emission vlsfo and hfo with scrubber top other options but co emissions tell another story the hpdf option shows the worst co emission therefore one conclusion can be made that the lpdf is the best shipping fuel option based on the cumulative emission results of co pm nox and sox to compare the fuel consumption and co2 equivalent emission between different ship classes the nautical mile based fuel consumption co2 equivalent emission per capacity bin was brought to categorize six ship types into three groups figs 4 6 presents the relationship between co2 equivalent emissions per nautical mile per unit of capacity bin for six ship types and the values of dwt ltc and teu respectively and the corresponding fuel consumption are shown in fig s 1 and fig s 2 in the supplemental information overall all unit emission values display a decreasing trend as the capacity bin increases suggesting larger size ships exhibit better environmental performance specifically bulk carrier as shown in fig 4a outperforms general cargo ship fig 4b on exhaust gas emissions there is no clear pattern for general cargo ships with less than 15 000 dwt capacity but the unit emission drops along with the increment of capacity bins when the dwt value grows over 15 000 moreover lng based options are more eco friendly than oil based options on either bulk carrier or general cargo ship liquid tank capacity is set as the capacity bin unit for the three tankers in this study fig 5 illustrates the most sustainable option is the oil tanker as a result of its overall large ship scale in general the oil based fuels do not perform as well as the two lng fueled engines and hpdf shows a better performance than lpdf on co2 equivalent emissions among these three tankers furthermore the difference between oil based engines and lng based engines is tremendous when the ship size is small based on our calculated outputs lng tankers with ltc of 30 000 cubic meters presents the most unit co2 equivalent emission indicating the investment of lng tanker in this scale may not be a wise choice when ltc grows to 150 000 ltc the value is dropped below 0 004 kg n m ltc and there is no big difference when the ltc locates in the range of 150 000 and 180 000 except for two abnormal ship types with their ltc of 173 400 the unit emission value for lpg tanker shown in fig 5b plunges to 0 005kg n m ltc when the x axis value exceeds 23000 cubic meters but there are two exceptional data points i e ltc 36 000 and ltc 38 000 for oil tankers the co2 equivalent unit emission is below 0 004 kg n m ltc at the time when ltc surpasses 180 000 cubic meters or stays in the range between 100 000 and 130 000 therefore the recommended tanker sizes from the perspective of co2 equivalent emission savings are as follows lng tanker with liquid tank capacity larger than 150 000 cubic meters lpg tanker with ltc greater than 23 000 oil tanker whose ltc in the range between 100 thousand and 130 thousand and greater than 180 thousand cubic meters the capacity bin of container ships is unique among all the six merchant ships and the unit of the fuel consumption which is the y axis in fig 6a is kilogram fuel per teu per nautical mile 0 04 kg fuel per teu every nautical mile is achieved when the shipping capacity surpasses 5000 teu the lowest value of fuel consumption occurs when the teu is 18 982 of which the values of mgo vlsfo lpdf and hpdf are 87 5 91 4 83 9 and 84 4 respectively as much as that of hfo with scrubber as for fig 6b the capacity unit co2 equivalent emission goes below 0 1 kg n m teu once the capacity bin reaches 5000 teu at that point when taking hfo with scrubber as a benchmark the mgo emission can be saved by 13 6 while the unit emission saving for vlsfo lpdf and hpdf are 5 8 31 1 and 38 4 respectively thus the small size container ship whose teu is less than 5 000 is not a recommended choice when considering the fuel cost and gwp gas emission next the bca emissions for our database were calculated based on the unit of capacity bin for every nautical mile fig 7 shows the bca emissions for two capacity bin groups one can conclude that the two lng fuel options can reduce bca emissions into a neglectable level specifically for dwt basis fleets shown in fig 7a general cargo ship may emit around 2 5 times more black carbons than bulk carriers while the bca emission can be saved up to 94 times by replacing oil based fuels with lng fuel options as for the ltc basis shown in fig 7b the best bca emission control tanker is lng tankers it emits 65 less black carbons than lpg tankers meanwhile oil tankers only emit 7 more than lng tankers when employing same fuel options for container ships suppose the benchmark choice is hfo with scrubber by substituting it with other options the bca emissions decreased 82 for mgo 98 for lpdf and hpdf however the vlsfo emits 25 more black carbons than the benchmark fuel option to sum up ghg emissions follow the rank of hfo with scrubber vlsfo mgo lpdf hpdf while the order for non ghg emissions is hfo with scrubber vlsfo mgo hpdf lpdf specifically the two lng options outperform the three oil options on emissions of non gwp emissions except for the ch4 emission which is reasonable because of the concern of methane slip and co emission for hpdf is as well interior than others on the other hand the between group calculated results confirmed the large size ships of our database tend to have a good performance on fuel saving and gwp gas emission control in detail bulk carriers generally have lower values of the gwp gas emissions per dwt than general cargo ships the three tankers which share the liquid tank capacity as the capacity bin have little difference on emission control for large size tankers but lpg tankers have better co2 equivalent emission records for medium size tankers ranging from 20 000 to 100 000 cubic meters set teu as a unique capacity bin unit container ships emit more air pollutants per unit than other ship types which is attributed to its fast serving speed and large transport capability per teu for black carbon emissions vlsfo serving as a newly blended imo 2020 compliant option is surprisingly to emit the largest amount of bca among all the fuel options while hpdf and lpdf have overwhelming performance in bca emission control over the two residual oil options 60 to 100 times bca emissions will be saved by taking lng fuel options rather than hfo and vlsfo based on our calculations the recommended ship types when considering bca emission are bulk carriers and lng tankers respectively for the dwt group and the ltc group 5 case study the proposed mathematical models for fuel consumption and gwp gas emissions are employed on a specific case for trans ocean cruising from houston located in the north america eca to rotterdam located in north sea seca from oct 1 2019 to oct 31 2019 aiming to find an optimized fuel option by minimizing the fuel consumption and environmental impacts based on the ais collected data there were 234 ships navigating from houston to rotterdam during oct 1 2019 to oct 31 2019 the total distance of this voyage is 5089 nautical miles of which 3615 nm for non eca cruising collected data from lloyd s database the dwt of six major merchant ships accounts for 90 of all the listed vessels as shown in the outer circle of the below figure and the inner circle of fig 9 represents the vessel numbers of each ship type next this study will focus on calculating the total fuel consumption and ship exhaust gas emissions for the cruising mode of the six merchant ship class in the non eca areas shown as the red line in the fig 8 based on the model previously proposed as dwt is the unit of capacity bin for bulk carrier and general cargo ship the relationship between dwt and the capacity bin units of the container ships and the three tankers should be found to proceed with the fuel consumption this study adopted the regression model proposed by to calculate teu from dwt abramowski et al 2018 in the meanwhile a fit regression model was built by the liquid tank capacity and dwt for lng lpg and oil tankers see fig s 3 of the supplemental information from the perspective of fuel consumption the least energy saving solution for each ship class is always the hfo with scrubber shown in fig 10 particularly for bulk carriers other options can save up to 39 fuel by discarding this scrubber solution the container ships take the most value of fuel consumption ranging from 81 936 to 97 768 tons since they contribute the most transported dwt and their design speed is much higher than that of other options on the other side lng carriers and lpg tankers share the least fuel consumption as there were 6 lng tankers and 5 lpg tankers navigating from us eca to north sea seca at that time leading no evident difference between the lng fueled engines and oil fueled engines by considering the operating expense only the lng based fuel options lpdf and hpdf are the best strategy because of the least amount of fuel consumption and the lowest energy price of lng when using the emission model to calculate the gwp related exhaust gas emissions it can be deduced that the hfo with scrubber is the option with the highest amounts of co2 equivalent emissions so it is set as the benchmark to show the emission reduction of other four fuel options see fig 11 hpdf as the most effective fuel option for emission abatement is able to reduce the emission of co2 equivalent by around 36 39 for the six ship types taken bulk carrier as an instance the gwp related gases emissions for hfo with scrubber is 39 502 tons while that of hpdf is 24 433 tons furthermore the vlsfo option does not show much difference as the benchmark solution the percentage of reduced co2 equivalent ranges from 4 to 7 as for the most co2 equivalent ship class the container ship emits around 237 278 tons of gwp related gases when hfo with scrubber is taken for cruising in the non eca of this study and when the mgo is adopted 205 235 tons of co2 equivalent will be exhausted while for vlsfo lpdf and hpdf are 223 640 163 696 146 312 tons respectively suppose the first scenario employs hfo with scrubber for the six merchant ships the total co2 equivalent emission may surge to 340 344 tons for the whole non eca cruising voyage alternatively the number may reduce to 209 990 tons when all the merchant ships employ hpdf engines as the most eco friendly scenario 38 gwp related gases may be dropped compared to the first scenario see fig 12 it is widely recognized that the newly blended marine fuel option vlsfo is a compliant solution with high cost performance ratio under imo 2020 sulfur cap more and more liquefied gas tankers either newly building orders or existed ones tend to install or retrofit lng fueled engines to meet the long term marine environmental requirements of imo as a result this case study defined a most practical fuel scenario which assumed vlsfo as the major option for bulker carriers general cargo ships container ships and oil tankers in the meanwhile the lng hpdf engines were assumed to be installed on the lng and lpg carriers then the total amount of co2 equivalent emission for the case is 3 077 411 tons with the 37 232 tons contributed by bulk carriers 16718 tons by general cargo ships 223 640 tons by container ships 5158 tons by lng carriers 4067 tons by lpg carriers and 20 596 tons by oil tankers 6 conclusions towards enhancing the sustainable development of the shipping industry fuel economy and safety concerns are among the most important factors to create future roadmaps for the operation and the growth of the global ship fleets focusing on optimizing calculations of shipping fuel consumption and ship exhaust gas emissions this study provides a holistic bottom up methodology by integrating and evolving several approaches to reduce the uncertainties to our knowledge this manuscript is the first work to cover both the newly blended fuel and the bca emission impacts and the fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions from 337 ships within six major merchant ship types have been calculated and analyzed to find the most sustainable solutions by in group comparison and between group comparison in general the calculated values from the mathematical model confirmed that the large size ships are preferred from the perspective of maritime sustainability and the two lng fuel options displayed great potential for fuel savings and reductions in the emissions of co2 n2o and bca although ch4 emission may be an issue for lng fueled ships their overall gwp gas emissions were better than other options as for the sustainable preferred ship fleet bulk carriers outperformed general cargo ships on both nautical mile based fuel consumption and co2 equivalent emissions per unit of dwt while for the unit of liquid tank capacity there is little difference in ghg emissions among lng tanker lpg tanker and oil tanker when the liquid tank size surpasses 100 thousand cubic meters the recommended tanker size is lng tanker with ltc larger than 150 000 cubic meters lpg tanker greater than 23 000 and oil tanker whose ltc in the range between 100 000 and 130 000 and greater than 180 000 m3 among all the proven fuel options under imo 2020 sulfur cap the hfo with scrubber is the least favorable for both gwp and non gwp gases while the lng fueled engines lpdf and hpdf are recommended to meet the green shipping requirement hpdf took a slight lead for gwp related gas emission control whereas lpdf offers superior emission control for co pm nox and sox the case study confirmed 36 39 co2 equivalent emissions were reduced by replacing hfo with scrubber option with hpdf as a second dominated gwp gas following co2 bca emission follows the rank vlsfo hfo with scrubber mgo hpdf lpdf from high to low because of bca s high emission rate vlsfo fails to show great improvement on gwp gas emission control compared to hfo with scrubber meanwhile the two lng based fuel options show the least global warming potential benefiting from lower bca and co2 emissions based on this work there are three main recommendations for future research the first recommendation is to apply the approach developed in this work for ship navigation in the reduced speed zones and ship maneuvering in the harbor areas another recommendation is tantamount to employ machine learning or deep learning techniques to integrate the safety characteristics of these fuel options with calculated emissions data finally since methanol hydrogen and ammonia may soon enter into the shipping fuel market it will be beneficial to carry out a study similar to this work to optimize fuel efficiency and to limit air pollutant emission from the tank to propeller stage for these promising fuel options credit authorship contribution statement chenxi ji proposed the approach
