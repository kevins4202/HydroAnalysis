5855,precipitation is a major driving factor for land surface water and energy balances uncertainty in global precipitation products over observation sparse regions such as the tibetan plateau tp is generally large sensitivity of surface water and energy variables to precipitation uncertainty can provide clues for confidence that can be assigned to simulated water and energy variables in such regions in this study the sensitivities of surface water and energy variables to global precipitation product uncertainty over four large river basins in the tp are quantified and inter compared based on a newly developed sensitivity analysis approach a water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model including biosphere is utilized after calibration and validation against observed runoff and land surface temperatures lsts from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis eight global precipitation products are used to represent the precipitation uncertainty results show that canopy interception loss cie and runoff are highly sensitive to the uncertainty in general whereas lsts are not sensitive therefore confidence in simulated cie and runoff can be considered relatively low when using global precipitation products in the four basins these results imply that other simulated variables may have large uncertainty even when lsts simulation performs well and accurate simulations of cie and runoff require high accuracy in precipitation because cie has profound influence on local hydrological cycle the results also imply that utilizing the most accurate precipitation product is critical for local scale hydrological cycle research keywords precipitation uncertainty runoff sensitivity tibetan plateau water balance distributed hydrological modeling 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp plays an important role in ensuring regional water security food security and sustainable socioeconomic development in south east and southeast asia the majority of in situ precipitation stations are located in the southern and eastern tp gao and liu 2013 yang et al 2014 to compensate the data gap in the data sparse regions in the tp satellite and or reanalysis based global precipitation products are utilized as input of land surface hydrological models to simulate water and energy variables e g xue et al 2013 precipitation has large temporal and spatial variations which render reliable estimation difficult ji and kang 2015 in addition because global satellite and or reanalysis based precipitation products use different inversion algorithms and data sources with limited in situ gauge observation global precipitation products have various pros and cons for example qi et al 2016a showed that tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm products trmm3b42 huffman et al 2007 and global land data assimilation system gldas version 1 rodell et al 2004 underestimate heavy rainfall intensities in summer periods on a daily scale in a coastal river basin chen et al 2018 found that satellite products are generally more realistic than those from reanalysises because of the uncertainty of precipitation products confidence in simulated land surface water and energy variables using them is unknown biemans et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 qi et al 2016a qi et al 2018b which to some extent has undermined the practical applications of global precipitation products for water and energy variable simulations in data sparse region in the tp sensitivity analysis of water and energy variables to precipitation uncertainties can provide information on which variable is influenced the most and which one is least impacted therefore the sensitivity can provide information on confidence that we can place on simulated various water and energy variables when using global precipitation products in data sparse regions fekete et al 2004 investigated the influence of precipitation uncertainty on runoff on a global scale guo et al 2006 studied the sensitivity of soil moisture to meteorological forcing in russian united states china and mongolia kato et al 2007 first employed an ensemble including different land surface models and precipitation products to simulate water and energy fluxes in the united states wei et al 2008 investigated the sensitivity of soil moisture to precipitation and radiation wang and zeng 2011 studied the sensitivity of soil moisture evapotranspiration and simulated runoff to precipitation and air temperature uncertainties however these studies did not verify their simulation accuracy against observation which could undermine the results because the simulations may have large uncertainties if simulation is not validated many studies also investigated sensitivity of simulation results to precipitation uncertainties using calibrated models for example biemans et al 2009 vano et al 2012 and weiland et al 2015 studied influence of precipitation uncertainty on runoff using calibrated hydrological models kavetski et al 2006b and kavetski et al 2006a developed a mathematical approach and studied the influence of precipitation uncertainty on runoff simulation although the previous studies used calibrated models the sensitivity analysis were carried out only for runoff and therefore the sensitivity of different water and energy variables cannot be inter compared thus more comprehensive studies on water and energy variable sensitivity to global precipitation product uncertainties are needed based on well calibrated and validated hydrological land surface models the overall aim of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of land surface water and energy variables to global precipitation product uncertainty in the tp a water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model including biosphere web dhm wang et al 2009a wang et al 2009b wang et al 2009c qi et al 2015 is implemented after calibration and validation based on hydrological gauge observation and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land surface temperature lst the mod11a2 product wan 2008 eight global scale fine resolution precipitation products are utilized to represent the precipitation uncertainty this paper is unique in that for the first time divergent sensitivity of various water and energy variables to global precipitation product uncertainty is quantified and inter compared in the tp the results can provide important information on different confidence that can be placed on various simulated water and energy variables when using global precipitation products in the data sparse regions in the tp 2 study basins model data and assessment criteria 2 1 river basins studied four large river basins fig 1 in the tp were used to conduct this study they cover a total area of 571 471 km2 the average elevations of the river basins are above 4100 m the mean annual temperatures in the four river basins are around zero degree celsius among the four river basins the yarlung tsangpo river basin is the largest 256 864 km2 and the upper lancang river basin is the smallest 53 656 km2 the upper yangtze river basin has an area of 137 371 km2 and the upper yellow river basin has an area of 123 580 km2 the river basin details are shown in table 1 including basin average leaf area index lai aridity index climate and hydrological regimes because this study is a sequel to our previous study more river basin details can be found in the study by qi et al 2018a 2 2 model and datasets web dhm combines a simple biosphere scheme version 2 sib2 land surface model sellers et al 1986 sellers et al 1996a sellers et al 1996b and a hydrological model developed by yang 1998 web dhm simulates the leaf photosynthetic activity by combining a leaf stomatal conductance model developed by ball 1988 and a photosynthesis model developed by collatz et al 1991 and collatz et al 1992 i e the ball berry model web dhm estimates lst from canopy temperature lst c and surface soil temperature lst g as below wang et al 2009c 1 lst sim v l s t c 4 1 v l s t g 4 1 4 2 v l a i l a i max where v represents green vegetation coverage la i max represents the maximum lai defined by sellers et al 1996b many evaluations and applications using web dhm have been conducted wang et al 2010a wang et al 2010b wang et al 2012 qi et al 2015 qi et al 2016a qi et al 2019 and results showed that web dhm performs well generally china gauge based daily precipitation analysis data is utilized in the model calibration and validation and the precipitation data has been used in many studies showing good performance in general zhao and zhu 2015 shen and xiong 2016 gao et al 2017 hourly precipitation data are downscaled from the daily data using a stochastic method wang et al 2011 other model forcing data used are from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he and yang 2011 xue et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 yang et al 2017 cmfd has a 3 hour temporal resolution in the cmfd dataset temperature pressure humidity and wind speed are instantaneous variables and downward shortwave and longwave radiation are 3 hour mean values linear interpolation approaches are used to generate hourly data for temperature pressure humidity and wind speed downward shortwave and longwave radiation are assumed the same within each 3 hour time step the 8 day modis land surface temperatures used i e the mod11a2 product were observed at the day around 11 00 and at night around 22 00 local time details about the model calibration and validation methods can be found in the study by qi et al 2018a the global precipitation products used are listed in table 2 the precipitation products used here are the same to our previous study qi et al 2018a and please refer to the previous study for more detailed description about the global precipitation products 2 3 assessment criteria the sensitivity is quantified based on the precipitation uncertainty influence pui index using eq 3 pui i 1 12 max i i min i i 12 mean abs d obs where max i i and min i i represent the maximum and minimum values of simulated ensemble intervals in ith month d obs represents observation or simulated values utilizing observation pui index represents the average width of ensemble intervals normalized using d obs the higher the pui the wider the ensemble intervals on average more sensitive it can be seen that the pui sensitivity index is different from previous methods such as the one factor at a time sensitivity analysis method and sobol s sensitivity analysis approach which are designed to quantify sensitivity of model outputs to various influential factors and do not consider ensemble interval width sobol 2001 tang et al 2007a tang et al 2007b fu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013a nevertheless the pui sensitivity index considers ensemble interval width which is appropriate because an ensemble of precipitation product data is utilized coefficient of determination r2 mean bias error mbe and root mean square error rmse are used in uncertainty assessment 4 mbe i 1 n x si i 1 n x oi n 5 rmse i 1 n x si x oi 2 n where xoi and xsi represent observation or simulation using observation and simulation forced by global precipitation products at time i for runoff nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative bias rb are utilized qi et al 2016b qi et al 2016c qi et al 2018c nse and rb are calculated as follows 6 nse 1 i 1 n q pi q ti 2 i 1 n q ti q t 2 7 rb i 1 n q pi i 1 n q ti i 1 n q ti 100 where qpi and q ti represent simulated and observed runoff q t represents average runoff observation 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation web dhm has been calibrated and validated using observed runoff from 2000 to 2010 in the four river basins in our previous study please refer to fig 2 fig 3 table 3 and table 4 of qi et al 2018a web dhm shows good performance in replicating runoff observations with nse being above 0 88 and absolute values of rb being lower than 9 modis lsts and web dhm simulation are compared in fig 2 web dhm simulated lsts replicate modis observation well at both nightime and daytime in the four river basins the r2 values all are higher than 0 83 rmse values are lower than 4 36 absolute values of mbe are lower than 0 41 the uncertainty may be due to the input data of the model simulation the linear green vegetation coverage eq 2 may also contribute the uncertainty of lst simulation overall the performance of web dhm is acceptable in reproducing the observed runoff and lsts in the four river basins the runoff and lsts represent water and energy states respectively they are readily available from hydrological gauges and remote sensing products with good credibility and therefore have been commonly used to validate model performance in simulating land surface water and energy processes e g wang et al 2009c wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 wang et al 2016 this study follows the same approach to verify the model simulation 3 2 simulated water and energy variables fig 3 shows the ensemble of long term mean monthly simulation results in the yarlong tsangpo river basin the results include sensible heat flux latent heat flux evapotranspiration et canopy interception loss cie surface soil evaporation ground interception store evaporation gie surface zone wetness land surface temperature lst upward shortwave radiation upward longwave radiation net radiation ground heat flux and runoff the ensemble of sensible heat flux fig 3a brackets observation based results in most of the months except in may similarly the ensemble of ground interception store evaporation fig 3g also does not bracket observation based results in several months however the upper bounds of the ensembles of sensible heat flux and ground interception store evaporation are very close to observation based simulation results different from sensible heat flux and ground interception store evaporation the generated ensembles of other variables envelop the simulated results forced by observed precipitation regarding the spread of the ensembles lst upward shortwave radiation upward longwave radiation net radiation and ground heat flux show very narrow ensemble intervals and are very similar to the observation observation based results for other variables the simulation ensembles show large intervals this indicates that lst upward shortwave radiation upward longwave radiation net radiation and ground heat flux are less sensitivity to precipitation uncertainties than other variables the difference also implies that the simulations of the other variables may not be accurate even when lst upward shortwave radiation upward longwave radiation net radiation and ground heat flux simulations are close to observation most of the results show the runoff is overestimated which is because most of the precipitation products have higher precipitation estimation than observation as shown in the fig 11 of qi et al 2018a fig 4 shows comparison between ensemble averages and observation observation based simulation results in the yarlong tsangpo river basin the ensemble averages reflect the seasonal variations of all variables well with r2 values being over 0 97 overall large differences between ensemble averages and observation observation based simulation also exist for example the ensemble averages of ground interception store evaporation fig 4g are higher than observation based simulation from january to march and greatly lower from may to september the ensemble averages of runoff are greatly higher than observation from june to september the higher values of the ensemble average of runoff may be because the ensemble average of et is close to simulation forced by observation fig 4c and ensemble average of precipitation is higher than observation rb is up to 35 figs 5 6 and 7 show long term mean monthly simulation results in the upper lancang upper yangtze and upper yellow river basins the patterns are similar to the yarlong tsangpo river basin fig 3 the various precipitation products result in different simulation results and the ensemble spreads of lst upward shortwave radiation upward longwave radiation net radiation and ground heat flux are generally smaller than other variables figs 8 9 and 10 show comparison between ensemble averages and observation observation based simulation results similar to fig 4 the ensemble averages replicate the seasonal variations of all variables well and the differences between ensemble averages and observation observation based simulation results vary with the variables 3 3 quantification of sensitivity fig 11 shows the pui index values of water and energy variables the higher the pui index values the greater the influence of precipitation uncertainty in the yarlung tsangpo river pui of runoff is the highest and pui of cie is the second highest meanwhile pui value of lst is the lowest similarly runoff is the most sensitive variable and lst is the least sensitive variable in the upper yellow and upper lancang rivers nevertheless in the upper yangtze river gie is the most sensitive variable and lst is the least sensitive variable the difference between the upper yangtze river and other three river basins may be because the upper yangtze river is dryer than others and also have relatively lower average lai as shown in table 1 overall runoff is more sensitive than most of the other variables in the river basins studied the correlation between precipitation and runoff is high zhang et al 2013b chen et al 2017 liu et al 2018 han et al 2019 therefore the uncertainty in the precipitation has a large influence on runoff the results in fig 11 indicate that cie is the second most sensitive variable to precipitation uncertainty in the yarlung tsangpo and the upper lancang rivers and cie is the third most sensitive variable in the upper yellow and the upper yangtze rivers nevertheless the pui index values of ct and cie are very similar in the upper yellow river the average lai in the upper yellow river is the highest among the four river basins which may result in that the ranking of ct is higher than other three river basins in the upper yangtze river basin the average lai is low comparatively meanwhile the upper yangtze river basin is the driest among the four river basins therefore gie is more sensitive than cie in the upper yangtze river basin overall cie is sensitive to precipitation uncertainty in the four river basins as pointed out by wang erlandsson et al 2014 and van der ent et al 2014 cie has profound influence on local hydrological cycle thus utilizing the most accurate precipitation data is critical for studying local hydrological cycle in the tp the results in fig 11 provide information on the confidence that we can place on various simulated water and energy variables when utilizing global precipitation product data based on the results when precipitation product data have uncertainty the confidence should be decreasing from runoff gie to lst least confidence should be given to the simulations of runoff gie and highest confidence to lst simulation in addition to the information on the confidence the results in fig 11 also have many implications for example a few studies suggested utilizing lsts to calibrate the parameters of land surface hydrological models corbari and mancini 2014 silvestro et al 2015 koch et al 2016 however the results in fig 11 indicate that other simulated water and energy variables may have large uncertainties even when simulated lsts perform well when reliable hydrological gauge runoff data are not available using surface zone wetness sw which could be obtained from satellite based remote sensing data to calibrate models may generate better results than using lsts because sw is more sensitive than lsts to precipitation uncertainty in addition the results in fig 11 also imply that the requirement on the accuracy of precipitation data may not be strict in lst simulation in data sparse regions because lsts are least sensitive to precipitation uncertainty 3 4 discussion the pui index values are calculated on the basis of eleven years from 2000 to 2010 of data on the annual scale in this study and therefore the results in fig 11 are appropriate for long term mean annual scale studies which are common in large scale research and land surface and atmosphere interaction research e g wei et al 2008 wang erlandsson et al 2014 schellekens et al 2017 it should be noted that precipitation influence may change when study regions precipitation data used or and hydrological land surface models used vary however the developed sensitivity assessment criterion i e eq 3 is not case specific and should be applicable to other studies the results here do add important insights into the currently limited pool of knowledge regarding the distinguishing sensitivities of water and energy variables to uncertainties in precipitation data in the tp as shown in table 1 the average lai of the four river basins range from 0 22 to 0 55 which brackets the average lai value of the entire tp 0 29 in addition the selected four river basins span several climate zones and different hydrological regimes semiarid dry sub humid humid water limited and energy limited therefore the results in this study should be applicable to other regions in the tp the results in section 3 2 indicate some ensemble averages have good performance which could also provide a reference for the confidence that could be put on simulated ensemble averages in data sparse regions however the confidence gained from the ensemble averages could be very similar for different variables because the ensemble averages of several variables have similar performance different from the confidence obtained from the ensemble averages the sensitivity information in fig 11 distinguishes the difference in the confidence that could be assigned to each of the simulated variables the web dhm model has been calibrated and validated against the hydrological gauge observation and modis lsts and the results show web dhm performs well recall the results in section 3 1 thus the input data processing model calibration and validation approaches and calibrated parameters are considered appropriate and acceptable 4 conclusions this study investigates the divergent sensitivity of various water and energy variables to precipitation uncertainty in the tp four large river basins with diversified vegetation coverages climates and hydrological regimes are used eight global precipitation products are utilized as the input to a well calibrated and validated distributed hydrological model simulating water and energy budgets this study is unique in that it quantified the distinguishing sensitivity of water and energy variables to precipitation uncertainty in the tp based on the newly developed sensitivity analysis approach the results provide improved understanding and appropriate interpretation of water and energy variable simulations in the tp when different global precipitation products are used to force the model this knowledge is especially useful in data sparse regions like the tp the major contributions of this study are summarized as follows first runoff is more sensitive to precipitation uncertainties than most variables in general therefore less confidence should be given to runoff simulation than others when using global precipitation products in ungauged regions second lsts are least sensitive to precipitation uncertainty among all variables considered more confidence can be attached to the simulated lsts and other variables may have large uncertainty even when simulated lsts are accurate this result implies that calibrating the parameters of land surface hydrological models using lsts could be problematic when precipitation has uncertainty third canopy interception loss has a relatively high sensitivity to precipitation uncertainty because canopy interception loss has profound influence on local hydrological cycle utilizing the most accurate precipitation data is critical for realistically representing local scale hydrological cycle in the four basins on the tp the methodology introduced in this paper could be used in other regions with more information on the sensitivity more precise confidence information on simulated variables using global precipitation products could be gained in data sparse regions declaration of competing interest the authors

upward longwave radiation net radiation ground heat flux and runoff the ensemble of sensible heat flux fig 3a brackets observation based results in most of the months except in may similarly the ensemble of ground interception store evaporation fig 3g also does not bracket observation based results in several months however the upper bounds of the ensembles of sensible heat flux and ground interception store evaporation are very close to observation based simulation results different from sensible heat flux and ground interception store evaporation the generated ensembles of other variables envelop the simulated results forced by observed precipitation regarding the spread of the ensembles lst upward shortwave radiation upward longwave radiation net radiation and ground heat flux show very narrow ensemble intervals and are very similar to the observation observation based results for other variables the simulation ensembles show large intervals this indicates that lst upward shortwave radiation upward longwave radiation net radiation and ground heat flux are less sensitivity to precipitation uncertainties than other variables the difference also implies that the simulations of the other variables may not be accurate even when lst upward shortwave radiation upward longwave radiation net radiation and ground heat flux simulations are close to observation most of the results show the runoff is overestimated which is because most of the precipitation products have higher precipitation estimation than observation as shown in the fig 11 of qi et al 2018a fig 4 shows comparison between ensemble averages and observation observation based simulation results in the yarlong tsangpo river basin the ensemble averages reflect the seasonal variations of all variables well with r2 values being over 0 97 overall large differences between ensemble averages and observation observation based simulation also exist for example the ensemble averages of ground interception store evaporation fig 4g are higher than observation based simulation from january to march and greatly lower from may to september the ensemble averages of runoff are greatly higher than observation from june to september the higher values of the ensemble average of runoff may be because the ensemble average of et is close to simulation forced by observation fig 4c and ensemble average of precipitation is higher than observation rb is up to 35 figs 5 6 and 7 show long term mean monthly simulation results in the upper lancang upper yangtze and upper yellow river basins the patterns are similar to the yarlong tsangpo river basin fig 3 the various precipitation products result in different simulation results and the ensemble spreads of lst upward shortwave radiation upward longwave radiation net radiation and ground heat flux are generally smaller than other variables figs 8 9 and 10 show comparison between ensemble averages and observation observation based simulation results similar to fig 4 the ensemble averages replicate the seasonal variations of all variables well and the differences between ensemble averages and observation observation based simulation results vary with the variables 3 3 quantification of sensitivity fig 11 shows the pui index values of water and energy variables the higher the pui index values the greater the influence of precipitation uncertainty in the yarlung tsangpo river pui of runoff is the highest and pui of cie is the second highest meanwhile pui value of lst is the lowest similarly runoff is the most sensitive variable and lst is the least sensitive variable in the upper yellow and upper lancang rivers nevertheless in the upper yangtze river gie is the most sensitive variable and lst is the least sensitive variable the difference between the upper yangtze river and other three river basins may be because the upper yangtze river is dryer than others and also have relatively lower average lai as shown in table 1 overall runoff is more sensitive than most of the other variables in the river basins studied the correlation between precipitation and runoff is high zhang et al 2013b chen et al 2017 liu et al 2018 han et al 2019 therefore the uncertainty in the precipitation has a large influence on runoff the results in fig 11 indicate that cie is the second most sensitive variable to precipitation uncertainty in the yarlung tsangpo and the upper lancang rivers and cie is the third most sensitive variable in the upper yellow and the upper yangtze rivers nevertheless the pui index values of ct and cie are very similar in the upper yellow river the average lai in the upper yellow river is the highest among the four river basins which may result in that the ranking of ct is higher than other three river basins in the upper yangtze river basin the average lai is low comparatively meanwhile the upper yangtze river basin is the driest among the four river basins therefore gie is more sensitive than cie in the upper yangtze river basin overall cie is sensitive to precipitation uncertainty in the four river basins as pointed out by wang erlandsson et al 2014 and van der ent et al 2014 cie has profound influence on local hydrological cycle thus utilizing the most accurate precipitation data is critical for studying local hydrological cycle in the tp the results in fig 11 provide information on the confidence that we can place on various simulated water and energy variables when utilizing global precipitation product data based on the results when precipitation product data have uncertainty the confidence should be decreasing from runoff gie to lst least confidence should be given to the simulations of runoff gie and highest confidence to lst simulation in addition to the information on the confidence the results in fig 11 also have many implications for example a few studies suggested utilizing lsts to calibrate the parameters of land surface hydrological models corbari and mancini 2014 silvestro et al 2015 koch et al 2016 however the results in fig 11 indicate that other simulated water and energy variables may have large uncertainties even when simulated lsts perform well when reliable hydrological gauge runoff data are not available using surface zone wetness sw which could be obtained from satellite based remote sensing data to calibrate models may generate better results than using lsts because sw is more sensitive than lsts to precipitation uncertainty in addition the results in fig 11 also imply that the requirement on the accuracy of precipitation data may not be strict in lst simulation in data sparse regions because lsts are least sensitive to precipitation uncertainty 3 4 discussion the pui index values are calculated on the basis of eleven years from 2000 to 2010 of data on the annual scale in this study and therefore the results in fig 11 are appropriate for long term mean annual scale studies which are common in large scale research and land surface and atmosphere interaction research e g wei et al 2008 wang erlandsson et al 2014 schellekens et al 2017 it should be noted that precipitation influence may change when study regions precipitation data used or and hydrological land surface models used vary however the developed sensitivity assessment criterion i e eq 3 is not case specific and should be applicable to other studies the results here do add important insights into the currently limited pool of knowledge regarding the distinguishing sensitivities of water and energy variables to uncertainties in precipitation data in the tp as shown in table 1 the average lai of the four river basins range from 0 22 to 0 55 which brackets the average lai value of the entire tp 0 29 in addition the selected four river basins span several climate zones and different hydrological regimes semiarid dry sub humid humid water limited and energy limited therefore the results in this study should be applicable to other regions in the tp the results in section 3 2 indicate some ensemble averages have good performance which could also provide a reference for the confidence that could be put on simulated ensemble averages in data sparse regions however the confidence gained from the ensemble averages could be very similar for different variables because the ensemble averages of several variables have similar performance different from the confidence obtained from the ensemble averages the sensitivity information in fig 11 distinguishes the difference in the confidence that could be assigned to each of the simulated variables the web dhm model has been calibrated and validated against the hydrological gauge observation and modis lsts and the results show web dhm performs well recall the results in section 3 1 thus the input data processing model calibration and validation approaches and calibrated parameters are considered appropriate and acceptable 4 conclusions this study investigates the divergent sensitivity of various water and energy variables to precipitation uncertainty in the tp four large river basins with diversified vegetation coverages climates and hydrological regimes are used eight global precipitation products are utilized as the input to a well calibrated and validated distributed hydrological model simulating water and energy budgets this study is unique in that it quantified the distinguishing sensitivity of water and energy variables to precipitation uncertainty in the tp based on the newly developed sensitivity analysis approach the results provide improved understanding and appropriate interpretation of water and energy variable simulations in the tp when different global precipitation products are used to force the model this knowledge is especially useful in data sparse regions like the tp the major contributions of this study are summarized as follows first runoff is more sensitive to precipitation uncertainties than most variables in general therefore less confidence should be given to runoff simulation than others when using global precipitation products in ungauged regions second lsts are least sensitive to precipitation uncertainty among all variables considered more confidence can be attached to the simulated lsts and other variables may have large uncertainty even when simulated lsts are accurate this result implies that calibrating the parameters of land surface hydrological models using lsts could be problematic when precipitation has uncertainty third canopy interception loss has a relatively high sensitivity to precipitation uncertainty because canopy interception loss has profound influence on local hydrological cycle utilizing the most accurate precipitation data is critical for realistically representing local scale hydrological cycle in the four basins on the tp the methodology introduced in this paper could be used in other regions with more information on the sensitivity more precise confidence information on simulated variables using global precipitation products could be gained in data sparse regions declaration of competing interest the authors

5856,identification of the periodic variability of precipitation is of paramount importance for rainfall modeling and forecasting but it is also a challenge in this article we 1 identify the periodic variability of summer precipitation in china at interannual and decadal scales and 2 explore its physical connection to the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo the summer precipitation data in 1961 2013 from 520 meteorological stations across china and the empirical mode decomposition based method are used for this study results show that at the interannual and decadal timescales summer precipitation exhibits significant periodicities which can be attributed to the variability of pdo and amo with high correlations only in four small regions northwest corner of china most parts of the songliao river basin srb the huang huai hai plain and the south boundary of the yangtze river basin yrb however their effects with spatial variability in strength and direction are distinguished as four types due to the spatial variability in the changes in water vapor flux between warm and cold pdo amo phases precipitation is mainly connected to 1 amo in the northwest corner of china with the same phase 2 pdo in most parts of srb and lower reach of yrb keeping the same phase 3 pdo in the mid reach of the yellow river basin eastward to the northern huai river basin and the southeast river basin with the inverse phase and 4 both pdo and amo in the mid reach of yrb where a positive pdo and a negative amo phase cause precipitation surplus for the four horizontal three vertical national water transfer framework in china the decadal variability of summer precipitation between the water exporting and importing regions keeps an inverse phase due to the pdo and amo effects although allocation of water resources over a large region through huge water transfer projects in china and elsewhere often yield favorable results for water security the periodic variability of precipitation and especially the anthropogenic effects needs to be carefully considered and evaluated to maximize the benefits keywords precipitation periodicity interannual and decadal changes spatial variability pacific decadal oscillation atlantic multidecadal oscillation 1 introduction adequate understanding of the occurrence amount and distribution of precipitation is crucial for a wide range of water resources and environmental applications precipitation exhibits significant variability in terms of frequency duration intensity and trend whether this variability in precipitation is the result of a significant periodic variability or arises from its inherent stochastic dynamic variations remains a largely unresolved question kottegoda et al 2004 rigby and porporato 2010 sun et al 2012 he et al 2017 while the significance of distinguishing between these two has been clearly recognized and attempts have also been made to achieve such rao and hamed 2003 sang et al 2012 zanchettin et al 2008 identifying a proper approach to this end remains a challenge due to the stochastic characteristics of precipitation paschalis et al 2013 thober et al 2014 anderson et al 2015 hu et al 2017 the challenge of the detection of the nature of variability of precipitation in a region becomes even greater for a country like china because of its large spatial extent and the different prevailing climatic conditions influencing factors and governing mechanisms shen et al 2010 sun et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 in regards to the physical causes of precipitation variability in china many studies have reported on the vital role of sea surface temperature sst for instance the pacific decadal oscillation pdo is the leading mode of decadal sst variability in the pacific ocean mantua and hare 2002 representing a large scale cyclonic with northwesterly anticyclonic with southeasterly wind anomalies over northern china in its warm cold phases a warm pdo phase with positive values would generally cause precipitation deficiency and increase in droughts over northern china ma 2007 zhang and zhou 2015 on the other hand a cold pdo phase with negative values may lead to significantly different outcomes for example the cold pdo phase that occurred in the late 1990s led to rainfall surplus in the lower reaches of the yellow river basin but also rainfall deficiency in the lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and north china zhu et al 2015 the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo kerr 2000 the atlantic sst has a certain physical relationship with pdo through the amo northern hemisphere teleconnection wave train si and ding 2016 yang et al 2017 consequently it may also influence precipitation occurrence over eastern china at decadal scales zhang et al 2013 but its degree of influence is generally weaker than that of pdo liu and chiang 2012 yang et al 2017 a warm pdo phase combined with a cold amo phase would generally cause summer rainfall surplus over eastern china but rainfall deficiency over northern china zhu et al 2016 many studies have also reported on the effects of el niño southern oscillation enso on the rainfall in china as enso has connection to the variability of pdo the pdo modulates the relationship between enso and the east asian summer monsoon chen et al 2013 which influences rainfall in east china the pdo also modulates the interannual variability of early summer rainfall over southern china including the pearl river basin by influencing enso related sst anomalies duan et al 2013 yang et al 2017 a warm pdo phase can cause rainfall deficiency in the region with part of the contribution coming from the negative enso mode chan and zhou 2005 several studies have confirmed the dominant roles of pdo and amo on the precipitation variability in china through their physical teleconnections which can occur at interannual decadal and larger timescales duan et al 2013 however the exact relationships of precipitation variability in china with pdo and amo remain less than clear because 1 there is a low explained variance smaller than 10 when investigating the correlations between precipitation and pdo and amo yang et al 2017 this is most likely due to the stochastic variations of precipitation and therefore evaluating the significance of periodic variability of precipitation is necessary and 2 the effects of pdo and amo on the periodic variability of precipitation may be spatially different but the regions where precipitation is sensitive to the variability of pdo and amo have not been clearly identified in view of these the main objective of this study is to investigate the periodic variability of precipitation in china with particular focus on its statistical significance and spatial variability furthermore the connection of periodic variability of precipitation to the leading modes i e pdo and amo of climate variability is examined and its potential influence on the allocation of water resources at the national scale is discussed summer precipitation data from 520 meteorological stations across china as well as summer pdo and amo data over the period of 1961 2013 are analyzed the empirical mode decomposition maximum entropy spectral analysis emd mesa method is employed for detecting the periodic variability of summer precipitation and for evaluating its relationship with pdo and amo 2 data and methodology 2 1 hydroclimatic data used precipitation in the central and eastern parts of china is mainly influenced by the asian monsoon awan et al 2015 and thus indicates obvious seasonal variability with more than half of the amount occurring during the summer season from may to september of every year because of this in this study we consider only the summer precipitation data for our investigation of precipitation variability at interannual and decadal scales we choose summer precipitation data over the period of 1961 2013 from each of 520 meteorological stations shown in fig s1 for detecting periodicities and for examining their connections to climate variability the length consistency and completeness of precipitation data from these 520 stations have been checked zhang et al 2015 for ensuring their reliability note that other data sources e g remote sensing data and reanalysis data are not considered to be more reliable zhu and sang 2018 and thus are not used here since there are only a very limited number of stations in the southwest regions especially in the tibetan plateau the results for this region may not be reliable and therefore are not discussed in the study apart from the precipitation data we collect the summer pdo and amo data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration https www ncdc noaa gov for the same period of 1961 2013 to investigate their effects on the periodic variability of summer precipitation in china and its spatial variability 2 2 identification of periodicities using emd mesa hydroclimatic time series are usually composed of stochastic periodic denoted as periodicities and trend components razavi and vogel 2018 the existence of stochastic components would contaminate the true periodicities and cause pseudo periodicities further multiple peak spectra of the time series are often encountered because of the existence of the periodic components at multi time scales and their mutual interference would increase the difficulty in identifying the periodicities traditional methods for detecting periodic components e g fast fourier transform periodogram method variance spectral density analysis are mainly spectral analyses techniques based on empirical autocorrelation functions or on fourier transform they work well for stationary and ergodic processes rao and hamed 2003 sang et al 2009 agarwal et al 2016 but fail in handling the mutual interference among stochastic components and multiple peak spectra of the time series coulibaly and baldwin 2005 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 sang 2013 kim et al 2018 causing biased or even wrong results to overcome these problems sang et al 2012 developed a method that couples empirical mode decomposition emd and maximum entropy spectral analysis mesa termed as the emd mesa method the emd mesa method has an advantage in that it first separates the different components and then removes the stochastic components through performing a significance test in this way the periodicities can be more accurately identified the steps for identifying periodicities using the emd mesa method are described as follows 1 use the emd method to decompose the original time series f t into a set of components called intrinsic mode functions imfs representing the oscillatory modes imbedded in f t huang et al 1998 as 1 f t i 1 n c i r n where n is the number of imfs separated from f t ci is the i th imf and rn is the residual that is usually a trend component 2 calculate the energy density ei of the ci i 1 2 n with the length n as 2 e i 1 n j 1 n c i j 2 3 consider the first ifm which is composed mainly of noise and use its energy density e 1 to rescale the energy densities of the rest of the imfs the result is defined as the energy level of f t 4 describe the spread function ρ yi of white noise using wu and huang 2004 3 ρ y i c exp n e y i y 2 4 w i t h c n n e 2 exp 1 2 n e 1 y where yi ln ei and e and y are the mean values of all ei and yi respectively 5 estimate the spread line of white noise s spread function at the concerned confidence level e g 95 using 4 y i x i k 2 n e x i 2 where xi ln t i t i is the mean period calculated from the spectrum of ci k is a constant estimated by certain confidence level of a standard normal distribution for example k 0 656 for the 95 confidence level 6 compare the energy level of the series f t with the spread line in eq 4 the imfs of series f t with their energy densities above the estimated spread line are thought as useful information and are taken as the true imfs while those below the estimated spread line are more likely composed of stochastic components and 7 use the mesa method to identify the periodicities in each of the true imfs and obtain them as the periodicities of the series f t we identify the periodicities in the summer precipitation series over the period 1961 2013 of each of the 520 stations using the emd mesa method because of the data length of 53 years the decomposition result of each precipitation series includes five components the component at the smallest largest timescale is generally composed of stochastic components trend the three residuals i e c 2 c 3 and c 4 in eq 1 are the periodic components at the interannual decadal and multidecadal scales and their significance is evaluated using eq 4 at 95 confidence level for distinguishing them from the stochastic variations due to the short data length of only 53 years the identification of periodicities at multidecadal scales i e c 4 component would have large uncertainty and thus they are not discussed here besides we compute the signal to noise ratio snr value of the summer precipitation series at each station for verification here the signal with variance vs is the sum of all the periodic components i e c 2 c 3 and c 4 except for the trend the noise with variance vn is the stochastic component i e c 1 at the smallest timescale therefore the signal to noise ratio is given as follows snr 2 ln vs vn the snr value reflects the ratio between the periodic components and the stochastic components therefore a larger snr value indicates a larger proportion of periodic component in the original series corresponding to more significant periodic variability of summer precipitation similarly a smaller snr value indicates a smaller proportion of periodic component corresponding to less significant periodic variability of summer precipitation we also evaluate the significance of the periodic variability of the summer pdo and amo using the emd mesa method and analyze their correlations with the summer precipitation further we explore the physical causes of the spatial variability in the periodicities of summer precipitation based on the changes in water vapor fluxes with the data sources from the research data archive at the national center for atmospheric research ncar https rda ucar edu 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of periodicities in summer precipitation out of the total 520 summer precipitation series observed across china analyzed in this study significant periodicities in summer precipitation at 95 confidence level cl are identified in only four specific regions covering only 112 stations these regions are the northwest corner of china most parts of the songliao river basin the huang huai hai plain 32 40 n 114 121 e an important grain producing area for food security in china and the southern boundary of the yangtze river basin and its northern parts fig 1 in most of the other regions covering as many as 408 stations periodic fluctuations in summer precipitation are insignificant at 95 cl rather the fluctuations tend to be stochastic variations in the four regions with significant periodicities in summer precipitation at the interannual 5 8 yr and decadal 10 18 yr scales with their periodicities shown in fig s2 the snr values are greater than 1 6 and even greater than 5 0 in some local regions as shown in fig 1 this indicates a larger proportion of periodic components in the original precipitation series than the proportion of stochastic components however in the other regions without significant periodicities in summer precipitation the snr values are smaller than 1 6 especially in the regions from the middle region of the yangtze river basin up to the northern boundary of china the spatial distribution of the significant periodicities in summer precipitation and that of the snr values match well shown in fig 1 this reflects that the significance of periodicities is closely connected to their proportion in the original precipitation series thus verifying the reasonableness of the results obtained using the emd mesa method 3 2 correlation between pdo amo and summer precipitation the variability of summer pdo and amo during 1961 2013 is shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b indicates the significant periodicities of the summer amo at interannual and decadal scales at 95 cl as its second and third mean normalized energy densities defined in eq 2 are above 95 cl while the variability of the summer pdo at interannual and decadal scales are insignificant at 95 cl for calculating the spearman correlation coefficients between summer precipitation and pdo and amo the stochastic components in each of the original series are removed to eliminate their influence and the effective data length is also determined by considering the influence of serial autocorrelation for doing significance test fig 3 shows that the degrees and directions of the relationship of summer precipitation with summer pdo fig 3 left and amo fig 3 right vary with regions overall there is an inverse relationship of summer precipitation with summer pdo and amo with their negative relationship shown in fig s3 except for the northwest corner of china and some regions in the yangtze river delta comparatively the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficients between summer precipitation and summer amo fig 3 right matches better with that of the significant periodicities of summer precipitation when compared to the results obtained for summer pdo note that similar correlation results can also be obtained from the original data see fig s4 indicating its reliability however in those regions with significant periodicities of summer precipitation the correlations between the summer precipitation and pdo amo are not significant at 90 cl especially for amo this suggests that the variability of summer pdo or amo alone cannot completely explain the periodic variability of summer precipitation to investigate the combined effects of the summer pdo and amo on summer precipitation we perform a linear regression of summer precipitation at each station against the combination of a pdo b amo the values of the parameters a 0 553 to 0 531 and b 0 649 to 0 661 are obtained from the ordinary least squares method their spatial distributions shown in fig s5 are similar to those of the correlation results in fig 3 further the ratio of a b is computed to quantify the different effects of summer pdo and amo on summer precipitation at each station a negative positive value of a b reflects the inverse consistent effects of pdo and amo absolute values of a b greater less than 1 indicate stronger effects of pdo amo on precipitation rather than amo pdo fig 4 left presents the spatial distribution of the effects including both direction and strength of summer pdo and amo on summer precipitation the summer pdo more strongly influences the summer precipitation with absolute a b value 1 5 in most parts of the songliao river basin the lower reach of the yellow river basin eastward to the northern part of the huai river basin the lower reach of the yangtze river basin yrb the southeast river basin and the southwest corner of china in these regions the summer amo also contributes a small part to the summer precipitation variability with a positive effect as pdo in the lower reach of yrb and the local southwest corner of china but with an inverse effect in the other regions in the middle reach of yrb and its southern boundary the summer pdo and amo with similar strengths with absolute a b value of 0 5 1 5 indicate an inverse effect on summer precipitation however in the northwest corner of china except its far north part summer precipitation is more influenced by summer amo with absolute a b value 0 5 rather than by summer pdo the correlations between the estimated linear regression series and the summer precipitation series are further analyzed fig 4 right shows their significant correlations at 90 cl with absolute values of correlation coefficient bigger than 0 28 observed in most parts of the songliao river basin and the northwest corner of china in other regions with significant periodicities of summer precipitation their correlations overall are significant at 80 cl the weak correlations in some areas may be due to the stochastic variability of precipitation and anthropogenic effects for instance their weak correlations in the lower reach of yrb may be due to the rapid urban development which can significantly influence the precipitation variability indeed studies have reported that rapid urban development has changed the local terrestrial surface and energy balance caused mutual enhancement and superposition of the urban rain island effect and heat island effect and further increased the complexity of precipitation variability in recent decades sang et al 2013 hu et al 2019 overall the consistency of the above results suggests the reliability of the significant periodicities identified in summer precipitation data and their connections with the variability of summer pdo and amo summer precipitation indicates significant periodicities at interannual and decadal scales in only four specific regions in china but not for the other regions the variability of summer precipitation in the four regions is mainly influenced by the summer pdo and amo but the effects of pdo and amo vary in space 3 3 exploration of physical causes previous studies have reported on the north south dipole structure of precipitation in east china with the typical spatial pattern of southern flooding drought and northern drought flooding liu and chiang 2012 yang et al 2017 and the main channel of the yangtze river as its boundary compared to such studies the new finding from the present study is the identification of a more detailed spatial pattern of precipitation variability in east china in addition three local regions are also distinguished see fig 4 to explore the physical causes of the spatial variability in the relationship between summer precipitation and pdo amo we compare the changes in the water vapor fluxes wvfs in different warm and cold pdo amo phases for this purpose the period 1995 1997 is chosen to represent the warm pdo phase and the period 2010 2013 is chosen to represent the cold pdo phase in these two periods amo keeps its warm phases to ensure its weak influence on the precipitation pdo relationship the results indicate more wvfs at the 500 hpa in north china compared with south china in the warm pdo phases fig 5 a but more wvfs in south china in the cold pdo phases fig 5 b considering their difference fig 5 c clearly indicates that the north south dipole structure of wvfs at the 500 hpa between the warm and cold pdo phases is similar to the spatial pattern of precipitation reported in previous studies liu and chiang 2012 yang et al 2017 however it is also found that wvfs at the 850 hpa are larger and basically exhibit an inverse spatial pattern compared with that at the 500 hpa regardless of whether the pdo phase is warm or cold fig 5 d and e the difference in wvfs at the 850 hpa between the warm and cold pdo phases and especially its spatial variability fig 5 f matches well with that of the summer precipitation in the middle and eastern parts of china see fig 4 furthermore the period 2003 2006 1992 1994 is chosen to represent the warm cold amo phase during these phases the pdo keeps its warm phases and thus has weak influence on the precipitation amo relationship the results indicate smaller wvfs implying a weaker influence of amo compared with that of pdo the wvfs are large in high and low altitudes at the 500 hpa fig 6 a and b and in south china at the 850 hpa fig 6 d and e the difference in wvfs between the warm and cold amo phases has positive values at the northwest corner of china and the southeast border regions of china fig 6 c and f overall the changes in the wvf intensity in different pdo and amo phases and their spatial variability match well with the spatial distribution of summer precipitation fig 4 reflecting their physical connection and explaining the physical causes of the significant periodicities of summer precipitation and their spatial variability from the above results the connection between summer precipitation and pdo and amo can be distinguished as four types as shown in fig 7 1 precipitation is mainly connected to the amo variability in the northwest corner of china where a positive amo phase would cause precipitation surplus 2 in most parts of the songliao river basin and the lower reach of the yangtze river basin precipitation is mainly connected to the pdo variability and a positive pdo phase would cause precipitation surplus 3 in the lower reach of the yellow river basin eastward to the northern part of the huai river basin and the southeast river basin summer precipitation is mainly connected to the pdo variability and a negative pdo phase would cause precipitation surplus and 4 precipitation is connected to both the pdo and amo variability in the middle reach of the yangtze river basin and its southern boundary where a positive pdo phase combined with a negative amo phase would cause precipitation surplus 4 discussion hydroclimatic processes in china exhibit significant spatiotemporal variability as a result the spatial distribution of water resources is extremely uneven with more amount in the south and less amount in the north jiang 2009 this creates great difficulties in water resources planning and management agricultural development eco environmental system preservation and coordinated socioeconomic development among regions especially in the north and northwest china construction of water transfer projects can be an effective approach to deal with the uneven distribution of water resources in time to account for dry and wet periods and space to account for water affluent and shortage areas for ensuring water security in china indeed many water transfer projects have already been constructed and are operating throughout china and many others are being designed and constructed among such projects the four major rivers the hai yellow huai and yangtze and the south north water transfer snwt project with east central and west routes compose the primary four horizontal three vertical water transfer framework at the national scale see fig 7 however the impacts of the periodic variability of hydrological processes especially at large timescales on the operation of these huge water transfer projects have not been thoroughly considered for example the central route of the snwt project has been operating since 2014 aiming at transferring 14 billion m3 water per year from the hanjiang river a tributary in the middle reach of the yangtze river basin to north china a severe water shortage region however the hanjiang river basin the supposedly surplus basin has been experiencing dry periods in recent years and consequently the quantity of water available has been decreasing sharply this has made the water transfer difficult and the planning and management complicated in this regard the results presented in figs 3 and 4 indicate a favorable condition of precipitation variability for transferring water across china the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin serve an important water exporting region for transferring water out to north china water importing areas a positive pdo combined with a negative amo would cause precipitation surplus in the middle and lower reaches of yrb water exporting region but precipitation deficiency in north china water importing region this implies that precipitation at interannual and decadal scales keeps an inverse phase between the water exporting and importing areas and thus the abundant water in the yangtze river basin in wet periods can be supplied to north china that is more likely in its dry periods concurrently to more efficiently and effectively achieve such water transfer however a reliable quantification of the periodic variability of precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin is crucial it is also important to note that with the anthropogenic effects the dynamics of the variability of streamflow and water resources are much more complex than that of precipitation and thus are even more difficult to predict therefore reliable hydrological prediction at large timescales is clearly required the significant periodicities of summer precipitation identified in this study can be a useful guide for long term simulation and prediction of hydrological processes in china some past studies have attempted prediction of the southern drought and northern flooding pattern of precipitation in east china over the next two decades wang et al 2014 yang et al 2017 however they also point out that such prediction should be cautiously considered especially because of the low explained variance from climate variability yang et al 2017 the uncertainty in prediction is mainly due to the limited investigation of significant periodic variability of precipitation considering both the periodic variability of precipitation fig 1 and pdo and amo fig 2 summer precipitation during the next decade should refer to the southern drought and northern flooding pattern in the regions covering the central and east routes of the snwt project however there would still be a large uncertainty for the next second decade 5 conclusions precipitation exhibits stochastic variations and therefore detection of its significant periodic variability at multi time scales is a challenge in this study we analyzed the precipitation data observed during the period 1961 2013 at each of 520 stations across china to detect the periodic variability of summer precipitation specifically we employed the emd mesa method to identify the periodic variability of summer precipitation at interannual and decadal scales the results suggested that the variability of summer precipitation could be attributed to the summer pdo and amo in four specific regions with high correlations however the strength and direction of their relationship were found to show spatial variability due to the obvious differences in the spatial variability of water vapor flux between warm and cold amo pdo phases based on it the connections between summer precipitation and pdo and amo in china were distinguished as four types regarding the primary four horizontal three vertical water transfer framework in china the periodic variability of summer precipitation between the water exporting middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and importing north china regions was found to keep an inverse phase at interannual and decadal scales due to the pdo and amo effects this is favorable for water resources allocation at the national scale however it is important to properly assess and predict the periodic variability of precipitation and also evaluate the anthropogenic effects on the streamflow variability to achieve a more efficient and effective operation of water transfer projects and maximum benefit in closing discriminating the significant periodicities from the stochastic variations of precipitation would be helpful and important for understanding the response of precipitation to climate change the results from the present study can guide long term simulation and prediction of hydrological processes in china and the approach can be extended to any region around the world based on both the periodic variability of precipitation and the pdo and amo precipitation during the next decade should refer to the southern drought and northern flooding pattern in the south north water transfer snwt project controlled region and more effective operation rules should be formulated

5856,identification of the periodic variability of precipitation is of paramount importance for rainfall modeling and forecasting but it is also a challenge in this article we 1 identify the periodic variability of summer precipitation in china at interannual and decadal scales and 2 explore its physical connection to the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo the summer precipitation data in 1961 2013 from 520 meteorological stations across china and the empirical mode decomposition based method are used for this study results show that at the interannual and decadal timescales summer precipitation exhibits significant periodicities which can be attributed to the variability of pdo and amo with high correlations only in four small regions northwest corner of china most parts of the songliao river basin srb the huang huai hai plain and the south boundary of the yangtze river basin yrb however their effects with spatial variability in strength and direction are distinguished as four types due to the spatial variability in the changes in water vapor flux between warm and cold pdo amo phases precipitation is mainly connected to 1 amo in the northwest corner of china with the same phase 2 pdo in most parts of srb and lower reach of yrb keeping the same phase 3 pdo in the mid reach of the yellow river basin eastward to the northern huai river basin and the southeast river basin with the inverse phase and 4 both pdo and amo in the mid reach of yrb where a positive pdo and a negative amo phase cause precipitation surplus for the four horizontal three vertical national water transfer framework in china the decadal variability of summer precipitation between the water exporting and importing regions keeps an inverse phase due to the pdo and amo effects although allocation of water resources over a large region through huge water transfer projects in china and elsewhere often yield favorable results for water security the periodic variability of precipitation and especially the anthropogenic effects needs to be carefully considered and evaluated to maximize the benefits keywords precipitation periodicity interannual and decadal changes spatial variability pacific decadal oscillation atlantic multidecadal oscillation 1 introduction adequate understanding of the occurrence amount and distribution of precipitation is crucial for a wide range of water resources and environmental applications precipitation exhibits significant variability in terms of frequency duration intensity and trend whether this variability in precipitation is the result of a significant periodic variability or arises from its inherent stochastic dynamic variations remains a largely unresolved question kottegoda et al 2004 rigby and porporato 2010 sun et al 2012 he et al 2017 while the significance of distinguishing between these two has been clearly recognized and attempts have also been made to achieve such rao and hamed 2003 sang et al 2012 zanchettin et al 2008 identifying a proper approach to this end remains a challenge due to the stochastic characteristics of precipitation paschalis et al 2013 thober et al 2014 anderson et al 2015 hu et al 2017 the challenge of the detection of the nature of variability of precipitation in a region becomes even greater for a country like china because of its large spatial extent and the different prevailing climatic conditions influencing factors and governing mechanisms shen et al 2010 sun et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 in regards to the physical causes of precipitation variability in china many studies have reported on the vital role of sea surface temperature sst for instance the pacific decadal oscillation pdo is the leading mode of decadal sst variability in the pacific ocean mantua and hare 2002 representing a large scale cyclonic with northwesterly anticyclonic with southeasterly wind anomalies over northern china in its warm cold phases a warm pdo phase with positive values would generally cause precipitation deficiency and increase in droughts over northern china ma 2007 zhang and zhou 2015 on the other hand a cold pdo phase with negative values may lead to significantly different outcomes for example the cold pdo phase that occurred in the late 1990s led to rainfall surplus in the lower reaches of the yellow river basin but also rainfall deficiency in the lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and north china zhu et al 2015 the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo kerr 2000 the atlantic sst has a certain physical relationship with pdo through the amo northern hemisphere teleconnection wave train si and ding 2016 yang et al 2017 consequently it may also influence precipitation occurrence over eastern china at decadal scales zhang et al 2013 but its degree of influence is generally weaker than that of pdo liu and chiang 2012 yang et al 2017 a warm pdo phase combined with a cold amo phase would generally cause summer rainfall surplus over eastern china but rainfall deficiency over northern china zhu et al 2016 many studies have also reported on the effects of el niño southern oscillation enso on the rainfall in china as enso has connection to the variability of pdo the pdo modulates the relationship between enso and the east asian summer monsoon chen et al 2013 which influences rainfall in east china the pdo also modulates the interannual variability of early summer rainfall over southern china including the pearl river basin by influencing enso related sst anomalies duan et al 2013 yang et al 2017 a warm pdo phase can cause rainfall deficiency in the region with part of the contribution coming from the negative enso mode chan and zhou 2005 several studies have confirmed the dominant roles of pdo and amo on the precipitation variability in china through their physical teleconnections which can occur at interannual decadal and larger timescales duan et al 2013 however the exact relationships of precipitation variability in china with pdo and amo remain less than clear because 1 there is a low explained variance smaller than 10 when investigating the correlations between precipitation and pdo and amo yang et al 2017 this is most likely due to the stochastic variations of precipitation and therefore evaluating the significance of periodic variability of precipitation is necessary and 2 the effects of pdo and amo on the periodic variability of precipitation may be spatially different but the regions where precipitation is sensitive to the variability of pdo and amo have not been clearly identified in view of these the main objective of this study is to investigate the periodic variability of precipitation in china with particular focus on its statistical significance and spatial variability furthermore the connection of periodic variability of precipitation to the leading modes i e pdo and amo of climate variability is examined and its potential influence on the allocation of water resources at the national scale is discussed summer precipitation data from 520 meteorological stations across china as well as summer pdo and amo data over the period of 1961 2013 are analyzed the empirical mode decomposition maximum entropy spectral analysis emd mesa method is employed for detecting the periodic variability of summer precipitation and for evaluating its relationship with pdo and amo 2 data and methodology 2 1 hydroclimatic data used precipitation in the central and eastern parts of china is mainly influenced by the asian monsoon awan et al 2015 and thus indicates obvious seasonal variability with more than half of the amount occurring during the summer season from may to september of every year because of this in this study we consider only the summer precipitation data for our investigation of precipitation variability at interannual and decadal scales we choose summer precipitation data over the period of 1961 2013 from each of 520 meteorological stations shown in fig s1 for detecting periodicities and for examining their connections to climate variability the length consistency and completeness of precipitation data from these 520 stations have been checked zhang et al 2015 for ensuring their reliability note that other data sources e g remote sensing data and reanalysis data are not considered to be more reliable zhu and sang 2018 and thus are not used here since there are only a very limited number of stations in the southwest regions especially in the tibetan plateau the results for this region may not be reliable and therefore are not discussed in the study apart from the precipitation data we collect the summer pdo and amo data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration https www ncdc noaa gov for the same period of 1961 2013 to investigate their effects on the periodic variability of summer precipitation in china and its spatial variability 2 2 identification of periodicities using emd mesa hydroclimatic time series are usually composed of stochastic periodic denoted as periodicities and trend components razavi and vogel 2018 the existence of stochastic components would contaminate the true periodicities and cause pseudo periodicities further multiple peak spectra of the time series are often encountered because of the existence of the periodic components at multi time scales and their mutual interference would increase the difficulty in identifying the periodicities traditional methods for detecting periodic components e g fast fourier transform periodogram method variance spectral density analysis are mainly spectral analyses techniques based on empirical autocorrelation functions or on fourier transform they work well for stationary and ergodic processes rao and hamed 2003 sang et al 2009 agarwal et al 2016 but fail in handling the mutual interference among stochastic components and multiple peak spectra of the time series coulibaly and baldwin 2005 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 sang 2013 kim et al 2018 causing biased or even wrong results to overcome these problems sang et al 2012 developed a method that couples empirical mode decomposition emd and maximum entropy spectral analysis mesa termed as the emd mesa method the emd mesa method has an advantage in that it first separates the different components and then removes the stochastic components through performing a significance test in this way the periodicities can be more accurately identified the steps for identifying periodicities using the emd mesa method are described as follows 1 use the emd method to decompose the original time series f t into a set of components called intrinsic mode functions imfs representing the oscillatory modes imbedded in f t huang et al 1998 as 1 f t i 1 n c i r n where n is the number of imfs separated from f t ci is the i th imf and rn is the residual that is usually a trend component 2 calculate the energy density ei of the ci i 1 2 n with the length n as 2 e i 1 n j 1 n c i j 2 3 consider the first ifm which is composed mainly of noise and use its energy density e 1 to rescale the energy densities of the rest of the imfs the result is defined as the energy level of f t 4 describe the spread function ρ yi of white noise using wu and huang 2004 3 ρ y i c exp n e y i y 2 4 w i t h c n n e 2 exp 1 2 n e 1 y where yi ln ei and e and y are the mean values of all ei and yi respectively 5 estimate the spread line of white noise s spread function at the concerned confidence level e g 95 using 4 y i x i k 2 n e x i 2 where xi ln t i t i is the mean period calculated from the spectrum of ci k is a constant estimated by certain confidence level of a standard normal distribution for example k 0 656 for the 95 confidence level 6 compare the energy level of the series f t with the spread line in eq 4 the imfs of series f t with their energy densities above the estimated spread line are thought as useful information and are taken as the true imfs while those below the estimated spread line are more likely composed of stochastic components and 7 use the mesa method to identify the periodicities in each of the true imfs and obtain them as the periodicities of the series f t we identify the periodicities in the summer precipitation series over the period 1961 2013 of each of the 520 stations using the emd mesa method because of the data length of 53 years the decomposition result of each precipitation series includes five components the component at the smallest largest timescale is generally composed of stochastic components trend the three residuals i e c 2 c 3 and c 4 in eq 1 are the periodic components at the interannual decadal and multidecadal scales and their significance is evaluated using eq 4 at 95 confidence level for distinguishing them from the stochastic variations due to the short data length of only 53 years the identification of periodicities at multidecadal scales i e c 4 component would have large uncertainty and thus they are not discussed here besides we compute the signal to noise ratio snr value of the summer precipitation series at each station for verification here the signal with variance vs is the sum of all the periodic components i e c 2 c 3 and c 4 except for the trend the noise with variance vn is the stochastic component i e c 1 at the smallest timescale therefore the signal to noise ratio is given as follows snr 2 ln vs vn the snr value reflects the ratio between the periodic components and the stochastic components therefore a larger snr value indicates a larger proportion of periodic component in the original series corresponding to more significant periodic variability of summer precipitation similarly a smaller snr value indicates a smaller proportion of periodic component corresponding to less significant periodic variability of summer precipitation we also evaluate the significance of the periodic variability of the summer pdo and amo using the emd mesa method and analyze their correlations with the summer precipitation further we explore the physical causes of the spatial variability in the periodicities of summer precipitation based on the changes in water vapor fluxes with the data sources from the research data archive at the national center for atmospheric research ncar https rda ucar edu 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of periodicities in summer precipitation out of the total 520 summer precipitation series observed across china analyzed in this study significant periodicities in summer precipitation at 95 confidence level cl are identified in only four specific regions covering only 112 stations these regions are the northwest corner of china most parts of the songliao river basin the huang huai hai plain 32 40 n 114 121 e an important grain producing area for food security in china and the southern boundary of the yangtze river basin and its northern parts fig 1 in most of the other regions covering as many as 408 stations periodic fluctuations in summer precipitation are insignificant at 95 cl rather the fluctuations tend to be stochastic variations in the four regions with significant periodicities in summer precipitation at the interannual 5 8 yr and decadal 10 18 yr scales with their periodicities shown in fig s2 the snr values are greater than 1 6 and even greater than 5 0 in some local regions as shown in fig 1 this indicates a larger proportion of periodic components in the original precipitation series than the proportion of stochastic components however in the other regions without significant periodicities in summer precipitation the snr values are smaller than 1 6 especially in the regions from the middle region of the yangtze river basin up to the northern boundary of china the spatial distribution of the significant periodicities in summer precipitation and that of the snr values match well shown in fig 1 this reflects that the significance of periodicities is closely connected to their proportion in the original precipitation series thus verifying the reasonableness of the results obtained using the emd mesa method 3 2 correlation between pdo amo and summer precipitation the variability of summer pdo and amo during 1961 2013 is shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b indicates the significant periodicities of the summer amo at interannual and decadal scales at 95 cl as its second and third mean normalized energy densities defined in eq 2 are above 95 cl while the variability of the summer pdo at interannual and decadal scales are insignificant at 95 cl for calculating the spearman correlation coefficients between summer precipitation and pdo and amo the stochastic components in each of the original series are removed to eliminate their influence and the effective data length is also determined by considering the influence of serial autocorrelation for doing significance test fig 3 shows that the degrees and directions of the relationship of summer precipitation with summer pdo fig 3 left and amo fig 3 right vary with regions overall there is an inverse relationship of summer precipitation with summer pdo and amo with their negative relationship shown in fig s3 except for the northwest corner of china and some regions in the yangtze river delta comparatively the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficients between summer precipitation and summer amo fig 3 right matches better with that of the significant periodicities of summer precipitation when compared to the results obtained for summer pdo note that similar correlation results can also be obtained from the original data see fig s4 indicating its reliability however in those regions with significant periodicities of summer precipitation the correlations between the summer precipitation and pdo amo are not significant at 90 cl especially for amo this suggests that the variability of summer pdo or amo alone cannot completely explain the periodic variability of summer precipitation to investigate the combined effects of the summer pdo and amo on summer precipitation we perform a linear regression of summer precipitation at each station against the combination of a pdo b amo the values of the parameters a 0 553 to 0 531 and b 0 649 to 0 661 are obtained from the ordinary least squares method their spatial distributions shown in fig s5 are similar to those of the correlation results in fig 3 further the ratio of a b is computed to quantify the different effects of summer pdo and amo on summer precipitation at each station a negative positive value of a b reflects the inverse consistent effects of pdo and amo absolute values of a b greater less than 1 indicate stronger effects of pdo amo on precipitation rather than amo pdo fig 4 left presents the spatial distribution of the effects including both direction and strength of summer pdo and amo on summer precipitation the summer pdo more strongly influences the summer precipitation with absolute a b value 1 5 in most parts of the songliao river basin the lower reach of the yellow river basin eastward to the northern part of the huai river basin the lower reach of the yangtze river basin yrb the southeast river basin and the southwest corner of china in these regions the summer amo also contributes a small part to the summer precipitation variability with a positive effect as pdo in the lower reach of yrb and the local southwest corner of china but with an inverse effect in the other regions in the middle reach of yrb and its southern boundary the summer pdo and amo with similar strengths with absolute a b value of 0 5 1 5 indicate an inverse effect on summer precipitation however in the northwest corner of china except its far north part summer precipitation is more influenced by summer amo with absolute a b value 0 5 rather than by summer pdo the correlations between the estimated linear regression series and the summer precipitation series are further analyzed fig 4 right shows their significant correlations at 90 cl with absolute values of correlation coefficient bigger than 0 28 observed in most parts of the songliao river basin and the northwest corner of china in other regions with significant periodicities of summer precipitation their correlations overall are significant at 80 cl the weak correlations in some areas may be due to the stochastic variability of precipitation and anthropogenic effects for instance their weak correlations in the lower reach of yrb may be due to the rapid urban development which can significantly influence the precipitation variability indeed studies have reported that rapid urban development has changed the local terrestrial surface and energy balance caused mutual enhancement and superposition of the urban rain island effect and heat island effect and further increased the complexity of precipitation variability in recent decades sang et al 2013 hu et al 2019 overall the consistency of the above results suggests the reliability of the significant periodicities identified in summer precipitation data and their connections with the variability of summer pdo and amo summer precipitation indicates significant periodicities at interannual and decadal scales in only four specific regions in china but not for the other regions the variability of summer precipitation in the four regions is mainly influenced by the summer pdo and amo but the effects of pdo and amo vary in space 3 3 exploration of physical causes previous studies have reported on the north south dipole structure of precipitation in east china with the typical spatial pattern of southern flooding drought and northern drought flooding liu and chiang 2012 yang et al 2017 and the main channel of the yangtze river as its boundary compared to such studies the new finding from the present study is the identification of a more detailed spatial pattern of precipitation variability in east china in addition three local regions are also distinguished see fig 4 to explore the physical causes of the spatial variability in the relationship between summer precipitation and pdo amo we compare the changes in the water vapor fluxes wvfs in different warm and cold pdo amo phases for this purpose the period 1995 1997 is chosen to represent the warm pdo phase and the period 2010 2013 is chosen to represent the cold pdo phase in these two periods amo keeps its warm phases to ensure its weak influence on the precipitation pdo relationship the results indicate more wvfs at the 500 hpa in north china compared with south china in the warm pdo phases fig 5 a but more wvfs in south china in the cold pdo phases fig 5 b considering their difference fig 5 c clearly indicates that the north south dipole structure of wvfs at the 500 hpa between the warm and cold pdo phases is similar to the spatial pattern of precipitation reported in previous studies liu and chiang 2012 yang et al 2017 however it is also found that wvfs at the 850 hpa are larger and basically exhibit an inverse spatial pattern compared with that at the 500 hpa regardless of whether the pdo phase is warm or cold fig 5 d and e the difference in wvfs at the 850 hpa between the warm and cold pdo phases and especially its spatial variability fig 5 f matches well with that of the summer precipitation in the middle and eastern parts of china see fig 4 furthermore the period 2003 2006 1992 1994 is chosen to represent the warm cold amo phase during these phases the pdo keeps its warm phases and thus has weak influence on the precipitation amo relationship the results indicate smaller wvfs implying a weaker influence of amo compared with that of pdo the wvfs are large in high and low altitudes at the 500 hpa fig 6 a and b and in south china at the 850 hpa fig 6 d and e the difference in wvfs between the warm and cold amo phases has positive values at the northwest corner of china and the southeast border regions of china fig 6 c and f overall the changes in the wvf intensity in different pdo and amo phases and their spatial variability match well with the spatial distribution of summer precipitation fig 4 reflecting their physical connection and explaining the physical causes of the significant periodicities of summer precipitation and their spatial variability from the above results the connection between summer precipitation and pdo and amo can be distinguished as four types as shown in fig 7 1 precipitation is mainly connected to the amo variability in the northwest corner of china where a positive amo phase would cause precipitation surplus 2 in most parts of the songliao river basin and the lower reach of the yangtze river basin precipitation is mainly connected to the pdo variability and a positive pdo phase would cause precipitation surplus 3 in the lower reach of the yellow river basin eastward to the northern part of the huai river basin and the southeast river basin summer precipitation is mainly connected to the pdo variability and a negative pdo phase would cause precipitation surplus and 4 precipitation is connected to both the pdo and amo variability in the middle reach of the yangtze river basin and its southern boundary where a positive pdo phase combined with a negative amo phase would cause precipitation surplus 4 discussion hydroclimatic processes in china exhibit significant spatiotemporal variability as a result the spatial distribution of water resources is extremely uneven with more amount in the south and less amount in the north jiang 2009 this creates great difficulties in water resources planning and management agricultural development eco environmental system preservation and coordinated socioeconomic development among regions especially in the north and northwest china construction of water transfer projects can be an effective approach to deal with the uneven distribution of water resources in time to account for dry and wet periods and space to account for water affluent and shortage areas for ensuring water security in china indeed many water transfer projects have already been constructed and are operating throughout china and many others are being designed and constructed among such projects the four major rivers the hai yellow huai and yangtze and the south north water transfer snwt project with east central and west routes compose the primary four horizontal three vertical water transfer framework at the national scale see fig 7 however the impacts of the periodic variability of hydrological processes especially at large timescales on the operation of these huge water transfer projects have not been thoroughly considered for example the central route of the snwt project has been operating since 2014 aiming at transferring 14 billion m3 water per year from the hanjiang river a tributary in the middle reach of the yangtze river basin to north china a severe water shortage region however the hanjiang river basin the supposedly surplus basin has been experiencing dry periods in recent years and consequently the quantity of water available has been decreasing sharply this has made the water transfer difficult and the planning and management complicated in this regard the results presented in figs 3 and 4 indicate a favorable condition of precipitation variability for transferring water across china the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin serve an important water exporting region for transferring water out to north china water importing areas a positive pdo combined with a negative amo would cause precipitation surplus in the middle and lower reaches of yrb water exporting region but precipitation deficiency in north china water importing region this implies that precipitation at interannual and decadal scales keeps an inverse phase between the water exporting and importing areas and thus the abundant water in the yangtze river basin in wet periods can be supplied to north china that is more likely in its dry periods concurrently to more efficiently and effectively achieve such water transfer however a reliable quantification of the periodic variability of precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin is crucial it is also important to note that with the anthropogenic effects the dynamics of the variability of streamflow and water resources are much more complex than that of precipitation and thus are even more difficult to predict therefore reliable hydrological prediction at large timescales is clearly required the significant periodicities of summer precipitation identified in this study can be a useful guide for long term simulation and prediction of hydrological processes in china some past studies have attempted prediction of the southern drought and northern flooding pattern of precipitation in east china over the next two decades wang et al 2014 yang et al 2017 however they also point out that such prediction should be cautiously considered especially because of the low explained variance from climate variability yang et al 2017 the uncertainty in prediction is mainly due to the limited investigation of significant periodic variability of precipitation considering both the periodic variability of precipitation fig 1 and pdo and amo fig 2 summer precipitation during the next decade should refer to the southern drought and northern flooding pattern in the regions covering the central and east routes of the snwt project however there would still be a large uncertainty for the next second decade 5 conclusions precipitation exhibits stochastic variations and therefore detection of its significant periodic variability at multi time scales is a challenge in this study we analyzed the precipitation data observed during the period 1961 2013 at each of 520 stations across china to detect the periodic variability of summer precipitation specifically we employed the emd mesa method to identify the periodic variability of summer precipitation at interannual and decadal scales the results suggested that the variability of summer precipitation could be attributed to the summer pdo and amo in four specific regions with high correlations however the strength and direction of their relationship were found to show spatial variability due to the obvious differences in the spatial variability of water vapor flux between warm and cold amo pdo phases based on it the connections between summer precipitation and pdo and amo in china were distinguished as four types regarding the primary four horizontal three vertical water transfer framework in china the periodic variability of summer precipitation between the water exporting middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and importing north china regions was found to keep an inverse phase at interannual and decadal scales due to the pdo and amo effects this is favorable for water resources allocation at the national scale however it is important to properly assess and predict the periodic variability of precipitation and also evaluate the anthropogenic effects on the streamflow variability to achieve a more efficient and effective operation of water transfer projects and maximum benefit in closing discriminating the significant periodicities from the stochastic variations of precipitation would be helpful and important for understanding the response of precipitation to climate change the results from the present study can guide long term simulation and prediction of hydrological processes in china and the approach can be extended to any region around the world based on both the periodic variability of precipitation and the pdo and amo precipitation during the next decade should refer to the southern drought and northern flooding pattern in the south north water transfer snwt project controlled region and more effective operation rules should be formulated

the fundamental connection between forests and water such that upstream disturbances may affect watershed processes and functions and their ability to sustain the wellbeing of downstream users by providing multiple services and benefits brauman 2015 brauman et al 2007 carvalho santos et al 2014 among the many concerns for long term water security climate change and the associated upsurge of both biotic e g insects pathogens and abiotic e g droughts wildfires disturbances have increasingly impacted water supplies and decreased the resilience of temperate and boreal forests gauthier et al 2015 seidl et al 2017 stephens et al 2014 in particular changing wildfire activity in many regions of the planet including high latitude forests of north america has increased the risks to water supplies bladon 2018 coogan et al 2019 doerr and santín 2016 robinne et al 2019 wildfires are a common natural disturbance in northern latitudes however many recent studies suggest that ongoing climate change is already changing burning conditions with longer fire seasons hotter and drier weather and greater lightning activity leading to more frequent and severe wildfires flannigan et al 2009 wang et al 2017 young et al 2017 furthermore the growing number of people attracted to northern regions for employment and recreation has influenced ignition patterns and increased the exposure of communities and watersheds to risks from fire activity johnston and flannigan 2018 parisien et al 2016 robinne et al 2016 fire either natural or human caused has a dual effect on the capacity of ecosystems to benefit humans while frequent low severity natural wildfires can help maintain forest ecosystem health and related services such as wood production biodiversity and recreational activities increasingly large and severe fires can generate more toxic smoke and contaminate water sil et al 2019 as a result high severity wildfires have the potential to disrupt a broad range of ecohydrologic processes and functions in forested watersheds such as interception infiltration evapotranspiration and storage ebel and moody 2017 poon and kinoshita 2018 in turn these effects can result in rapid runoff responses increased surface runoff elevated erosion and sediment delivery to streams and greater potential for mass movements kinoshita and hogue 2011 rengers et al 2016 robichaud et al 2016 these impacts may lead to deteriorated physical and chemical water quality with potentially substantial and long lasting effects on hes such as the provision of community drinking water supply or recreational water uses hohner et al 2019 kinoshita et al 2016 vukomanovic and steelman 2019 as human population and industrial development keep growing the reliance on hes from forested watersheds in many regions including high latitude forests in canada and alaska will also continue to increase erdozain et al 2018 lamothe et al 2019 webster et al 2015 these growing pressures will add to existing acute water security issues in northern communities bradford et al 2016 penn et al 2017 in northern forested regions water is a defining ecological social and economic element for example in alaska there are more than 12 000 rivers and streams draining into more than 3 million lakes larger than 2 5 ha alaska department of fish and game 2006 canada has the third largest renewable freshwater supply in the world with nearly 10 of global renewable water resources bakker 2007 statistics canada 2017 these surface water resources provide 75 of domestic agricultural and industrial water use in alaska while providing 88 of the drinking water and 68 of the hydropower generation in canada anielski and wilson 2005 estimated the annual value of hydrologic services from the boreal forest at nearly 72 billion cad 2002 dollars water also is culturally important especially in northern latitudes where it is often related to spiritual tradition peoples identity and aesthetic and recreational values of the landscape brauman et al 2007 in canada the heritage river system protects 12 000 km of rivers of historical and recreational importance canadian heritage rivers system 2010 while the watermark project an online archive of personal stories and local knowledge about people s relationships with water gives access to hundreds of testimonies from a diversity of water users swim drink fish canada 2016 these efforts highlight the strong dependence of indigenous communities on healthy aquatic ecosystems for subsistence and spirituality which remains a defining feature of northern identity wilson et al 2019 wilson and inkster 2018 in light of the ongoing changes in wildfire regimes in north american high latitude forests maintaining healthy forested watersheds that will continue to provide a wide range of hes is critical this necessitates specific wildfire management practices in at risk watersheds e g fire regime restoration fuel treatment suppression or post fire restoration informed by established scientific knowledge creed et al 2017 steenberg et al 2019 yeung et al 2018 at present there is no unified vision regarding the range of post fire effects on hes as existing work is either outdated carignan and steedman 2000 prepas et al 2003b narrowly focused on a subset of post fire impacts to surface hydrology e g river geomorphology owens et al 2013 or has only considered a single natural region e g western cordillera silins et al 2014 moreover although several recent studies have echoed the growing concern of wildfire risks to water security bladon et al 2014 martin 2019 robinne et al 2018 there is no formal assessment of the current state of knowledge in post fire hydrology and the related risks to hes in northern latitude forests that would benefit viable watershed protection strategies notwithstanding the importance of this earlier work the need to assemble the current state of knowledge on this topic is paramount to facilitate development of sustainable land management decisions and to inspire future research efforts specifically if we are to address present and future compound wildfire water risks hallema et al 2018a we need to answer the following question what are the consequences of wildfires in high latitude forested watersheds on surface hydrology and the provision of downstream hydrologic ecosystem services to begin to answer this question we present a scoping review to document scientific knowledge on wildfire effects on watershed functioning and how these effects might impact the provision of hes to downstream communities our review covers forested watersheds of canada and alaska dominated by nival i e streamflow regime dominated by snowmelt to pluvial nival i e streamflow regime dominated by mixed rain and snowmelt hydro climatic regimes and mostly located in boreal mixedwood and pacific conifer forests fig 1 the objectives of this review were to 1 collect using a systematic design studies focused on post fire hydrologic effects on surface hydrology 2 collect and analyze the characteristics of those studies regarding fire regime description and the nature and duration of post fire effects on a range of surface hydrologic features 3 assess the extent to which those studies translated potential post fire hydrologic effects into consequences positive or negative on the provision of hes and 4 propose a research agenda that addresses key knowledge gaps in post fire surface hydrology in canada and alaska and promotes the integration of the ecosystem services approach into wildfire risk assessment the resulting synthesis reflects the current understanding of wildfire risk to hes and water security in this part of the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 review type a scoping review is a rapid and systematic approach to complete a comprehensive survey of the available yet often scattered knowledge pertaining to a research area whose complexity and or novelty hinders a more traditional in depth type of review the scoping review framework has gained popularity during the past two decades particularly in the medical field pham et al 2014 and several recent references illustrate that this framework may be used to address pressing environmental questions such as wildfire water security and ecosystem services bradford et al 2016 hanna et al 2018 marshall et al 2018 vukomanovic and steelman 2019 a scoping review provides a descriptive account of available research arksey and o malley 2005 p 30 that depicts and disseminates the current state of scientific knowledge on a given topic analysis of the collected material remains superficial in nature and its quality is not assessed in depth if at all in other words a scoping review is a preliminary study identifying research gaps for which further meta analysis or state of the art reviews will be necessary it is therefore more accessible and of greater value for introducing emerging scientific topics to managers and policy makers compared to more complex reviews we followed a systematic approach based on recommendations from the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma statement and protocol for systematic reviews moher et al 2015 2009 however we prioritized the published research and evaluated its quality only as needed to address the objectives of this study arksey and o malley 2005 thus the scoping review process facilitated evaluation of a large body of literature which allowed us to summarize the current state of knowledge and to identify important research gaps grant and booth 2009 marshall et al 2018 pham et al 2014 2 2 study search our review focused on surface water bodies including lakes reservoirs ponds ephemeral and permanent streams and rivers we constrained our review to surface water sources in northern regions because 1 canadian and alaskan communities and economies rely heavily on surface water resources for diverse purposes including domestic use industrial uses and ecotourism alessa et al 2011 lemelin et al 2015 statistics canada 2017 2 canadian and alaskan forests are naturally fire prone a characteristic that is likely to strengthen with global change stocks et al 2002 wotton et al 2017 and 3 there is scientific evidence of water security impairment due to wildfires emelko et al 2011 hohner et al 2019 smith et al 2011 we searched scopus and web of science databases by topic looking for specific terms in the title the abstract and the keywords only the queries and keywords extensively targeted the association of aquatic or hydrologic vocabulary to vegetation fire and the consequences of burning supporting information s1 we also applied forward backward author searching also called citation chaining to collect references linked to authors either frequently identified by search engines or often cited in topical papers until no new study could be retrieved we listed 25 authors whose publications were individually searched for on both scopus and web of science supporting information s1 finally nine studies known to the authors and considered relevant to this work were added to the pool of studies to be screened supporting information s1 the search was limited to research published in english language peer reviewed scientific journals or in french language journals which had been translated to english we did not constrain our search to specific years thus we included any pioneer papers completed up to july 2018 the time of the search 2 3 study screening after the original database search we imported the list of studies to the reference manager mendeley desktop version 1 19 3 mendeley ltd 2019 we then screened and selected relevant studies in three steps reading the titles provided a first filter that helped eliminate entries unrelated to the topic of the review second abstracts of remaining entries were read to check for their a priori relevance we discarded for instance several studies whose abstracts described post fire changes in forest stand water budget e g evapotranspiration as well as studies whose abstracts mentioned fire and water in a different context e g structural firefighting we also removed paleo ecological studies unless they presented a link between fire and surface water that extended to modern days i e 1980 onwards finally we removed reviews reports and conference proceedings 2 4 study eligibility studies that remained after our initial screening were read by two of the co authors initially we read a subset of five studies to identify the relevant information we needed to gather and the appropriate level of detail to include we used this information to develop a data charting form which was cross verified for quality control and adjusted leading to modification of the form structure supporting information s2 for each study relevant details were collected and stored in a standardized format using the descriptive analytical method of arksey and o malley 2005 and implemented in the prisma protocol in total we included 34 study attributes in the data charting form irrelevant studies were flagged so they would not be included in the final data analysis specifically the information we collected included metadata e g author year of publication study location watershed physiography fire characteristics post fire weather type of water body type of hydrologic process and or function affected direction of the effect i e positive neutral negative data analysis method and whether or not a potential effect on hes was reported i e yes or no and or evaluated i e positive neutral negative fire characteristics were based on fire history fire severity and fraction of watershed burned comparatively watershed physiography was based on basin dominant slope while precipitation characteristics were based on reported timing and intensity which are generally the dominant controls over post fire changes in hydrologic processes and functions hallema et al 2018b miller et al 2011 moody et al 2008 shakesby and doerr 2006 where possible we also extracted details regarding hydrologic ecosystem services hes from each study brauman et al 2007 carvalho santos et al 2014 ojea et al 2012 specifically we noted a whether or not a hes was mentioned b what type of hes was considered table 1 and c the direction of the effect due to wildfire 2 5 data analysis study locations were used to create a point vector layer in arcgis 10 5 environmental systems research institute 2017 allowing us to assess the spatial distribution of research however location information was provided in various ways in the reviewed studies including name of the watershed a map or coordinates of a point with or without specification regarding the reference point s e g hydrometric station watershed centroid bounding box we used ancillary spatial datasets to add information pertaining to ecoregions commission for environmental cooperation 2009b to country and state province territory and to the sub sub drainage basin equivalent hydrologic unit code level 8 in alaska natural resources of canada 2012 this facilitated assessment of the degree to which the reviewed studies were representative of northern forests further visualization and analysis of non spatial attributes was accomplished using tableau software 2019 1 0 tableau development team 2019 3 results 3 1 general observations we performed all database searches on july 19 2018 chaining on july 23 2018 with seven additional studies added based on co author knowledge on august 21 2018 we identified 2935 potentially eligible studies after removing duplicates the screening stage yielded 95 studies and 82 were included in the data analysis after charting fig 2 supporting information s3 of the 82 studies six were in alaska and 76 in canada there were several clusters where experimental watersheds were located in québec north western ontario central and northern alberta and in the southern rocky mountains and caribou mountains in alberta and british columbia for instance seven studies came from the forest watershed and riparian disturbance forward project in central alberta mceachern 2016 illustrating the importance of long term monitoring fig 3 supporting information s4 however there were no studies conducted in seven out of the 13 canadian provinces and territories most of which display geographic factors e g historical area burned existence of populated places conducive to post fire risks to community water supplies fig 1 of the 22 ecoregions level ii commission for environmental cooperation 2009 intersecting northern forest watersheds forest cover 30 11 were represented in the data based on study location hes were mentioned in 41 studies 50 yet only 24 29 indicated the direction of the impacts supporting information s5 the studies included in our review covered 39 years from 1980 to 2018 with a clear increasing trend both in the number of studies on wildfire effects on hydrology and the consideration of the effects on hes table 2 fig 4 post fire changes in water quality and aquatic ecosystem function were the main focus with 32 dedicated studies each fig 5 reviewed articles also focused primarily on supporting ecosystem services linking changes in watershed function to habitat conservation issues and nutrient cycling fig 6 the vast majority of studies did not provide the full range of details on the wildfire characteristics watershed physiography or post fire weather in 84 of the studies 69 of 82 at least one detail regarding these elements was not mentioned table 3 fig 6 3 2 runoff and flow regime post fire changes in runoff or flow regime were quantified in 19 studies 23 of total studies authors reported effects of wildfire on various aspects of the hydrologic regime including mean annual or seasonal water yield mean annual or daily peakflow timing and duration hydrograph accession recession curves flashiness total annual or daily runoff and snow water equivalent and snowmelt timing most studies emphasized the importance of precipitation variability in controlling the magnitude and longevity of the post fire hydrologic response however hydrologic response was highly variable both across and within studies 3 3 erosion and sediment transport our review found 15 studies 18 quantifying the effects of wildfire on erosion or sediment transport most indicated a distinct post fire increase in either bedload transport or suspended sediment in streams in stream total suspended sediment varied significantly throughout the duration of any given storm event but was generally highest on the rising limb of the first major storm event following a fire bedload flux did not follow this trend but gradually increased during the weeks after fire only to decline again after several years following vegetation re establishment no evidence was found for wildfire effects on erosion and sedimentation in lakes and rivers in eastern canada in some cases authors noted that fires were not hot enough to burn the humus layer entirely and argued that flat topography promoted the accumulation of thick organic soils protecting the underlying mineral soil 3 4 water chemistry our review found 32 studies 39 that quantified wildfire effects on aquatic chemistry stream chemistry and water quality response to wildfire varied greatly depending on wildfire severity and environmental characteristics of the watershed for example high severity wildfire in the canadian rocky mountains led to higher concentration of nitrogen e g nitrate dissolved organic nitrogen total nitrogen as well as phosphorus p further north increased n in boreal forest streams after a high severity fire was likely associated with recovering vegetation because boreal forest soils are naturally n limited conversely n response in lacustrine systems seemed ephemeral even after severe wildfire changes in dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in tundra streams were limited possibly due to decreased hydrologic connectivity between slopes and streams as a result of permafrost collapse i e thermokarst in alaska post fire doc inputs into streams were higher but no such link was found for lakes on the boreal plains where the lack of change in post fire doc concentrations in lakes indicated they might be primarily groundwater fed 3 5 hydromorphological processes hydromorphological processes influencing physical attributes of water bodies over time were addressed in 11 studies 13 of total studies studies showed that large and severe fires led to a sharp increase in in stream loading of large wood followed by a long term decrease of woody inputs from the surrounding land as the forest recovered self thinning of dead snags after a fire was yet another source of wood reaching streams for several decades after fire in many cases the increased input of large wood in the years following fire favored enhanced sediment storage behind large wood jams increased sediment input from bank erosion due to root decay also coincided with changes in channel morphology with the appearance of bars and a more complex morphology i e riffle pool type damaging mass movements in severely burned watersheds which were reported in southern british columbia were likely triggered by accelerated post fire snowmelt or long duration precipitation events 3 6 aquatic food webs aquatic ecosystem response to wildfire was addressed in 32 studies 39 of total studies lower trophic levels i e plankton in lakes showed contrasting response to fire indeed many studies reported no change or a marginal difference in overall species diversity compared to unburned or pre fire conditions whereas biomass particularly at lower trophic levels tended to increase a few studies observed post fire decreases in biological activity altered community composition species richness and or densities whereas many studies indicated beneficial effects of fire with higher species population density and biological activity the duration of post fire effects was highly variable some studies observed legacy effects lasting 15 20 years while others have observed short lived effects 1 2 years post fire effects on higher trophic levels i e fish assemblage and populations seemed limited or even positive at least in the short term studies focusing on streams were mostly conducted in small headwaters post fire environments favored biological activity stream productivity and overall species diversity this was due to the influence of nutrient and organic matter enrichment of the complete trophic chain over several years post fire from phytoplankton and microbial communities to fish for larger aquatic animals i e beavers and waterfowls three relevant studies provided totally different outcomes with beavers negatively affected by even low intensity fires whereas boreal waterfowls were resilient to fire activity and frequent prescribed burns bioaccumulation of mercury hg and methyl mercury mehg has been a major research theme since the late 1990s particularly in lake ecosystems available studies show contrasting results a strong increase in bioaccumulated mehg in a mountain lake a decrease in mehg concentration in a boreal plain lake and no difference in mehg or hg concentrations in water or along the trophic chain in another boreal plain lake 4 discussion 4 1 state of knowledge our scoping review of 82 studies conducted in canada and alaska revealed a positive trend in the number of studies addressing post fire changes in hydrology and impacts to ecosystem services a trend that we expect to continue musetta lambert et al 2019 robinne et al 2019 tank et al 2019 while this increase in published research is likely due to increasing concern about the issues associated with wildfire on water supplies coogan et al 2019 hanes et al 2019 some of this trend may be due to an overall increase in the number of studies published in environmental sciences over the past four decades aznar sánchez et al 2019 although the majority of historical studies across northern latitudes in canada and alaska quantified the effects of wildfire on aquatic ecosystem health or water chemistry there was a notable increase in the emphasis on the threats of wildfire to community water supply emelko et al 2016 mahat et al 2016 winkler et al 2015 geographically the studies were concentrated in small clusters dispersed across the vast canadian territory and alaska consequently some ecological regions with different wildfire regimes hydrology and socio economic activity have been overlooked yet further comparison with available data fig 1 coupled to projected changes in wildfire regimes and hydrologic functioning indicates the ubiquity of post fire challenges to water supplies albeit with different local challenges al ibrahim and patrick 2017 price and heberling 2018 robinne et al 2019 for instance al ibrahim and patrick 2017 mentioned wildfire threats to the water supply of halifax nova scotia population 400 000 however no wildfire water risks study appears to have been conducted in nova scotia to date even in well studied ecological regions the causes of differences in watershed response to fire remain difficult to decipher owens et al 2013 pomeroy et al 2012 silins et al 2009 springer et al 2015 indeed the inherently opportunistic nature of wildfire hydrology field research often means that pre fire data are not available this underscores the importance of long term monitoring and field campaigns for data collection blöschl et al 2019 burt and mcdonnell 2015 mcdonnell et al 2018 our review found that the previous research across the study region has included a diversity of foci data and methods which illustrates strong heterogeneity in approaches to wildfire and water problems in canada and alaska most importantly there has been a high degree of variability in the descriptions of the fire characteristics watershed topography and precipitation which hinders cross site comparisons neary et al 1999 shakesby and doerr 2006 some of this variability is due to a a lack of pre fire data which does not allow the researcher to accurately quantify fire severity or pre fire hydrology b the short term funding cycle that does not facilitate longer term research on these topics and c the comparatively few number of studies on post fire fire hydrology to permit detection of trends if present within and across regions bladon et al 2014 blöschl et al 2019 moody et al 2013 in addition the diversity of study designs makes comparisons difficult notably the sample size varied considerably i e between one and 50 lakes while in some cases the sample size changed over the course of the study whereas others mixed a set of streams and lakes the contrasting post fire response of lacustrine ecosystems indicated that the environmental settings of lakes e g size depth trophic status peatland cover drainage ratio input precipitation remained the main controls of post fire response 80 variance explained in some cases e g lewis et al 2014 patoine 2002 pinel alloul et al 1998 planas et al 2000 for instance charette and prepas 2003 showed that phytoplankton response to fire including toxic cyanobacteria was likely controlled by depth in boreal plains headwater lakes mceachern et al 2002 and jalal et al 2005 suggested that wildfires in peat dominated watersheds likely would not result in increased primary productivity which is counter to most stream studies that have illustrated that fire results in increased nutrients increased algal productivity and the associated public health implications they attributed this lack of algal response in peat dominated watersheds to amplification of n limitation and light extinction due to higher doc exports shield plains and cordillera ecoregions also showed clear differences in lakes post fire response with a generally greater response in mountain and shield zones garcia et al 2007 garcia and carignan 2000 compared to the plains lewis et al 2014 for instance kelly et al 2006 showed a 5 fold increase in mercury hg accumulation in rainbow trout in a mountain lake reaching concentration levels potentially harmful to human health alternatively allen et al 2005 showed a decrease in mehg concentration in a boreal plain lake which has previously been related to post fire increases in doc and productivity of lower trophic levels garcia and carignan 2005 1999 in contrast to observations of increases and decreases in hg after wildfires garcia and carignan 2000 1999 showed no difference in mehg or hg concentrations in water or along the trophic chain in the boreal plains these contrasting observations highlight the many uncertainties that remain regarding the differential effects of wildfires on water quality across ecoregions our review also showed that the hydrologic response of northern riverine ecosystems to fire is highly variable in some studies both annual streamflow and peakflows increased post fire e g pomeroy et al 2012 springer et al 2015 while in other studies only annual water yields increased e g eaton et al 2010a mahat et al 2015 for example schindler et al 1980 reported a two year increase in annual yield after fire even under drier conditions on the canadian shield including higher baseflows comparatively pelster et al 2008 reported higher water yield six years after fire in the boreal plains conversely our review indicated that observed wildfire impacts on erosion mechanisms and water quality in northern watersheds might have important implications for watershed health and downstream water supplies several studies in headwaters showed post fire stream contamination by excess nutrients doc chemicals e g mercury and sediments that could create various challenges for the production of drinking water emelko et al 2016 2011 silins et al 2014 or the consumption of aquatic food kelly et al 2006 for example beaty 1994 reported a 20 fold increase in bedload transport the first year following an initial fire in northwestern ontario that resulted in a 20 fold increase in bedload transport during the first post fire year similarly p concentrations were elevated up to 7 years after wildfire and over 10 km downstream of the burned area in a study in the rocky mountains emelko et al 2016 wagner et al 2014 reported a change in stream thermal regime with 1 0 3 0 c increases in mean daily maximum temperature in burned watersheds of the rocky mountain which can negatively impact cold adapted aquatic organisms despite a majority of studies focusing on water chemistry we note a lack of quantitative information on certain chemicals released during and after wildfire for example studies in north carolina and new mexico point to increased post fire levels of free cyanide from ash and sodium ferrohexacyanide from fire retardant respectively in surface runoff barber et al 2003 gallaher et al 2002 depending on the timing and concentration of release this can have episodic toxic effects on aquatic life however studies on post fire cyanide are few in number and we found none for high latitude forests northern watersheds are highly influenced by permafrost and snow permafrost adds another dimension to post fire water chemistry because it acts as a barrier to infiltration and transportation of nutrients to deeper soil layers and restricts water to the active layer petrone et al 2007 discontinuous permafrost may regulate stream solute concentrations by forcing hydrologic flowpaths through the organic surface layer resulting in strong variations in dissolved organic matter dom inputs after a fire betts and jones 2009 petrone et al 2007 many studies also provided strong evidence for increased snow water equivalent in burned areas e g burles and boon 2011 pomeroy et al 2012 winkler et al 2015 an earlier and shorter snowmelt freshet e g burles and boon 2011 winkler et al 2015 and a greater contribution of snowmelt to annual streamflow e g eaton et al 2010a owens et al 2013 although mahat et al 2015 showed an increase in peakflows due to snowmelt runoff several studies noted the opposite response which was likely due to a decoupling of snowmelt between burned and unburned areas e g burke et al 2005 eaton et al 2010b owens et al 2013 climate change may also be expected to influence the post fire snow cover dynamics ireson et al 2015 again creating uncertainty in projecting post fire responses based on the spatially and temporally limited research in this region interestingly the current knowledge of fire effects on aquatic ecosystems generally points towards ecosystem resistance and or resiliency in both streams and lakes this suggests the adaptation of aquatic ecosystems to natural fire activity jalal et al 2005 kreutzweiser et al 2012 lewis et al 2014 as is commonly accepted for northern forests as a whole burton et al 2008 stewart et al 2012 for instance naylor et al 2012 reported that boreal riparian forests can burn extensively meaning that over protecting riparian buffers from disturbances can be detrimental to aquatic habitat diversity the observed rejuvenation effect on aquatic habitats seems to favor long term ecosystem productivity which suggests that safeguarding and restoring fire regimes may benefit aquatic ecosystems through enhanced watershed health cott et al 2010 tonn et al 2004 this ecological need may be difficult to reconcile with demand for provisioning services i e angling due to potential short term depreciation of aquatic ecosystem health and further implications for human health e g mercury bioaccumulation in fire dependent watersheds experiencing a high demand for hes risk mitigation will have to include fire as part of the solution to stabilize changing watershed functioning creed et al 2014 hanes et al 2019 rocca et al 2014 davidson and eaton 2015 and charron and johnson 2006 also strongly suggested stream aquatic habitat dependency on post fire hydrologic pulses of water sediment and debris influencing stream morphology and riparian vegetation implications of these findings are important for habitat conservation as they suggest that fire disturbances within their natural range of variability and the associated post fire pulses are necessary processes supporting long term aquatic ecosystem health in northern forests jentsch and white 2019 rocca et al 2014 global environmental change especially climate change was rarely addressed specifically and only in simulation studies mahat and anderson 2013 in northern latitudes the balance between annual precipitation and annual potential evapotranspiration provides a rough index of water availability for streamflow as well as soil and groundwater recharge however post fire changes in snow cover expected decreases in snowmelt and glacier contributions to streamflow and increases in pet hember et al 2017 marshall et al 2011 vincent et al 2015 suggest a stronger possibility of scenarios where wildfire leads to the contamination of limited water supplies from forests in these regions bladon et al 2014 similar concerns have been expressed in other parts of the world such as australia lane et al 2010 and portugal santos et al 2015 where wildfire activity is already demonstrably affected by climate change and other anthropogenic stressors although summer storms in the central boreal forest and wet years in the western mountains seem to be primary triggers for post fire response e g burke et al 2005 prepas et al 2003a shifts in seasonality and magnitude of precipitation will increasingly complicate our ability to project post fire responses 4 2 limitations our scoping review enabled us to rapidly and systematically summarize the literature associated with the pressing environmental questions associated with wildfire water security and ecosystem services in northern latitudes however the scoping approach is limited due to a focus on the quantity of available information rather than on an in depth analysis of its quality as would be completed in more typical reviews thus while this approach enabled us to address the main topics in the selected studies and note the general results our findings are not meant to provide conclusive evidence nor any guideline regarding the best approach to study wildfire risks to water security in northern watersheds our review was also limited in scope and did not include studies in peatlands we acknowledge the importance of peatlands which cover no less than 13 of the canadian landmass and 64 in the boreal forest tarnocai et al 2011 however peatlands uniquely play a critical role in wildfire spread and affect water distribution horizontally and vertically within the landscape thompson et al 2019 waddington et al 2015 as such they also buffer the impacts of wildfires on water quantity and quality pelster et al 2008 prepas et al 2006 despite their critical importance they were beyond our focus on surface water bodies and we strongly encourage continued research in these unique environments finally our review focused on the effects of wildfire on a subset of hydrologic functions in northern latitude studies again we acknowledge that wildfires are known to have direct effects on many other hydrologic processes e g interception evapotranspiration national research council 2008 we also acknowledge that local post fire changes in the forest water balance can ultimately affect the broader water cycle and hes in high latitude watersheds bond lamberty et al 2009 waddington et al 2015 however in constraining the objectives of our review we felt that most impacted hydrologic processes would at least be indirectly addressed in other aspects of our review 5 research agenda in this first systematic review of post fire hydrology in the high latitude forests of north america we have covered 40 years of research on hydrology geomorphology water quality and aquatic ecosystem quality in lakes open wetlands and rivers despite an increasing number of studies on wildfire impacts on water chemistry and aquatic ecosystem responses to wildfires other hydrologic services like drinking water source supply recreation and fish health have received comparatively less attention based on our results and recent publications addressing the forest fire water nexus elsewhere bladon 2018 hallema et al 2019a martin 2016 we propose a list of priorities for post fire hydrologic research in this region carignan and steedman 2000 mahat et al 2015 our results show marked differences in study design description of the hydrologic setting fire characteristics and general reporting of results this hinders cross site comparisons and detection of general patterns in post fire watershed response as such this precludes the ability to design appropriate fire and post fire management strategies e g prescribed burn programs mechanical fuel reduction fire suppression post fire forest restoration to effectively mitigate effects on freshwater resources we argue for the need for the wildfire water research community to develop a more standardized protocol for the description of watershed settings and the post fire environment this will help ensure that the same information is captured across studies and that their results are comparable thereby enabling researchers to undertake meta analyses and develop watershed health indicators adapted to northern fire conditions dunn and bakker 2011 flotemersch et al 2016 smith et al 2016 studies on post fire changes in ecohydrological processes and freshwater services have mainly focused on aquatic habitats and water chemistry despite evidence that hes are connected creed et al 2016 sun et al 2017 the lack of studies analyzing cultural services is a problem that can be extended to the ecosystem services literature as a whole satz et al 2013 whereas the lack of studies focusing on other hes is related to the relative novelty of the topic post fire hydrologic studies should strive to describe results within the context of hydrologic services especially when they involve water supply issues to downstream communities so that appropriate indicators of risks to water resources can be developed creed et al 2016 grizzetti et al 2016 vollmer et al 2018 future research must also prioritize studies with a focus on fire impacts on other hes particularly drinking water provision flash flood mitigation and recreational uses as exemplified by jordan 2016 and emelko et al 2011 the combined effect of wildfires and climate trends on water supplies also necessitates regional assessments of water issues hallema et al 2019b which should be integrated with transparent cost benefit analyses of hes degradation due to wildfire price and heberling 2018 we acknowledge that conducting such studies is challenging due to the absence of baseline information e g spatial economic on the majority of hydrologic services provided by high latitude forests the large spatial extent of fire activity across the region the strong variability in vulnerability of communities relying on fire affected watersheds and the uncertain costs and benefits of enhancing hydrologic resilience of fire prone watersheds e g with fuel treatments we therefore argue for an initial focus on quantifying and mapping hes provided by northern forest watersheds which future efforts could build on however the mapping approach must be adaptive and part of an ongoing effort as illustrated for instance by the high resolution mapping of river characteristics in canada ouellet dallaire et al 2019 and by the assessment of drinking water production costs that can be related to upstream forest health and disturbances price et al 2017 robinne et al 2019 temporal and spatial scales affect our understanding of ecohydrologic processes and hydro sociological interactions that cannot be captured by studies at a single watershed scale conducted over a few years bakker 2012 sivapalan et al 2014 recent work on forest cover and water yield interactions revealed that the effect of cumulative disturbances at large scales is not monotonic or unidirectional and could have long lasting and extensive effects li et al 2018 2017 zhang and wei 2014 therefore there is a need to study longer term interactions between hydrologic and fire regimes in northern watersheds to date most studies are short term and focus on the aftermath of a single wildfire a common pitfall of post fire environmental assessments in general neary et al 1999 vieira et al 2015 however high latitude forests are generally fire prone and fire dependent which suggests a likely dynamic equilibrium between landscape fire occurrence its resulting pattern on the forest mosaic and the movement of water across the landscape chanasyk et al 2003 devito et al 2012 understanding this equilibrium might be key to designing future strategies to adapt to global environmental change where wildfires have a place in ensuring water security in this respect the need for the creation and maintenance of long term ecological research sites combined with a thorough analysis of existing data could provide invaluable insights to learning how to cope with more unpredictable hydroclimatic extremes huntington 2006 milly et al 2008 as such increasing data availability combined with a multi scale approach to studying compound fire hydrologic processes and services may be key to enabling effective decisions to preserve water security in canada and alaska bakker 2012 bakker and cook 2011 finally the limited number of studies that have used computational modeling data mining and remote sensing technologies indicates that cutting edge advances in the general hydrologic sciences have yet to be mainstreamed in the sub field of post fire hydrology at least in canada and alaska for example remote sensing methods to monitor inland waters and the ecosystem services they provide have made significant progress de araujo barbosa et al 2015 palmer et al 2015 specifically recent studies have relied on remote sensing to identify potential harmful algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs keith et al 2018 kudela et al 2015 given that algal blooms have been noted as a major post fire challenge to drinking water supplies this would seem like an opportunity for the post fire hydrology research community to address hydrologic modeling of northern regions has also made significant advances with the development of dedicated modeling frameworks such as the cold region hydrologic model pomeroy et al 2007 and raven chernos et al 2017 that remain to be fully tested in a post fire environment addressing emerging questions associated with global environmental change requires the use of such advanced technologies carignan and steedman 2000 thompson et al 2013 adapting current hydrologic models to enable scenario testing for post wildfire conditions can provide testable hypotheses regarding the magnitude of hydrologic effects associated with high severity fires the temporal and spatial duration of effects and the interact with other pressures such as climate change and human demand for water moreover the combination of simulation modeling with remote sensing data could also be used to improve understanding of the effects of wildfires on key water quality parameters e g sediment limiting nutrients carbon in both upstream and downstream environments as well as the potential impacts on aquatic ecosystem health e g primary productivity fish habitat modeling such modeling efforts could provide important information for the implementation and the revision of source water supply and protection strategies post fire simulation modeling could also further help decipher the future effect of global change particularly climate variations and increasing water demand of expanding urban

5857,high latitude forests of north america are characterized by their natural dependence on large and severe wildfires however these wildfires also pose a range of social economic and environmental risks with growing concern regarding persistent effects on stream flow volume seasonal timing of flow water quality aquatic ecosystem health and downstream community drinking water treatment here we present the outcomes of a comprehensive scoping review of post fire hydrologic studies in high latitude forests of north america canada and alaska our objectives were to 1 create an inventory of studies on post fire hydrologic effects on surface water 2 analyze those studies in terms of watershed characteristics and the type and duration of hydrologic effects 3 identify and evaluate the link between upstream hydrologic effects with hydrologic ecosystem services and 4 propose a research agenda addressing the link between wildfire science and hydrologic ecosystem services we screened 2935 peer reviewed articles and selected 82 studies to include based on their relevance according to a systematic multi step selection process next we classified the papers into five themes a runoff volume and flow regimes b erosion and sediment transport c water chemistry d hydromorphology and e aquatic food webs for each study we documented location fire regime watershed characteristics and ecosystem services the annual number of published studies on post fire hydrology in high latitude forests and in particular those addressing hydrologic ecosystem services has increased steadily in recent years descriptions of wildfire characteristics watershed characteristics and effects on hydrologic ecosystem services were highly variable across studies hindering cross study comparisons moreover there were limited efforts to extend study results to implications for forest or water management decisions regarding ecosystem services from source watersheds most studies focused on fire impacts on aquatic habitats and water chemistry while services of direct concern to communities such as drinking water were rarely addressed we contend that study standardization further use of geospatial technologies and more studies directly addressing ecosystem services will help mitigate the increasing risks to water resources in northern forests keywords forest fires water security source watersheds post fire hydrology 1 introduction an ongoing planetary water crisis abbott et al 2019 is increasingly threatening the current and future ability of forested watersheds to supply water to

water security paradigm i e the guarantee of safe access to sustainable quantities of quality water to fulfill daily personal needs and promote socio economic development the hes concept acknowledges the fundamental connection between forests and water such that upstream disturbances may affect watershed processes and functions and their ability to sustain the wellbeing of downstream users by providing multiple services and benefits brauman 2015 brauman et al 2007 carvalho santos et al 2014 among the many concerns for long term water security climate change and the associated upsurge of both biotic e g insects pathogens and abiotic e g droughts wildfires disturbances have increasingly impacted water supplies and decreased the resilience of temperate and boreal forests gauthier et al 2015 seidl et al 2017 stephens et al 2014 in particular changing wildfire activity in many regions of the planet including high latitude forests of north america has increased the risks to water supplies bladon 2018 coogan et al 2019 doerr and santín 2016 robinne et al 2019 wildfires are a common natural disturbance in northern latitudes however many recent studies suggest that ongoing climate change is already changing burning conditions with longer fire seasons hotter and drier weather and greater lightning activity leading to more frequent and severe wildfires flannigan et al 2009 wang et al 2017 young et al 2017 furthermore the growing number of people attracted to northern regions for employment and recreation has influenced ignition patterns and increased the exposure of communities and watersheds to risks from fire activity johnston and flannigan 2018 parisien et al 2016 robinne et al 2016 fire either natural or human caused has a dual effect on the capacity of ecosystems to benefit humans while frequent low severity natural wildfires can help maintain forest ecosystem health and related services such as wood production biodiversity and recreational activities increasingly large and severe fires can generate more toxic smoke and contaminate water sil et al 2019 as a result high severity wildfires have the potential to disrupt a broad range of ecohydrologic processes and functions in forested watersheds such as interception infiltration evapotranspiration and storage ebel and moody 2017 poon and kinoshita 2018 in turn these effects can result in rapid runoff responses increased surface runoff elevated erosion and sediment delivery to streams and greater potential for mass movements kinoshita and hogue 2011 rengers et al 2016 robichaud et al 2016 these impacts may lead to deteriorated physical and chemical water quality with potentially substantial and long lasting effects on hes such as the provision of community drinking water supply or recreational water uses hohner et al 2019 kinoshita et al 2016 vukomanovic and steelman 2019 as human population and industrial development keep growing the reliance on hes from forested watersheds in many regions including high latitude forests in canada and alaska will also continue to increase erdozain et al 2018 lamothe et al 2019 webster et al 2015 these growing pressures will add to existing acute water security issues in northern communities bradford et al 2016 penn et al 2017 in northern forested regions water is a defining ecological social and economic element for example in alaska there are more than 12 000 rivers and streams draining into more than 3 million lakes larger than 2 5 ha alaska department of fish and game 2006 canada has the third largest renewable freshwater supply in the world with nearly 10 of global renewable water resources bakker 2007 statistics canada 2017 these surface water resources provide 75 of domestic agricultural and industrial water use in alaska while providing 88 of the drinking water and 68 of the hydropower generation in canada anielski and wilson 2005 estimated the annual value of hydrologic services from the boreal forest at nearly 72 billion cad 2002 dollars water also is culturally important especially in northern latitudes where it is often related to spiritual tradition peoples identity and aesthetic and recreational values of the landscape brauman et al 2007 in canada the heritage river system protects 12 000 km of rivers of historical and recreational importance canadian heritage rivers system 2010 while the watermark project an online archive of personal stories and local knowledge about people s relationships with water gives access to hundreds of testimonies from a diversity of water users swim drink fish canada 2016 these efforts highlight the strong dependence of indigenous communities on healthy aquatic ecosystems for subsistence and spirituality which remains a defining feature of northern identity wilson et al 2019 wilson and inkster 2018 in light of the ongoing changes in wildfire regimes in north american high latitude forests maintaining healthy forested watersheds that will continue to provide a wide range of hes is critical this necessitates specific wildfire management practices in at risk watersheds e g fire regime restoration fuel treatment suppression or post fire restoration informed by established scientific knowledge creed et al 2017 steenberg et al 2019 yeung et al 2018 at present there is no unified vision regarding the range of post fire effects on hes as existing work is either outdated carignan and steedman 2000 prepas et al 2003b narrowly focused on a subset of post fire impacts to surface hydrology e g river geomorphology owens et al 2013 or has only considered a single natural region e g western cordillera silins et al 2014 moreover although several recent studies have echoed the growing concern of wildfire risks to water security bladon et al 2014 martin 2019 robinne et al 2018 there is no formal assessment of the current state of knowledge in post fire hydrology and the related risks to hes in northern latitude forests that would benefit viable watershed protection strategies notwithstanding the importance of this earlier work the need to assemble the current state of knowledge on this topic is paramount to facilitate development of sustainable land management decisions and to inspire future research efforts specifically if we are to address present and future compound wildfire water risks hallema et al 2018a we need to answer the following question what are the consequences of wildfires in high latitude forested watersheds on surface hydrology and the provision of downstream hydrologic ecosystem services to begin to answer this question we present a scoping review to document scientific knowledge on wildfire effects on watershed functioning and how these effects might impact the provision of hes to downstream communities our review covers forested watersheds of canada and alaska dominated by nival i e streamflow regime dominated by snowmelt to pluvial nival i e streamflow regime dominated by mixed rain and snowmelt hydro climatic regimes and mostly located in boreal mixedwood and pacific conifer forests fig 1 the objectives of this review were to 1 collect using a systematic design studies focused on post fire hydrologic effects on surface hydrology 2 collect and analyze the characteristics of those studies regarding fire regime description and the nature and duration of post fire effects on a range of surface hydrologic features 3 assess the extent to which those studies translated potential post fire hydrologic effects into consequences positive or negative on the provision of hes and 4 propose a research agenda that addresses key knowledge gaps in post fire surface hydrology in canada and alaska and promotes the integration of the ecosystem services approach into wildfire risk assessment the resulting synthesis reflects the current understanding of wildfire risk to hes and water security in this part of the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 review type a scoping review is a rapid and systematic approach to complete a comprehensive survey of the available yet often scattered knowledge pertaining to a research area whose complexity and or novelty hinders a more traditional in depth type of review the scoping review framework has gained popularity during the past two decades particularly in the medical field pham et al 2014 and several recent references illustrate that this framework may be used to address pressing environmental questions such as wildfire water security and ecosystem services bradford et al 2016 hanna et al 2018 marshall et al 2018 vukomanovic and steelman 2019 a scoping review provides a descriptive account of available research arksey and o malley 2005 p 30 that depicts and disseminates the current state of scientific knowledge on a given topic analysis of the collected material remains superficial in nature and its quality is not assessed in depth if at all in other words a scoping review is a preliminary study identifying research gaps for which further meta analysis or state of the art reviews will be necessary it is therefore more accessible and of greater value for introducing emerging scientific topics to managers and policy makers compared to more complex reviews we followed a systematic approach based on recommendations from the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma statement and protocol for systematic reviews moher et al 2015 2009 however we prioritized the published research and evaluated its quality only as needed to address the objectives of this study arksey and o malley 2005 thus the scoping review process facilitated evaluation of a large body of literature which allowed us to summarize the current state of knowledge and to identify important research gaps grant and booth 2009 marshall et al 2018 pham et al 2014 2 2 study search our review focused on surface water bodies including lakes reservoirs ponds ephemeral and permanent streams and rivers we constrained our review to surface water sources in northern regions because 1 canadian and alaskan communities and economies rely heavily on surface water resources for diverse purposes including domestic use industrial uses and ecotourism alessa et al 2011 lemelin et al 2015 statistics canada 2017 2 canadian and alaskan forests are naturally fire prone a characteristic that is likely to strengthen with global change stocks et al 2002 wotton et al 2017 and 3 there is scientific evidence of water security impairment due to wildfires emelko et al 2011 hohner et al 2019 smith et al 2011 we searched scopus and web of science databases by topic looking for specific terms in the title the abstract and the keywords only the queries and keywords extensively targeted the association of aquatic or hydrologic vocabulary to vegetation fire and the consequences of burning supporting information s1 we also applied forward backward author searching also called citation chaining to collect references linked to authors either frequently identified by search engines or often cited in topical papers until no new study could be retrieved we listed 25 authors whose publications were individually searched for on both scopus and web of science supporting information s1 finally nine studies known to the authors and considered relevant to this work were added to the pool of studies to be screened supporting information s1 the search was limited to research published in english language peer reviewed scientific journals or in french language journals which had been translated to english we did not constrain our search to specific years thus we included any pioneer papers completed up to july 2018 the time of the search 2 3 study screening after the original database search we imported the list of studies to the reference manager mendeley desktop version 1 19 3 mendeley ltd 2019 we then screened and selected relevant studies in three steps reading the titles provided a first filter that helped eliminate entries unrelated to the topic of the review second abstracts of remaining entries were read to check for their a priori relevance we discarded for instance several studies whose abstracts described post fire changes in forest stand water budget e g evapotranspiration as well as studies whose abstracts mentioned fire and water in a different context e g structural firefighting we also removed paleo ecological studies unless they presented a link between fire and surface water that extended to modern days i e 1980 onwards finally we removed reviews reports and conference proceedings 2 4 study eligibility studies that remained after our initial screening were read by two of the co authors initially we read a subset of five studies to identify the relevant information we needed to gather and the appropriate level of detail to include we used this information to develop a data charting form which was cross verified for quality control and adjusted leading to modification of the form structure supporting information s2 for each study relevant details were collected and stored in a standardized format using the descriptive analytical method of arksey and o malley 2005 and implemented in the prisma protocol in total we included 34 study attributes in the data charting form irrelevant studies were flagged so they would not be included in the final data analysis specifically the information we collected included metadata e g author year of publication study location watershed physiography fire characteristics post fire weather type of water body type of hydrologic process and or function affected direction of the effect i e positive neutral negative data analysis method and whether or not a potential effect on hes was reported i e yes or no and or evaluated i e positive neutral negative fire characteristics were based on fire history fire severity and fraction of watershed burned comparatively watershed physiography was based on basin dominant slope while precipitation characteristics were based on reported timing and intensity which are generally the dominant controls over post fire changes in hydrologic processes and functions hallema et al 2018b miller et al 2011 moody et al 2008 shakesby and doerr 2006 where possible we also extracted details regarding hydrologic ecosystem services hes from each study brauman et al 2007 carvalho santos et al 2014 ojea et al 2012 specifically we noted a whether or not a hes was mentioned b what type of hes was considered table 1 and c the direction of the effect due to wildfire 2 5 data analysis study locations were used to create a point vector layer in arcgis 10 5 environmental systems research institute 2017 allowing us to assess the spatial distribution of research however location information was provided in various ways in the reviewed studies including name of the watershed a map or coordinates of a point with or without specification regarding the reference point s e g hydrometric station watershed centroid bounding box we used ancillary spatial datasets to add information pertaining to ecoregions commission for environmental cooperation 2009b to country and state province territory and to the sub sub drainage basin equivalent hydrologic unit code level 8 in alaska natural resources of canada 2012 this facilitated assessment of the degree to which the reviewed studies were representative of northern forests further visualization and analysis of non spatial attributes was accomplished using tableau software 2019 1 0 tableau development team 2019 3 results 3 1 general observations we performed all database searches on july 19 2018 chaining on july 23 2018 with seven additional studies added based on co author knowledge on august 21 2018 we identified 2935 potentially eligible studies after removing duplicates the screening stage yielded 95 studies and 82 were included in the data analysis after charting fig 2 supporting information s3 of the 82 studies six were in alaska and 76 in canada there were several clusters where experimental watersheds were located in québec north western ontario central and northern alberta and in the southern rocky mountains and caribou mountains in alberta and british columbia for instance seven studies came from the forest watershed and riparian disturbance forward project in central alberta mceachern 2016 illustrating the importance of long term monitoring fig 3 supporting information s4 however there were no studies conducted in seven out of the 13 canadian provinces and territories most of which display geographic factors e g historical area burned existence of populated places conducive to post fire risks to community water supplies

were mentioned in 41 studies 50 yet only 24 29 indicated the direction of the impacts supporting information s5 the studies included in our review covered 39 years from 1980 to 2018 with a clear increasing trend both in the number of studies on wildfire effects on hydrology and the consideration of the effects on hes table 2 fig 4 post fire changes in water quality and aquatic ecosystem function were the main focus with 32 dedicated studies each fig 5 reviewed articles also focused primarily on supporting ecosystem services linking changes in watershed function to habitat conservation issues and nutrient cycling fig 6 the vast majority of studies did not provide the full range of details on the wildfire characteristics watershed physiography or post fire weather in 84 of the studies 69 of 82 at least one detail regarding these elements was not mentioned table 3 fig 6 3 2 runoff and flow regime post fire changes in runoff or flow regime were quantified in 19 studies 23 of total studies authors reported effects of wildfire on various aspects of the hydrologic regime including mean annual or seasonal water yield mean annual or daily peakflow timing and duration hydrograph accession recession curves flashiness total annual or daily runoff and snow water equivalent and snowmelt timing most studies emphasized the importance of precipitation variability in controlling the magnitude and longevity of the post fire hydrologic response however hydrologic response was highly variable both across and within studies 3 3 erosion and sediment transport our review found 15 studies 18 quantifying the effects of wildfire on erosion or sediment transport most indicated a distinct post fire increase in either bedload transport or suspended sediment in streams in stream total suspended sediment varied significantly throughout the duration of any given storm event but was generally highest on the rising limb of the first major storm event following a fire bedload flux did not follow this trend but gradually increased during the weeks after fire only to decline again after several years following vegetation re establishment no evidence was found for wildfire effects on erosion and sedimentation in lakes and rivers in eastern canada in some cases authors noted that fires were not hot enough to burn the humus layer entirely and argued that flat topography promoted the accumulation of thick organic soils protecting the underlying mineral soil 3 4 water chemistry our review found 32 studies 39 that quantified wildfire effects on aquatic chemistry stream chemistry and water quality response to wildfire varied greatly depending on wildfire severity and environmental characteristics of the watershed for example high severity wildfire in the canadian rocky mountains led to higher concentration of nitrogen e g nitrate dissolved organic nitrogen total nitrogen as well as phosphorus p further north increased n in boreal forest streams after a high severity fire was likely associated with recovering vegetation because boreal forest soils are naturally n limited conversely n response in lacustrine systems seemed ephemeral even after severe wildfire changes in dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in tundra streams were limited possibly due to decreased hydrologic connectivity between slopes and streams as a result of permafrost collapse i e thermokarst in alaska post fire doc inputs into streams were higher but no such link was found for lakes on the boreal plains where the lack of change in post fire doc concentrations in lakes indicated they might be primarily groundwater fed 3 5 hydromorphological processes hydromorphological processes influencing physical attributes of water bodies over time were addressed in 11 studies 13 of total studies studies showed that large and severe fires led to a sharp increase in in stream loading of large wood followed by a long term decrease of woody inputs from the surrounding land as the forest recovered self thinning of dead snags after a fire was yet another source of wood reaching streams for several decades after fire in many cases the increased input of large wood in the years following fire favored enhanced sediment storage behind large wood jams increased sediment input from bank erosion due to root decay also coincided with changes in channel morphology with the appearance of bars and a more complex morphology i e riffle pool type damaging mass movements in severely burned watersheds which were reported in southern british columbia were likely triggered by accelerated post fire snowmelt or long duration precipitation events 3 6 aquatic food webs aquatic ecosystem response to wildfire was addressed in 32 studies 39 of total studies lower trophic levels i e plankton in lakes showed contrasting response to fire indeed many studies reported no change or a marginal difference in overall species diversity compared to unburned or pre fire conditions whereas biomass particularly at lower trophic levels tended to increase a few studies observed post fire decreases in biological activity altered community composition species richness and or densities whereas many studies indicated beneficial effects of fire with higher species population density and biological activity the duration of post fire effects was highly variable some studies observed legacy effects lasting 15 20 years while others have observed short lived effects 1 2 years post fire effects on higher trophic levels i e fish assemblage and populations seemed limited or even positive at least in the short term studies focusing on streams were mostly conducted in small headwaters post fire environments favored biological activity stream productivity and overall species diversity this was due to the influence of nutrient and organic matter enrichment of the complete trophic chain over several years post fire from phytoplankton and microbial communities to fish for larger aquatic animals i e beavers and waterfowls three relevant studies provided totally different outcomes with beavers negatively affected by even low intensity fires whereas boreal waterfowls were resilient to fire activity and frequent prescribed burns bioaccumulation of mercury hg and methyl mercury mehg has been a major research theme since the late 1990s particularly in lake ecosystems available studies show contrasting results a strong increase in bioaccumulated mehg in a mountain lake a decrease in mehg concentration in a boreal plain lake and no difference in mehg or hg concentrations in water or along the trophic chain in another boreal plain lake 4 discussion 4 1 state of knowledge our scoping review of 82 studies conducted in canada and alaska revealed a positive trend in the number of studies addressing post fire changes in hydrology and impacts to ecosystem services a trend that we expect to continue musetta lambert et al 2019 robinne et al 2019 tank et al 2019 while this increase in published research is likely due to increasing concern about the issues associated with wildfire on water supplies coogan et al 2019 hanes et al 2019 some of this trend may be due to an overall increase in the number of studies published in environmental sciences over the past four decades aznar sánchez et al 2019 although the majority of historical studies across northern latitudes in canada and alaska quantified the effects of wildfire on aquatic ecosystem health or water chemistry there was a notable increase in the emphasis on the threats of wildfire to community water supply emelko et al 2016 mahat et al 2016 winkler et al 2015 geographically the studies were concentrated in small clusters dispersed across the vast canadian territory and alaska consequently some ecological regions with different wildfire regimes hydrology and socio economic activity have been overlooked yet further comparison with available data fig 1 coupled to projected changes in wildfire regimes and hydrologic functioning indicates the ubiquity of post fire challenges to water supplies albeit with different local challenges al ibrahim and patrick 2017 price and heberling 2018 robinne et al 2019 for instance al ibrahim and patrick 2017 mentioned wildfire threats to the water supply of halifax nova scotia population 400 000 however no wildfire water risks study appears to have been conducted in nova scotia to date even in well studied ecological regions the causes of differences in watershed response to fire remain difficult to decipher owens et al 2013 pomeroy et al 2012 silins et al 2009 springer et al 2015 indeed the inherently opportunistic nature of wildfire hydrology field research often means that pre fire data are not available this underscores the importance of long term monitoring and field campaigns for data collection blöschl et al 2019 burt and mcdonnell 2015 mcdonnell et al 2018 our review found that the previous research across the study region has included a diversity of foci data and methods which illustrates strong heterogeneity in approaches to wildfire and water problems in canada and alaska most importantly there has been a high degree of variability in the descriptions of the fire characteristics watershed topography and precipitation which hinders cross site comparisons neary et al 1999 shakesby and doerr 2006 some of this variability is due to a a lack of pre fire data which does not allow the researcher to accurately quantify fire severity or pre fire hydrology b the short term funding cycle that does not facilitate longer term research on these topics and c the comparatively few number of studies on post fire fire hydrology to permit detection of trends if present within and across regions bladon et al 2014 blöschl et al 2019 moody et al 2013 in addition the diversity of study designs makes comparisons difficult notably the sample size varied considerably i e between one and 50 lakes while in some cases the sample size changed over the course of the study whereas others mixed a set of streams and lakes the contrasting post fire response of lacustrine ecosystems indicated that the environmental settings of lakes e g size depth trophic status peatland cover drainage ratio input precipitation remained the main controls of post fire response 80 variance explained in some cases e g lewis et al 2014 patoine 2002 pinel alloul et al 1998 planas et al 2000 for instance charette and prepas 2003 showed that phytoplankton response to fire including toxic cyanobacteria was likely controlled by depth in boreal plains headwater lakes mceachern et al 2002 and jalal et al 2005 suggested that wildfires in peat dominated watersheds likely would not result in increased primary productivity which is counter to most stream studies that have illustrated that fire results in increased nutrients increased algal productivity and the associated public health implications they attributed this lack of algal response in peat dominated watersheds to amplification of n limitation and light extinction due to higher doc exports shield plains and cordillera ecoregions also showed clear differences in lakes post fire response with a generally greater response in mountain and shield zones garcia et al 2007 garcia and carignan 2000 compared to the plains lewis et al 2014 for instance kelly et al 2006 showed a 5 fold increase in mercury hg accumulation in rainbow trout in a mountain lake reaching concentration levels potentially harmful to human health alternatively allen et al 2005 showed a decrease in mehg concentration in a boreal plain lake which has previously been related to post fire increases in doc and productivity of lower trophic levels garcia and carignan 2005 1999 in contrast to observations of increases and decreases in hg after wildfires garcia and carignan 2000 1999 showed no difference in mehg or hg concentrations in water or along the trophic chain in the boreal plains these contrasting observations highlight the many uncertainties that remain regarding the differential effects of wildfires on water quality across ecoregions our review also showed that the hydrologic response of northern riverine ecosystems to fire is highly variable in some studies both annual streamflow and peakflows increased post fire e g pomeroy et al 2012 springer et al 2015 while in other studies only annual water yields increased e g eaton et al 2010a mahat et al 2015 for example schindler et al 1980 reported a two year increase in annual yield after fire even under drier conditions on the canadian shield including higher baseflows comparatively pelster et al 2008 reported higher water yield six years after fire in the boreal plains conversely our review indicated that observed wildfire impacts on erosion mechanisms and water quality in northern watersheds might have important implications for watershed health and downstream water supplies several studies in headwaters showed post fire stream contamination by excess nutrients doc chemicals e g mercury and sediments that could create various challenges for the production of drinking water emelko et al 2016 2011 silins et al 2014 or the consumption of aquatic food kelly et al 2006 for example beaty 1994 reported a 20 fold increase in bedload transport the first year following an initial fire in northwestern ontario that resulted in a 20 fold increase in bedload transport during the first post fire year similarly p concentrations were elevated up to 7 years after wildfire and over 10 km downstream of the burned area in a study in the rocky mountains emelko et al 2016 wagner et al 2014 reported a change in stream thermal regime with 1 0 3 0 c increases in mean daily maximum temperature in burned watersheds of the rocky mountain which can negatively impact cold adapted aquatic organisms despite a majority of studies focusing on water chemistry we note a lack of quantitative information on certain chemicals released during and after wildfire for example studies in north carolina and new mexico point to increased post fire levels of free cyanide from ash and sodium ferrohexacyanide from fire retardant respectively in surface runoff barber et al 2003 gallaher et al 2002 depending on the timing and concentration of release this can have episodic toxic effects on aquatic life however studies on post fire cyanide are few in number and we found none for high latitude forests northern watersheds are highly influenced by permafrost and snow permafrost adds another dimension to post fire water chemistry because it acts as a barrier to infiltration and transportation of nutrients to deeper soil layers and restricts water to the active layer petrone et al 2007 discontinuous permafrost may regulate stream solute concentrations by forcing hydrologic flowpaths through the organic surface layer resulting in strong variations in dissolved organic matter dom inputs after a fire betts and jones 2009 petrone et al 2007 many studies also provided strong evidence for increased snow water equivalent in burned areas e g burles and boon 2011 pomeroy et al 2012 winkler et al 2015 an earlier and shorter snowmelt freshet e g burles and boon 2011 winkler et al 2015 and a greater contribution of snowmelt to annual streamflow e g eaton et al 2010a owens et al 2013 although mahat et al 2015 showed an increase in peakflows due to snowmelt runoff several studies noted the opposite response which was likely due to a decoupling of snowmelt between burned and unburned areas e g burke et al 2005 eaton et al 2010b owens et al 2013 climate change may also be expected to influence the post fire snow cover dynamics ireson et al 2015 again creating uncertainty in projecting post fire responses based on the spatially and temporally limited research in this region interestingly the current knowledge of fire effects on aquatic ecosystems generally points towards ecosystem resistance and or resiliency in both streams and lakes this suggests the adaptation of aquatic ecosystems to natural fire activity jalal et al 2005 kreutzweiser et al 2012 lewis et al 2014 as is commonly accepted for northern forests as a whole burton et al 2008 stewart et al 2012 for instance naylor et al 2012 reported that boreal riparian forests can burn extensively meaning that over protecting riparian buffers from disturbances can be detrimental to aquatic habitat diversity the observed rejuvenation effect on aquatic habitats seems to favor long term ecosystem productivity which suggests that safeguarding and restoring fire regimes may benefit aquatic ecosystems through enhanced watershed health cott et al 2010 tonn et al 2004 this ecological need may be difficult to reconcile with demand for provisioning services i e angling due to potential short term depreciation of aquatic ecosystem health and further implications for human health e g mercury bioaccumulation in fire dependent watersheds experiencing a high demand for hes risk mitigation will have to include fire as part of the solution to stabilize changing watershed functioning creed et al 2014 hanes et al 2019 rocca et al 2014 davidson and eaton 2015 and charron and johnson 2006 also strongly suggested stream aquatic habitat dependency on post fire hydrologic pulses of water sediment and debris influencing stream morphology and riparian vegetation implications of these findings are important for habitat conservation as they suggest that fire disturbances within their natural range of variability and the associated post fire pulses are necessary processes supporting long term aquatic ecosystem health in northern forests jentsch and white 2019 rocca et al 2014 global environmental change especially climate change was rarely addressed specifically and only in simulation studies mahat and anderson 2013 in northern latitudes the balance between annual precipitation and annual potential evapotranspiration provides a rough index of water availability for streamflow as well as soil and groundwater recharge however post fire changes in snow cover expected decreases in snowmelt and glacier contributions to streamflow and increases in pet hember et al 2017 marshall et al 2011 vincent et al 2015 suggest a stronger possibility of scenarios where wildfire leads to the contamination of limited water supplies from forests in these regions bladon et al 2014 similar concerns have been expressed in other parts of the world such as australia lane et al 2010 and portugal santos et al 2015 where wildfire activity is already demonstrably affected by climate change and other anthropogenic stressors although summer storms in the central boreal forest and wet years in the western mountains seem to be primary triggers for post fire response e g burke et al 2005 prepas et al 2003a shifts in seasonality and magnitude of precipitation will increasingly complicate our ability to project post fire responses 4 2 limitations our scoping review enabled us to rapidly and systematically summarize the literature associated with the pressing environmental questions associated with wildfire water security and ecosystem services in northern latitudes however the scoping approach is limited due to a focus on the quantity of available information rather than on an in depth analysis of its quality as would be completed in more typical reviews thus while this approach enabled us to address the main topics in the selected studies and note the general results our findings are not meant to provide conclusive evidence nor any guideline regarding the best approach to study wildfire risks to water security in northern watersheds our review was also limited in scope and did not include studies in peatlands we acknowledge the importance of peatlands which cover no less than 13 of the canadian landmass and 64 in the boreal forest tarnocai et al 2011 however peatlands uniquely play a critical role in wildfire spread and affect water distribution horizontally and vertically within the landscape thompson et al 2019 waddington et al 2015 as such they also buffer the impacts of wildfires on water quantity and quality pelster et al 2008 prepas et al 2006 despite their critical importance they were beyond our focus on surface water bodies and we strongly encourage continued research in these unique environments finally our review focused on the effects of wildfire on a subset of hydrologic functions in northern latitude studies again we acknowledge that wildfires are known to have direct effects on many other hydrologic processes e g interception evapotranspiration national research council 2008 we also acknowledge that local post fire changes in the forest water balance can ultimately affect the broader water cycle and hes in high latitude watersheds bond lamberty et al 2009 waddington et al 2015 however in constraining the objectives of our review we felt that most impacted hydrologic processes would at least be indirectly addressed in other aspects of our review 5 research agenda in this first systematic review of post fire hydrology in the high latitude forests of north america we have covered 40 years of research on hydrology geomorphology water quality and aquatic ecosystem quality in lakes open wetlands and rivers despite an increasing number of studies on wildfire impacts on water chemistry and aquatic ecosystem responses to wildfires other hydrologic services like drinking water source supply recreation and fish health have received comparatively less attention based on our results and recent publications addressing the forest fire water nexus elsewhere bladon 2018 hallema et al 2019a martin 2016 we propose a list of priorities for post fire hydrologic research in this region carignan and steedman 2000 mahat et al 2015 our results show marked differences in study design description of the hydrologic setting fire characteristics and general reporting of results this hinders cross site comparisons and detection of general patterns in post fire watershed response as such this precludes the ability to design appropriate fire and post fire management strategies e g prescribed burn programs mechanical fuel reduction fire suppression post fire forest restoration to effectively mitigate effects on freshwater resources we argue for the need for the wildfire water research community to develop a more standardized protocol for the description of watershed settings and the post fire environment this will help ensure that the same information is captured across studies and that their results are comparable thereby enabling researchers to undertake meta analyses and develop watershed health indicators adapted to northern fire conditions dunn and bakker 2011 flotemersch et al 2016 smith et al 2016 studies on post fire changes in ecohydrological processes and freshwater services have mainly focused on aquatic habitats and water chemistry despite evidence that hes are connected creed et al 2016 sun et al 2017 the lack of studies analyzing cultural services is a problem that can be extended to the ecosystem services literature as a whole satz et al 2013 whereas the lack of studies focusing on other hes is related to the relative novelty of the topic post fire hydrologic studies should strive to describe results within the context of hydrologic services especially when they involve water supply issues to downstream communities so that appropriate indicators of risks to water resources can be developed creed et al 2016 grizzetti et al 2016 vollmer et al 2018 future research must also prioritize studies with a focus on fire impacts on other hes particularly drinking water provision flash flood mitigation and recreational uses as exemplified by jordan 2016 and emelko et al 2011 the combined effect of wildfires and climate trends on water supplies also necessitates regional assessments of water issues hallema et al 2019b which should be integrated with transparent cost benefit analyses of hes degradation due to wildfire price and heberling 2018 we acknowledge that conducting such studies is challenging due to the absence of baseline information e g spatial economic on the majority of hydrologic services provided by high latitude forests the large spatial extent of fire activity across the region the strong variability in vulnerability of communities relying on fire affected watersheds and the uncertain costs and benefits of enhancing hydrologic resilience of fire prone watersheds e g with fuel treatments we therefore argue for an initial focus on quantifying and mapping hes provided by northern forest watersheds which future efforts could build on however the mapping approach must be adaptive and part of an ongoing effort as illustrated for instance by the high resolution mapping of river characteristics in canada ouellet dallaire et al 2019 and by the assessment of drinking water production costs that can be related to upstream forest health and disturbances price et al 2017 robinne et al 2019 temporal and spatial scales affect our understanding of ecohydrologic processes and hydro sociological interactions that cannot be captured by studies at a single watershed scale conducted over a few years bakker 2012 sivapalan et al 2014 recent work on forest cover and water yield interactions revealed that the effect of cumulative disturbances at large scales is not monotonic or unidirectional and could have long lasting and extensive effects li et al 2018 2017 zhang and wei 2014 therefore there is a need to study longer term interactions between hydrologic and fire regimes in northern watersheds to date most studies are short term and focus on the aftermath of a single wildfire a common pitfall of post fire environmental assessments in general neary et al 1999 vieira et al 2015 however high latitude forests are generally fire prone and fire dependent which suggests a likely dynamic equilibrium between landscape fire occurrence its resulting pattern on the forest mosaic and the movement of water across the landscape chanasyk et al 2003 devito et al 2012 understanding this equilibrium might be key to designing future strategies to adapt to global environmental change where wildfires have a place in ensuring water security in this respect the need for the creation and maintenance of long term ecological research sites combined with a thorough analysis of existing data could provide invaluable insights to learning how to cope with more unpredictable hydroclimatic extremes huntington 2006 milly et al 2008 as such increasing data availability combined with a multi scale approach to studying compound fire hydrologic processes and services may be key to enabling effective decisions to preserve water security in canada and alaska bakker 2012 bakker and cook 2011 finally the limited number of studies that have used computational modeling data mining and remote sensing technologies indicates that cutting edge advances in the general hydrologic sciences have yet to be mainstreamed in the sub field of post fire hydrology at least in canada and alaska for example remote sensing methods to monitor inland waters and the ecosystem services they provide have made significant progress de araujo barbosa et al 2015 palmer et al 2015 specifically recent studies have relied on remote sensing to identify potential harmful algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs keith et al 2018 kudela et al 2015 given that algal blooms have been noted as a major post fire challenge to drinking water supplies this would seem like an opportunity for the post fire hydrology research community to address hydrologic modeling of northern regions has also made significant advances with the development of dedicated modeling frameworks such as the cold region hydrologic model pomeroy et al 2007 and raven chernos et al 2017 that remain to be fully tested in a post fire environment addressing emerging questions associated with global environmental change requires the use of such advanced technologies carignan and steedman 2000 thompson et al 2013 adapting current hydrologic models to enable scenario testing for post wildfire conditions can provide testable hypotheses regarding the magnitude of hydrologic effects associated with high severity fires the temporal and spatial duration of effects and the interact with other pressures such as climate change and human demand for water moreover the combination of simulation modeling with remote sensing data could also be used to improve understanding of the effects of wildfires on key water quality parameters e g sediment limiting nutrients carbon in both upstream and downstream environments as well as the potential impacts on aquatic ecosystem health e g primary productivity fish habitat modeling such modeling efforts could provide important information for the implementation and the revision of source water supply and protection strategies post fire simulation modeling could also further help decipher the future effect of global change particularly climate variations and increasing water demand of expanding urban

5858,an experimental loamy sand soil tank 12 m long 1 5 m wide 1 5 m deep with a slope of 3 was designed to conduct artificial rainfall runoff experiments and continuously monitor soil moisture sm rainfall surface runoff sr and subsurface runoff ssr a total of 28 rainfall runoff events are analysed to investigate the capability of estimating rainfall from sm observations through sm2rain algorithm which is then adjusted in sm2rain exp according to the conditions of the artificial rainfall runoff experiment i e including the sr and ssr component the main purpose of this study is to test the underlying hypotheses of sm2rain algorithm in a controlled experiment to better understand the most important processes driving the relationship between sm and rainfall results suggest that sm2rain exp demonstrates satisfactory performance in estimating rainfall with respect to the observed data when the aggregation intervals of rainfall increase the sm2rain exp performances improve the integration of 10 cm and 30 cm sm data yields performance scores better than using the sensor at 10 cm and 30 cm depth alone the lagged response of 30 cm sm sensor has a slight influence on the results in addition the major contribution to the estimated rainfall is provided by the term incorporating the sm variations 85 followed by the sr 12 which is different from the hypothesis of neglecting sr made in the classical sm2rain by comparing the results obtained by sm2rain and sm2rain exp sm2rain exp is proved more stable and accurate the recognition of the more suitable soil depth needed for obtaining good results and of the important sr contribution could help to clarify some important aspects related to the usage of satellite surface sm data for estimating rainfall keywords

pennington et al 2014 sun et al 2018 commonly rain gauges are considered the best choice to measure rainfall accurately and reliably lanza and vuerich 2009 although the density of rain gauge network is sparse in many areas worldwide ground based weather radar krajewski and smith 2002 and satellite based remote sensing ebert et al 2007 are the viable options to obtain appropriate rainfall characterization over large areas however both radar and remote sensing techniques suffer from several limitations kidd and levizzani 2011 krajewski and smith 2002 villarini and krajewski 2010 in the last decade great deal of efforts has been made to improve satellite rainfall estimates by using sm observations brocca et al 2014 2013 crow et al 2011 2008 pellarin et al 2013 crow et al 2011 and pellarin et al 2013 have made some attempts to correct satellite rainfall estimates using the soil moisture analysis rainfall tool smart and antecedent precipitation index modification api mod based on the well known relationship between temporal evolution of rainfall and soil moisture sm recently a bottom up estimating rainfall by sm methodology named sm2rain developed by brocca et al 2014 2013 has opened new venues to directly provide accumulated rainfall estimates by using the variations in time of the amount of water stored into the soil that is regarded as a natural rain gauge in some studies sm2rain based rainfall estimates have been found to be even more accurate than the classical top down method e g brocca et al 2016 more in detail the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network persiann sorooshian et al 1998 and other related products are classified as top down rainfall products the top down approaches are based on inversion techniques where the upwelling radiation or backscattered signal for radars is related to the surface precipitation rate

irrigation estimation e g brocca et al 2017 and satellite rainfall products performance assessment e g massari et al 2017 for the analysis with in situ sm specifically brocca et al 2013 employed sm datasets from in situ observations over italy spain and france to satisfactorily estimate rainfall amount via sm2rain at different time intervals from 3 to 72 h in a following study at ten sites in europe it is found that the performance in calibration and validation periods matches well and the results obtained for sites with humid temperate climates and 15 cm depth sm are better brocca et al 2015 similarly pan et al 2014 estimated rainfall by using hourly in situ sm measurements at depths of 10 20 and 40 cm and found the promising results compared to the data from rain gauges on the north eastern qinghai tibet plateau recently there are some studies employing approaches similar to sm2rain edwin 2019 used cosmic ray neutron detectors to estimate in situ sm and inverted the water balance equation for estimating 1 year rainfall at four field sites in the united states li et al 2019 collected sm data from six different plots in the middle heihe river basin of china and made an attempt to test the possibility of sm in estimating the soil water budget components swbcs including the irrigation water amount the satisfactory results obtained in the mentioned studies validate the possibility of using sm observations for estimating the rainfall amount and confirm the reliability of sm2rain however the algorithm has some limitations and it is expected to provide less accurate results in some conditions such as at soil saturation brocca et al 2013 in mountainous regions ciabatta et al 2016 for dense vegetation coverage massari et al 2016 and for frozen soils brocca et al 2014 because the performance of the algorithm is significantly affected by the quality of sm input the objective of this study is to make a first attempt to evaluate the possibility and reliability to estimate rainfall using high resolution sm data at soil tank laboratory experiments song and wang 2019 through the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 rainfall is always artificial indeed the physical mechanism of sm2rain and its assumptions are worth to be investigated in depth well instrumented laboratory experiment could give a chance to prove the reliability of the assumptions made in sm2rain holko et al 2015 the analysis is performed on a plot scale at 2 min high resolution temporal sampling during 28 rainfall runoff events in the period 2016 2018 the estimated rainfall data is compared against the observed rainfall in the artificial rainfall experiment the study consists of two main parts firstly we investigate the possibility to estimate rainfall from high resolution sm observations via sm2rain exp which is an adjusted version of sm2rain including the contribution of surface runoff sr and subsurface runoff ssr measured in the soil tank experiment we also explore the influence of temporal aggregation intervals as well as the depth of sm observations on the performances secondly we assess the contributions of sr and ssr to total rainfall estimated through sm2rain and compare the performance of the classical sm2rain with the sm2rain exp formulation 2 material and methods 2 1 tank experiment the artificial rainfall experiments were conducted in a soil tank which is located in the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university jiangsu province china the experimental runoff soil tank is 12 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 5 m deep with a slope of 3 which represents a gentle slope in a flat area fig 1 at the bottom of the tank there is a 5 cm depth coarse sand layer above it there is a loamy sand soil layer of 140 cm because the coarse sand layer can make the soil water drain out of the soil tank easily groundwater was not considered in this study six groups of sm sensors 10hs capacitance sensors produced by onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts usa are equipped to measure volumetric sm at 10 30 60 100 cm depths and horizontally and evenly located away from the top boundary of the soil tank sm profiles are identified as s1 6 in the following sections the sensors were connected to h21 002 data loggers and the volumetric sm was continuously measured with high temporal resolution of 30 s during the artificial precipitation as well as after rainfall ceased most notably in 2016 2018 rainfall experiments some of the sm sensors at different depths could not provide the accurate values and these were changed to new ones including the 30 cm and 60 cm depths in s1 10 cm depth in s3 and 10 cm in s4 comparatively speaking the sm values obtained from s2 were relatively complete a rainfall simulator is installed twenty meters above the soil tank it can simulate rainfall covering the entire tank with different intensities the soil tank can be surely wetted during the artificial rain since the wetted area is designed to be 8 m wide three tipping bucket rain gauges hobo rg3 m produced by onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts usa were used to observe the rainfall patterns with a resolution of 0 2 mm located on specific sites fig 1 surface runoff sr and subsurface runoff ssr were both measured continuously including the rising limb and the recessing limb of the hydrograph during rainfall events for further details about the soil parameters and the calibration processes of instruments the reader is referred to song and wang 2019 over forty rainfall runoff events were conducted in total however given the quality of the data only 28 rainfall runoff events table 1 are selected for further analysis in this study rainfall sr ssr and volumetric sm data were aggregated to a 2 min interval from the original aggregation at 30 s 2 2 sm2rain equations 2 2 1 classical sm2rain the classical sm2rain algorithm based on the inversion of the soil water balance equation is proposed by brocca et al 2014 2013 it can be used for retrieving rainfall directly from sm observations specifically the soil water balance equation for a layer depth z l can be described by the following expression 1 znds t dt p t sr t e t ssr t dp t where z l is the soil depth n is the porosity s t is the relative saturation of the soil or relative sm t t is the time p t sr t e t ssr t and dp t l t are the rainfall surface runoff evapotranspiration subsurface runoff and deep percolation rates respectively two assumptions are made in the classical formulation of sm2rain the surface runoff sr t and the evapotranspiration e t rates are negligible during rainfall events i e sr t 0 and e t 0 brocca et al 2015 have demonstrated with in situ observations that neglecting the surface runoff and the evapotranspiration terms does not deteriorate the algorithm performance however the validity of this assumption at the soil tank scale needs to be investigated because the bottom of the soil tank is a steel plate deep percolation is absent i e dp t 0 for the subsurface runoff rate according to famiglietti and wood 1994 the following relation may be adopted ssr t as t b where a l t and b are two parameters expressing the nonlinearity between drainage rate and soil saturation brocca et al 2013 based on the previous assumptions and the rearrangement of equation above replacing zn with z the rainfall rate can be obtained by the following ordinary differential equation 2 p t z ds t dt as t b this equation can be applied to estimate the rainfall rate from the knowledge of relative sm s t its fluctuations in time ds t dt and three parameters z a and b the parameters are calibrated by minimizing the root mean square error with respect to reference rainfall observations 2 2 2 sm2rain exp according to the measurements carried out in the experimental tank and the hypothesis that rainfall cannot be expressed as a function of storage changes only we adjust the equations above with a new formulation identified as sm2rain exp including the sr t and ssr t rates 3 p t z ds t dt sr t ssr t similar to eq 2 the evapotranspiration rate is not considered since evapotranspiration was minimal during rainfall events and the surface of soil tank was covered with a plastic film to minimize evaporation losses after each rainfall event in sm2rain exp the sr t and ssr t are obtained from observations available at soil tank and hence not neglected sr t or estimated as a function of sm ssr t as in the classical sm2rain formulation eq 2 in our laboratory experiments vegetation is absent and during the selected rainfall runoff events frozen conditions do not occur hence other limitations of sm2rain approach are not present 2 3 performance metrics the accuracy of sm2rain and sm2rain exp algorithms is assessed by using several performance metrics the pearson s correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse in mm min and the mean relative error bias in mm min which can be regarded as unconditional scores are calculated over the soil tank to assess the agreement between observed rainfall from the rain gauges and estimated rainfall via sm2rain and sm2rain exp additionally kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 which takes into account the correlation the bias and the variability of estimated and observed rainfall is considered here to assess model performance camici et al 2018 massari et al 2018 kge scores range between and 1 with 1 as perfect model results 3 results and discussions 3 1 sm2rain exp results using one probe to test the capability of sm2rain exp algorithm to estimate rainfall one representative sm profile s2 is selected as input rainfall is estimated and compared against observed rainfall from rain gauges at a 2 min aggregation step the s2 data is relatively complete and high quality in 2016 2018 experimental period the analysis is carried out using the 28 rainfall events listed in table 1 the time period selected for each rainfall event shown in fig 2 depends on the rainfall duration and it starts end one hour before the beginning after the end of each rainfall event sm values at depth of 10 cm and 30 cm are used to simulate rainfall as the temporal variations at 60 cm and 100 cm depth are negligible during the selected rainfall events the integration between 10 cm and 30 cm sm values is carried out through linear merging with weights 1 3 and 2 3 respectively depending on the respective soil layer depth the values of the parameter z in the analytical eq 3 is set to be equal to 600 mm by considering the representative soil layer depth in the soil tank the porosity value n is set to 0 25 and it was determined by cutting rings 100 cm3 from undisturbed soil cores collected from each transect at 10 30 cm depths as shown in fig 2 a good agreement between the observed and the estimated rainfall for each event has been obtained which demonstrates the capability of sm2rain exp algorithm to satisfactorily simulate rainfall using the sm observations in the soil tank in terms of performance scores the r and the kge values are equal to 0 869 and 0 709 respectively which means that model results are very good note that it is computed at 2 min time resolution with respect to bias and rmse the values are 0 038 and 0 184 mm min respectively which also indicate high performance of sm2rain exp however the underestimation of some rainfall events should be noticed especially in the relatively dry events at the end of the period this might be due to deficiencies in the sm2rain exp formulation but also to inter calibration problems of sm observations in 2018 i e sm variations in 2018 are lower than previous years due to problems in the calibration of the sensor differently during wet conditions the expected underestimation of sm2rain algorithm due to saturation problems e g brocca et al 2013 ciabatta et al 2015 crow et al 2011 massari et al 2018 is not present as in the sm2rain exp formulation sr is explicitly considered some rainfall peaks are not correctly identified indeed we have observed a double peak in some of the estimated rainfall events which show a sudden decrease of estimated rainfall after the first pulse and then a successive increase similarly to massari et al 2014 this is to be attributed to the time difference in the response of 10 cm and 30 cm sm during the infiltration processes the specific response time analysis for the soil tank can be found in song and wang 2019 3 2 sm2rain exp results using all available probes in this section the analysis of the performance has been carried out for 21 rainfall events instead of 28 for simulating rainfall based on four sm profiles s1 s2 s3 and s4 20 events for 2016 and 1 event for 2017 the events are extracted by considering the reliability of sm sensors indeed in 2018 some sm sensors have been changed and hence the temporal consistency over time is not ensured actually the s3 sensor is not working at all in 2018 thus constraining us to not select events in 2018 meanwhile s5 and s6 data are not available continuously in time during 2016 and 2017 fig 3 shows the boxplots of the performance scores r kge rmse and bias obtained for each rainfall event note that the 2 min accumulated rainfall is considered by a simple visual inspection of fig 3 the estimated rainfall has proven to be in good agreement with the observed data over each rainfall event with different performance scores for different sm profiles indicating that the results are depending strongly on the quality of the input sm observations brocca et al 2016 ciabatta et al 2016 the four sm profiles show different scenarios specifically s2 provides the highest r and kge values r always higher than 0 9 the lowest median bias value equal to 0 024 mm min and median rmse value equal to 0 148 mm min s2 and s3 have a relatively stable range in performance scores whereas the scores for s1 and s4 show a stronger variability more in details s1 has the lowest r values probably because of the sensor inconsistency during the rainfall events in 2016 and 2017 s4 has the lowest kge and largest bias the bias values range from 0 024 mm min to 0 072 mm min for s1 4 while the negative values indicate a typical underestimation of the observed rainfall fereidoon and koch 2018 as discussed previously it is worth to underline that the median performances of the average sm profiles avg are lower than some single sensors due to the differences of sm observations at each profile as illustrated in fig 4 in which the comparison between the observed and estimated rainfall based on the average of the four sm profiles is given the underestimations are much more obvious than those in fig 2 only s2 the performance scores yield r 0 904 kge 0 637 bias 0 044 mm min and rmse 0 172 mm min while more accurate results would have been expected due to the use of multiple sensors ciabatta et al 2015 the data quality in different sm profiles plays an important role in this soil tank 3 3 influence of temporal aggregation intervals the temporal resolution of sm measurements is a critical issue for obtaining accurate rainfall estimates from sm2rain in this study performance scores are separately described at different temporal scales 2 min 10 min 20 min and 30 min accumulated rainfall the summary statistics for the comparison between estimated and observed rainfall data are given in table 2 as an example s2 profile data for the 21 rainfall events in 2016 and 2017 is selected the results with other profiles are similar as would be expected the performances improve by increasing the aggregation intervals of rainfall as evidenced by the increase of r and kge the reduction of rmse and a decreasing of the spread in the bias values which is in line with earlier findings brocca et al 2016 2013 the lower performance scores obtained by 2 min accumulated rainfall should be attributed to the inversion of sm data in the sm2rain algorithm which affects the quality of estimated rainfall ciabatta et al 2018 indeed sm2rain is highly sensitive to the temporal resolution of sm observations brocca et al 2013 as it can be seen in table 2 in terms of r and kge the improvements due to the increased rainfall accumulation intervals are evident and significant with an increase of nearly 7 and 10 for 30 min results compared to the 2 min estimated results 3 4 influence of the depth of sm observations in order to explore the effect of the depth of sm observations on the performances of the algorithm the sensor at 10 cm and 30 cm depths alone and their integration are analysed as before r kge bias and rmse metrics are computed by comparing the observed and estimated rainfall values with s2 profile in 21 rainfall events specifically z value is set to 600 mm for 30 cm depth and the integration of 10 cm and 30 cm as before and to 300 mm for 10 cm depth fig 5 indicates that the integration of 10 cm and 30 cm by using sm2rain exp yields the most satisfactory performance scores which is consistent with the result obtained by brocca et al 2015 who studied ten sites across europe with different sm sampling depths and found that the res site for which the sensor is installed vertically between 0 and 30 cm depth is performing the best by critically analysing fig 5 non negligible differences can be observed over the usage of 10 cm sm and integration of 10 cm and 30 cm where four performance metrics provides quite different results r values are slightly better for the 10 cm 30 cm configuration with respect to 10 cm alone and much better than 30 cm all the other performance scores show much better performance for the 10 cm 30 cm configuration the use of 10 cm depth only would alleviate the double peak because it is mainly impacted by the lag response of 30 cm sm but it shows lower performance overall these results are in agreement with those obtained by massari et al 2014 who indicated that the depth of sm observations might influence the estimated rainfall pattern satellite sm observations are available for a layer depth of approximately 2 5 10 cm but sm can vary significantly with depth souza et al 2018 a number of studies using satellite sm data reported the problem of underestimating rainfall brocca et al 2016 brunetti et al 2018 ciabatta et al 2015 fereidoon and koch 2018 jalilvand et al 2018 maggioni and massari 2018 massari et al 2018 thaler et al 2018 apart from other factors e g rainfall regime snow frozen soil and complex topography sm depth needs to be considered and emphasized the discussion about sm depths above could help to clarify some important aspects related to the use of satellite surface sm data for estimating rainfall 3 5 contributions of sr and ssr to the sm2rain water balance equation with the purpose of quantifying the contribution of sr and ssr in sm2rain exp the contribution of these two terms to the total estimated rainfall during each rainfall event i e when rainfall is greater than 0 is computed the contribution of ssr is 3 1 which can be considered negligible whereas sr reaches a value of 12 1 thus the major contribution is provided by the term incorporating the sm variations with a value of approximately 85 followed by sr in order to figure out the contribution of sm evapotranspiration sr and drainage term brocca et al 2015 employed four simplified algorithm versions of sm2rain with synthetically generated data and in situ observations for ten sites across europe they found that the average contribution of sr and evapotranspiration components amounted to less than 4 of the total rainfall while sm 63 and drainage term 30 provided a much higher contribution indicating sr and evapotranspiration terms can be neglected but for petrelle site located in central italy contribution of sr to the estimation of rainfall is 16 which is similar to our results recently fereidoon and koch 2019 also investigated the contributions of different hydrological components to sm2rain at different sites in the karkheh river basin southwest iran and indicated that drainage and evapotranspiration contribute the most and least to the rainfall estimation the different contributions of each term in previous studies may be ascribed to the distinct conditions in study area i e soil depth soil texture and topography evapotranspiration can be ignored in the algorithm especially in our indoor soil tank since the absence of vegetation on the left study area fig 1 the reasons why the contribution of sr should be noticed is that sr contribution comes next to sm in the soil tank and it is a vital component in the hydrological processes occurring at the plot scale 3 6 the differences between classical sm2rain and sm2rain exp with sr and ssr the differences between classical sm2rain with drainage rate and sm2rain exp with sr and ssr are distinguished according to eqs 2 and 3 using the integration of 10 cm and 30 cm depth profile s2 and 28 rainfall events note that in eq 2 the contribution of ssr interflow plus baseflow is represented in the term as t b brocca et al 2015 the calibration of classical sm2rain is necessary for the sake of producing a reliable estimation of rainfall the calibration process z is fixed to 600 mm only the parameters a and b are calibrated have considered the first 14 rainfall events by the minimization of rmse between 2 min observed and estimated rainfall the calibrated parameters yield to a 0 33 mm and b 1 as it can be seen in fig 6 the performance scores obtained for the classical sm2rain is r 0 825 kge 0 705 bias 0 016 mm min rmse 0 205 mm min while for the sm2rain exp with sr and ssr r 0 869 kge 0 709 bias 0 038 mm min rmse 0 184 mm min is obtained fig 2 as a result the differences are not significant by comparing fig 6 with fig 2 the rainfall patterns obtained by sm2rain perform as well as those obtained by sm2rain exp or even better however sm2rain presents a more significant underestimation in the relatively dry events 22 to 28 this could be ascribed to the contribution of sr as mentioned above fig 7 is shown to clarify the different simulation results with classical sm2rain and sm2rain exp the data are aggregated at 10 min time intervals for sake of visualization three components have been separated according to eqs 2 and 3 into z ds t dt as t b and sr t ssr t in fig 7 a it is obvious that the major contribution to the total estimated rainfall is due to sm variations as mentioned above for the two sm2rain formulations as t b and sr t ssr t are similar in the first 21 rainfall events while the remaining events differences are larger likely due to the sm conditions and the sr contribution fig 7 b and c further present the comparisons between the observed and estimated rainfall for the two formulations for the event 1 21 the estimated rainfall accumulations obtained by the classical sm2rain tend to be larger than those obtained by sm2rain exp while the opposite occurs for the event 22 28 as a whole the results from sm2rain exp is more stable and more accurate anyway we assume that the sm2rain algorithm could produce satisfactory and promising results at this experimental plot scale but the contribution of sr may not be negligible 4 conclusions an experimental soil tank 12 m long 1 5 m wide 1 5 m deep equipped with a spatially distributed instrument network was designed to conduct artificial rainfall runoff experiments rainfall surface runoff sr subsurface runoff ssr and volumetric soil moisture sm data were collected at the soil tank and aggregated to a 2 min interval this is the first study performing the validation of sm2rain hypothesis and formulation at the experimental plot scale the classic algorithm is modified to be sm2rain exp according to the condition of the artificial rainfall experiment and the fact that rainfall cannot be related only to storage changes based on the obtained results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the results in all available sm probes confirm the good capability of sm2rain exp algorithm in estimating rainfall allowing to apply successfully the method for the experimental soil tank with r and kge values greater than 0 8 and 0 7 respectively at 2 min time intervals 2 by increasing the aggregation interval performance scores show significant improvements with r kge values increasing from 0 91 0 81 to 0 97 0 89 with aggregation intervals from 2 min to 30 min 3 the integration of 10 cm and 30 cm sm data yields the most satisfactory performance scores with respect in using sensor at 10 cm and 30 cm depths alone 4 the major contribution to the total estimated rainfall is provided by the term incorporating the sm variations with a value of approximately 85 followed by the sr 12 indicating that sr cannot be neglected in sm2rain at plot scale 5 by comparing the results obtained by sm2rain and sm2rain exp sm2rain exp which includes sr and ssr is proved more stable and accurate notwithstanding the obtained results are related to the stability and quality of sm observed data this study provides satisfactory results and represents the first attempt to successfully apply the algorithm in the experimental soil tank more detailed analysis will be devoted to testing the ability of sm2rain in improving the performance in hydrological modelling at experimental plot scale further research of sm2rain will be addressed in verifying the influence of soil depth by selecting additional experimental or in situ networks worldwide the incorporation of surface and subsurface runoff rate observations or the implementation of more elaborated formulations for their estimation from sm data will be also the object of future studies credit authorship contribution statement shuang song conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing original

5858,an experimental loamy sand soil tank 12 m long 1 5 m wide 1 5 m deep with a slope of 3 was designed to conduct artificial rainfall runoff experiments and continuously monitor soil moisture sm rainfall surface runoff sr and subsurface runoff ssr a total of 28 rainfall runoff events are analysed to investigate the capability of estimating rainfall from sm observations through sm2rain algorithm which is then adjusted in sm2rain exp according to the conditions of the artificial rainfall runoff experiment i e including the sr and ssr component the main purpose of this study is to test the underlying hypotheses of sm2rain algorithm in a controlled experiment to better understand the most important processes driving the relationship between sm and rainfall results suggest that sm2rain exp demonstrates satisfactory performance in estimating rainfall with respect to the observed data when the aggregation intervals of rainfall increase the sm2rain exp performances improve the integration of 10 cm and 30 cm sm data yields performance scores better than using the sensor at 10 cm and 30 cm depth alone the lagged response of 30 cm sm sensor has a slight influence on the results in addition the major contribution to the estimated rainfall is provided by the term incorporating the sm variations 85 followed by the sr 12 which is different from the hypothesis of neglecting sr made in the classical sm2rain by comparing the results obtained by sm2rain and sm2rain exp sm2rain exp is proved more stable and accurate the recognition of the more suitable soil depth needed for obtaining good results and of the important sr contribution could help to clarify some important aspects related to the usage of satellite surface sm data for estimating rainfall keywords

is sparse in many areas worldwide ground based weather radar krajewski and smith 2002 and satellite based remote sensing ebert et al 2007 are the viable options to obtain appropriate rainfall characterization over large areas however both radar and remote sensing techniques suffer from several limitations kidd and levizzani 2011 krajewski and smith 2002 villarini and krajewski 2010 in the last decade great deal of efforts has been made to improve satellite rainfall estimates by using sm observations brocca et al 2014 2013 crow et al 2011 2008 pellarin et al 2013 crow et al 2011 and pellarin et al 2013 have made some attempts to correct satellite rainfall estimates using the soil moisture analysis rainfall tool smart and antecedent precipitation index modification api mod based on the well known relationship between temporal evolution of rainfall and soil moisture sm recently a bottom up estimating rainfall by sm methodology named sm2rain developed by brocca et al 2014 2013 has opened new venues to directly provide accumulated rainfall estimates by using the variations in time of the amount of water stored into the soil that is regarded as a natural rain gauge in some studies sm2rain based rainfall estimates have been found to be even more accurate than the classical top down method e g brocca et al 2016 more in detail the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network persiann sorooshian et al 1998 and other related products are classified

brocca et al 2014 sm2rain has been applied worldwide with in situ and satellite sm data on a local abera et al 2016 brocca et al 2016 2015 2013 ciabatta et al 2017 2015 massari et al 2014 tarpanelli

irrigation estimation e g brocca et al 2017 and satellite rainfall products performance assessment e g massari et al 2017 for the analysis with in situ sm specifically brocca et al 2013 employed sm datasets from in situ observations over italy spain and france to satisfactorily estimate rainfall amount via sm2rain at different time intervals from 3 to 72 h in a following study at ten sites in europe it is found that the performance in calibration and validation periods matches well and the results obtained for sites with humid temperate climates and 15 cm depth sm are better brocca et al 2015 similarly pan et al 2014 estimated rainfall by using hourly in situ sm measurements at depths of 10 20 and 40 cm and found the promising results compared to the data from rain gauges on the north eastern qinghai tibet plateau recently there are some studies employing approaches similar to sm2rain edwin 2019 used cosmic ray neutron detectors to estimate in situ sm and inverted the water balance equation for estimating 1 year rainfall at four field sites in the united states li et al 2019 collected sm data from six different plots in the middle heihe river basin of china and made an attempt to test the possibility of sm in estimating the soil water budget components swbcs including the irrigation water amount the satisfactory results obtained in the mentioned studies validate the possibility of using sm observations for estimating the rainfall amount and confirm the reliability of sm2rain however the algorithm has some limitations and it is expected to provide less accurate results in some conditions such as at soil saturation brocca et al 2013 in mountainous regions ciabatta et al 2016 for dense vegetation coverage massari et al 2016 and for frozen soils brocca et al 2014 because the performance of the algorithm is significantly affected by the quality of sm input the objective of this study is to make a first attempt to evaluate the possibility and reliability to estimate rainfall using high resolution sm data at soil tank laboratory experiments song and wang 2019 through the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 rainfall is always artificial indeed the physical mechanism of sm2rain and its assumptions are worth to be investigated in depth well instrumented laboratory experiment could give a chance to prove the reliability of the assumptions made in sm2rain holko et al 2015 the analysis is performed on a plot scale at 2 min high resolution temporal sampling during 28 rainfall runoff events in the period 2016 2018 the estimated rainfall data is compared against the observed rainfall in the artificial rainfall experiment the study consists of two main parts firstly we investigate the possibility to estimate rainfall from high resolution sm observations via sm2rain exp which is an adjusted version of sm2rain including the contribution of surface runoff sr and subsurface runoff ssr measured in the soil tank experiment we also explore the influence of temporal aggregation intervals as well as the depth of sm observations on the performances secondly we assess the contributions of sr and ssr to total rainfall estimated through sm2rain and compare the performance of the classical sm2rain with the sm2rain exp formulation 2 material and methods 2 1 tank experiment the artificial rainfall experiments were conducted in a soil tank which is located in the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university jiangsu province china the experimental runoff soil tank is 12 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 5 m deep with a slope of 3 which represents a gentle slope in a flat area fig 1 at the bottom of the tank there is a 5 cm depth coarse sand layer above it there is a loamy sand soil layer of 140 cm because the coarse sand layer can make the soil water drain out of the soil tank easily groundwater was not considered in this study six groups of sm sensors 10hs capacitance sensors produced by onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts usa are equipped to measure volumetric sm at 10 30 60 100 cm depths and horizontally and evenly located away from the top boundary of the soil tank sm profiles are identified as s1 6 in the following sections the sensors were connected to h21 002 data loggers and the volumetric sm was continuously measured with high temporal resolution of 30 s during the artificial precipitation as well as after rainfall ceased most notably in 2016 2018 rainfall experiments some of the sm sensors at different depths could not provide the accurate values and these were changed to new ones including the 30 cm and 60 cm depths in s1 10 cm depth in s3 and 10 cm in s4 comparatively speaking the sm values obtained from s2 were relatively complete a rainfall simulator is installed twenty meters above the soil tank it can simulate rainfall covering the entire tank with different intensities the soil tank can be surely wetted during the artificial rain since the wetted area is designed to be 8 m wide three tipping bucket rain gauges hobo rg3 m produced by onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts usa were used to observe the rainfall patterns with a resolution of 0 2 mm located on specific sites fig 1 surface runoff sr and subsurface runoff ssr were both measured continuously including the rising limb and the recessing limb of the hydrograph during rainfall events for further details about the soil parameters and the calibration processes of instruments the reader is referred to song and wang 2019 over forty rainfall runoff events were conducted in total however given the quality of the data only 28 rainfall runoff events table 1 are selected for further analysis in this study rainfall sr ssr and volumetric sm data were aggregated to a 2 min interval from the original aggregation at 30 s 2 2 sm2rain equations 2 2 1 classical sm2rain the classical sm2rain algorithm based on the inversion of the soil water balance equation is proposed by brocca et al 2014 2013 it can be used for retrieving rainfall directly from sm observations specifically the soil water balance equation for a layer depth z l can be described by the following expression 1 znds t dt p t sr t e t ssr t dp t where z l is the soil depth n is the porosity s t is the relative saturation of the soil or relative sm t t is the time p t sr t e t ssr t and dp t l t are the rainfall surface runoff evapotranspiration subsurface runoff and deep percolation rates respectively two assumptions are made in the classical formulation of sm2rain the surface runoff sr t and the evapotranspiration e t rates are negligible during rainfall events i e sr t 0 and e t 0 brocca et al 2015 have demonstrated with in situ observations that neglecting the surface runoff and the evapotranspiration terms does not deteriorate the algorithm performance however the validity of this assumption at the soil tank scale needs to be investigated because the bottom of the soil tank is a steel plate deep percolation is absent i e dp t 0 for the subsurface runoff rate according to famiglietti and wood 1994 the following relation may be adopted ssr t as t b where a l t and b are two parameters expressing the nonlinearity between drainage rate and soil saturation brocca et al 2013 based on the previous assumptions and the rearrangement of equation above replacing zn with z the rainfall rate can be obtained by the following ordinary differential equation 2 p t z ds t dt as t b this equation can be applied to estimate the rainfall rate from the knowledge of relative sm s t its fluctuations in time ds t dt and three parameters z a and b the parameters are calibrated by minimizing the root mean square error with respect to reference rainfall observations 2 2 2 sm2rain exp according to the measurements carried out in the experimental tank and the hypothesis that rainfall cannot be expressed as a function of storage changes only we adjust the equations above with a new formulation identified as sm2rain exp including the sr t and ssr t rates 3 p t z ds t dt sr t ssr t similar to eq 2 the evapotranspiration rate is not considered since evapotranspiration was minimal during rainfall events and the surface of soil tank was covered with a plastic film to minimize evaporation losses after each rainfall event in sm2rain exp the sr t and ssr t are obtained from observations available at soil tank and hence not neglected sr t or estimated as a function of sm ssr t as in the classical sm2rain formulation eq 2 in our laboratory experiments vegetation is absent and during the selected rainfall runoff events frozen conditions do not occur hence other limitations of sm2rain approach are not present 2 3 performance metrics the accuracy of sm2rain and sm2rain exp algorithms is assessed by using several performance metrics the pearson s correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse in mm min and the mean relative error bias in mm min which can be regarded as unconditional scores are calculated over the soil tank to assess the agreement between observed rainfall from the rain gauges and estimated rainfall via sm2rain and sm2rain exp additionally kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 which takes into account the correlation the bias and the variability of estimated and observed rainfall is considered here to assess model performance camici et al 2018 massari et al 2018 kge scores range between and 1 with 1 as perfect model results 3 results and discussions 3 1 sm2rain exp results using one probe to test the capability of sm2rain exp algorithm to estimate rainfall one representative sm profile s2 is selected as input rainfall is estimated and compared against observed rainfall from rain gauges at a 2 min aggregation step the s2 data is relatively complete and high quality in 2016 2018 experimental period the analysis is carried out using the 28 rainfall events listed in table 1 the time period selected for each rainfall event shown in fig 2 depends on the rainfall duration and it starts end one hour before the beginning after the end of each rainfall event sm values at depth of 10 cm and 30 cm are used to simulate rainfall as the temporal variations at 60 cm and 100 cm depth are negligible during the selected rainfall events the integration between 10 cm and 30 cm sm values is carried out through linear merging with weights 1 3 and 2 3 respectively depending on the respective soil layer depth the values of the parameter z in the analytical eq 3 is set to be equal to 600 mm by considering the representative soil layer depth in the soil tank the porosity value n is set to 0 25 and it was determined by cutting rings 100 cm3 from undisturbed soil cores collected from each transect at 10 30 cm depths as shown in fig 2 a good agreement between the observed and the estimated rainfall for each event has been obtained which demonstrates the capability of sm2rain exp algorithm to satisfactorily simulate rainfall using the sm observations in the soil tank in terms of performance scores the r and the kge values are equal to 0 869 and 0 709 respectively which means that model results are very good note that it is computed at 2 min time resolution with respect to bias and rmse the values are 0 038 and 0 184 mm min respectively which also indicate high performance of sm2rain exp however the underestimation of some rainfall events should be noticed especially in the relatively dry events at the end of the period this might be due to deficiencies in the sm2rain exp formulation but also to inter calibration problems of sm observations in 2018 i e sm variations in 2018 are lower than previous years due to problems in the calibration of the sensor differently during wet conditions the expected underestimation of sm2rain algorithm due to saturation problems e g brocca et al 2013 ciabatta et al 2015 crow et al 2011 massari et al 2018 is not present as in the sm2rain exp formulation sr is explicitly considered some rainfall peaks are not correctly identified indeed we have observed a double peak in some of the estimated rainfall events which show a sudden decrease of estimated rainfall after the first pulse and then a successive increase similarly to massari et al 2014 this is to be attributed to the time difference in the response of 10 cm and 30 cm sm during the infiltration processes the specific response time analysis for the soil tank can be found in song and wang 2019 3 2 sm2rain exp results using all available probes in this section the analysis of the performance has been carried out for 21 rainfall events instead of 28 for simulating rainfall based on four sm profiles s1 s2 s3 and s4 20 events for 2016 and 1 event for 2017 the events are extracted by considering the reliability of sm sensors indeed in 2018 some sm sensors have been changed and hence the temporal consistency over time is not ensured actually the s3 sensor is not working at all in 2018 thus constraining us to not select events in 2018 meanwhile s5 and s6 data are not available continuously in time during 2016 and 2017 fig 3 shows the boxplots of the performance scores r kge rmse and bias obtained for each rainfall event note that the 2 min accumulated rainfall is considered by a simple visual inspection of fig 3 the estimated rainfall has proven to be in good agreement with the observed data over each rainfall event with different performance scores for different sm profiles indicating that the results are depending strongly on the quality of the input sm observations brocca et al 2016 ciabatta et al 2016 the four sm profiles show different scenarios specifically s2 provides the highest r and kge values r always higher than 0 9 the lowest median bias value equal to 0 024 mm min and median rmse value equal to 0 148 mm min s2 and s3 have a relatively stable range in performance scores whereas the scores for s1 and s4 show a stronger variability more in details s1 has the lowest r values probably because of the sensor inconsistency during the rainfall events in 2016 and 2017 s4 has the lowest kge and largest bias the bias values range from 0 024 mm min to 0 072 mm min for s1 4 while the negative values indicate a typical underestimation of the observed rainfall fereidoon and koch 2018 as discussed previously it is worth to underline that the median performances of the average sm profiles avg are lower than some single sensors due to the differences of sm observations at each profile as illustrated in fig 4 in which the comparison between the observed and estimated rainfall based on the average of the four sm profiles is given the underestimations are much more obvious than those in fig 2 only s2 the performance scores yield r 0 904 kge 0 637 bias 0 044 mm min and rmse 0 172 mm min while more accurate results would have been expected due to the use of multiple sensors ciabatta et al 2015 the data quality in different sm profiles plays an important role in this soil tank 3 3 influence of temporal aggregation intervals the temporal resolution of sm measurements is a critical issue for obtaining accurate rainfall estimates from sm2rain in this study performance scores are separately described at different temporal scales 2 min 10 min 20 min and 30 min accumulated rainfall the summary statistics for the comparison between estimated and observed rainfall data are given in table 2 as an example s2 profile data for the 21 rainfall events in 2016 and 2017 is selected the results with other profiles are similar as would be expected the performances improve by increasing the aggregation intervals of rainfall as evidenced by the increase of r and kge the reduction of rmse and a decreasing of the spread in the bias values which is in line with earlier findings brocca et al 2016 2013 the lower performance scores obtained by 2 min accumulated rainfall should be attributed to the inversion of sm data in the sm2rain algorithm which affects the quality of estimated rainfall ciabatta et al 2018 indeed sm2rain is highly sensitive to the temporal resolution of sm observations brocca et al 2013 as it can be seen in table 2 in terms of r and kge the improvements due to the increased rainfall accumulation intervals are evident and significant with an increase of nearly 7 and 10 for 30 min results compared to the 2 min estimated results 3 4 influence of the depth of sm observations in order to explore the effect of the depth of sm observations on the performances of the algorithm the sensor at 10 cm and 30 cm depths alone and their integration are analysed as before r kge bias and rmse metrics are computed by comparing the observed and estimated rainfall values with s2 profile in 21 rainfall events specifically z value is set to 600 mm for 30 cm depth and the integration of 10 cm and 30 cm as before and to 300 mm for 10 cm depth fig 5 indicates that the integration of 10 cm and 30 cm by using sm2rain exp yields the most satisfactory performance scores which is consistent with the result obtained by brocca et al 2015 who studied ten sites across europe with different sm sampling depths and found that the res site for which the sensor is installed vertically between 0 and 30 cm depth is performing the best by critically analysing fig 5 non negligible differences can be observed over the usage of 10 cm sm and integration of 10 cm and 30 cm where four performance metrics provides quite different results r values are slightly better for the 10 cm 30 cm configuration with respect to 10 cm alone and much better than 30 cm all the other performance scores show much better performance for the 10 cm 30 cm configuration the use of 10 cm depth only would alleviate the double peak because it is mainly impacted by the lag response of 30 cm sm but it shows lower performance overall these results are in agreement with those obtained by massari et al 2014 who indicated that the depth of sm observations might influence the estimated rainfall pattern satellite sm observations are available for a layer depth of approximately 2 5 10 cm but sm can vary significantly with depth souza et al 2018 a number of studies using satellite sm data reported the problem of underestimating rainfall brocca et al 2016 brunetti et al 2018 ciabatta et al 2015 fereidoon and koch 2018 jalilvand et al 2018 maggioni and massari 2018 massari et al 2018 thaler et al 2018 apart from other factors e g rainfall regime snow frozen soil and complex topography sm depth needs to be considered and emphasized the discussion about sm depths above could help to clarify some important aspects related to the use of satellite surface sm data for estimating rainfall 3 5 contributions of sr and ssr to the sm2rain water balance equation with the purpose of quantifying the contribution of sr and ssr in sm2rain exp the contribution of these two terms to the total estimated rainfall during each rainfall event i e when rainfall is greater than 0 is computed the contribution of ssr is 3 1 which can be considered negligible whereas sr reaches a value of 12 1 thus the major contribution is provided by the term incorporating the sm variations with a value of approximately 85 followed by sr in order to figure out the contribution of sm evapotranspiration sr and drainage term brocca et al 2015 employed four simplified algorithm versions of sm2rain with synthetically generated data and in situ observations for ten sites across europe they found that the average contribution of sr and evapotranspiration components amounted to less than 4 of the total rainfall while sm 63 and drainage term 30 provided a much higher contribution indicating sr and evapotranspiration terms can be neglected but for petrelle site located in central italy contribution of sr to the estimation of rainfall is 16 which is similar to our results recently fereidoon and koch 2019 also investigated the contributions of different hydrological components to sm2rain at different sites in the karkheh river basin southwest iran and indicated that drainage and evapotranspiration contribute the most and least to the rainfall estimation the different contributions of each term in previous studies may be ascribed to the distinct conditions in study area i e soil depth soil texture and topography evapotranspiration can be ignored in the algorithm especially in our indoor soil tank since the absence of vegetation on the left study area fig 1 the reasons why the contribution of sr should be noticed is that sr contribution comes next to sm in the soil tank and it is a vital component in the hydrological processes occurring at the plot scale 3 6 the differences between classical sm2rain and sm2rain exp with sr and ssr the differences between classical sm2rain with drainage rate and sm2rain exp with sr and ssr are distinguished according to eqs 2 and 3 using the integration of 10 cm and 30 cm depth profile s2 and 28 rainfall events note that in eq 2 the contribution of ssr interflow plus baseflow is represented in the term as t b brocca et al 2015 the calibration of classical sm2rain is necessary for the sake of producing a reliable estimation of rainfall the calibration process z is fixed to 600 mm only the parameters a and b are calibrated have considered the first 14 rainfall events by the minimization of rmse between 2 min observed and estimated rainfall the calibrated parameters yield to a 0 33 mm and b 1 as it can be seen in fig 6 the performance scores obtained for the classical sm2rain is r 0 825 kge 0 705 bias 0 016 mm min rmse 0 205 mm min while for the sm2rain exp with sr and ssr r 0 869 kge 0 709 bias 0 038 mm min rmse 0 184 mm min is obtained fig 2 as a result the differences are not significant by comparing fig 6 with fig 2 the rainfall patterns obtained by sm2rain perform as well as those obtained by sm2rain exp or even better however sm2rain presents a more significant underestimation in the relatively dry events 22 to 28 this could be ascribed to the contribution of sr as mentioned above fig 7 is shown to clarify the different simulation results with classical sm2rain and sm2rain exp the data are aggregated at 10 min time intervals for sake of visualization three components have been separated according to eqs 2 and 3 into z ds t dt as t b and sr t ssr t in fig 7 a it is obvious that the major contribution to the total estimated rainfall is due to sm variations as mentioned above for the two sm2rain formulations as t b and sr t ssr t are similar in the first 21 rainfall events while the remaining events differences are larger likely due to the sm conditions and the sr contribution fig 7 b and c further present the comparisons between the observed and estimated rainfall for the two formulations for the event 1 21 the estimated rainfall accumulations obtained by the classical sm2rain tend to be larger than those obtained by sm2rain exp while the opposite occurs for the event 22 28 as a whole the results from sm2rain exp is more stable and more accurate anyway we assume that the sm2rain algorithm could produce satisfactory and promising results at this experimental plot scale but the contribution of sr may not be negligible 4 conclusions an experimental soil tank 12 m long 1 5 m wide 1 5 m deep equipped with a spatially distributed instrument network was designed to conduct artificial rainfall runoff experiments rainfall surface runoff sr subsurface runoff ssr and volumetric soil moisture sm data were collected at the soil tank and aggregated to a 2 min interval this is the first study performing the validation of sm2rain hypothesis and formulation at the experimental plot scale the classic algorithm is modified to be sm2rain exp according to the condition of the artificial rainfall experiment and the fact that rainfall cannot be related only to storage changes based on the obtained results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the results in all available sm probes confirm the good capability of sm2rain exp algorithm in estimating rainfall allowing to apply successfully the method for the experimental soil tank with r and kge values greater than 0 8 and 0 7 respectively at 2 min time intervals 2 by increasing the aggregation interval performance scores show significant improvements with r kge values increasing from 0 91 0 81 to 0 97 0 89 with aggregation intervals from 2 min to 30 min 3 the integration of 10 cm and 30 cm sm data yields the most satisfactory performance scores with respect in using sensor at 10 cm and 30 cm depths alone 4 the major contribution to the total estimated rainfall is provided by the term incorporating the sm variations with a value of approximately 85 followed by the sr 12 indicating that sr cannot be neglected in sm2rain at plot scale 5 by comparing the results obtained by sm2rain and sm2rain exp sm2rain exp which includes sr and ssr is proved more stable and accurate notwithstanding the obtained results are related to the stability and quality of sm observed data this study provides satisfactory results and represents the first attempt to successfully apply the algorithm in the experimental soil tank more detailed analysis will be devoted to testing the ability of sm2rain in improving the performance in hydrological modelling at experimental plot scale further research of sm2rain will be addressed in verifying the influence of soil depth by selecting additional experimental or in situ networks worldwide the incorporation of surface and subsurface runoff rate observations or the implementation of more elaborated formulations for their estimation from sm data will be also the object of future studies credit authorship contribution statement shuang song conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing original

those of the downscaled results this study provides a great potential solution for generating satellite based precipitation dataset with finer spatio temporal resolutions keywords downscaling imerg precipitation gmwwda 1 introduction accurate gridded precipitation estimates with both finer spatio temporal resolutions are critical for various scientific communities e g hydrology meteorology climatology and agriculture which are however currently severely limited especially for catchment rainfall inputs driving hydrological models liu et al 2016 coastal areas are vulnerable to large scale destructive tropical cyclones e g typhoons resulting in serious ecological and human damages typhoons are one of the severest natural disasters in the southeast coast regions of china which brought extreme amount of precipitation and triggered serious disasters such as flooding and landslides chen et al 2013 haghroosta and ismail 2017 thus accurate precipitation information with reasonable spatio temporal resolutions are vital to disaster evaluations and predictions during typhoon events traditionally gridded precipitation estimates are generated using spatial interpolation methods based on rain gauge data however observations from rain gauge data are only representative within a certain radius and it is difficult to effectively reflect the spatial variations of precipitation while remote sensing is born in providing gridded precipitation estimates joyce et al 2004 and over the last three decades various satellite based precipitation estimates have been generated and delivered after a series of launched projects such as the global precipitation climatology project gpcp huffman et al 1997 adler et al 2003 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm kummerow et al 2000 huffman et al 2007 the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap project kubota et al 2007 and global precipitation measurement gpm huffman et al 2015a b although these satellite based

2010 kan et al 2016 2017 to meet such requirements downscaling strategy based on these satellite based precipitation estimates is an optimal approach to acquire precipitation estimates at finer spatial scales kustas et al 2003 agam et al 2007 merlin et al 2010 as the tmpa provides the best precipitation estimates in the trmm era a wide range of research conducted downscaling work on tmpa data firstly immerzeel et al 2009 introduced an exponential model to downscale tmpa 3b43 v7 based on the relationship between precipitation and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi considering topography s effects jia et al 2011 applied a multiple linear regression model to downscale tmpa data in the qaidam basin using both the ndvi and the digital elevation model dem to obtain more accurate downscaled estimates duan and bastiaanssen 2013 suggested two methods geographical difference analysis gda geographical ratio analysis gra for calibrating tmpa data using rain gauge observations before downscaling of tpma data above mentioned downscaling algorithms considered that the relationships between precipitation and environmental variables the ndvi and or dem were constant over their study areas while xu et al 2015 introduced a moving window regression method geographically weighted regression gwr to explain these spatially varied relationships between precipitation and the ndvi and or dem and then downscaled the tmpa data based on the work done by xu et al 2015 ma et al 2017a b introduced a spatial data mining algorithm to obtain downscaled results with the effects of systematic anomalies removed incorporating various land surface characteristics related to the spatial distribution of precipitation at annual scale however all these downscaling researches were conducted at climatological scales such as monthly and annually while almost no exploration has been investigated to downscale these satellite precipitation estimates at meteorological scales for example at hourly scale in this study we attempted to use cloud properties to downscale the imerg data at hourly scale to acquire hourly downscaled precipitation estimates based on imergdata there were two significant challenges 1 limited rainfall related environmental variables 0 01 0 01 hourly used to downscale the imerg data and 2 far few rainfall pixels used for traditional regressing relationships between precipitation and environmental variables in this case most traditional or commonly used regression empirical models and the state of art machine learning algorithms such as regression machine learning decision tree bayesian artificial neural network deep learning ensemble support vectors are not suitable to cater this requirement therefore we proposed a new strategy to obtain hourly downscaled precipitation estimates based on imerg called geographically moving window weight disaggregation analysis gmwwda 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area we defined the southeast coast sec of china fig 1 as the study area spanning from 108 61 to 122 95 e and 18 19 to 35 12 n which included jiangsu shanghai zhejiang anhui fujian jiangxi guangdong and hainan provinces overall sec is covered by plains and hills with elevation varying from 40 to 2000 m above sea level due to the close range to west pacific ocean sec suffered frequently from destructive typhoon events each year especially in summer rumbia the severe tropical storm landed in shanghai at 04 00 am august 17 the period from 08 00 am to 17 00 pm august 17 in which precipitation in sec was influenced by rumbia was selected as the typical typhoon event in this study 2 2 datasets and processing 2 2 1 rain gauge data hourly rain gauge data at automatic weather

building upon the success of the trmm gpm aims at helping to advance our understanding of earth s water and energy cycle improve forecasting of extreme events that cause natural hazards and disasters and extend current capabilities in using accurate and timely information of precipitation to directly benefit society since light rain and falling snow account for significant fractions of

product was created by intercalibrating merging and interpolating all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with microwave calibrated infrared ir satellite estimates precipitation gauge

3 1 geographically moving window weight disaggregation analysis gmwwda in this study to cater the two great challenges downscaling imerg data at hourly scale we proposed a new downscaling algorithm called geographically moving window weight disaggregation analysis gmwwda to obtain the disaggregation weights this new algorithm was based on the assumption that different variables have different relationships with precipitation for example precipitation volume is inversely proportional to cloud top temperature hsu et al 1997 hong et al 2004 the main steps to obtain disaggregation weights dw using cloud properties based on the assumption that the volume of precipitation is directly proportional to the cloud properties as follows i select the moving window size in this study we selected 3 by 3 as the window size and calculate the average values in each window shown as eq 2 2 average i 1 n v a l u e i n where nn represent the moving window size and the value i here means the cloud information value in the i th pixel in the current window ii calculate the dw based on cloud properties at the central pixel in the moving window shown as eq 3 3 dw value 5 average where value 5 is cloud information value at the central of the current window shown as the fig 2 and average represents the average value from all the pixels in the current window obtained from eq 2 3 2 main downscaling steps by introducing gmwdwa to downscale the coarse satellite based precipitation estimates imerg at hourly scale gmwdwa was introduced as the core algorithm in this study and the main sequential steps in the downscaling process were as fig 3 1 the cloud properties including cer cth ctt and cot were derived from himawari 8 with 0 05 spatial resolution and 10 minute temporal resolution firstly for each cloud property the six composites within an hour were averaged to obtain the cloud property at hourly scale secondly the hourly cloud properties were resampled to 0 01 spatial resolution 2 the disaggregation weights based on cer cth ctt and cot were calculated according to the algorithms described in section 3 1 the disaggregation weights were obtained at hourly temporal scale coordinating with the corresponding hour of imerg data 3 all the disaggregation weights based on cer cth ctt and cot were transformed from raster format 0 01 into points which were then used to extract precipitation information from imerg data in raster 0 1 finally the downscaled results based on cer cth ctt and cot were obtained by multiplying imerg value at 0 01 spatial resolution with the corresponding disaggregation weights respectively 3 3 validation we used ground observations from independent rain gauges to assess the performances of the imerg and the downscaled results four comparison criteria were selected correlation coefficients cc bias mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rsme cc reflects the strength of correlations between precipitation estimates and rain gauge data varying from 0 to 1 with perfect value of 1 bias measures the degree of estimates to be overestimated positive or underestimated negative with a perfect value of 0 the mae and rmse indicate the magnitude of error estimations the smaller mae and rmse mean more reliable estimates compared to ground observations the equations for the above criteria were described as 4 c c i 1 n g i g 2 p i p 2 i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n p i p 2 5 b i a s i 1 n p i g i i 1 n g i 100 6 m a e 1 n i 1 n p i g i 7 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i g i 2 in which p i and p represent precipitation estimates and their average respectively g i means ground based precipitation measurements g means the average ground based precipitation measurements n means the number of precipitation pairs in the analysis in order to reflect the ability of capturing the precipitation events other three types of indices probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were introduced pod represents the proportion of correctly detected precipitation occurrences to the total number of events detected by satellites with optimal value of 1 far indicates the ratio of precipitation events falsely alarmed among the total number of detected precipitation occurrences with perfect value of 0 while csi denotes the fraction of precipitation events detected by satellites correctly to the total number of observed or detected rainfall events the equations were given as 8 p o d h h m 9 f a r f h f 10 c s i h h m f where h hit means that the precipitation occurrence was observed by ground station as well as satellite m miss represents that ground station observed the occurrence while the satellite undetected it f false indicates that the unobserved precipitation event was falsely detected by satellite 4 results 4 1 main results in obtaining disaggregation weights upon cloud properties series of research demonstrated that the occurrence and intensity of precipitation were correlated with the cloud properties yang et al 2014 2018 this study investigated the potentials of using cloud properties including cer cth ctt and cot in downscaling imerg data a typical hour 12 00 am august 17 2018 during the typhoon event over the sec was selected to demonstrate the spatial patterns of both cloud properties and the corresponding disaggregation weights fig 4 a b c and d displayed the spatial distributions of cer cth ctt and cot respectively at the typical hour over the sec basically the spatial patterns of cer cth and cot were similar large values of cer cth and cot were found at the northern central and southwestern parts of sec while the spatial patterns of ctt were contrary to those of cer cth and cot at the northern and central parts of sec values of ctt were relatively lower compared with neighboring regions these information reflected that larger cloud droplet size always existed with thicker cloud higher cloud top and lower temperature which would increase the probability of generating heavy and intensive precipitation events yang et al 2014 one of the reasons why it is difficult to downscale the coarse satellite based precipitation products e g imerg at hourly scale is that the spatial distribution of occurring precipitation is discrete and the rainfall pixels are mostly limited therefore the traditional statistical regression strategy is not suitable to downscale the precipitation at hourly scale while the new strategy proposed by this study is aimed at this situation the disaggregation weights derived based on cer cth ctt and cot were obtained using gmwwda shown as fig 5 a b c and d respectively generally the spatial patterns of disaggregation weights derived based on cer cth ctt and cot were similar due to the similar spatial distributions of original cloud properties it could be seen from fig 5 large weights 1 0 were mainly located in the north and southwest sec where the variations of cloud properties were significant overall the disaggregation weights based on cer varied from 0 15 to 2 0 with average weights around 0 93 and standard deviation around 0 25 while the average weights based on cth ctt and cot were around 0 96 0 98 and 1 00 with standard deviations around 0 23 0 20 and 0 19 respectively 4 2 main downscaled results using cloud properties the spatial patterns of precipitation measured by imerg at the typical hour 12 00 am august 17 2018 were shown as fig 6 a while the downscaled results at the corresponding hour based on the disaggregation weights derived from cer cth ctt and cot abbreviated as ds cer ds cth ds ctt and ds cot were shown as fig 6 b c d and e respectively it could be seen that the spatial patterns of downscaled results showed consistent with those of the original imerg for example both the original imerg and the downscaled results captured the storm center in the north sec where heavy precipitation occurred 10 mm h as for the volume table 1 the range of imerg varied from 0 0 to 59 7 mm h with the average around2 48 mm h and standard deviation around6 02 mm h and the range of ds cer varied from 0 0 to 49 6 mm h with the average 2 24 mm h and standard deviation 4 98 mm h showed the largest decrease compared with that of the original imerg while the range of ds cth varied from 0 0 to 51 2 mm h with the average 2 30 mm h and standard deviation 5 19 mm h and the range of the ds tt varied from 0 0 to 53 3 mm h with the average 2 35 mm h and standard deviation 5 40 mm h the precipitation volume of ds cot ranged from 0 0 to 58 5 mm h with average around 2 40 mm h and standard deviation around 5 60 mm h 4 3 validations on the downscaled results against ground observations to quantitatively evaluate performances of original imerg and the downscaled results the rain gauge data were used as the reference to compare with precipitation estimates derived from imerg ds cer ds cth ds ctt and ds cot at the typical hour over the sec shown as fig 7 a b c d and e respectively at hourly scale the original imerg highly overestimated the total precipitation with bias around 75 and cc around 0 53 mae around 1 99 mm rmse around 5 16 mm compared with the original imerg data all the downscaled results based on cloud properties showed better performances the ds cer presented the mostly improved accuracy with bias around 50 27 cc around 0 57 mae and rmse around 1 59 mm and 3 87 mm respectively as for the performances of ds cth and ds ctt cc increased to 0 56 and 0 54 bias reduced to 59 40 and 58 47 mae reduced to 1 79 mm and 1 69 mm rmse reduced to 4 33 mm and 4 09 mm respectively compared with those of original imerg data while the ds cot showed little improvement with cc bias mae and rmse around 0 54 68 13 1 89 mm and 4 65 mm respectively as for the performances of the original imerg and the downscaled results during the whole typhoon event from 08 00 am to 17 00 am august 17 2018 fig 8 a b c and d presented the temporal variations of cc bias mae and rmse indices respectively it could be seen from fig 8 a the ds cer had the highest cc values during the whole event indicating the strongest correlations between precipitation estimates from ds cer and the ground observations the cc values of ds cth and ds ctt were close but still larger than those of the original imerg during the event while the cc values of ds cot showed little improvement and almost near to those of the original imerg data regarding to the variations of bias all the precipitation estimates overestimated the total precipitation with bias larger than 50 however the ds cer had the lowest bias during the event which reflected the closet precipitation estimates to the ground observations the bias of ds cth ds ctt and ds cot also decreased compared with the original imerg data as for the mae and rmse the temporal variations were similar to those of bias the ds cer had the smallest mae and rmse values during the whole event which demonstrated the lowest estimate errors of ds cer compared with imerg and other three downscaled results fig 9 illustrated the numerical distributions of contingency statistics on imerg and the downscaled results at hourly scale in terms of pod fig 9 a the performances of downscaled results the ds cer in particular were better than those of imerg with the mean values larger than 0 80 while the mean values of pod of imerg was around 0 73 as for the distributions of far fig 9 b the mean values of downscaled results were smaller than those of imerg around 0 23 which indicated that the downscaled results could better detect precipitation occurrence among than imerg regarding to the csi fig 9 c the distributions and numerical characteristics were similar to those of pod the downscaled results especially the ds cer had mean values of csi larger than 0 65 while the mean csi value of imerg was around 0 60 which reflected that fact the downscaled results outperformed imerg in capturing the precipitation occurrence based on the evaluations some conclusions were illustrated as follows i the downscaled results based on cloud properties performed better than the original imerg data ii the downscaled results improved the spatial resolution of original imerg data from 0 1 to 0 01 as well as the accuracy and iii the ds cer outperformed the ds cth ds ctt and ds cot thus the downscaling strategy proposed by this study is promising to obtain the downscaled results at hourly temporal scale 5 discussion 5 1 the relationships between cloud properties and precipitation during the typhoon rumbia event based on the validation results in section 4 3 we found that the downscaled results based on cloud properties cer cth ctt and cot outperformed the original imerg with improved spatial resolution and accuracy which demonstrated that the cloud properties could work as effective environmental variables for downscaling satellite precipitation data using propriate algorithm we also found that the ds cer had better performances in terms of multiple indices compared with ds cth ds ctt and ds cot which indicated that the variations of cer correlated better with those of precipitation we further explored the relationships between precipitation and multiple cloud properties cer cth ctt and cot during the typhoon event fig 10 illustrated the temporal variations of mean values of precipitation derived from imerg and cloud properties derived from himawari 8 it could be seen from fig 10 precipitation presented an increasing trend during the typhoon event similarly cer and cth also posed increasing trends in the period from 08 00 a m to 17 00 a m while ctt showed reverse trend decreased from 08 00 to 17 00 as for cot it decreased from 08 00 to 13 00 and showed increasing trend from 13 00 to 17 00 overall the variations of cer and cth agreed well with that of precipitation while ctt also presented similar variations to precipitation but in reverse trend actually larger cloud particle size always lead to more intensive precipitation yang et al 2018 additionally the temperature at cloud top decreased accordingly with the increasement of cloud top height which enhanced the probability of generating large cloud particle size while thicker cloud also result in the enlargement of cloud particle size fig 11 displayed the scatterplots of the relationships between precipitation and cloud properties because the dimensions of precipitation and cloud properties were different we firstly normalized all the values between 0 and 1 to get rid of the impact of dimensions the relationships between precipitation and cer first quadrant were the strongest with cc values around 0 34 while the relations between precipitation and ctt second quadrant and cth third quadrant were close with cc values around 0 17 and 0 18 respectively the strength of correlations between precipitation and cot forth quadrant were relatively low with cc only around 0 05 the findings also indicated that cer showed the best agreement to precipitation while cot performed worst in reflecting the variations of precipitation 5 2 further directions for improving the accuracy of downscaled results though the imerg data are the newest and best satellite based precipitation estimates it still demonstrated relatively low quality at hourly scale to meet the requirements of high quality hourly precipitation datasets in driving hydrological models yang et al 2016 introduced a non parametric quantile mapping and gaussian weighting qm gm interpolation bias correction procedure based on persiann ccs and derived a new persiann ccs adj datasets with much higher accuracy by considering more ground observations in chile additionally aiming at the overestimations of tmpa 3b43 datasets with various anomalies over the tp ma et al 2018 firstly proposed a spatial data mining algorithm to remove the anomalies and then introduced bias calibration method to calibrate the tmpa 3b43 datasets at annual scale by incorporating ground observations at annual scale and finally disaggregated the annual scale results into monthly datasets in the same tempo spatial resolution with tmpa 3b43 which provided a better high quality dataset without obvious anomalies than the original tmpa 3b43 for various investigations over the tp http agri zju edu cn nitmpa3b43 qtp while the accuracy of downscaled results depended on the original satellite based precipitation products therefore we really recommended that before conducting downscaling research the original satellite based precipitation estimates should be firstly evaluated and bias corrected 6 conclusion there are two challenges to acquire hourly downscaled precipitation estimates 1 limited rainfall related environmental variables at 0 01 hourly scale and 2 far few rainfall pixels used for building relationships between precipitation and environmental variables to cater these challenges in this article we proposed a new algorithm called gmwwda to downscale the newest and best satellite based precipitation imerg at hourly scale over sec during a typhoon event and explored multiple cloud properties cer cth ctt cot as the environmental covariates to obtain precipitation estimates at finer resolutions 0 01 hourly for various fields applications and research main conclusions illustrated by this study were listed as follows 1 the downscaled results based on cloud properties performed better than imerg data 2 the downscaled results based on cer outperformed those based on cth ctt and cot 3 the accuracy of original satellite based precipitation products pose significant effects on those of the downscaled results this study provides a great potential solution for generating satellite based precipitation dataset with finer

algorithms are not suitable to cater these requirements therefore we proposed a new strategy to obtain hourly downscaled precipitation estimates based on imerg called geographically moving window weight disaggregation analysis gmwwda additionally we explored multiple cloud properties including cloud effective radius cer cloud top height cth cloud top temperature ctt and cloud optical thickness cot as covariates to downscale imerg using gmwwda method and concluded as follows 1 the downscaled results 0 01 0 01 hourly based on the above mentioned cloud properties outperformed the original imerg data 2 the downscaled results based on cer performed better than those based on cth ctt and cot respectively 3 the accuracy of satellite based precipitation products pose significant effects on those of the downscaled results this study provides a great potential solution for generating satellite based precipitation dataset with finer spatio temporal resolutions keywords downscaling imerg precipitation gmwwda 1 introduction accurate gridded precipitation estimates with both finer spatio temporal resolutions are critical for various scientific communities e g hydrology meteorology climatology and agriculture which are however currently severely limited especially for catchment rainfall inputs driving hydrological models liu et al 2016 coastal areas are vulnerable to large scale destructive tropical cyclones e g typhoons resulting in serious ecological and human damages typhoons are one of the severest natural disasters in the southeast coast regions of china which brought extreme amount of precipitation and triggered serious disasters such as flooding and landslides chen et al 2013 haghroosta and ismail 2017 thus accurate precipitation information with reasonable spatio temporal resolutions are vital to disaster evaluations and predictions during typhoon events traditionally gridded precipitation estimates are generated using spatial interpolation methods based on rain gauge data however observations from rain gauge data are only representative within a certain radius and it is difficult to effectively reflect the spatial variations of precipitation while remote sensing is born in providing gridded precipitation estimates joyce et al 2004 and over the last three decades various satellite based precipitation estimates have been generated and delivered after a series of launched projects such as the global precipitation climatology project gpcp huffman et al 1997 adler et al 2003 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm kummerow et al 2000 huffman et al 2007 the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap project kubota et al 2007 and global precipitation measurement gpm huffman et al 2015a b although these satellite based estimates precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network cloud classification system persiann ccs hong et al 2004 trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 2010 climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 integrated multi satellite retrivals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2015a b provide relatively much more precipitation information globally quasi globally however their spatial resolutions e g 0 1 0 5 are too coarse for driving hydrological and meteorological models at the local scale tao barros 2010 kan et al 2016 2017 to meet such requirements downscaling strategy based on these satellite based precipitation estimates is an optimal approach to acquire precipitation estimates at finer spatial scales kustas et al 2003 agam et al 2007 merlin et al 2010 as the tmpa provides the best precipitation estimates in the trmm era a wide range of research conducted downscaling work on tmpa data firstly immerzeel et al 2009 introduced an exponential model to downscale tmpa 3b43 v7 based on the relationship between precipitation and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi considering topography s effects jia et al 2011 applied a multiple linear regression model to downscale tmpa data in the qaidam basin using both the ndvi and the digital elevation model dem to obtain more accurate downscaled estimates duan and bastiaanssen 2013 suggested two methods geographical difference analysis gda geographical ratio analysis gra for calibrating tmpa data using rain gauge observations before downscaling of tpma data above mentioned downscaling algorithms considered that the relationships between precipitation and environmental variables the ndvi and or dem were constant over their study areas while xu et al 2015 introduced a moving window regression method geographically weighted regression gwr to explain these spatially varied relationships between precipitation and the ndvi and or dem and then downscaled the tmpa data based on the work done by xu et al 2015 ma et al 2017a b introduced a spatial data mining algorithm to obtain downscaled results with the effects of systematic anomalies removed incorporating various land surface characteristics related to the spatial distribution of precipitation at annual scale however all these downscaling researches were conducted at climatological scales such as monthly and annually while almost no exploration has been investigated to downscale these satellite precipitation estimates at meteorological scales for example at hourly scale in this study we attempted to use cloud properties to downscale the imerg data at hourly scale to acquire hourly downscaled precipitation estimates based on imergdata there were two significant challenges 1 limited rainfall related environmental variables 0 01 0 01 hourly used to downscale the imerg data and 2 far few rainfall pixels used for traditional regressing relationships between precipitation and environmental variables in this case most traditional or commonly used regression empirical models and the state of art machine learning algorithms such as regression machine learning decision tree bayesian artificial neural network deep learning ensemble support vectors are not suitable to cater this requirement therefore we proposed a new strategy to obtain hourly downscaled precipitation estimates based on imerg called geographically moving window weight disaggregation analysis gmwwda 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area we defined the southeast coast sec of china fig 1 as the study area spanning from 108 61 to 122 95 e and 18 19 to 35 12 n which included jiangsu shanghai zhejiang anhui fujian jiangxi guangdong and hainan provinces overall sec is covered by plains and hills with elevation varying from 40 to 2000 m above sea level due to the close range to west pacific ocean sec suffered frequently from destructive typhoon events each year especially in summer rumbia the severe tropical storm landed in shanghai at 04 00 am august 17 the period from 08 00 am to 17 00 pm august 17 in which precipitation in sec was influenced by rumbia was selected as the typical typhoon event in this study 2 2 datasets and processing 2 2 1 rain gauge data hourly rain gauge data at automatic weather stations awss were used in this study over the sec shown as fig 1 which were provided by the chinese meteorological data sharing service system http cdc nmic cn home do totally we collected 452 awss

building upon the success of the trmm gpm aims at helping to advance our understanding of earth s water and energy cycle improve forecasting of extreme events that cause natural hazards and disasters and extend current capabilities in using accurate and timely information of precipitation to directly benefit society since light rain and falling snow account for significant fractions of precipitation occurrences in middle and high latitudes a key advancement of gpm over trmm is the extended capability to measure light rain e g 0 5 mm hr 1 solid precipitation and the microphysical properties of precipitating particles which carries the first space borne ku ka band dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and a multi channel gpm microwave imager gmi sims and liu 2015 the merg product was created by intercalibrating merging and interpolating all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with microwave calibrated infrared ir satellite estimates precipitation gauge analyses and potentially other precipitation estimators at finer scales from the trmm and gpm eras over the entire globe the imerg data are produced by a bayesian inverse algorithm applied to microwave brightness temperatures that is run several times for each observation time imerg can range from giving quick precipitation estimate to research level products as more data are used in the algorithm including monthly gauges huffman et al 2019 this study adopted final half hourly cumulative precipitation files at a resolution of 0 1 degree of latitude longitude half hourly imergv6 files

covering the study area were used in this study all of the data were obtained from the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa himawari monitor website http www eorc jaxa jp ptree index html 3 methods 3 1 geographically moving window weight disaggregation analysis gmwwda in this study to cater the two great challenges downscaling imerg data at hourly scale we proposed a new downscaling algorithm called geographically moving window weight disaggregation analysis gmwwda to obtain the disaggregation weights this new algorithm was based on the assumption that different variables have different relationships with precipitation for example precipitation volume is inversely proportional to cloud top temperature hsu et al 1997 hong et al 2004 the main steps to obtain disaggregation weights dw using cloud properties based on the assumption that the volume of precipitation is directly proportional to the cloud properties as follows i select the moving window size in this study we selected 3 by 3 as the window size and calculate the average values in each window shown as eq 2 2 average i 1 n v a l u e i n where nn represent the moving window size and the value i here means the cloud information value in the i th pixel in the current window ii calculate the dw based on cloud properties at the central pixel in the moving window shown as eq 3 3 dw value 5 average where value 5 is cloud information value at the central of the current window shown as the fig 2 and average represents the average value from all the pixels in the current window obtained from eq 2 3 2 main downscaling steps by introducing gmwdwa to downscale the coarse satellite based precipitation estimates imerg at hourly scale gmwdwa was introduced as the core algorithm in this study and the main sequential steps in the downscaling process were as fig 3 1 the cloud properties including cer cth ctt and cot were derived from himawari 8 with 0 05 spatial resolution and 10 minute temporal resolution firstly for each cloud property the six composites within an hour were averaged to obtain the cloud property at hourly scale secondly the hourly cloud properties were resampled to 0 01 spatial resolution 2 the disaggregation weights based on cer cth ctt and cot were calculated according to the algorithms described in section 3 1 the disaggregation weights were obtained at hourly temporal scale coordinating with the corresponding hour of imerg data 3 all the disaggregation weights based on cer cth ctt and cot were transformed from raster format 0 01 into points which were then used to extract precipitation information from imerg data in raster 0 1 finally the downscaled results based on cer cth ctt and cot were obtained by multiplying imerg value at 0 01 spatial resolution with the corresponding disaggregation weights respectively 3 3 validation we used ground observations from independent rain gauges to assess the performances of the imerg and the downscaled results four comparison criteria were selected correlation coefficients cc bias mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rsme cc reflects the strength of correlations between precipitation estimates and rain gauge data varying from 0 to 1 with perfect value of 1 bias measures the degree of estimates to be overestimated positive or underestimated negative with a perfect value of 0 the mae and rmse indicate the magnitude of error estimations the smaller mae and rmse mean more reliable estimates compared to ground observations the equations for the above criteria were described as 4 c c i 1 n g i g 2 p i p 2 i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n p i p 2 5 b i a s i 1 n p i g i i 1 n g i 100 6 m a e 1 n i 1 n p i g i 7 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i g i 2 in which p i and p represent precipitation estimates and their average respectively g i means ground based precipitation measurements g means the average ground based precipitation measurements n means the number of precipitation pairs in the analysis in order to reflect the ability of capturing the precipitation events other three types of indices probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were introduced pod represents the proportion of correctly detected precipitation occurrences to the total number of events detected by satellites with optimal value of 1 far indicates the ratio of precipitation events falsely alarmed among the total number of detected precipitation occurrences with perfect value of 0 while csi denotes the fraction of precipitation events detected by satellites correctly to the total number of observed or detected rainfall events the equations were given as 8 p o d h h m 9 f a r f h f 10 c s i h h m f where h hit means that the precipitation occurrence was observed by ground station as well as satellite m miss represents that ground station observed the occurrence while the satellite undetected it f false indicates that the unobserved precipitation event was falsely detected by satellite 4 results 4 1 main results in obtaining disaggregation weights upon cloud properties series of research demonstrated that the occurrence and intensity of precipitation were correlated with the cloud properties yang et al 2014 2018 this study investigated the potentials of using cloud properties including cer cth ctt and cot in downscaling imerg data a typical hour 12 00 am august 17 2018 during the typhoon event over the sec was selected to demonstrate the spatial patterns of both cloud properties and the corresponding disaggregation weights fig 4 a b c and d displayed the spatial distributions of cer cth ctt and cot respectively at the typical hour over the sec basically the spatial patterns of cer cth and cot were similar large values of cer cth and cot were found at the northern central and southwestern parts of sec while the spatial patterns of ctt were contrary to those of cer cth and cot at the northern and central parts of sec values of ctt were relatively lower compared with neighboring regions these information reflected that larger cloud droplet size always existed with thicker cloud higher cloud top and lower temperature which would increase the probability of generating heavy and intensive precipitation events yang et al 2014 one of the reasons why it is difficult to downscale the coarse satellite based precipitation products e g imerg at hourly scale is that the spatial distribution of occurring precipitation is discrete and the rainfall pixels are mostly limited therefore the traditional statistical regression strategy is not suitable to downscale the precipitation at hourly scale while the new strategy proposed by this study is aimed at this situation the disaggregation weights derived based on cer cth ctt and cot were obtained using gmwwda shown as fig 5 a b c and d respectively generally the spatial patterns of disaggregation weights derived based on cer cth ctt and cot were similar due to the similar spatial distributions of original cloud properties it could be seen from fig 5 large weights 1 0 were mainly located in the north and southwest sec where the variations of cloud properties were significant overall the disaggregation weights based on cer varied from 0 15 to 2 0 with average weights around 0 93 and standard deviation around 0 25 while the average weights based on cth ctt and cot were around 0 96 0 98 and 1 00 with standard deviations around 0 23 0 20 and 0 19 respectively 4 2 main downscaled results using cloud properties the spatial patterns of precipitation measured by imerg at the typical hour 12 00 am august 17 2018 were shown as fig 6 a while the downscaled results at the corresponding hour based on the disaggregation weights derived from cer cth ctt and cot abbreviated as ds cer ds cth ds ctt and ds cot were shown as fig 6 b c d and e respectively it could be seen that the spatial patterns of downscaled results showed consistent with those of the original imerg for example both the original imerg and the downscaled results captured the storm center in the north sec where heavy precipitation occurred 10 mm h as for the volume table 1 the range of imerg varied from 0 0 to 59 7 mm h with the average around2 48 mm h and standard deviation around6 02 mm h and the range of ds cer varied from 0 0 to 49 6 mm h with the average 2 24 mm h and standard deviation 4 98 mm h showed the largest decrease compared with that of the original imerg while the range of ds cth varied from 0 0 to 51 2 mm h with the average 2 30 mm h and standard deviation 5 19 mm h and the range of the ds tt varied from 0 0 to 53 3 mm h with the average 2 35 mm h and standard deviation 5 40 mm h the precipitation volume of ds cot ranged from 0 0 to 58 5 mm h with average around 2 40 mm h and standard deviation around 5 60 mm h 4 3 validations on the downscaled results against ground observations to quantitatively evaluate performances of original imerg and the downscaled results the rain gauge data were used as the reference to compare with precipitation estimates derived from imerg ds cer ds cth ds ctt and ds cot at the typical hour over the sec shown as fig 7 a b c d and e respectively at hourly scale the original imerg highly overestimated the total precipitation with bias around 75 and cc around 0 53 mae around 1 99 mm rmse around 5 16 mm compared with the original imerg data all the downscaled results based on cloud properties showed better performances the ds cer presented the mostly improved accuracy with bias around 50 27 cc around 0 57 mae and rmse around 1 59 mm and 3 87 mm respectively as for the performances of ds cth and ds ctt cc increased to 0 56 and 0 54 bias reduced to 59 40 and 58 47 mae reduced to 1 79 mm and 1 69 mm rmse reduced to 4 33 mm and 4 09 mm respectively compared with those of original imerg data while the ds cot showed little improvement with cc bias mae and rmse around 0 54 68 13 1 89 mm and 4 65 mm respectively as for the performances of the original imerg and the downscaled results during the whole typhoon event from 08 00 am to 17 00 am august 17 2018 fig 8 a b c and d presented the temporal variations of cc bias mae and rmse indices respectively it could be seen from fig 8 a the ds cer had the highest cc values during the whole event indicating the strongest correlations between precipitation estimates from ds cer and the ground observations the cc values of ds cth and ds ctt were close but still larger than those of the original imerg during the event while the cc values of ds cot showed little improvement and almost near to those of the original imerg data regarding to the variations of bias all the precipitation estimates overestimated the total precipitation with bias larger than 50 however the ds cer had the lowest bias during the event which reflected the closet precipitation estimates to the ground observations the bias of ds cth ds ctt and ds cot also decreased compared with the original imerg data as for the mae and rmse the temporal variations were similar to those of bias the ds cer had the smallest mae and rmse values during the whole event which demonstrated the lowest estimate errors of ds cer compared with imerg and other three downscaled results fig 9 illustrated the numerical distributions of contingency statistics on imerg and the downscaled results at hourly scale in terms of pod fig 9 a the performances of downscaled results the ds cer in particular were better than those of imerg with the mean values larger than 0 80 while the mean values of pod of imerg was around 0 73 as for the distributions of far fig 9 b the mean values of downscaled results were smaller than those of imerg around 0 23 which indicated that the downscaled results could better detect precipitation occurrence among than imerg regarding to the csi fig 9 c the distributions and numerical characteristics were similar to those of pod the downscaled results especially the ds cer had mean values of csi larger than 0 65 while the mean csi value of imerg was around 0 60 which reflected that fact the downscaled results outperformed imerg in capturing the precipitation occurrence based on the evaluations some conclusions were illustrated as follows i the downscaled results based on cloud properties performed better than the original imerg data ii the downscaled results improved the spatial resolution of original imerg data from 0 1 to 0 01 as well as the accuracy and iii the ds cer outperformed the ds cth ds ctt and ds cot thus the downscaling strategy proposed by this study is promising to obtain the downscaled results at hourly temporal scale 5 discussion 5 1 the relationships between cloud properties and precipitation during the typhoon rumbia event based on the validation results in section 4 3 we found that the downscaled results based on cloud properties cer cth ctt and cot outperformed the original imerg with improved spatial resolution and accuracy which demonstrated that the cloud properties could work as effective environmental variables for downscaling satellite precipitation data using propriate algorithm we also found that the ds cer had better performances in terms of multiple indices compared with ds cth ds ctt and ds cot which indicated that the variations of cer correlated better with those of precipitation we further explored the relationships between precipitation and multiple cloud properties cer cth ctt and cot during the typhoon event fig 10 illustrated the temporal variations of mean values of precipitation derived from imerg and cloud properties derived from himawari 8 it could be seen from fig 10 precipitation presented an increasing trend during the typhoon event similarly cer and cth also posed increasing trends in the period from 08 00 a m to 17 00 a m while ctt showed reverse trend decreased from 08 00 to 17 00 as for cot it decreased from 08 00 to 13 00 and showed increasing trend from 13 00 to 17 00 overall the variations of cer and cth agreed well with that of precipitation while ctt also presented similar variations to precipitation but in reverse trend actually larger cloud particle size always lead to more intensive precipitation yang et al 2018 additionally the temperature at cloud top decreased accordingly with the increasement of cloud top height which enhanced the probability of generating large cloud particle size while thicker cloud also result in the enlargement of cloud particle size fig 11 displayed the scatterplots of the relationships between precipitation and cloud properties because the dimensions of precipitation and cloud properties were different we firstly normalized all the values between 0 and 1 to get rid of the impact of dimensions the relationships between precipitation and cer first quadrant were the strongest with cc values around 0 34 while the relations between precipitation and ctt second quadrant and cth third quadrant were close with cc values around 0 17 and 0 18 respectively the strength of correlations between precipitation and cot forth quadrant were relatively low with cc only around 0 05 the findings also indicated that cer showed the best agreement to precipitation while cot performed worst in reflecting the variations of precipitation 5 2 further directions for improving the accuracy of downscaled results though the imerg data are the newest and best satellite based precipitation estimates it still demonstrated relatively low quality at hourly scale to meet the requirements of high quality hourly precipitation datasets in driving hydrological models yang et al 2016 introduced a non parametric quantile mapping and gaussian weighting qm gm interpolation bias correction procedure based on persiann ccs and derived a new persiann ccs adj datasets with much higher accuracy by considering more ground observations in chile additionally aiming at the overestimations of tmpa 3b43 datasets with various anomalies over the tp ma et al 2018 firstly proposed a spatial data mining algorithm to remove the anomalies and then introduced bias calibration method to calibrate the tmpa 3b43 datasets at annual scale by incorporating ground observations at annual scale and finally disaggregated the annual scale results into monthly datasets in the same tempo spatial resolution with tmpa 3b43 which provided a better high quality dataset without obvious anomalies than the original tmpa 3b43 for various investigations over the tp http agri zju edu cn nitmpa3b43 qtp while the accuracy of downscaled results depended on the original satellite based precipitation products therefore we really recommended that before conducting downscaling research the original satellite based precipitation estimates should be firstly evaluated and bias corrected 6 conclusion there are two challenges to acquire hourly downscaled precipitation estimates 1 limited rainfall related environmental variables at 0 01 hourly scale and 2 far few rainfall pixels used for building relationships between precipitation and environmental variables to cater these challenges in this article we proposed a new algorithm called gmwwda to downscale the newest and best satellite based precipitation imerg at hourly scale over sec during a typhoon event and explored multiple cloud properties cer cth ctt cot as the environmental covariates to obtain precipitation estimates at finer resolutions 0 01 hourly for various fields applications and research main conclusions illustrated by this study were listed as follows 1 the downscaled results based on cloud properties performed better than imerg data 2 the downscaled results based on cer outperformed those based on cth ctt and cot 3 the accuracy of original satellite based precipitation products pose significant effects on those of the downscaled results this study provides a great potential solution for generating satellite based precipitation dataset with finer
