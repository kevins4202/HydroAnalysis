introduction hydrology is the science that examines the life cycle of water and its movement in terms of topographical features the amount of runoff produced is in many ways essential for managing

estimated using various methods such as swat soil and water assessment tool and artificial neural network ann model dubey et al 2020 the swat model is a comprehensive basin scale model that is introduced by arnold from united state agricultural research service usars and it is a large scale model that is designed for predicting and simulation the impact of different management methods on

more in hydrology in numerous studies of artificial neural network in runoff modeling used in hydrological research for estimate water energy rainfall modeling and runoff prediction and sediment modeling pradhan et al 2020 in the field of runoff forecasting various researches have been conducted worldwide for example fan et al fan et al 2020 that compared the lstm model to a hydrological

analyzed the performance of the swat model and the three types of artificial neural networks in the runoff simulation and presented the results that the artificial neural network model with r2 and nse values of more than 0 95 had a significant performance these two models in terms of hydrological indicators were evaluated and the results again showed that the ann had better performance in simulating runoff kumar et al kumar et al 2019 evaluated the comparison of emotional neural network enn and artificial neural network ann approaches for modeling of runoff and showed that enn with r 0 933 r2 0 870 nse 0 8689 rmse 276 1359 and the relative peak error 0 00879 is better than the ann networks in simulating runoff therefore the enn model was used as a better model for runoff simulation koycegiz et al koycegiz and buyukyildiz 2019 investigated the swat model for runoff simulation in this study swat results were compared with the results of ann and svm models and these results showed that data driven models had higher performance in runoff simulations but they did not represent spatially distributed information while the swat model is capable of doing so and for this reason a

results in runoff prediction by reducing the constraints and errors the research also improves the basic optimization algorithm to resolve the algorithm in terms of premature convergence this study will be conducted to help spread the research to different regions of the world in a region different from other regions 2 method and material 2 1 area of study baliqlu chai watershed is one of the sub basins of ghara soo in northwestern iran in ardabil province latitude of this area between latitude 37 46 38 to 38 22 52 n and longitude 47 46 28 to 48 42 11 e its area is approximately 1036 square kilometers and the average rainfall is 280 9 km this watershed has four hydrometer stations which is illustrated in table 1 by the position of each of these stations fig 1 shows the location of the baliqlu chai watershed 2 2 introduction soil and water assessment tool swat model the swat is a semi distributed model and can simulate various processes on a daily monthly or yearly time scale and the capabilities of this model are constantly evolving the smallest unit of this model is the hydrological reaction units hru which is derived from a combination of topography land use and soil maps karki et al 2020 running this model in a shared environment with arcgis software makes it easier to operation and using the required basic maps in this model include digital elevation model dem maps land use map soil map that all need to be raster format in gis gupta et al 2020 before implementing the swat model to the gis environment input data including climatic and hydrological data topographic maps soil land use were prepared figs 2 4 show dem land use and soil type map respectively table 2 show summarizing the input parameters and their range in this study 2 3 evaluation of runoff in swat model using modified nrcs cn method in order to guesstimate the surface runoff in the swat model the cn method is used that is the most applicable method for calculating the cn in the model usda this method separates the amount of rain that produces runoff effective precipitation from the total rainfall by water balance eq 1 based on the theories defined in the eq 2 and eq 3 walega et al 2020 1 p i a f q 2 q p i a f s 3 i a λ s where p is the whole precipitation mm q is the value of runoff produced by precipitation mm that calculate by eq 4 and ia 0 2s is primary precipitation losses and s that is the potential maximum retention and calculated using eq 5 and f is the infiltration except for ia mm and λ is the primary loss coefficient andrade and ribeiro 2020 4 q p i a 2 p i a s 5 s 25 4 1000 c n 10 where cn is the value of the curve number that is an original factor in hydrology for predicting runoff produced from precipitation that the cn values in the swat model are concluded by the values s that depends on the soil moisture and can be used based on the following jaiswal et al 2020 6 s s m x 1 s w s w e x p w 1 w 2 s w where s m x is the most retention per day mm s w is related to soil moisture in all profiles except water at the wilting point mm and w1 and w2 are shape coefficients that are achieved by the following ghaith et al 2020 7 w 1 ln f c 1 s 3 s m x 1 f c w 2 8 w 2 ln f c 1 s 3 s m x 1 f c l n s a t 1 2 54 s m x 1 s a t s a t f c where f c describes the amount of soil moisture is in the field capacity in sat water depth in saturated soil millimeter and s 3 is retention factor is saturated mm 2 4 introduction ann model interaction of climatic factors such as temperature precipitation evaporation and wind with hydrological factors such as flow rate infiltration has caused the rainfall runoff relationship to be expressed as nonlinear and indefinite phenomena ali et al 2020 on the one hand the complexity of this process and the multitude of information needed to calculate it and on the other hand the difficulties in measuring these parameters reveal the necessity of using ann for estimating rainfall runoff since empirical models such as natural or artificial unit hydrographs cannot fully simulate the nonlinear behavior of basins in flood generation so the use of ann models is appropriate for recognition samantaray et al 2020 an artificial neural network is a simulation of the natural nervous system and consists of a set called neurons that are interconnected through axons in artificial neural networks simulates the structure similar to the biological structure of the human brain and the neural network of the body so that it has the ability to learn generalize and make decisions kline and prša 2020 the overall structure of the artificial neural network consists of three layers with separate tasks such that is include input layer with the distribution of data in the network and the middle layer or the hidden layer that has the task of processing the information the network and output layer that in addition to processing the network input it also shows its output moallem and razmjooy 2012 moallem et al 2013 mousavi et al 2013 due to the application of multi layer perceptron networks in predicting hydrological parameters and their ability to generalize the results these networks have been used to predict runoff liu et al 2020 multilayer perceptron neural network mlps is a mathematical model that is simulated from a normal brain the mlp neural networks include several interconnected neurons that are capable of simulating brain synapses each of the connections between neurons has a specific weight that shows the amount of output effect at the input to the next neuron in general neurons also have their weight called bias that shows the impact of neurons on themselves razmjooy et al 2019 one of the common ways of reducing the error of mlp neural networks is to utilize back propagation bp in bp technique the error of per training pairs is estimated and also it is applied to adjust the weights of the neurons for fitting the wanted output liu et al 2017 razmjooy et al 2013a razmjooy et al 2013b bp applies a slope reduction algorithm to reduce the error there is a major disadvantage to this approach and the problem is that it sometimes reduces the error to such an extent that it can affect the success of the final network razmjooy et al 2018 yu et al 2019 fig 5 shows the general structure of mlps the output of per node can be estimated in two stage in the first stage the input weight sum is obtained by the following formula 9 z i j 1 n w i j α i β j where αi is the number of input neurons β j describes the bias related weight for the hidden layer neurons w i j describes the weight of the input layer the second stage is to apply the activation function to generate the output of neurons various types of activation functions applied in mlp in this research sigmoid function is utilized as an activation function which is explained below 10 f j x 1 1 e z j finally the output of each neuron is estimated as follows 11 y i j 1 m w k j α i β k artificial neural network modeling is performed using m file programming and matlab software r2016b in this research rainfall data 1987 2018 and artificial neural network in matlab programmatic environment is used to predict monthly runoff using the features and functions of this software 2 4 1 introduction whale optimization algorithm the whale optimization algorithm woa is a new meta heuristic algorithm that was first offered by mirjalili and lewis mohanty et al 2018 like other meta heuristic optimization algorithms in woa it begins by creating a random population group candidate solutions to investigate the optimal global solution maximum or minimum for a problem hamian et al 2018 hosseini firouz and ghadimi 2016 this algorithm continues to update and improve the appropriate solution based on its structure to achieve the desired amount ghadimi 2015 leng et al 2018 the main difference between woa and other meta heuristic algorithms is how to improve and update woa rules the woa algorithm is one of the nature inspired optimization algorithms that is inspired by the whale s ability to track and hunt prey by creating indicator bubbles along a circle around prey called bubble feeding behavior fig 6 indications of the procedure of the bubble net feeding performance it is obvious from the figure above that the whale with a spiral motion makes bubbles around the prey and then attacks them such a process has been used in the original woa structure the pure bubble system can be simulated as follows 12 x t 1 x t a d p 0 5 d e b l cos 2 π x t p 0 5 13 d c x t x t 14 a 2 a r a 15 c 2 r where p and r are random numbers between 1 and 0 l is a random number between 1 and 1 t illustrates the current iteration d refers to the ith whale to pray distance the best solution here b is a constant for defining the logarithmic spiral shape a decreases linearly from 0 to 2 during the iterations in both exploration and extraction phases in the above equation the first term is to model the encircling process and the second term is to model the bubble net process in woa these two terms comprise the exploration and the exploitation terms of the algorithm lang and jia 2019 the process of the prey encircling and bubble net hunting are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively molavi et al 2006 noruzi et al 2015 as stated earlier woa begins with a random population then the solutions are updated in per iteration for mathematical modeling of the pure bubble siege and hunting here to ensure the convergence of the algorithm the best solution is to include the factors when updating otherwise the best solution will play a pivotal point the following is a woa pseudo code 2 4 2 mutated whale optimization algorithm mwoa however based on the literature the whale optimization algorithm is a high performance algorithm with several advantages it has also a prominent shortcoming the main shortcoming of this algorithm is that sometimes is trapped into the local optimum point this happening gives a premature convergence for the algorithm which is not satisfying for the solution in this study mutation mechanism is provided for developing and resolving this shortcoming although because of random initialization of the whales the population is high diverse the updating process reduces the diversity of the algorithm and reduces it gradually that makes a local optimum with premature convergence to resolve this problem the mutation mechanism is added to the algorithm this mechanism has been used to combine the advantages of the basic woa and the evolutionary algorithm to develop the searching performance the diversity of the woa is formulated below 16 d 1 n l e j 1 n f i f i 2 where l e describes the length of the longest diagonal line in the solution space and f i is the mean value of f i for keeping the diversity of the population in a high range d d l o w in the following the mutation coefficient is considered to apply the algorithm to improve diversity 17 x t 1 x t 1 φ σ τ x t 1 g x t 1 g φ σ τ where τ n 0 1 σ represents a stated parameter φ 10 d l o w is defined to meet the requirement of d d l o w after mutation estimation 2 4 3 hybrid mlp mwoa as defined in the earlier parts the bp method is used here for network learning the bp is an algorithm based on slope reduction so it has weaknesses one of the major shortcomings of slope reduction is that you are easily confined to a minimum area these deficiencies can lead to some complex problems in pattern identification results numerous methods have been proposed to discuss this problem moallem and razmjooy 2012 razmjooy et al 2018 in which this new woa hybrid approach is used instead of slope reduction to minimize the optimum capability with the ability scissors are obtained from local minimums the hybrid method consists of two principal parts 1 multilayer forward feedback mlp perceptron network 2 woa as a ga model specially designed to obtain mlp weight optimization ga component there are also two important things to consider when applying woa in mlp choosing the right fitness function and determining the search factors therefore woa based mlp can be set as follows 1 create the number of primary whales with n weight and estimate the fitness value for per mlp woa 2 update the current performance position for fitness value based on pure bubble feeding and prey blockade 3 use other operators to the whale algorithm for each agent 4 confirm that the network has achieved sufficient error rates or met criteria 5 if the criteria condition is not specified go to 2 6 if you meet the criteria requirement 7 end mean square error mse is used as a fitness function to estimate mlp error the principal purpose of using mse is to assess the difference between the actual and optimal values for all training samples the mse formula is explained below 18 m s e 1 n i 1 n j 1 m y j k y j k 2 where y is the actual amount y is the wanted amount and n defines the number of the stage in the training dataset the general structure of the mlp woa method is illustrated in fig 9 the principal purpose here is to create a robust optimized neural network mlp mwoa method for using as a tool for runoff forecast 2 5 combination of swat ann model to improve the results of flood prediction in this study a synthetic neural network and swat model have been used in this method the amount of runoff is calculated based on the runoff produced by the swat model and the artificial neural network model in the proposed optimized swat ann method runoff is simulated in the initial swat model not calibrated that can reduce the time required for calibration and validation of the swat model in this method the swat model acts as a transmitter and transmits the data to the artificial neural network which includes meteorological data such as runoff that includes surface flow and interception evapotranspiration and infiltration and gis data such as topographic soil and land use map the first 20 years 1987 2007 of the monthly flow data collection records are considered for training the swat ann model and the remaining ten years 2008 2018 are intended for verification and testing model fig 10 shows the steps of the developed model in runoff forecasting according to fig 10 the improved model for calculating total discharge can be used from the following formula kassem et al 2019 19 q t q s w a t δ q a n n where q t is the total calculated discharge for the combined swat and ann model q s w a t is the discharge calculated value through the swat model and δ q a n n is the discharge calculated value through the ann model 2 6 combination of swat and mlp mwoa in addition to combining the ann with the swat model it can be optimized by mwoa for improving the results of the runoff forecast that can be an optimal combination for prediction the runoff produced from precipitation which runoff is simulated in not calibrated swat model this approach reduces the time needed for calibration and validation of the swat model and like method earlier in this method the swat model as after simulated runoff transmits the data as input to mlp woa 2 7 evaluation measures the statistical indicators to determine the model s ability to simulate river runoff is used baliqlu chai which is illustrated in table 3 the range changes r 2 are from one to zero and the optimal value is one the range of the nash sutcliffe coefficient changes from to one and the desirable value of this index is one root mean square error changes from zero to and the good value of these indices is zero so the lower this amount the better the simulation percentage bias shows simulated values larger or smaller than the observed values relative error re is used as a precision measure that is between one to zero and desirable value is one 3 result and discussion 3 1 swat model the swat model has been used to predict and estimate the runoff produced over the coming years this study predicted runoff for the next two years 2019 2020 for this propose the information of topographic land use soil and hydro climatological data including monthly rainfall temperature wind and relative humidity have been collected the statistical data for 30 years are used to implement the swat model the first 20 years 1987 2007 are considered for calibration and the second 10 years 2008 2018 are considered for model validation fig 11 and fig 12 show the observed and the simulated discharge values during the calibration and validation of the swat model a scatter plot was utilized to analyze the predicted results of the swat model runoff with the monthly observation runoff fig 13 and fig 14 show the pattern of observed and estimated point values of the best line for calibration and validation respectively 3 2 swat ann model in this investigation the most suitable structure mlp ann has been obtained 3 5 1 that is including 3 input layers 5hidden layers and 1 output layer hyperbolic tangent is utilized as the activation function between the input and the output layers whereas the identification of the activation function is within the hidden and the output layers this process is utilized to the swat for developing its efficiency finally the swat ann model has been produced forecasting monthly runoff simulation is conducted applying the extended model during the calibration period for a 20 year statistical period 1987 2017 fig 15 presents the results that are including the simulated and the observed flow during the calibration swat ann the improved model is carried out as a validation period for a ten year statistical period 2008 2018 fig 16 presents the simulation results for the validation period in the swat model to compare the predicted runoff results the improved model with the monthly observational runoff of a scatter plot has been considered fig 17 and fig 18 present the distribution of observed and predicted points values of the best line for calibration and validation 3 3 swat and mlpm woa since the purpose of this study is to investigate better prediction of runoff an optimized version of the ann is utilized for this purpose the advantages of combining an artificial neural network with an algorithm optimized are because the algorithms increase the accuracy of predictions during the learning process they optimize in this study to improve the model the ann is combined with the mwoa as a new optimization algorithm in this step the simulation of runoff was again performed using the combined method of swat and mlp woa fig 19 shows the simulation and observation results of the runoff during the calibration model for 20 years 1987 2007 the model is validated for ten years to evaluate the performance of the model that fig 20 show the simulation results for the validation period in the swat mlp woa model then a linear regression method was designed for comparing the performance model improved to forecast runoff results fig 21 and fig 22 show distribution of observed and simulated values best line for calibration and validation the graph curves the predicted values of the models with the observed values and showing that the lower the scatter of the predicted data around the regression line the greater the accuracy of the model in estimating the data the results show that the hybrid model of artificial neural network and mwoa algorithm with the swat model significantly increases the predictive power to identify the effective variables in prediction because the performance criteria of the model are better combining the mwoa algorithm with an artificial neural network can select the effective input variables and minimize the inefficiency of the ineffective variables 3 4 performance evaluation of three models to evaluate the ability and accuracy of the three aforementioned methods swat and swat ann and swat mlp mwoa for estimating and simulating runoff from statistical indices are used that tables 4 presents the results of these statistical indices based on the results of table it is known that among the three swat models the mlp mwoa has the best estimation and prediction for the runoff produced from precipitation and also based on the results of the table presented in general high values r2 during the two calibration and validation periods indicate high accuracy of the model it is known that in all three simulation models in the period validation is better than calibration based on the results from the above tables the swat ann model had value statistical better of swat model because it had r2 0 80 rmse 1 61 nse 0 79 re 0 11 but the swat mlp woa model has r2 values was 0 84 rmse 1 42 nse 0 81 and re was 0 09 the best performance in predicting runoff than other models 4 conclusions in this research the ability of swat swat ann and swat mlp mwoa models to forecast monthly runoff was investigated here in addition to a hydrological model and a multilayer perceptron neural network a new modified version of an optimal algorithm was used to reduce the error rate for optimizing the neural network results to produce better and more accurate results of the runoff prediction rmse nash r2 and re statistical indices were used to evaluate the performance of models for predicting runoff the statistical indices in the swat mlp mwoa model showed that this model is better for predicting monthly runoff than swat and swat ann models that the values in the swat mlp woa model are r2 0 84 rmse 1 42 nse 0 81 and re 0 09 the results showed that when the swat model is combined with an artificial neural network model the swat model performs better also when this artificial neural network is coupled with the modified optimization algorithm in the swat model the results are more accurate and closer to the actual values of the hydrometric stations the conclusions from this study showed that as long as the climatic data are longer more accurate results can be obtained from the hybrid model to simulate runoff in rivers for future study a runoff forecast can be conducted using the k nearest neighbor knn and fuzzy meta heuristic method also in other applied models the impact the upstream watershed can be investigated by raising or reducing the coefficients of the valid model equation conflict of

and the capabilities of this model are constantly evolving the smallest unit of this model is the hydrological reaction units hru which is derived from a combination of topography land use and soil maps karki et al 2020 running this model in a shared environment with arcgis software makes it easier to operation and using the required basic maps in this model include digital elevation model dem maps land use map soil map that all need to be raster format in gis gupta et al 2020 before implementing the swat model to the gis environment input data including climatic and hydrological data topographic maps soil land use were prepared figs 2 4 show dem land use and soil type map respectively table 2 show summarizing the input parameters and their range in this study 2 3 evaluation of runoff in swat model using modified nrcs cn method in order to guesstimate the surface runoff in the swat model the cn method is used that is the most applicable method for calculating the cn in the model usda this method separates the amount of rain that produces runoff effective precipitation from the total rainfall by water balance eq 1 based on the theories defined in the eq 2 and eq 3 walega et al 2020 1 p i a f q 2 q p i a f s 3 i a λ s where p is the whole precipitation mm q is the value of runoff produced by precipitation mm that calculate by eq 4 and ia 0 2s is primary precipitation losses and s that is the potential maximum retention and calculated using eq 5 and f is the infiltration except for ia mm and λ is the primary loss coefficient andrade and ribeiro 2020 4 q p i a 2 p i a s 5 s 25 4 1000 c n 10 where cn is the value of the curve number that is an original factor in hydrology for predicting runoff produced from precipitation that the cn values in the swat model are concluded by the values s that depends on the soil moisture and can be used based on the following jaiswal et al 2020 6 s s m x 1 s w s w e x p w 1 w 2 s w where s m x is the most retention per day mm s w is related to soil moisture in all profiles except water at the wilting point mm and w1 and w2 are shape coefficients that are achieved by the following ghaith et al 2020 7 w 1 ln f c 1 s 3 s m x 1 f c w 2 8 w 2 ln f c 1 s 3 s m x 1 f c l n s a t 1 2 54 s m x 1 s a t s a t f c where f c describes the amount of soil moisture is in the field capacity in sat water depth in saturated soil millimeter and s 3 is retention factor is saturated mm 2 4 introduction ann model interaction of climatic factors such as temperature precipitation evaporation and wind with hydrological factors such as flow rate infiltration has caused the rainfall runoff relationship to be expressed as nonlinear and indefinite phenomena ali et al 2020 on the one hand the complexity of this process and the multitude of information needed to calculate it and on the other hand the difficulties in measuring these parameters reveal the necessity of using ann for estimating rainfall runoff since empirical models such as natural or artificial unit hydrographs cannot fully simulate the nonlinear behavior of basins in flood generation so the use of ann models is appropriate for recognition samantaray et al 2020 an artificial neural network is a simulation of the natural nervous system and consists of a set called neurons that are interconnected through axons in artificial neural networks simulates the structure similar to the biological structure of the human brain and the neural network of the body so that it has the ability to learn generalize and make decisions kline and prša 2020 the overall structure of the artificial neural network consists of three layers with separate tasks such that is include input layer with the distribution of data in the network and the middle layer or the hidden layer that has the task of processing the information the network and output layer that in addition to processing the network input it also shows its output moallem and razmjooy 2012 moallem et al 2013 mousavi et al 2013 due to the application of multi layer perceptron networks in predicting hydrological parameters and their ability to generalize the results these networks have been used to predict runoff liu et al 2020 multilayer perceptron neural network mlps is a mathematical model that is simulated from a normal brain the mlp neural networks include several interconnected neurons that are capable of simulating brain synapses each of the connections between neurons has a specific weight that shows the amount of output effect at the input to the next neuron in general neurons also have their weight called bias that shows the impact of neurons on themselves razmjooy et al 2019 one of the common ways of reducing the error of mlp neural networks is to utilize back propagation bp in bp technique the error of per training pairs is estimated and also it is applied to adjust the weights of the neurons for fitting the wanted output liu et al 2017 razmjooy et al 2013a razmjooy et al 2013b bp applies a slope reduction algorithm to reduce the error there is a major disadvantage to this approach and the problem is that it sometimes reduces the error to such an extent that it can affect the success of the final network razmjooy et al 2018 yu et al 2019 fig 5 shows the general structure of mlps the output of per node can be estimated in two stage in the first stage the input weight sum is obtained by the following formula 9 z i j 1 n w i j α i β j where αi is the number of input neurons β j describes the bias related weight for the hidden layer neurons w i j describes the weight of the input layer the second stage is to apply the activation function to generate the output of neurons various types of activation functions applied in mlp in this research sigmoid function is utilized as an activation function which is explained below 10 f j x 1 1 e z j finally the output of each neuron is estimated as follows 11 y i j 1 m w k j α i β k artificial neural network modeling is performed using m file programming and matlab software r2016b in this research rainfall data 1987 2018 and artificial neural network in matlab programmatic environment is used to predict monthly runoff using the features and functions of this software 2 4 1 introduction whale optimization algorithm the whale optimization algorithm woa is a new meta heuristic algorithm that was first offered by mirjalili and lewis mohanty et al 2018 like other meta heuristic optimization algorithms in woa it begins by creating a random population group candidate solutions to investigate the optimal global solution maximum or minimum for a problem hamian et al 2018 hosseini firouz and ghadimi 2016 this algorithm continues to update and improve the appropriate solution based on its structure to achieve the desired amount ghadimi 2015 leng et al 2018 the main difference between woa and other meta heuristic algorithms is how to improve and update woa rules the woa algorithm is one of the nature inspired optimization algorithms that is inspired by the whale s ability to track and hunt prey by creating indicator bubbles along a circle around prey called bubble feeding behavior fig 6 indications of the procedure of the bubble net feeding performance it is obvious from the figure above that the whale with a spiral motion makes bubbles around the prey and then attacks them such a process has been used in the original woa structure the pure bubble system can be simulated as follows 12 x t 1 x t a d p 0 5 d e b l cos 2 π x t p 0 5 13 d c x t x t 14 a 2 a r a 15 c 2 r where p and r are random numbers between 1 and 0 l is a random number between 1 and 1 t illustrates the current iteration d refers to the ith whale to pray distance the best solution here b is a constant for defining the logarithmic spiral shape a decreases linearly from 0 to 2 during the iterations in both exploration and extraction phases in the above equation the first term is to model the encircling process and the second term is to model the bubble net process in woa these two terms comprise the exploration and the exploitation terms of the algorithm lang and jia 2019 the process of the prey encircling and bubble net hunting are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively molavi et al 2006 noruzi et al 2015 as stated earlier woa begins with a random population then the solutions are updated in per iteration for mathematical modeling of the pure bubble siege and hunting here to ensure the convergence of the algorithm the best solution is to include the factors when updating otherwise the best solution will play a pivotal point the following is a woa pseudo code 2 4 2 mutated whale optimization algorithm mwoa however based on the literature the whale optimization algorithm is a high performance algorithm with several advantages it has also a prominent shortcoming the main shortcoming of this algorithm is that sometimes is trapped into the local optimum point this happening gives a premature convergence for the algorithm which is not satisfying for the solution in this study mutation mechanism is provided for developing and resolving this shortcoming although because of random initialization of the whales the population is high diverse the updating process reduces the diversity of the algorithm and reduces it gradually that makes a local optimum with premature convergence to resolve this problem the mutation mechanism is added to the algorithm this mechanism has been used to combine the advantages of the basic woa and the evolutionary algorithm to develop the searching performance the diversity of the woa is formulated below 16 d 1 n l e j 1 n f i f i 2 where l e describes the length of the longest diagonal line in the solution space and f i is the mean value of f i for keeping the diversity of the population in a high range d d l o w in the following the mutation coefficient is considered to apply the algorithm to improve diversity 17 x t 1 x t 1 φ σ τ x t 1 g x t 1 g φ σ τ where τ n 0 1 σ represents a stated parameter φ 10 d l o w is defined to meet the requirement of d d l o w after mutation estimation 2 4 3 hybrid mlp mwoa as defined in the earlier parts the bp method is used here for network learning the bp is an algorithm based on slope reduction so it has weaknesses one of the major shortcomings of slope reduction is that you are easily confined to a minimum area these deficiencies can lead to some complex problems in pattern identification results numerous methods have been proposed to discuss this problem moallem and razmjooy 2012 razmjooy et al 2018 in which this new woa hybrid approach is used instead of slope reduction to minimize the optimum capability with the ability scissors are obtained from local minimums the hybrid method consists of two principal parts 1 multilayer forward feedback mlp perceptron network 2 woa as a ga model specially designed to obtain mlp weight optimization ga component there are also two important things to consider when applying woa in mlp choosing the right fitness function and determining the search factors therefore woa based mlp can be set as follows 1 create the number of primary whales with n weight and estimate the fitness value for per mlp woa 2 update the current performance position for fitness value based on pure bubble feeding and prey blockade 3 use other operators to the whale algorithm for each agent 4 confirm that the network has achieved sufficient error rates or met criteria 5 if the criteria condition is not specified go to 2 6 if you meet the criteria requirement 7 end mean square error mse is used as a fitness function to estimate mlp error the principal purpose of using mse is to assess the difference between the actual and optimal values for all training samples the mse formula is explained below 18 m s e 1 n i 1 n j 1 m y j k y j k 2 where y is the actual amount y is the wanted amount and n defines the number of the stage in the training dataset the general structure of the mlp woa method is illustrated in fig 9 the principal purpose here is to create a robust optimized neural network mlp mwoa method for using as a tool for runoff forecast 2 5 combination of swat ann model to improve the results of flood prediction in this study a synthetic neural network and swat model have been used in this method the amount of runoff is calculated based on the runoff produced by the swat model and the artificial neural network model in the proposed optimized swat ann method runoff is simulated in the initial swat model not calibrated that can reduce the time required for calibration and validation of the swat model in this method the swat model acts as a transmitter and transmits the data to the artificial neural network which includes meteorological data such as runoff that includes surface flow and interception evapotranspiration and infiltration and gis data such as topographic soil and land use map the first 20 years 1987 2007 of the monthly flow data collection records are considered for training the swat ann model and the remaining ten years 2008 2018 are intended for verification and testing model fig 10 shows the steps of the developed model in runoff forecasting according to fig 10 the improved model for calculating total discharge can be used from the following formula kassem et al 2019 19 q t q s w a t δ q a n n where q t is the total calculated discharge for the combined swat and ann model q s w a t is the discharge calculated value through the swat model and δ q a n n is the discharge calculated value through the ann model 2 6 combination of swat and mlp mwoa in addition to combining the ann with the swat model it can be optimized by mwoa for improving the results of the runoff forecast that can be an optimal combination for prediction the runoff produced from precipitation which runoff is simulated in not calibrated swat model this approach reduces the time needed for calibration and validation of the swat model and like method earlier in this method the swat model as after simulated runoff transmits the data as input to mlp woa 2 7 evaluation measures the statistical indicators to determine the model s ability to simulate river runoff is used baliqlu chai which is illustrated in table 3 the range changes r 2 are from one to zero and the optimal value is one the range of the nash sutcliffe coefficient changes from to one and the desirable value of this index is one root mean square error changes from zero to and the good value of these indices is zero so the lower this amount the better the simulation percentage bias shows simulated values larger or smaller than the observed values relative error re is used as a precision measure that is between one to zero and desirable value is one 3 result and discussion 3 1 swat model the swat model has been used to predict and estimate the runoff produced over the coming years this study predicted runoff for the next two years 2019 2020 for this propose the information of topographic land use soil and hydro climatological data including monthly rainfall temperature wind and relative humidity have been collected the statistical data for 30 years are used to implement the swat model the first 20 years 1987 2007 are considered for calibration and the second 10 years 2008 2018 are considered for model validation fig 11 and fig 12 show the observed and the simulated discharge values during the calibration and validation of the swat model a scatter plot was utilized to analyze the predicted results of the swat model runoff with the monthly observation runoff fig 13 and fig 14 show the pattern of observed and estimated point values of the best line for calibration and validation respectively 3 2 swat ann model in this investigation the most suitable structure mlp ann has been obtained 3 5 1 that is including 3 input layers 5hidden layers and 1 output layer hyperbolic tangent is utilized as the activation function between the input and the output layers whereas the identification of the activation function is within the hidden and the output layers this process is utilized to the swat for developing its efficiency finally the swat ann model has been produced forecasting monthly runoff simulation is conducted applying the extended model during the calibration period for a 20 year statistical period 1987 2017 fig 15 presents the results that are including the simulated and the observed flow during the calibration swat ann the improved model is carried out as a validation period for a ten year statistical period 2008 2018 fig 16 presents the simulation results for the validation period in the swat model to compare the predicted runoff results the improved model with the monthly observational runoff of a scatter plot has been considered fig 17 and fig 18 present the distribution of observed and predicted points values of the best line for calibration and validation 3 3 swat and mlpm woa since the purpose of this study is to investigate better prediction of runoff an optimized version of the ann is utilized for this purpose the advantages of combining an artificial neural network with an algorithm optimized are because the algorithms increase the accuracy of predictions during the learning process they optimize in this study to improve the model the ann is combined with the mwoa as a new optimization algorithm in this step the simulation of runoff was again performed using the combined method of swat and mlp woa fig 19 shows the simulation and observation results of the runoff during the calibration model for 20 years 1987 2007 the model is validated for ten years to evaluate the performance of the model that fig 20 show the simulation results for the validation period in the swat mlp woa model then a linear regression method was designed for comparing the performance model improved to forecast runoff results fig 21 and fig 22 show distribution of observed and simulated values best line for calibration and validation the graph curves the predicted values of the models with the observed values and showing that the lower the scatter of the predicted data around the regression line the greater the accuracy of the model in estimating the data the results show that the hybrid model of artificial neural network and mwoa algorithm with the swat model significantly increases the predictive power to identify the effective variables in prediction because the performance criteria of the model are better combining the mwoa algorithm with an artificial neural network can select the effective input variables and minimize the inefficiency of the ineffective variables 3 4 performance evaluation of three models to evaluate the ability and accuracy of the three aforementioned methods swat and swat ann and swat mlp mwoa for estimating and simulating runoff from statistical indices are used that tables 4 presents the results of these statistical indices based on the results of table it is known that among the three swat models the mlp mwoa has the best estimation and prediction for the runoff produced from precipitation and also based on the results of the table presented in general high values r2 during the two calibration and validation periods indicate high accuracy of the model it is known that in all three simulation models in the period validation is better than calibration based on the results from the above tables the swat ann model had value statistical better of swat model because it had r2 0 80 rmse 1 61 nse 0 79 re 0 11 but the swat mlp woa model has r2 values was 0 84 rmse 1 42 nse 0 81 and re was 0 09 the best performance in predicting runoff than other models 4 conclusions in this research the ability of swat swat ann and swat mlp mwoa models to forecast monthly runoff was investigated here in addition to a hydrological model and a multilayer perceptron neural network a new modified version of an optimal algorithm was used to reduce the error rate for optimizing the neural network results to produce better and more accurate results of the runoff prediction rmse nash r2 and re statistical indices were used to evaluate the performance of models for predicting runoff the statistical indices in the swat mlp mwoa model showed that this model is better for predicting monthly runoff than swat and swat ann models that the values in the swat mlp woa model are r2 0 84 rmse 1 42 nse 0 81 and re 0 09 the results showed that when the swat model is combined with an artificial neural network model the swat model performs better also when this artificial neural network is coupled with the modified optimization algorithm in the swat model the results are more accurate and closer to the actual values of the hydrometric stations the conclusions from this study showed that as long as the climatic data are longer more accurate results can be obtained from the hybrid model to simulate runoff in rivers for future study a runoff forecast can be conducted using the k nearest neighbor knn and fuzzy meta heuristic method also in other applied models the impact the upstream watershed can be investigated by raising or reducing the coefficients of the valid model equation conflict of

8361,study region thirlmere lakes national park new south wales australia study focus uncertainties in water balance calculations can arise from errors associated with each of the budget input terms precipitation evapotranspiration and inflows outflows however uncertainties associated with the accuracy of the surface storage calculation have seldom been the focus of previous water balance studies digital elevation models dems used in water balance studies typically rely on bathymetric topographic surveys with remote sensing techniques including satellite imaging processing light detection and ranging lidar and unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry this study investigates the vertical errors in bathymetric dems obtained from various remote sensing techniques and its implication on water balance estimates in an intermittent wetland under drying conditions with vegetation encroachment new hydrological insights when bathymetry data obtained from different remote sensing survey methods were adopted to calculate the water balance of a lake variations in the model predicted levels were attributed to the poor quality of photogrammetric dems to improve the photogrammetric data a new ground filtering approach is developed which reduces vertical errors induced by vegetation interference the correlation r2 of the dems as compared to ground truthed elevations was improved from 0 5 before ground filtering to 0 9 after ground filtering using the ground filtered dem in the water balance calculation a 70 improvement was achieved in the water balance residuals as such uncertainties in lake and wetland bathymetry should be assessed in future water balance studies keywords remote sensing surveys water balance model digital elevation models intermittent wetlands 1 introduction many wetlands worldwide were threatened by changes in their water regimes resulting in fluctuating storage volumes e g jacobs et al 2002 banerjee et al 2016 mbanguka et al 2016 labaugh et al 2018 the decreasing trend of water in wetlands associated with the future sustainability of the ecosystem has gained the attention of the public governments and scientists e g brooks 2009 stromberg et al 2009 banerjee et al 2016 the wetland water problems can be categorised into two main categories i human activities such as tiling ditching for agriculture groundwater extraction and mining activities may impact ecosystems within and adjacent to surface waterbodies blann et al 2009 jenkins and frazier 2010 and ii climatic shifts may alter the regional pattern of precipitation and the intensity of evapotranspiration et which may change the availability of water in shallow waterbodies trenberth et al 2007 bajracharya et al 2018 labaugh et al 2018 zambrano mera et al 2018 estimating the water balance budgets may help to identify the reasons behind the water storage problems in many wetland and lacustrine systems water levels fluctuate between dry and full levels over periods of years to decades these wetland systems are referred to as intermittent systems e g brooks 2009 stromberg et al 2009 alternating states in a wetland can lead to weed invasions cooke et al 2011 declining wildlife populations greenberg et al 2015 and damage to the ecosystem biodiversity brooks 2009 it is therefore important to accurately calculate the water balance and identify the causes of changing wetland water levels swenson and wahr 2009 calculating the water balance budget accurately is an important step in understanding the fluctuating water levels in wetlands builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 as water levels drive the biogeochemical ecological wetland dynamics accordingly a detailed understanding of the water balance can assist in developing precautionary measures to protect and or manage the entire ecosystem hydroclimatic factors such as precipitation et surface flows and groundwater fluxes contribute to the wetland water balance these factors are well documented and the effects of their uncertainties on the water balance budget have been previously investigated kuczera and parent 1998 parajka et al 2007 trenberth et al 2007 habets et al 2018 in contrast to the best of our knowledge uncertainties associated with the bathymetry data derived from digital elevation models dems have rarely been the focus of water balance studies available literature has emphasised the uncertainty of bathymetry data in other fields of water modelling for instance trigg et al 2014 highlighted the importance of understanding bathymetric uncertainties for modelling groundwater flux estimates and solute balances in shallow wetlands also many studies investigated the uncertainties of topographic data pertinent to flood modelling e g schumann et al 2008 bhuyian and kalyanapu 2018 hawker et al 2018 for example hawker et al 2018 investigated the impact of uncertainties in topographic measurements on flood models where the major spatial errors were identified from tree cover karran et al 2017 identified beaver ponds from aerial imagery using the morphometric characteristics of waterbodies that contribute to varying storage volume estimates while from different scientific fields these studies suggest that uncertainties in bathymetry data from dems could be an important factor in estimating wetland water dynamics varying levels of uncertainties have been noted in dems obtained from different topographic surveying methods e g wheaton et al 2010 yakubu et al 2019 numerous remote sensing technologies and postprocessing methods are available to produce topographic and bathymetry data for hydrologic modelling these include satellite imagery ozesmi and bauer 2002 moudrý et al 2018 light detection and ranging lidar technology cobby et al 2003 cavalli et al 2008 and unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry technology fonstad et al 2013 turner et al 2016 the appropriate application of the remote sensing techniques depends on the size of the study area and the adequate dem resolution in modelling satellite imagery may be more suitable to larger sites because the satellite image resolution and the uncertainties may result in coarse dem results e g schumann et al 2008 in contrast both airborne and uav lidar as well as uav photogrammetry can produce high resolution dems however especially in smaller sites 100 ha ground filtering i e extracting bare earth elevations may be necessary if bare earth dems are required and vegetation is evident bigdeli et al 2018 it should be noted that none of these survey methods could provide bathymetry for the part of wetlands covered by water in intermittent wetlands such problem can be avoided by selecting the dry periods for surveying while airborne lidar surveys are often carried out by commercial organisations using traditional aircrafts both uav lidar and photogrammetry surveys can be carried out by operators with a remote pilot licence compared to the lidar equipment the cost of photogrammetric survey equipment can be more than 30 times lower with greater flexibility buczkowski 2018 ground truthed measurements carried out by real time kinematic global positioning system rtk gps units are often used to verify the accuracy in remote sensing surveys e g schubert et al 2008 zarco tejada et al 2014 ground filtering has been adopted to postprocess dems for many hydrologic studies methods for filtering and interpolating lidar data have been previously examined by e g pingel et al 2013 hui et al 2016 however in relation to photogrammetric survey data poor ground exposure due to vegetation can make it difficult to obtain ground points most existing ground filtering methods using interpolation are more suitable to process lidar data as the laser pulses may penetrate through the gaps in vegetation canopies lim and treitz 2004 however uav photogrammetry is a more affordable survey technology that can achieve high resolution point cloud dataset and is often used in coastal engineering surveys e g gonçalves and henriques 2015 turner et al 2016 uncertainties introduced by potential vegetation interference from photogrammetry surveys in wetlands may be high in the absence of a tailored ground filtering method such interference may have the potential to have a big impact on the lateral extent nevertheless accurate estimates of storage volume of waterbodies in wetlands rely on bathymetry data obtained from robust dems with any artifacts due to vegetation cover removed consequently in the present study dems of an intermittent wetland with encroaching vegetation from uav lidar experiments and uav photogrammetry experiments during a dry period are utilised and compared in a water balance model a ground filtering method to improve photogrammetric dems and thereby water balance budget calculations in shallow waterbodies is presented herein the photogrammetric dem results after filtering are validated against the dems obtained from lidar surveys and on ground rtk gps surveys with the application of the ground filtering method for the photogrammetric dem improvements to the water balance calculations are identified based on the improved dem filtering methods the study provides recommendations on how to i cost effectively develop a dem to improve water balance modelling predictions and ii examine the influence of a less accurate dem due to vegetation interference on water balance estimates while it is understood that errors in precipitation and et can contribute to uncertainties in water balance calculations winter 1981 this study aims to identify and reduce the influence of vertical errors caused by vegetation interference in lake bathymetry obtained from dems on the water balance budget estimates 2 study sites and methodology 2 1 site overview the study area as shown in fig 1 a b 34 22 n 150 54 e is thirlmere lakes national park tlnp part of the greater blue mountains world heritage area in new south wales australia tlnp consists of five lakes including from upstream to downstream lake gandangarra lg lake werri berri lwb and lake couridjah lc interestingly lake baraba lb is located at the highest elevation even though it is the third system downstream followed by lake nerrigorang ln in the most downstream position as shown in fig 1b ln the furthest downstream discharges to blue gum creek at times of high water levels based on the historical record thirlmere lakes is a flow through system with a maximum water depth of 6 m riley et al 2012 the catchment areas and lake area of the five sites are shown in table 1 and the boundaries of the catchment areas are shown in fig 1b the lakes at tlnp were historically used for recreation and water supply in the 19th and 20th centuries riley et al 2012 in the last decade tlnp has experienced large fluctuation in water levels with an overall declining trend resulting in a changing hydroregime the recent decline in lake levels has led to the speculation that longwall mining a form of underground coal mining approximately 5 km to the east of tlnp has induced surface subsidence and influenced the surface hydrology riley et al 2012 as a result it is essential to estimate the surface water budget so that the loss gain budget terms can be quantified the monitoring program in tlnp has been initiated by the new south wales nsw government in australia in may 2013 with near real time water level data available for each lake meteorological data including solar radiation air temperature wind speed direction atmospheric pressure and relative humidity have been also collected thirlmere lakes station 212063 waternsw in the present study the most upstream lake lg is the focus since it has the largest catchment area and the least inflow uncertainty as it lacks the source of upstream inflows the furthest downstream lake ln is used as a companion site in the dem analysis importantly the two lakes in focus for this study were completely dry during the field surveys due to an ongoing long term drought these lakes also had no substantial surface connections during the study period using a water balance model the influence of bathymetry data on the variation of the water balance budget is examined before and after a ground filtering method is applied the study period is three years between 2014 and 2017 2 2 topography and bathymetry 2 2 1 airborne lidar airborne lidar surveys were carried out over tlnp using leica airborne laser scanner als50 ii leica geosystems ag heerbrugg switzerland on a traditional aircraft by land and property information department nsw government the processed airborne survey data were then classified as ground and non ground points with the reported accuracy of 0 30 m vertical and 0 80 m horizontal the minimum and average point densities were 1 00 and 1 61 laser pulses per square meter ppm2 respectively and the acquisition date was from 17 may 2016 to 27 may 2016 an extended dry period for the lake system to generate the 1 m dem 1 m by 1 m using airborne lidar for tlnp a triangular irregular network tin method was used to formulate a regular grid by averaging the ground heights all elevation data were processed using the australian height datum ahd 2 2 2 unmanned aerial vehicle lidar uav lidar surveys for the lake areas of lg and ln were carried out on 07 june and 24 october in 2018 respectively both lakes were dry at the time of the survey so ground points across the lake areas were acquired by a handheld rtk gps unit refer to section 2 2 4 below a phoenix scout sl1 lidar phoenix lidar systems los angeles usa attached to a dji matrice 600 uav dji shenzhen china was used for uav data acquisition two rtk gps antennas m1227hct a2 sma maxtena md usa were used for positioning with cellular connections to corsnet nsw a network of permanent global navigation satellite system gnss tracking stations in nsw to provide real time offset and improve survey data accuracy ground control points gcps were also used during the surveys with 6 distributed points across each of the lake areas the acquisition software consisted of phoenix lidar systems pls spatial lighthouse v3 5 1 and pls spatial explorer v3 5 1 a commercial software package designed for phoenix lidar units the uav lidar data were processed through lastools to denoise and classify the lidar data isenburg et al 2006 the accuracy of the uav lidar data was better than airborne lidar with typical uncertainties of 0 06 m vertical and 0 01 m horizontal as vertical errors in the dems were critical to the study the actual vertical uncertainties were estimated from the surveyed data as 0 12 m at lg and 0 07 m at ln with reference to the rtk gps ground points the average point densities were 875 57 ppm2 at lg and 618 58 ppm2 at ln 1 m dems for each lake were generated in matlab 2017b using delaunay triangulation of scattered sample points amidror 2002 all elevation data collected in the uav lidar surveys were processed with reference to australian height datum ahd to produce lidar dems for the water balance modelling hereinafter lidem the dems produced by the airborne lidar and uav lidar were combined by replacing the centre lake area in the airborne lidar data with the uav lidar data for each lake i e lg and ln another alternative to using just the uav lidar dem is to combine the two dems with weights in the combination based on the skill of each dem e g based on the methods in lu and wong 2008 kim et al 2015 pham et al 2018 it was found that the combination method based on weights did not provide any improvements compared to using the uav lidar dem only this is attributed to the substantially better resolution and accuracy from uav lidar surveys 2 2 3 unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry uav based photogrammetry surveys were undertaken on the same dates as the uav lidar surveys at each site using a dji phantom 4 dji shenzhen china with a built in camera and a gps unit the areas of interest in the surveys were the same as the uav lidar surveys within the lake areas an autopilot application pix4dcapture was used to plan the flight paths for the photogrammetry surveys the structure from motion sfm algorithm was adopted to detect common features between any overlapping images smith et al 2016 with this approach a six dimensional point cloud dataset consisting of geotags i e x y and z coordinates and the rgb colour data could be produced using a series of images taken during the uav flight with the geotags embedded the captured images in ln and lg were processed under the sfm algorithm to generate geo rectified orthomosaic images for the lakes using the commercial software package pix4d the same gcps as the uav lidar survey were used in the post processing the average point density from photogrammetry surveys was 97 84 and 191 96 ppm2 in lg and ln respectively the typical uncertainties in photogrammetry surveys are 0 10 m vertical and 0 30 m horizontal delaunay triangulation in matlab was also used to generate the dems for each lake from the processed photogrammetric data similar to the lidem the resulting photogrammetric dem was combined by replacing the lake area in the airborne lidar data with the photogrammetric data to generate a 1 m resolution photogrammetric dem pdem 2 2 4 real time kinematic gps surveys to validate the accuracy of the elevation data obtained from the remote sensing surveys direct point measurements were collected with a trimble r10 rtk gps unit trimble inc with an approximate horizontal accuracy of 0 01 m and a vertical accuracy of 0 02 m from the manufacturer vertical uncertainties obtained from the measurements were 0 02 m at both lg and ln the rtk gps units were connected to the corsnet nsw cellular network where real time error corrections for the data acquired by the gps receiver were carried out to maintain high precision survey data field surveys were carried out between april and oct 2018 with 622 scattered points obtained from lg and ln including the elevations at the gcps for post processing of the remote sensing survey data the ground points within the vegetation cover 247 points were used as ground truthed points in the analysis in comparison to the corresponding heights interpolated from the lidems and pdems a trimble tsc3 controller trimble inc was used for data logging and collection during the survey the measurements were exported as the horizontal coordinate data and the corresponding elevation data with the reference to ahd the exported data were further processed using matlab for visualisation and comparison purposes 2 3 water balance model a water balance model was conceptualized and is shown in fig 2 the model considers the sources of precipitation runoff and et the model output is the change in lake storage in tlnp groundwater and surface water in outflows were unknown and therefore were treated as residuals in the water balance results as stated in the site description no continuous surface inflows and outflows according to the estimated sill level were indicated by the recorded water level during the study period therefore the actual residuals in the results may consist of the groundwater inflows and outflows only for individual lakes in the water balance model the surface water balance budget can be calculated using the mass balance equation expressed as 1 δ s p r o e t u where δ s is the change in storage that can be estimated from the surface water level data p is precipitation e t is evapotranspiration estimated by the penman monteith equation for the potential evapotranspiration donohue et al 2010 with the adoption of the meteorological data collected in the field u is the water balance residuals and r o is precipitation causing surface runoff to water storage estimated by the rainfall runoff model gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier perrin et al 2003 a matlab based lumped water balance model was developed to represent the aforementioned water balance of the lake as suggested by eq 1 also included is the gr4j model which is a daily lumped four parameter rainfall runoff model that needs calibration the four parameters in the gr4j model consist of the capacity of the production tank mm an underground trade coefficient mm day the capacity of the routing tank mm and time base of unit hydrograph days the parameters used in gr4j were calibrated using the data obtained from a gauged catchment stonequarry in picton nsw stonequarry station 212053 less than 10 km away from the study site the precipitation and et datasets for the water balance model at the study site eq 1 were also used in the gr4j model the meteorological and water level data were collected by the thirlmere lakes weather station 212063 the station as part of the thirlmere lakes monitoring program is managed by the state owned corporation waternsw with data collected since late 2013 and made available online a campbell scientific data logger cr3000 campbell scientific logan utah usa was used to incorporate an array of sensors for meteorological data measurements including a vaisala wtx520 weather station vaisala helsinki finland to the measure wind speed direction air temperature humidity barometric pressure and rainfall in addition a net radiometer kipp zonen delft the netherlands and a global solar radiation sensor pyranometer sp110 apogee santa monica usa were used to measure radiation data an additional tipping bucket rain gauge hs tb3 hydrological services america lake worth usa was also deployed as a cross check 2 4 ground filtering method a linear weighted average filtering lwaf method has been developed to improve the representation of bare earth elevations in pdems the accuracy of the pdems is influenced by vegetation cover as mentioned in the introduction as shown in fig 3 the ground filtering process adopts a filter applied to a sliding interrogation window over the points in the dem where larger weights are assigned to points with lower elevation in the blue colour in fig 3 with the assumption that these low elevations correspond to local bare earth pixels the corrected elevation is shown as a blue red dot within the interrogation window in fig 3 the filter sorts all points in the dem h i inside the interrogation window in descending order in reference to elevations of the points subsequently a rank e g r k 1 2 3 n is assigned to each point based on the sequential order i x of each sorted point if the elevation of the point is greater than the local median elevation h m e d i a n a rank of zero is assigned 2 r k i i x i h i h m e d i a n 0 h i h m e d i a n where i represents the index of individual points within the interrogation window the above ranks are then used to calculate the weight for the new elevation of the centre point within the interrogation window by normalisation therefore the summation of the weights is equal to one normalised weights of each point n r k i can be derived from 3 n r k i r k i k 1 n r k k where n represents the maximum index within the interrogation window finally the filtered elevation h i at the centre of the interrogation window is derived by multiplying the aforementioned weights of each point with their elevations within the window the new elevation can be expressed as follows 4 h i k 1 n h k n r k k an iterative screening process for non ground points is proposed as shown in fig 4 identifying the points for vegetation cover is important to avoid overcorrecting the ground points therefore a selective substitution process is adopted so that only the points affected by vegetation cover are filtered after a filtered dem is generated from the original dem using the lwaf described in this section the original dem is subtracted from the smoothed one to generate a new surface d e m d i f f the differentiated surface d e m d i f f is then adopted to discriminate the vegetated area from the ground surface it should be noted that d e m d i f f has been found useful in spotting objects with a distinct pattern in dems in other studies e g qian et al 2018 to identify the non bare earth points in the dem as indicated by the red dots in fig 3 a characteristic height δ h c as a free parameter pertinent to the uncertainties in the measurements is used to isolate the outliers i e interfered points in vegetated areas that need filtering the characteristic height optimisation is discussed in section 3 2 1 note that the data points in d e m d i f f that are greater than the characteristic height are classified as non ground points for all identified non ground points through the d e m d i f f the original elevation h is replaced by the filtered elevation value h an updated dem is then generated after the selective substitution process for a large area of dense vegetation cover it is unlikely that all non ground points can be corrected with a single pass of the filter for points surrounded by contiguous non ground points i e the dense vegetation area the correction can only be made after the neighbouring points are corrected as such the correction needs to propagate to the centre area of the vegetation cover during filtering and therefore the filter in the lwaf method runs iteratively the percentage between the number of non ground points and total points in the dem is calculated for a quality check this percentage represents the convergence criterion or filtering residuals to determine whether a subsequent iteration is required the convergence criterion needs to achieve an adequate balance between an accurate dem and minimising computational time three statistical indicators were used to examine the quality of the ground filtered pdem including bias root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r 2 5 b i a s d e m r d e m n 6 r m s e d e m r d e m 2 n 7 r 2 1 s s r e s i d s s t o t a l where d e m represents the filtered dem using the lwaf method r d e m represents the reference bare earth dem n is the total number of grid cells within the dem s s r e s i d is the sum of the squared residuals and s s t o t a l is the sum of squared differences from the mean of the reference dem 3 results and discussion this study highlights the importance of removing vegetation interference from bathymetry data obtained from remotely sensed dems in water balance modelling firstly the lidems and the pdems are compared to understand the difference in the results due to vegetation interference subsequently the free parameters used in the ground filtering method are calibrated to improve the accuracy of the corrected pdems a case study is then presented using different dems i e lidem pdem and the corrected pdem pdemc in the water balance model further the stream network variation due to vegetation interference is discussed to evaluate the potential influence of the inaccurate bathymetry data on process based water balance models finally recommendations are provided on how to cost effectively obtain a ground truthed dem for water balance studies 3 1 dems of lake bathymetry the dems obtained from lidar and photogrammetry surveys are compared against the reference data measured by the rtk gps unit the ground truthed points were taken within or near the vegetation cover of lg and ln in tlnp as shown in fig 5 a b the lidems correlate well with the ground truthed points fig 4c d with a r 2 greater than 0 90 whereas there are large deviations between the pdem and the ground truthed points for elevations between 301 and 302 m these elevations correspond to areas of dense vegetation demonstrating that vegetation cover in the area is an obstacle to the direct retrieval of bare earth elevations from the photogrammetric data however this is anticipated as the shaded areas under plants usually do not have adequate exposure for distance recognition purposes using the sfm algorithm when post processing the photogrammetric images since the uav lidar results have good accuracy at both lg r2 0 95 p 0 and ln r2 0 92 p 0 as shown in fig 5 the lidems are adopted as reference dems for the remainder of this study 3 2 ground filtering results for uav photogrammetry survey the lwaf method was calibrated and the resulting pdems were then validated against the lidem also known as the reference dem in this process three parameters need calibrating including characteristic heights interrogation window sizes and the filtering convergence criterion as described in the methodology the lwaf parameters were calibrated based on data from ln and then validated on the pdem for lg the results obtained from the lwaf method will be used to investigate the influence on the water balance budget in section 3 3 for the ground filtering purposes higher resolution dems from the photogrammetric survey data were generated to maximise the presence of bare earth points in the dem the adopted grid sizes of the dems used in the filtering procedure are 0 25 m by 0 25 m which is 16 times finer than the size of pdem and lidem used in water balance modelling 1 m by 1 m 3 2 1 calibration of the lwaf parameters in order to calibrate the characteristic height monte carlo simulations using a gaussian distribution of the different characteristic heights δ h c was carried out 400 sample heights between 0 and 4 m were tested for the dem of ln more tests were done in the vicinity of the uncertainty and therefore gaussian distribution is selected with the mean of the distribution at 0 30 m the monte carlo simulations as an optimisation technique helped to exhaust the possible values within the range as an input and visualised the potential outcomes the resulting dems from each test were checked against the reference dem in terms of r 2 bias and rmse fig 6 a the quality of the ground filtered dems is strongly affected by the choice of the characteristic height the ground filtering provides no benefits if the characteristic height is larger than 1 m or smaller than 0 1 m the optimal characteristic height is indicated by the vertical red lines 0 25 m in fig 6a when the characteristic height uses a large value the filter does not target enough non ground points in the correction process conversely a low characteristic height of the order of the measurement uncertainties tends to filter noise for points without vegetation interference as a result an optimal characteristic height h c 0 25 m was identified based on the monte carlo simulations of the 400 characteristic heights the optimal size of the interrogation window for the sliding filter was calibrated using four different scenarios with the window dimensions of 0 5 m by 0 5 m 1 m by 1 m 2 m by 2 m and 4 m by 4 m as seen in table 2 the rmse results show that improvements cannot be found from either increasing or decreasing of the interrogation window size relative to the optimal window size at 1 m therefore the selected size of the interrogation window was 1 m by 1 m which also matches the resolution of the reference dem in the water balance model different convergence criteria indicated by the filtering residuals were also examined in the calibration the pdem of ln was processed using different convergence criteria and compared to the raw and reference dems elevations along a transect in fig 5b from the different dems were plotted in fig 6b the improved results are observed when the percentage of the filtering residuals changes from 3 0 1 0 however no further improvement in the ground filtered results was found in the case with the residuals at 0 5 compared to those at 1 0 suggesting optimal results can be obtained when the convergence criterion is set to 1 0 this is important as it balances accuracy with computational efficiency in summary the three free parameters in the lwaf method for ground filtering process were calibrated using the pdem of ln an optimal characteristic height of 0 25 m was obtained from the monte carlo simulations the size of the interrogation window of the filter was calculated as 1 m by 1 m and the optimal convergence criterion was selected as 1 0 for the filtering residuals in the following section the calibrated parameters are validated with the pdem of lg 3 2 2 lwaf validation based on the calibrated parameters pdem of lg was also processed for validation as lg had similarly dense vegetation encroachment on the lakebed lg is an ideal representative study site to validate the method results from both lg and ln were adopted for validation a transect of elevations within lg across the vegetation cover as shown in fig 5a is compared between pdem and the reference dem in fig 7 the elevation estimates are improved substantially by the lwaf method the vegetation interference on elevations from pdem compared to the reference dem has been significantly reduced with more than an 80 improvement for the pdem for both bias and rmse the corrected dem and the rtk gps measurements were compared for both lg and ln in fig 8 a b the outlier points from the pdems were corrected effectively through the lwaf method with 86 reduction in bias to the ground truthed reference the r 2 in the dem comparisons at lg and ln has considerable improvement from 0 66 and 0 48 before the ground filtering correction to 0 92 and 0 87 after the correction was made respectively thus the ground filtered pdems better reflect the ground truthed elevations and provides a dem of similar accuracy as obtained via lidar and rtk gps surveys the above results reveal that photogrammetry surveys post processed with the proposed lwaf method can be a cost effective alternative to lidar surveys the photogrammetry method by itself was able to produce the dems for the bathymetry of the two lakes in an intermittent wetland during a dry period but the quality was undermined by vegetation interference to improve the accuracy of the pdem under vegetation interference the proposed lwaf method was applied from which a better bare earth dem quality in lake areas was obtained resulting in an improved accuracy compared to traditional photogrammetry surveys alone 3 3 water balance modelling using remotely sensed dems the corrected dem of lg was used to investigate the influence of errors in dems on water balance results the case study shown in table 3 was carried out using lidems reference as well as pdem before and after the ground filtering correction based on the lwaf method pdem vs pdemc in this section the validated dem data used for water balance modelling purposes are discussed to demonstrate the influence of the vegetation interference on the stage volume relationship this is followed by a discussion of the uncertainty and variation associated with the water balance results due to vegetation interference in dems using the water balance model 3 3 1 bathymetry and storage the contours of the lg bathymetry data are shown in fig 9 a the vegetation cover over the lake area generated patches on the bathymetric contour as seen in the original pdem uncorrected case the patch locations were consistent with what was observed at lg where the tall plants 1 m grew surrounding the middle of the lake and expanded to the edges of the lake the corrected dem once processed using the lwaf method was able to demonstrate a substantial improvement in comparison to the reference dem both the corrected and reference dems have the relatively clean iso depth lines with less noise around the centre area compared to the uncorrected dem see fig 9a the stage volume relationship plays an important role in the water balance study for intermittent wetlands as it closely relates to the dynamic water storage variations were observed from the comparison in fig 9b where the depth area volume relationships of the three cases are shown in one coordinate system with the water depth indicated by the colours the results from the uncorrected case demonstrated a smaller surface area with the same water volume compared to the reference particularly when the water depth is in a range of 1 00 2 00 m the onset of separation between the uncorrected and reference cases starts from 1 00 m water depth with the discrepancy increasing to 2 00 m water depth where the discrepancy between the two cases remains almost unchanged afterwards considerable improvements are found in the stage volume relationship after the application of the lwaf method to the pdem in fig 9b not only the surface volume relationship improved between the corrected and reference cases but also the corresponding water depths indicated by the colours are more consistent than the uncorrected one overall the rmse has been reduced by 76 after the correction when compared with the reference case 3 3 2 water balance results variations of water volume due to precipitation and et were investigated to examine the impact of the refined dem method the different water balance modelling scenarios adopted the same meteorological inputs and calibrated hydrologic parameters in the water balance model as described in the methodology alternating among the three dems in table 3 as inputs for each case the water balance model predicted monthly water level data contributed by direct rainfall direct rainfall water and monthly water level loss through et et water over the three year study period the results of the monthly direct rainfall water in fig 10 a depict that the uncorrected pdem underestimates the water level variation received by the lake in comparison to the reference dem this is anticipated as the smaller actual water surface area aligns with the corresponding depth in the uncorrected dem with more lake sediments exposed in addition the monthly direct rainfall water show that with more precipitation the discrepancies in the total amount of direct rainfall water increased in all the cases in the wettest month of june 2016 there was an approximately 5 variation in terms of the equivalent water level compared to the reference case the accumulated difference of the water volume from rainfall between the uncorrected and reference cases contributed to over 12 variation of the water balance residuals compared to the reference case during the study period the accuracy of the volume estimates from direct rainfall was improved by 19 after the correction fig 10b shows the monthly et water over the study period although all cases have a consistent interannual et trend a noticeable difference was observed in the monthly et water the uncorrected case had the lowest et rate throughout the study period due to the reduced surface water area which suggests that the water balance residuals increased compared to the reference case the variations in the water volume from the uncorrected dem was up to 30 of the total et water in the reference case using the corrected dem the cumulative water volume error induced by et has been reduced by 67 against the uncorrected case at the end of the study period in addition inaccurate dems for the study site had more influences on et than the direct rainfall had on the water balance residuals the extent to which the water balance modelling results were improved before and after the ground filtering was compared against the uncertainties induced by meteorological data in the model with the inclusion of uncertainties in precipitation and et data in the water balance model the water level residuals and their uncertainties obtained from the three cases in table 3 are shown in fig 10c according to the accuracy of the sensors and the statistics reported in literature e g gunaji 1968 beven 1979 winter 1981 a 5 variation was adopted for the precipitation based on rain gauge measurements and a 10 variation was adopted for et the water balance budget results indicate that the residual errors induced by meteorological data and bathymetry were equivalent the residual errors in terms of precipitation and et were up to 0 5 m water depth that was equivalent to 59 of the average water depth in the study period whereas the residual errors induced by the dem were as high as 0 7 m water depth that was 83 of the average water depth the dem improvements not only diminish the errors in the water balance budget residual calculations but also reduce the uncertainty in the results both accuracies and uncertainties have been statistically improved in the corrected case as seen in fig 10c with a 76 reduction in the difference of cumulative residuals and a 36 reduction in the absolute uncertainties the analysis demonstrates the importance of evaluating the uncertainty of dems in a water balance study the results have demonstrated significant departures in water volume contributed by rainfall water loss through et and water balance residuals in the model using an uncorrected dem more importantly the application of the proposed lwaf method on pdems helped to significantly improve the water balance modelling results the importance of using accurate bathymetry from dem corrected data in water balance studies was highlighted 3 4 discussion and recommendation it is clear that even with the lumped water balance model the results of the water balance modelling vary considerably based upon the vertical errors in the dems it is expected that the water balance results obtained from process based models are more sensitive to the dem as they consider land surface shape and slope wolock and price 1994 to investigate the influence of the dem on the flow accumulation process in the centre area of lg i e stream networks which are widely used in process based analysis in hydrology the streams within the catchment were calculated based on the dems from the three cases depicted in table 3 using a cell based routing scheme tucker and slingerland 1994 tucker and hancock 2010 the stream network can be extracted from the dems by thresholding flow accumulation using k s n s a θ where k s n represents the normalised channel steepness s refers to the topographic slope calculated as s d h d x d h represents the difference in vertical elevations d x represents the horizontal distance a is the area of each grid cell and θ refers to the channel concavity between 0 3 0 8 as shown in fig 11 a before the application of the lwaf method the stream was interfered by the vegetation cover surrounding the lake centre leading to less streams accumulating at the centre of the lake body the stream networks tended to flow around the vegetation cover towards the downstream area in the uncorrected dem the by passing volume of the water would not contribute to the lake surface storage possibly leading to an inaccurate estimate using process based models after the lwaf method was applied to the dem as shown in fig 11b noticeable improvements of the stream network can be found when compared to the reference dem as shown in fig 11c using dems with vegetation interference leads to the hydrologic models attributing flow through the basin to a different mix of hydrologic processes the results further emphasised the necessity of the ground filtering technique developed in the present study to improve water balance calculations in shallow waterbodies and wetlands it is important to ensure that a ground truthed dem with high accuracy is used airborne lidar surveys are typically the first choice for the development of bathymetric dems in water balance studies when available in the present case the cost of uav lidar equipment was 30 times more than the photogrammetric survey gear and the additional cost of staff with specialist training was required as the lidar uavs drones are usually heavier than ordinary drones used for photogrammetry however to realise the benefits of the reduced cost surveys the uav photogrammetry techniques for bathymetry surveys need to be used in conjunction with the proposed lwaf method to ensure that the water balance is accurate the present study has shown that both the dem and water balance results obtained from uav photogrammetry surveys can have similar quality compared to lidar surveys in the wetland area with dense vegetation cover 4 conclusions water balance budget estimates in intermittent wetlands are essential to understand the ecosystem sustainability therefore it is important to identify the sources of uncertainty contributing to water balance results the present study has found that in water balance modelling surveys of lakes with substantial vegetation cover can have reduced accuracy while uav lidar surveys generally have good accuracy for acquiring bare earth data the downside is their expense in terms of equipment and labour costs on the other hand uav photogrammetry survey data is more affected by vegetation cover but is less expensive to carry out the present study developed and tested a ground filtering method to improve uav photogrammetric dems by removing the influence of vegetation cover on water balance modelling the lwaf method successfully reduced the vegetation interference in the bathymetry data it is shown to provide a substantial improvement in the dem more importantly correcting the dems to remove vegetation interference in lake areas improves the accuracy of water balance results and reduces the uncertainty in water balance the method proposed in the present study is applicable to numerous intermittent wetlands e g brooks 2004 2009 calhoun et al 2017 where bathymetry is essential for water budget estimates apart from the effects of uncertainties associated with the meteorological or hydrologic inputs on hydrologic modelling such as precipitation et or in outflows the present study has demonstrated the importance of understanding the bathymetric uncertainties on water balance study for intermittent wetlands uncertainties in bathymetry data contributing to water balance results can be as important as the contribution of uncertainties in precipitation and et authorship statement s chen w glamore and f johnson conceived the project idea and s chen w glamore and f johnson and c

8361,study region thirlmere lakes national park new south wales australia study focus uncertainties in water balance calculations can arise from errors associated with each of the budget input terms precipitation evapotranspiration and inflows outflows however uncertainties associated with the accuracy of the surface storage calculation have seldom been the focus of previous water balance studies digital elevation models dems used in water balance studies typically rely on bathymetric topographic surveys with remote sensing techniques including satellite imaging processing light detection and ranging lidar and unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry this study investigates the vertical errors in bathymetric dems obtained from various remote sensing techniques and its implication on water balance estimates in an intermittent wetland under drying conditions with vegetation encroachment new hydrological insights when bathymetry data obtained from different remote sensing survey methods were adopted to calculate the water balance of a lake variations in the model predicted levels were attributed to the poor quality of photogrammetric dems to improve the photogrammetric data a new ground filtering approach is developed which reduces vertical errors induced by vegetation interference the correlation r2 of the dems as compared to ground truthed elevations was improved from 0 5 before ground filtering to 0 9 after ground filtering using the ground filtered dem in the water balance calculation a 70 improvement was achieved in the water balance residuals as such uncertainties in lake and wetland bathymetry should be assessed in future water balance studies keywords remote sensing surveys water balance model digital elevation models intermittent wetlands 1 introduction many wetlands worldwide were threatened by changes in their water regimes resulting in fluctuating storage volumes e g jacobs et al 2002 banerjee et al 2016 mbanguka et al 2016 labaugh et al 2018 the decreasing trend of water in wetlands associated with the future sustainability of the ecosystem has gained the attention of the public governments and scientists e g brooks 2009 stromberg et al 2009 banerjee et al 2016 the wetland water problems can be categorised into two main categories i human activities such as tiling ditching for agriculture groundwater extraction and mining activities may impact ecosystems within and adjacent to surface waterbodies blann et al 2009 jenkins and frazier 2010 and ii climatic shifts may alter the regional pattern of precipitation and the intensity of evapotranspiration et which may change the availability of water in shallow waterbodies trenberth et al 2007 bajracharya et al 2018 labaugh et al 2018 zambrano mera et al 2018 estimating the water balance budgets may help to identify the reasons behind the water storage problems in many wetland and lacustrine systems water levels fluctuate between dry and full levels over periods of years to decades these wetland systems are referred to as intermittent systems e g brooks 2009 stromberg et al 2009 alternating states in a wetland can lead to weed invasions cooke et al 2011 declining wildlife populations greenberg et al 2015 and damage to the ecosystem biodiversity brooks 2009 it is therefore important to accurately calculate the water balance and identify the causes of changing wetland water levels swenson and wahr 2009 calculating the water balance budget accurately is an important step in understanding the fluctuating water levels in wetlands builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 as water levels drive the biogeochemical ecological wetland dynamics accordingly a detailed understanding of the water balance can assist in developing precautionary measures to protect and or manage the entire ecosystem hydroclimatic factors such as precipitation et surface flows and groundwater fluxes contribute to the wetland water balance these factors are well documented and the effects of their uncertainties on the water balance budget have been previously investigated kuczera and parent 1998 parajka et al 2007 trenberth et al 2007 habets et al 2018 in contrast to the best of our knowledge uncertainties associated with the bathymetry data derived from digital elevation models dems have rarely been the focus of water balance studies available literature has emphasised the uncertainty of bathymetry data in other fields of water modelling for instance trigg et al 2014 highlighted the importance of understanding bathymetric uncertainties for modelling groundwater flux estimates and solute balances in shallow wetlands also many studies investigated the uncertainties of topographic data pertinent to flood modelling e g schumann et al 2008 bhuyian and kalyanapu 2018 hawker et al 2018 for example hawker et al 2018 investigated the impact of uncertainties in topographic measurements on flood models where the major spatial errors were identified from tree cover karran et al 2017 identified beaver ponds from aerial imagery using the morphometric characteristics of waterbodies that contribute to varying storage volume estimates while from different scientific fields these studies suggest that uncertainties in bathymetry data from dems could be an important factor in estimating wetland water dynamics varying levels of uncertainties have been noted in dems obtained from different topographic surveying methods e g wheaton et al 2010 yakubu et al 2019 numerous remote sensing technologies and postprocessing methods are available to produce topographic and bathymetry data for hydrologic modelling these include satellite imagery ozesmi and bauer 2002 moudrý et al 2018 light detection and ranging lidar technology cobby et al 2003 cavalli et al 2008 and unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry technology fonstad et al 2013 turner et al 2016 the appropriate application of the remote sensing techniques depends on the size of the study area and the adequate dem resolution in modelling satellite imagery may be more suitable to larger sites because the satellite image resolution and the uncertainties may result in coarse dem results e g schumann et al 2008 in contrast both airborne and uav lidar as well as uav photogrammetry can produce high resolution dems however especially in smaller sites 100 ha ground filtering i e extracting bare earth elevations may be necessary if bare earth dems are required and vegetation is evident bigdeli et al 2018 it should be noted that none of these survey methods could provide bathymetry for the part of wetlands covered by water in intermittent wetlands such problem can be avoided by selecting the dry periods for surveying while airborne lidar surveys are often carried out by commercial organisations using traditional aircrafts both uav lidar and photogrammetry surveys can be carried out by operators with a remote pilot licence compared to the lidar equipment the cost of photogrammetric survey equipment can be more than 30 times lower with greater flexibility buczkowski 2018 ground truthed measurements carried out by real time kinematic global positioning system rtk gps units are often used to verify the accuracy in remote sensing surveys e g schubert et al 2008 zarco tejada et al 2014 ground filtering has been adopted to postprocess dems for many hydrologic studies methods for filtering and interpolating lidar data have been previously examined by e g pingel et al 2013 hui et al 2016 however in relation to photogrammetric survey data poor ground exposure due to vegetation can make it difficult to obtain ground points most existing ground filtering methods using interpolation are more suitable to process lidar data as the laser pulses may penetrate through the gaps in vegetation canopies lim and treitz 2004 however uav photogrammetry is a more affordable survey technology that can achieve high resolution point cloud dataset and is often used in coastal engineering surveys e g gonçalves and henriques 2015 turner et al 2016 uncertainties introduced by potential vegetation interference from photogrammetry surveys in wetlands may be high in the absence of a tailored ground filtering method such interference may have the potential to have a big impact on the lateral extent nevertheless accurate estimates of storage volume of waterbodies in wetlands rely on bathymetry data obtained from robust dems with any artifacts due to vegetation cover removed consequently in the present study dems of an intermittent wetland with encroaching vegetation from uav lidar experiments and uav photogrammetry experiments during a dry period are utilised and compared in a water balance model a ground filtering method to improve photogrammetric dems and thereby water balance budget calculations in shallow waterbodies is presented herein the photogrammetric dem results after filtering are validated against the dems obtained from lidar surveys and on ground rtk gps surveys with the application of the ground filtering method for the photogrammetric dem improvements to the water balance calculations are identified based on the improved dem filtering methods the study provides recommendations on how to i cost effectively develop a dem to improve water balance modelling predictions and ii examine the influence of a less accurate dem due to vegetation interference on water balance estimates while it is understood that errors in precipitation and et can contribute to uncertainties in water balance calculations winter 1981 this study aims to identify and reduce the influence of vertical errors caused by vegetation interference in lake bathymetry obtained from dems on the water balance budget estimates 2 study sites and methodology 2 1 site overview the study area as shown in fig 1 a b 34 22 n 150 54 e is thirlmere lakes national park tlnp part of the greater blue mountains world heritage area in new south wales australia tlnp consists of five lakes including from upstream to downstream lake gandangarra lg lake werri berri lwb and lake couridjah lc interestingly lake baraba lb is located at the highest elevation even though it is the third system downstream followed by lake nerrigorang ln in the most downstream position as shown in fig 1b ln the furthest downstream discharges to blue gum creek at times of high water levels based on the historical record thirlmere lakes is a flow through system with a maximum water depth of 6 m riley et al 2012 the catchment areas and lake area of the five sites are shown in table 1 and the boundaries of the catchment areas are shown in fig 1b the lakes at tlnp were historically used for recreation and water supply in the 19th and 20th centuries riley et al 2012 in the last decade tlnp has experienced large fluctuation in water levels with an overall declining trend resulting in a changing hydroregime the recent decline in lake levels has led to the speculation that longwall mining a form of underground coal mining approximately 5 km to the east of tlnp has induced surface subsidence and influenced the surface hydrology riley et al 2012 as a result it is essential to estimate the surface water budget so that the loss gain budget terms can be quantified the monitoring program in tlnp has been initiated by the new south wales nsw government in australia in may 2013 with near real time water level data available for each lake meteorological data including solar radiation air temperature wind speed direction atmospheric pressure and relative humidity have been also collected thirlmere lakes station 212063 waternsw in the present study the most upstream lake lg is the focus since it has the largest catchment area and the least inflow uncertainty as it lacks the source of upstream inflows the furthest downstream lake ln is used as a companion site in the dem analysis importantly the two lakes in focus for this study were completely dry during the field surveys due to an ongoing long term drought these lakes also had no substantial surface connections during the study period using a water balance model the influence of bathymetry data on the variation of the water balance budget is examined before and after a ground filtering method is applied the study period is three years between 2014 and 2017 2 2 topography and bathymetry 2 2 1 airborne lidar airborne lidar surveys were carried out over tlnp using leica airborne laser scanner als50 ii leica geosystems ag heerbrugg switzerland on a traditional aircraft by land and property information department nsw government the processed airborne survey data were then classified as ground and non ground points with the reported accuracy of 0 30 m vertical and 0 80 m horizontal the minimum and average point densities were 1 00 and 1 61 laser pulses per square meter ppm2 respectively and the acquisition date was from 17 may 2016 to 27 may 2016 an extended dry period for the lake system to generate the 1 m dem 1 m by 1 m using airborne lidar for tlnp a triangular irregular network tin method was used to formulate a regular grid by averaging the ground heights all elevation data were processed using the australian height datum ahd 2 2 2 unmanned aerial vehicle lidar uav lidar surveys for the lake areas of lg and ln were carried out on 07 june and 24 october in 2018 respectively both lakes were dry at the time of the survey so ground points across the lake areas were acquired by a handheld rtk gps unit refer to section 2 2 4 below a phoenix scout sl1 lidar phoenix lidar systems los angeles usa attached to a dji matrice 600 uav dji shenzhen china was used for uav data acquisition two rtk gps antennas m1227hct a2 sma maxtena md usa were used for positioning with cellular connections to corsnet nsw a network of permanent global navigation satellite system gnss tracking stations in nsw to provide real time offset and improve survey data accuracy ground control points gcps were also used during the surveys with 6 distributed points across each of the lake areas the acquisition software consisted of phoenix lidar systems pls spatial lighthouse v3 5 1 and pls spatial explorer v3 5 1 a commercial software package designed for phoenix lidar units the uav lidar data were processed through lastools to denoise and classify the lidar data isenburg et al 2006 the accuracy of the uav lidar data was better than airborne lidar with typical uncertainties of 0 06 m vertical and 0 01 m horizontal as vertical errors in the dems were critical to the study the actual vertical uncertainties were estimated from the surveyed data as 0 12 m at lg and 0 07 m at ln with reference to the rtk gps ground points the average point densities were 875 57 ppm2 at lg and 618 58 ppm2 at ln 1 m dems for each lake were generated in matlab 2017b using delaunay triangulation of scattered sample points amidror 2002 all elevation data collected in the uav lidar surveys were processed with reference to australian height datum ahd to produce lidar dems for the water balance modelling hereinafter lidem the dems produced by the airborne lidar and uav lidar were combined by replacing the centre lake area in the airborne lidar data with the uav lidar data for each lake i e lg and ln another alternative to using just the uav lidar dem is to combine the two dems with weights in the combination based on the skill of each dem e g based on the methods in lu and wong 2008 kim et al 2015 pham et al 2018 it was found that the combination method based on weights did not provide any improvements compared to using the uav lidar dem only this is attributed to the substantially better resolution and accuracy from uav lidar surveys 2 2 3 unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry uav based photogrammetry surveys were undertaken on the same dates as the uav lidar surveys at each site using a dji phantom 4 dji shenzhen china with a built in camera and a gps unit the areas of interest in the surveys were the same as the uav lidar surveys within the lake areas an autopilot application pix4dcapture was used to plan the flight paths for the photogrammetry surveys the structure from motion sfm algorithm was adopted to detect common features between any overlapping images smith et al 2016 with this approach a six dimensional point cloud dataset consisting of geotags i e x y and z coordinates and the rgb colour data could be produced using a series of images taken during the uav flight with the geotags embedded the captured images in ln and lg were processed under the sfm algorithm to generate geo rectified orthomosaic images for the lakes using the commercial software package pix4d the same gcps as the uav lidar survey were used in the post processing the average point density from photogrammetry surveys was 97 84 and 191 96 ppm2 in lg and ln respectively the typical uncertainties in photogrammetry surveys are 0 10 m vertical and 0 30 m horizontal delaunay triangulation in matlab was also used to generate the dems for each lake from the processed photogrammetric data similar to the lidem the resulting photogrammetric dem was combined by replacing the lake area in the airborne lidar data with the photogrammetric data to generate a 1 m resolution photogrammetric dem pdem 2 2 4 real time kinematic gps surveys to validate the accuracy of the elevation data obtained from the remote sensing surveys direct point measurements were collected with a trimble r10 rtk gps unit trimble inc with an approximate horizontal accuracy of 0 01 m and a vertical accuracy of 0 02 m from the manufacturer vertical uncertainties obtained from the measurements were 0 02 m at both lg and ln the rtk gps units were connected to the corsnet nsw cellular network where real time error corrections for the data acquired by the gps receiver were carried out to maintain high precision survey data field surveys were carried out between april and oct 2018 with 622 scattered points obtained from lg and ln including the elevations at the gcps for post processing of the remote sensing survey data the ground points within the vegetation cover 247 points were used as ground truthed points in the analysis in comparison to the corresponding heights interpolated from the lidems and pdems a trimble tsc3 controller trimble inc was used for data logging and collection during the survey the measurements were exported as the horizontal coordinate data and the corresponding elevation data with the reference to ahd the exported data were further processed using matlab for visualisation and comparison purposes 2 3 water balance model a water balance model was conceptualized and is shown in fig 2 the model considers the sources of precipitation runoff and et the model output is the change in lake storage in tlnp groundwater and surface water in outflows were unknown and therefore were treated as residuals in the water balance results as stated in the site description no continuous surface inflows and outflows according to the estimated sill level were indicated by the recorded water level during the study period therefore the actual residuals in the results may consist of the groundwater inflows and outflows only for individual lakes in the water balance model the surface water balance budget can be calculated using the mass balance equation expressed as 1 δ s p r o e t u where δ s is the change in storage that can be estimated from the surface water level data p is precipitation e t is evapotranspiration estimated by the penman monteith equation for the potential evapotranspiration donohue et al 2010 with the adoption of the meteorological data collected in the field u is the water balance residuals and r o is precipitation causing surface runoff to water storage estimated by the rainfall runoff model gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier perrin et al 2003 a matlab based lumped water balance model was developed to represent the aforementioned water balance of the lake as suggested by eq 1 also included is the gr4j model which is a daily lumped four parameter rainfall runoff model that needs calibration the four parameters in the gr4j model consist of the capacity of the production tank mm an underground trade coefficient mm day the capacity of the routing tank mm and time base of unit hydrograph days the parameters used in gr4j were calibrated using the data obtained from a gauged catchment stonequarry in picton nsw stonequarry station 212053 less than 10 km away from the study site the precipitation and et datasets for the water balance model at the study site eq 1 were also used in the gr4j model the meteorological and water level data were collected by the thirlmere lakes weather station 212063 the station as part of the thirlmere lakes monitoring program is managed by the state owned corporation waternsw with data collected since late 2013 and made available online a campbell scientific data logger cr3000 campbell scientific logan utah usa was used to incorporate an array of sensors for meteorological data measurements including a vaisala wtx520 weather station vaisala helsinki finland to the measure wind speed direction air temperature humidity barometric pressure and rainfall in addition a net radiometer kipp zonen delft the netherlands and a global solar radiation sensor pyranometer sp110 apogee santa monica usa were used to measure radiation data an additional tipping bucket rain gauge hs tb3 hydrological services america lake worth usa was also deployed as a cross check 2 4 ground filtering method a linear weighted average filtering lwaf method has been developed to improve the representation of bare earth elevations in pdems the accuracy of the pdems is influenced by vegetation cover as mentioned in the introduction as shown in fig 3 the ground filtering process adopts a filter applied to a sliding interrogation window over the points in the dem where larger weights are assigned to points with lower elevation in the blue colour in fig 3 with the assumption that these low elevations correspond to local bare earth pixels the corrected elevation is shown as a blue red dot within the interrogation window in fig 3 the filter sorts all points in the dem h i inside the interrogation window in descending order in reference to elevations of the points subsequently a rank e g r k 1 2 3 n is assigned to each point based on the sequential order i x of each sorted point if the elevation of the point is greater than the local median elevation h m e d i a n a rank of zero is assigned 2 r k i i x i h i h m e d i a n 0 h i h m e d i a n where i represents the index of individual points within the interrogation window the above ranks are then used to calculate the weight for the new elevation of the centre point within the interrogation window by normalisation therefore the summation of the weights is equal to one normalised weights of each point n r k i can be derived from 3 n r k i r k i k 1 n r k k where n represents the maximum index within the interrogation window finally the filtered elevation h i at the centre of the interrogation window is derived by multiplying the aforementioned weights of each point with their elevations within the window the new elevation can be expressed as follows 4 h i k 1 n h k n r k k an iterative screening process for non ground points is proposed as shown in fig 4 identifying the points for vegetation cover is important to avoid overcorrecting the ground points therefore a selective substitution process is adopted so that only the points affected by vegetation cover are filtered after a filtered dem is generated from the original dem using the lwaf described in this section the original dem is subtracted from the smoothed one to generate a new surface d e m d i f f the differentiated surface d e m d i f f is then adopted to discriminate the vegetated area from the ground surface it should be noted that d e m d i f f has been found useful in spotting objects with a distinct pattern in dems in other studies e g qian et al 2018 to identify the non bare earth points in the dem as indicated by the red dots in fig 3 a characteristic height δ h c as a free parameter pertinent to the uncertainties in the measurements is used to isolate the outliers i e interfered points in vegetated areas that need filtering the characteristic height optimisation is discussed in section 3 2 1 note that the data points in d e m d i f f that are greater than the characteristic height are classified as non ground points for all identified non ground points through the d e m d i f f the original elevation h is replaced by the filtered elevation value h an updated dem is then generated after the selective substitution process for a large area of dense vegetation cover it is unlikely that all non ground points can be corrected with a single pass of the filter for points surrounded by contiguous non ground points i e the dense vegetation area the correction can only be made after the neighbouring points are corrected as such the correction needs to propagate to the centre area of the vegetation cover during filtering and therefore the filter in the lwaf method runs iteratively the percentage between the number of non ground points and total points in the dem is calculated for a quality check this percentage represents the convergence criterion or filtering residuals to determine whether a subsequent iteration is required the convergence criterion needs to achieve an adequate balance between an accurate dem and minimising computational time three statistical indicators were used to examine the quality of the ground filtered pdem including bias root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r 2 5 b i a s d e m r d e m n 6 r m s e d e m r d e m 2 n 7 r 2 1 s s r e s i d s s t o t a l where d e m represents the filtered dem using the lwaf method r d e m represents the reference bare earth dem n is the total number of grid cells within the dem s s r e s i d is the sum of the squared residuals and s s t o t a l is the sum of squared differences from the mean of the reference dem 3 results and discussion this study highlights the importance of removing vegetation interference from bathymetry data obtained from remotely sensed dems in water balance modelling firstly the lidems and the pdems are compared to understand the difference in the results due to vegetation interference subsequently the free parameters used in the ground filtering method are calibrated to improve the accuracy of the corrected pdems a case study is then presented using different dems i e lidem pdem and the corrected pdem pdemc in the water balance model further the stream network variation due to vegetation interference is discussed to evaluate the potential influence of the inaccurate bathymetry data on process based water balance models finally recommendations are provided on how to cost effectively obtain a ground truthed dem for water balance studies 3 1 dems of lake bathymetry the dems obtained from lidar and photogrammetry surveys are compared against the reference data measured by the rtk gps unit the ground truthed points were taken within or near the vegetation cover of lg and ln in tlnp as shown in fig 5 a b the lidems correlate well with the ground truthed points fig 4c d with a r 2 greater than 0 90 whereas there are large deviations between the pdem and the ground truthed points for elevations between 301 and 302 m these elevations correspond to areas of dense vegetation demonstrating that vegetation cover in the area is an obstacle to the direct retrieval of bare earth elevations from the photogrammetric data however this is anticipated as the shaded areas under plants usually do not have adequate exposure for distance recognition purposes using the sfm algorithm when post processing the photogrammetric images since the uav lidar results have good accuracy at both lg r2 0 95 p 0 and ln r2 0 92 p 0 as shown in fig 5 the lidems are adopted as reference dems for the remainder of this study 3 2 ground filtering results for uav photogrammetry survey the lwaf method was calibrated and the resulting pdems were then validated against the lidem also known as the reference dem in this process three parameters need calibrating including characteristic heights interrogation window sizes and the filtering convergence criterion as described in the methodology the lwaf parameters were calibrated based on data from ln and then validated on the pdem for lg the results obtained from the lwaf method will be used to investigate the influence on the water balance budget in section 3 3 for the ground filtering purposes higher resolution dems from the photogrammetric survey data were generated to maximise the presence of bare earth points in the dem the adopted grid sizes of the dems used in the filtering procedure are 0 25 m by 0 25 m which is 16 times finer than the size of pdem and lidem used in water balance modelling 1 m by 1 m 3 2 1 calibration of the lwaf parameters in order to calibrate the characteristic height monte carlo simulations using a gaussian distribution of the different characteristic heights δ h c was carried out 400 sample heights between 0 and 4 m were tested for the dem of ln more tests were done in the vicinity of the uncertainty and therefore gaussian distribution is selected with the mean of the distribution at 0 30 m the monte carlo simulations as an optimisation technique helped to exhaust the possible values within the range as an input and visualised the potential outcomes the resulting dems from each test were checked against the reference dem in terms of r 2 bias and rmse fig 6 a the quality of the ground filtered dems is strongly affected by the choice of the characteristic height the ground filtering provides no benefits if the characteristic height is larger than 1 m or smaller than 0 1 m the optimal characteristic height is indicated by the vertical red lines 0 25 m in fig 6a when the characteristic height uses a large value the filter does not target enough non ground points in the correction process conversely a low characteristic height of the order of the measurement uncertainties tends to filter noise for points without vegetation interference as a result an optimal characteristic height h c 0 25 m was identified based on the monte carlo simulations of the 400 characteristic heights the optimal size of the interrogation window for the sliding filter was calibrated using four different scenarios with the window dimensions of 0 5 m by 0 5 m 1 m by 1 m 2 m by 2 m and 4 m by 4 m as seen in table 2 the rmse results show that improvements cannot be found from either increasing or decreasing of the interrogation window size relative to the optimal window size at 1 m therefore the selected size of the interrogation window was 1 m by 1 m which also matches the resolution of the reference dem in the water balance model different convergence criteria indicated by the filtering residuals were also examined in the calibration the pdem of ln was processed using different convergence criteria and compared to the raw and reference dems elevations along a transect in fig 5b from the different dems were plotted in fig 6b the improved results are observed when the percentage of the filtering residuals changes from 3 0 1 0 however no further improvement in the ground filtered results was found in the case with the residuals at 0 5 compared to those at 1 0 suggesting optimal results can be obtained when the convergence criterion is set to 1 0 this is important as it balances accuracy with computational efficiency in summary the three free parameters in the lwaf method for ground filtering process were calibrated using the pdem of ln an optimal characteristic height of 0 25 m was obtained from the monte carlo simulations the size of the interrogation window of the filter was calculated as 1 m by 1 m and the optimal convergence criterion was selected as 1 0 for the filtering residuals in the following section the calibrated parameters are validated with the pdem of lg 3 2 2 lwaf validation based on the calibrated parameters pdem of lg was also processed for validation as lg had similarly dense vegetation encroachment on the lakebed lg is an ideal representative study site to validate the method results from both lg and ln were adopted for validation a transect of elevations within lg across the vegetation cover as shown in fig 5a is compared between pdem and the reference dem in fig 7 the elevation estimates are improved substantially by the lwaf method the vegetation interference on elevations from pdem compared to the reference dem has been significantly reduced with more than an 80 improvement for the pdem for both bias and rmse the corrected dem and the rtk gps measurements were compared for both lg and ln in fig 8 a b the outlier points from the pdems were corrected effectively through the lwaf method with 86 reduction in bias to the ground truthed reference the r 2 in the dem comparisons at lg and ln has considerable improvement from 0 66 and 0 48 before the ground filtering correction to 0 92 and 0 87 after the correction was made respectively thus the ground filtered pdems better reflect the ground truthed elevations and provides a dem of similar accuracy as obtained via lidar and rtk gps surveys the above results reveal that photogrammetry surveys post processed with the proposed lwaf method can be a cost effective alternative to lidar surveys the photogrammetry method by itself was able to produce the dems for the bathymetry of the two lakes in an intermittent wetland during a dry period but the quality was undermined by vegetation interference to improve the accuracy of the pdem under vegetation interference the proposed lwaf method was applied from which a better bare earth dem quality in lake areas was obtained resulting in an improved accuracy compared to traditional photogrammetry surveys alone 3 3 water balance modelling using remotely sensed dems the corrected dem of lg was used to investigate the influence of errors in dems on water balance results the case study shown in table 3 was carried out using lidems reference as well as pdem before and after the ground filtering correction based on the lwaf method pdem vs pdemc in this section the validated dem data used for water balance modelling purposes are discussed to demonstrate the influence of the vegetation interference on the stage volume relationship this is followed by a discussion of the uncertainty and variation associated with the water balance results due to vegetation interference in dems using the water balance model 3 3 1 bathymetry and storage the contours of the lg bathymetry data are shown in fig 9 a the vegetation cover over the lake area generated patches on the bathymetric contour as seen in the original pdem uncorrected case the patch locations were consistent with what was observed at lg where the tall plants 1 m grew surrounding the middle of the lake and expanded to the edges of the lake the corrected dem once processed using the lwaf method was able to demonstrate a substantial improvement in comparison to the reference dem both the corrected and reference dems have the relatively clean iso depth lines with less noise around the centre area compared to the uncorrected dem see fig 9a the stage volume relationship plays an important role in the water balance study for intermittent wetlands as it closely relates to the dynamic water storage variations were observed from the comparison in fig 9b where the depth area volume relationships of the three cases are shown in one coordinate system with the water depth indicated by the colours the results from the uncorrected case demonstrated a smaller surface area with the same water volume compared to the reference particularly when the water depth is in a range of 1 00 2 00 m the onset of separation between the uncorrected and reference cases starts from 1 00 m water depth with the discrepancy increasing to 2 00 m water depth where the discrepancy between the two cases remains almost unchanged afterwards considerable improvements are found in the stage volume relationship after the application of the lwaf method to the pdem in fig 9b not only the surface volume relationship improved between the corrected and reference cases but also the corresponding water depths indicated by the colours are more consistent than the uncorrected one overall the rmse has been reduced by 76 after the correction when compared with the reference case 3 3 2 water balance results variations of water volume due to precipitation and et were investigated to examine the impact of the refined dem method the different water balance modelling scenarios adopted the same meteorological inputs and calibrated hydrologic parameters in the water balance model as described in the methodology alternating among the three dems in table 3 as inputs for each case the water balance model predicted monthly water level data contributed by direct rainfall direct rainfall water and monthly water level loss through et et water over the three year study period the results of the monthly direct rainfall water in fig 10 a depict that the uncorrected pdem underestimates the water level variation received by the lake in comparison to the reference dem this is anticipated as the smaller actual water surface area aligns with the corresponding depth in the uncorrected dem with more lake sediments exposed in addition the monthly direct rainfall water show that with more precipitation the discrepancies in the total amount of direct rainfall water increased in all the cases in the wettest month of june 2016 there was an approximately 5 variation in terms of the equivalent water level compared to the reference case the accumulated difference of the water volume from rainfall between the uncorrected and reference cases contributed to over 12 variation of the water balance residuals compared to the reference case during the study period the accuracy of the volume estimates from direct rainfall was improved by 19 after the correction fig 10b shows the monthly et water over the study period although all cases have a consistent interannual et trend a noticeable difference was observed in the monthly et water the uncorrected case had the lowest et rate throughout the study period due to the reduced surface water area which suggests that the water balance residuals increased compared to the reference case the variations in the water volume from the uncorrected dem was up to 30 of the total et water in the reference case using the corrected dem the cumulative water volume error induced by et has been reduced by 67 against the uncorrected case at the end of the study period in addition inaccurate dems for the study site had more influences on et than the direct rainfall had on the water balance residuals the extent to which the water balance modelling results were improved before and after the ground filtering was compared against the uncertainties induced by meteorological data in the model with the inclusion of uncertainties in precipitation and et data in the water balance model the water level residuals and their uncertainties obtained from the three cases in table 3 are shown in fig 10c according to the accuracy of the sensors and the statistics reported in literature e g gunaji 1968 beven 1979 winter 1981 a 5 variation was adopted for the precipitation based on rain gauge measurements and a 10 variation was adopted for et the water balance budget results indicate that the residual errors induced by meteorological data and bathymetry were equivalent the residual errors in terms of precipitation and et were up to 0 5 m water depth that was equivalent to 59 of the average water depth in the study period whereas the residual errors induced by the dem were as high as 0 7 m water depth that was 83 of the average water depth the dem improvements not only diminish the errors in the water balance budget residual calculations but also reduce the uncertainty in the results both accuracies and uncertainties have been statistically improved in the corrected case as seen in fig 10c with a 76 reduction in the difference of cumulative residuals and a 36 reduction in the absolute uncertainties the analysis demonstrates the importance of evaluating the uncertainty of dems in a water balance study the results have demonstrated significant departures in water volume contributed by rainfall water loss through et and water balance residuals in the model using an uncorrected dem more importantly the application of the proposed lwaf method on pdems helped to significantly improve the water balance modelling results the importance of using accurate bathymetry from dem corrected data in water balance studies was highlighted 3 4 discussion and recommendation it is clear that even with the lumped water balance model the results of the water balance modelling vary considerably based upon the vertical errors in the dems it is expected that the water balance results obtained from process based models are more sensitive to the dem as they consider land surface shape and slope wolock and price 1994 to investigate the influence of the dem on the flow accumulation process in the centre area of lg i e stream networks which are widely used in process based analysis in hydrology the streams within the catchment were calculated based on the dems from the three cases depicted in table 3 using a cell based routing scheme tucker and slingerland 1994 tucker and hancock 2010 the stream network can be extracted from the dems by thresholding flow accumulation using k s n s a θ where k s n represents the normalised channel steepness s refers to the topographic slope calculated as s d h d x d h represents the difference in vertical elevations d x represents the horizontal distance a is the area of each grid cell and θ refers to the channel concavity between 0 3 0 8 as shown in fig 11 a before the application of the lwaf method the stream was interfered by the vegetation cover surrounding the lake centre leading to less streams accumulating at the centre of the lake body the stream networks tended to flow around the vegetation cover towards the downstream area in the uncorrected dem the by passing volume of the water would not contribute to the lake surface storage possibly leading to an inaccurate estimate using process based models after the lwaf method was applied to the dem as shown in fig 11b noticeable improvements of the stream network can be found when compared to the reference dem as shown in fig 11c using dems with vegetation interference leads to the hydrologic models attributing flow through the basin to a different mix of hydrologic processes the results further emphasised the necessity of the ground filtering technique developed in the present study to improve water balance calculations in shallow waterbodies and wetlands it is important to ensure that a ground truthed dem with high accuracy is used airborne lidar surveys are typically the first choice for the development of bathymetric dems in water balance studies when available in the present case the cost of uav lidar equipment was 30 times more than the photogrammetric survey gear and the additional cost of staff with specialist training was required as the lidar uavs drones are usually heavier than ordinary drones used for photogrammetry however to realise the benefits of the reduced cost surveys the uav photogrammetry techniques for bathymetry surveys need to be used in conjunction with the proposed lwaf method to ensure that the water balance is accurate the present study has shown that both the dem and water balance results obtained from uav photogrammetry surveys can have similar quality compared to lidar surveys in the wetland area with dense vegetation cover 4 conclusions water balance budget estimates in intermittent wetlands are essential to understand the ecosystem sustainability therefore it is important to identify the sources of uncertainty contributing to water balance results the present study has found that in water balance modelling surveys of lakes with substantial vegetation cover can have reduced accuracy while uav lidar surveys generally have good accuracy for acquiring bare earth data the downside is their expense in terms of equipment and labour costs on the other hand uav photogrammetry survey data is more affected by vegetation cover but is less expensive to carry out the present study developed and tested a ground filtering method to improve uav photogrammetric dems by removing the influence of vegetation cover on water balance modelling the lwaf method successfully reduced the vegetation interference in the bathymetry data it is shown to provide a substantial improvement in the dem more importantly correcting the dems to remove vegetation interference in lake areas improves the accuracy of water balance results and reduces the uncertainty in water balance the method proposed in the present study is applicable to numerous intermittent wetlands e g brooks 2004 2009 calhoun et al 2017 where bathymetry is essential for water budget estimates apart from the effects of uncertainties associated with the meteorological or hydrologic inputs on hydrologic modelling such as precipitation et or in outflows the present study has demonstrated the importance of understanding the bathymetric uncertainties on water balance study for intermittent wetlands uncertainties in bathymetry data contributing to water balance results can be as important as the contribution of uncertainties in precipitation and et authorship statement s chen w glamore and f johnson conceived the project idea and s chen w glamore and f johnson and c

8362,study region the poyang lake basin at the yangtze river china study focus impacts of multi purpose reservoirs on runoff are investigated through the lens of spatio temporal shifts in runoff coefficients rc before and after reservoir construction we furthermore use evapotranspiration et modelling to interpret possible additional impacts of climate change and other ambient changes since the 1950s within the poyang lake basin comprising one of china s most important freshwater resources new hydrological insights for the region results show that annual average rc and et remain essentially unchanged despite reservoir constructions and irrigation development we show that simultaneous basin wide implementation of lake to land transitions including wetland drainage has had a dampening effect on et contributing to unexpectedly weak et trends our model furthermore shows that the observed modest et increases since the 1950s can be fully attributed to the warmer climate in the region furthermore the intra annual distribution of the monthly rc used to be almost identical in all sub basins during the pre dam period we show that the different operation schedules of multi purpose reservoirs which reflect location specific differences in water need over the year have resulted in pronounced temporal differences in sub basin runoff characteristics including rc values the present analysis contributes to process understanding relevant for water management decisions in the poyang lake basin and other major multi purpose dam regions across the world keywords climate

change e g jarsjö et al 2012 törnqvist et al 2014 land use practices such as afforestation deforestation mining farming and urbanization carlson and arthur 2000 sahin and hall 1996 zhai and tao 2017 as well as water use practices such as construction of dams channels and irrigation systems ferguson and maxwell 2012 magilligan and nislow 2005 modify landscapes including their hydrological functioning ultimately such land use and water use changes can have significant impacts on evapotranspiration infiltration surface water storage and runoff which hence must be considered in water resource management in addition to regional impacts of global climate change e g lacombe et al 2016 however it is a scientific challenge to separate signatures of natural precipitation variability in the landscape from the impact of human induced and climate induced changes furthermore since these impacts occur simultaneously it is challenging to determine the relative importance of climate change and other human induced changes such as land use change on regional hydrological processes jarsjö et al 2020 lyon et al 2017 china is a significant example where impacts of climate change have interacted with unprecedented impacts of various anthropogenic changes during the past decades piao et al 2010 zhai and tao 2017 regarding climate the warming rates in western eastern and northern china are more significant than those in southern china over the past decades kan 2011 and there is evidence that these rates are accelerating ipcc 2013 in the yangtze river basin including dongting and poyang lake regions climate change has not only brought about temperature increases but also altered precipitation net increase unevenly distributed and evapotranspiration net increase this has in turn impacted streamflow and soil moisture li and zhang 2015 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 regarding anthropogenic changes along with an increased population and urbanization china has experienced an expansion in the irrigation area over the past 60 years tong et al 2016 zhu et al 2013 now china possesses over 20 of the world s total irrigation areas and 10 of the world s total number of reservoirs these reservoirs were constructed not only for irrigation but also for flood control and hydropower food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2016 liu et al 2013 the mega scale reservoir development across china and associated reservoir induced streamflow changes have received wide attention and brought about global concerns the most famous three gorges dam tgd which was constructed in the upper yangtze river is one of the world s largest hydraulic projects yang and lu 2014 the tgd was constructed about 800 km upstream of the largest fresh water lake in china the poyang lake fig 1 a which is the main focus of the present study there are unresolved questions and controversy regarding alterations of the natural flow regime by the operation of tgd which has considerably affected the hydrological interactions between the yangtze river and the downstream dongting and poyang lakes guo et al 2012 hu et al 2018 lai et al 2014 mao et al 2016 the interactions include river lake flow exchanges associated lake water level fluctuations and their eco hydrological consequences bunn and arthington 2002 hu et al 2018 nilsson et al 2005 the drainage basin of poyang lake plays an important hydrological and ecological role in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river hu et al 2007 however the poyang lake has been subject to considerable shrinkage after the 1990s along with an increased frequency and severity of floods and droughts in the lake basin li et al 2015a ye et al 2014 in addition to concerns regarding tgd impacts the aforementioned problems have raised concerns about the lake and water resources management from the local government including the role of the numerous dams and reservoirs that have been constructed in the near vicinity of the lake some studies have addressed the increased streamflow variations in the poyang lake basin and reported a series of findings relating to impacts of climatic anomalies land use land cover changes and the impact of the changing hydrology of the yangtze river on poyang lake gu et al 2017 guo et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 other studies were focused on climate induced and human induced runoff changes in different regions of poyang lake basin ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 however attempts in previous studies were not made to systematically quantify and compare prevailing hydroclimatic conditions before and after the construction of the numerous multi purpose dams that now are characteristic of poyang lake basin our current study seeks to improve the understanding of the changing water balance dynamics in the basin which is essential for management of its water resources and can also contribute to improve generic understanding of similar processes in many other world regions subject to complex and overlapping pressures from different human activities and climate change we use a water balance approach and evapotranspiration modelling in combination with analyses of runoff coefficients rc a dimensionless ratio of total runoff over total precipitation mcnamara et al 1998 savenije 1996 to access causes behind observed changes in runoff on various time scales more specifically this study considers all five main sub catchments of the poyang lake basin under pre dam and post dam conditions aiming at detecting impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities including multi purpose reservoir construction on i long term water balances including water losses through evapotranspiration and resulting runoff and ii seasonal runoff characteristics including rc values we hypothesize that increased temperature irrigation area and reservoir area in the poyang lake basin will bring about change in more regional evapotranspiration and thus reduce rcs by comparing between pre dam and post dam periods we determine how rcs vary in different sub catchments at both annual and seasonal monthly scales to test our hypothesis we quantify long term water balance changes through net changes of annual evapotranspiration caused by land use transitions during the whole studied period we further evaluate the relation between reservoir water level and precipitation of the recent year 2017 to assess operational strategies of multi purpose reservoirs in different sub catchments 2 methods 2 1 study area the poyang lake basin occupies an area of 162 225 km2 accounting for approximately 10 of the yangtze river basin the digital elevation model of this basin jarvis et al 2008 shows large elevation differences from the upstream mountain peaks at a maximum elevation of 2108 m to the downstream plains at about 8 m fig 1c the basin s five major river branches are ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui which flow into the yangtze river via the poyang lake through a narrow northern channel the land cover across the poyang lake basin derived from global land cover facility http glcf umd edu data can be divided into the main categories of forest shrub crop water and urban areas as a typical agricultural basin in this part of china this region has considerable production of rice cotton and oilseed rape over 12 of the area is currently irrigated including large regions surrounding the poyang lake and flatlands of ganjiang and fuhe fig 1b food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2016 dominated by a humid subtropical climate the annual mean temperature of the poyang lake basin is 17 4 c and the annual mean precipitation is 1569 mm cru ts v4 01 climate data harris et al 2014 the precipitation of the poyang lake basin is unevenly distributed over the year on average 45 of the annual precipitation falls during the relatively short wet season between april and june thereafter the precipitation gradually decreases with the dry season lasting from about september until february during the past decades numerous water conservation projects have been implemented across the poyang lake basin until 2011 27 large volume 0 1 billion m3 reservoirs had been constructed in this region jiangxi bureau of statistics jxbs 2016 with a total storage capacity over 17 billion m3 among them five major reservoirs were selected for detailed analysis in this current study based on their proximity to discharge measurement stations and their location in the downstream parts of the sub catchment these are zhelin reservoir in xiushui wan an reservoir in gangjing hongmen reservoir in fuhe da ao reservoir in xinjiang and communism reservoir in raohe fig 1c they have a range of different operational objectives including flood control hydroelectricity generation agriculture irrigation and seasonal water supply table 1 2 2 datasets water balance terms the area of poyang lake basin and stream networks were derived from the strm digital elevation data that has a spatial resolution of 90 m jarvis et al 2008 daily discharge q data for the period between 1953 and 2010 were obtained from observations at five gauging stations waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and qiujin before 1975 the flow was gauged in the nearby station of zhelin as reported by the bureau of hydrology boh of changjiang water resources commission the monthly and annual runoff r values were calculated from corresponding q statistics as r q a where a is the drainage area upstream of the considered gauging station table 1 the area averaged monthly data of temperature t and precipitation p were collected for the period 1953 2010 from the cru ts v 4 01 datasets harris et al 2014 this cru dataset is a high resolution gridded datasets containing global climatic data for multiple variables on 0 5 0 5 grids considering the orographic effects due to underrepresentation of gauge at high elevations we applied a correction factor 1 1 for orographic effects on p data calculated according to adam et al 2006 annual average evapotranspiration et was estimated from observation data by closing the water balance equation as 1 e t p r δ s on such annual time scales we have furthermore assumed that the change of water storage δ s within the catchment is negligible compared to p r over the catchment i e δ s 0 which previously have been shown to yield smaller errors in estimated et on the order of 15 than estimation methods that do not consider runoff data which commonly yield errors of up to 50 asokan et al 2010 verstraeten et al 2008 the storage capacity of the five selected reservoirs table 1 accounts for 69 of the storage volume of the 27 major reservoirs in the poyang lake basin jiangxi bureau of statistics jxbs 2016 the monthly average reservoir water levels rwls of the selected five reservoirs in 2017 were collected from the water resources department of the jiangxi province http www jxsl gov cn the corresponding monthly average precipitation values were collected from the chinese climatic brief of year 2017 http www qh323 com to check whether or not the hydro climatic conditions of 2017 were similar to typical i e average conditions of past years the annual average p and monthly average p values from 2017 were compared to the long term annual average and monthly averages of the period 1953 2010 2 3 statistical testing and quantitative analyses 2 3 1 long term hydroclimatic and hydrologic trends linear regression was used to detect trends in multi decadal series of annual average t p et and r the significance of the derived long term trends of hydroclimatic parameters were identified by the mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 pearson correlations were used to detect whether or not significant correlations exist between the variables r p and rwl the statistical significance of correlations was defined in this study considering p value thresholds of 0 01 and 0 05 both pre dam and post dam periods were considered as well as both annual and monthly averages 2 3 2 spatial and temporal differences in rc values in estimating impacts of land use change and flow regulation we will primarily analyze spatial and temporal differences in rc rather than r since differences in rc will to larger extent reflect direct human impacts and to lesser extent climate driven differences in p this is because a change in r may constitute a trivial response to changed p whereas rc values are normalized by p being calculated as r p savenije 1996 for instance on short timescales e g daily or one hydrological event rcs have frequently been applied to analyze floods taguas et al 2017 on longer timescales e g monthly seasonal or annual rcs have been used to understand signals from soil moisture conditions land use change and storage infrastructure such as dams knapp et al 1991 taguas et al 2015 in the present study we evaluate rc changes between pre dam and post dam periods in different sub catchments of poyang lake and therefore divide the hydrological data series using the year of completed major dam construction as breakpoint this breakpoint differed between the different sub catchments table 1 for comparison we also calculated streamflow changes while keeping the early and late periods fixed in all sub catchments comparing the first 20 year period 1953 1972 and the last 20 year period 1991 2010 of the considered total period 1953 2010 see the supplementary information the relative change in rc drc between the periods is then given by 2 d r c r c p o s t r c p r e r c p o s t 100 where r c p r e and r c p o s t are the runoff coefficients in every sub catchment of the pre post dam periods respectively in addition an area averaged rc for the whole poyang lake basin r c p l was calculated as 3 r c p l r s c a s c p s c a s c where r s c p s c and a s c are the runoff the precipitation and the area of the five sub catchments sc respectively the relative change in r c p l d r c p l between pre dam and post dam periods were calculated by applying eq 2 for r c p l 2 3 3 evapotranspiration quantifications for model scenarios 1 actual and potential et equations the actual evapotranspiration e t a was then determined from the annual mean precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e t p according to from turc 1954 and used e g by jarsjö et al 2008 4 e t a p 0 9 p 2 e t p 2 where e t p was estimated by two evapotranspiration calculation methods for comparing the two modelled results as well as to compare the modelled results from the water balance the first langbein 1949 was a simple method as follows 5 e t p 325 21 t 0 9 t 2 the second method is the thornthwaite 1948 method calculated by the following equation 6 e t p i 16 t d i 30 n i 12 10 t i i α where t d i is the number of days of month i n i is the averaged day length in hours of month i t i is the average temperature of month i and i i 1 12 t i 5 1 514 is the heat index and parameter α is calculated as 7 α 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 79 10 2 i 0 49 2 net change in et from various land changes derived observation based et trends using eq 1 were compared to calculated et changes in model scenarios accounting for effects of historical lake to farmland transitions lake drainage reservoir construction and irrigation development the relative changes in et det between pre disturbance 1950 s and post disturbance periods 2010 s were calculated by substituting et for rc in eq 2 in this study both climatic and anthropogenic factors were considered in quantifying net changes of annual et by estimating 1 areal changes due to lake drainage reservoir construction and irrigated agriculture and 2 areal changes as well as changes in 20 year average t from 1953 to 2010 evaporation over water surfaces from lakes and reservoirs were quantified by etp both the langbein and the thornthwaite methods of eqs 5 7 while et elsewhere over land were quantified eta eq 4 in this way et values for year i regarding to water surface e t w s i between 1953 and 2010 which differ due to land use transitions and reservoir developments were estimated from the related annual changes in land surface area and water surface area within the catchments according to 8 e t w s i α i e t p β i e t a where α i is the catchment poyang basin fraction covered by surface water and β i 1 α i is the complementary catchment fraction covered by land regarding et values due to irrigation developments e t i r we estimated by using 9 e t i r α i r e t a a f t e r β i r e t a b e f o r e where α i r is the changed percentage of irrigation area from the 1950 s to 2000 s and β ir 1 α ir e t a b e f o r e and e t a a f t e r are actual evapotranspiration before and after irrigation developments we used p i r r i a f t e r p l o c a l p e x t r a to calculate e t a a f t e r after irrigation where p l o c a l is the local precipitation over the considered irrigation fields we estimated p e x t r a due to irrigation developments as p e x t r a x i r r i a i r r i where x i r r i is the water volume of annual irrigation and a i r r i is the area of the irrigated fields 2 3 4 reservoir operation and anthropogenic changes the regulation procedures of the multi purpose reservoirs in the poyang lake basin are designed to control the reservoir water release during different seasons in order to meet various functional objectives as indicated in table 1 hydroelectricity is a main objective of reservoir operation for all dams considered the annual average electricity production of the five reservoirs in poyang lake basin is about 2 4 billion kwh jiangxi province 2010 apart from targeting energy demands the reservoirs in the poyang lake basin have another important objective namely flood control the reservoirs are required to keep the water levels lower than flood related threshold levels in order to provide adequate storage capacity for seasonal maximum inflows at the end of any given flood season reservoirs generally start to store water until reaching their normal water levels with sufficient water storage at the onset of the dry season reservoirs can discharge water to downstream regions to provide water for agricultural and industrial use and for improved navigation conditions 3 results 3 1 observed long term changes in climate water balance terms and rc during the considered period 1953 2010 the mean annual t in all sub catchments showed increasing trends which were statistically significant p value 0 001 according to the mann kendall test the trends including 10 year running averages are illustrated in fig 2 a c e g and i for the whole poyang lake basin t increased by on average 0 01 c year 1 during the 58 year investigation period which is approximately the same rate as the average global warming during the period 1951 2012 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 the annual mean p showed temporal fluctuations over the whole period without significant trends fig 2a c e g and i there were certain tendencies towards higher post dam p than pre dam p in ganjiang and xiushui and lower post dam p than pre dam p in fuhe xinjiang and raohe table 2 see also table 1 for the start and end years of the periods in each sub catchment for et there was a significantly increasing trend in the fuhe sub catchment p value 0 001 whereas the changes were found to be insignificant in the other four sub catchments the tendencies were towards decreased annual mean et during the post dam period in ganjiang raohe and xiushui and increased et in xinjiang overall the net sum of the et changes of all five sub catchments between the pre dam and post dam periods had increased by only 2 the annual mean r in ganjiang and xiushui was slightly higher during the post dam period than during the pre dam period fuhe xinjiang and raohe showed the opposite result table 2 none of the long term 1953 2010 trends in r fig 2b d f h and j were however statistically significant which is a result shared by several other catchments e g lyon et al 2009 2017 over shorter decadal time scales annual average r in all sub catchments had similar temporal fluctuations with relatively low values in the end of the 1980 s followed by relatively high values around 2000 the running average of r of ganjiang fuhe and xinjiang peaked in 2002 whereas raohe and xiushui reached their peak values in 1999 the annual average rc has decreased considerably in fuhe table 3 both when considering differences between pre dam and post dam periods and when considering differences between the first 20 years and the last 20 years of the considered period 1953 2010 for the other four sub catchments the rc differences between the periods were small and showed no consistent trend for example during the post dam period the annual average rc was slightly higher than during the pre dam period in ganjiang and xiushui whereas it was slightly lower in raohe and essentially unchanged in xinjiang table 3 as a result of these opposing weak trends in all catchments but one the annual average rc for the whole poyang region remained nearly unchanged between the pre dam period and the post dam period 3 2 model supported interpretations of long term water balance changes we here use et modelling to find process based explanations for our observation based result that basin scale et and r were essentially unchanged between 1953 and 2010 showing a small increase of 2 only section 3 1 despite climate change and considerable land use changes within the poyang lake basin since the 1950 s historical records show that back then the water surface area of lakes and wetlands in the poyang lake basin accounted for approximately 10 of the whole basin jiangxi provincial department of forestry jxpdf 2000 this area had decreased by around 4 3 percentage points in 2010 table 4 jiangxi provincial department of forestry jxpdf 2000 zhao et al 2006 xu 2017 due to basin wide implementation of lake to land transitions our et modelling showed that such a decrease in water surface area corresponds to a net decrease of annual et over the basin of about 0 52 table 4 on the other hand between 1953 and 2011 the water surface area increased by about 710 km2 global reservoir and dam database lehner et al 2011 messager et al 2016 as newly constructed reservoirs in the poyang lake basin were filled with water this corresponds to an increased annual et of about only 0 054 table 4 additionally the irrigated area of the basin has increased by about 6800 km2 between the 1950 s and 2010 jiangxi government 2020 zhao et al 2006 party history research center of the cpc central committee hprc 2009 editorial committee of the china census for water ecccw 2017 our quantifications show that this yields a limited annual et increase over basin of about 0 14 table 4 which hence is clearly smaller than the above estimated et decrease due to the lake to land transitions of 0 52 overall the modelled net effect of lake drainage reservoir construction and irrigated agricultural land development since the 1950 s is a very small et decrease of 0 33 we had to include also the impact of increased temperatures 0 55 since the 1950 s in our et modelling to obtain a non negative et change 4 6 over the poyang lake basin this is reasonably similar to the observed et increase 2 1 derived by water balance closure table 4 see also section 4 3 for discussion of this result in order to investigate to which extent our langbein method based results can be reproduced also with other et models we independently applied the thornthwaite method to quantify the et changes in response to land use changes and increased temperatures results indicated negligible differences of up to 0 3 in the modelled net effects of et comparing the two methods table s1 3 3 observed intra annual changes in water balance terms and rc the intra annual distributions of p were relatively similar during the pre dam period and the post dam period in all five sub catchments fig 3 a c e g and i with maximum values in may june and minimum values usually in december more specifically the monthly average p consistently peaked in june for xinjiang and xiushui in gaijang fuhe and rahoe p peaked in may during the pre dam period blue lines which was delayed until june in the post dam period red lines the intra annual distributions of r fig 3b d f h j in the pre dam period and the small differences between the pre dam blue lines and the post dam red lines periods followed almost exactly the same patterns as seen for p except for xiushui in the latter catchment there was a pronounced decrease in post dam r compared with pre dam r between april and june as well as a clear increase in post dam r between august and march fig 3j which could not have been driven by the relatively small changes seen in p fig 3i intra annual trends of change apart from those directly driven by p become apparent also in other catchments than xiushui when considering normalized distributions of rc r p fig 4 during the pre dam period all sub catchments had similar base line distributions of rc fig 4 blue bars generally the monthly rc reached a maximum in june or july it then decreased sharply reaching in most cases a minimum already in august just before the onset of the dry period the monthly rc then typically increased gradually over the year until next june or july except for some occasional drops in the winter period during the post dam period red bars the intra annual rc distributions exhibited shifts in a majority of the sub catchments but not all of them clear shifts were seen in ganjiang xinjiang and xiushui where post dam rc values were higher than pre dam values during the autumn and winter months august to february and lower during the summer months fig 4a c and e reflecting seasonal water storage in reservoirs see further section 4 1 this trend was most pronounced in xiushui were the monthly maximum rc shifted from july in the pre dam period to december in the post dam period and the minimum value shifted from january to june after reservoir regulation for fuhe and raohe there were no apparent intra annual redistribution of monthly rc between the pre dam and post dam periods fig 4b and d despite the fact that there was an approximately uniform decrease of monthly absolute rc values in fuhe 4 discussion 4 1 operational strategies of multi purpose reservoirs overall our results demonstrate that r shows strong positive correlation with local p in the poyang lake basin table 5 as one would expect in unregulated river systems however more detailed analysis of streamflow data is required to reveal the actual extent to which streamflow are impacted by various of reservoir operations as shown and discussed below we then consider reservoir water level data from 2017 fig 5 which is a year that had an average p deviating less than 2 from the long term average p 1953 2010 and which also had a seasonal distribution of p fig 5 red solid lines that was similar to long term conditions fig 5 red dashed lines not least in terms of the timing month of maximum p and minimum p 4 1 1 flood control during january to march april at the rising limb of the annual hydrographs precipitation gradually increased fig 5 red curves and water was released from the reservoirs in ganjiang xinjiang and xiushui see also shao et al 2017 to such an extent that the rwl clearly decreased fig 5a c d orange bars as a result rwl in these catchments showed a strong negative correlation with p table 5 which was significant for ganjiang where the wan an reservoir is located furthermore this impacted the rc values providing an explanation for the post dam rc increases relative to pre dam conditions fig 4 primarily in ganjiang and xiushui during the first quarter of the year more generally this reflects a period when the reservoir operations are focused on the early stage of flood control targets to facilitate sufficient storage volume to mitigate wet season floods reservoirs start to use the facilitated storage volume by allowing rwl increases and discharge reductions again as precipitation peaks in june fig 5 impounding of water and associated rwl increases usually occur until at least july or early autumn fig 5 after which p decreases this is a strategy similar to the three gorges dam china three gorges corporation ctg 2015 these reservoir operations for flood control purpose are estimated to decrease the reoccurrence of floods causing downstream damage from 5 or 10 years to at least 20 years up to 50 years in ganjiang and xiushui jiangxi province 2010 4 1 2 water supply for irrigation hydroelectricity and other operational targets in most tributary rivers flood control is just one of several operational purposes of the reservoirs table 1 for example the wan an reservoir operation schedule considers flood control see 4 1 1 hydroelectricity production with an annual average production over 1 5 billion kwh navigation support water storage for irrigation and various environmental goals notably the use of the wan an reservoir for water supply in the start of the dry season in early autumn is reflected in a slightly decreased the rwl fig 5a and increased the rc in the post dam period between august to april in ganjiang fig 4a a similar operational strategy in the dry season was implemented in xiushui as reflected by the runoff characteristics fig 3j and the relatively high post dam average value of monthly rc in winter time fig 4e that reflect net water releases from the zhelin reservoir as also independently noted by shao et al 2017 irrigation is another main target for reservoirs in poyang lake basin impacting rwl for example the da ao reservoir in xinjiang showed an rwl decrease in early in february which is consistent with early spring irrigation water needs when the minimum t increases over 5 c the sowing season starts for early spring crops such as various vegetable seeding in february and early rice in march furthermore water releases for agricultural water supply generally contribute to the observed decreases in rwl after august fig 5 for instance to meet the water requirements of the late season rice sowing in june and harvesting is in october and the oilseed rape sowing in september and harvesting in april some reservoirs have ambitious targets related to irrigation like the hongmen reservoir in fuhe which was intended to increase the supply of irrigation water to the gan fu plain by up to 7 presently fuhe occupies the largest proportion 17 of irrigated agricultural fields among the 5 considered sub catchments food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2016 consequently the water withdrawal in fuhe was considerable corresponding to about 30 of the annual total streamflow in the sub catchment zhang et al 2016 our results section 3 3 demonstrated that the annual average flows in fuhe showed a decreasing tendency over time during the study period 1953 2010 fig 2d this resulted in a clearly lower annual average rc value for the post dam period than for the pre dam period in fuhe fig 3b right most bars which is consistent with the considerable expansion of irrigated agriculture during this period our synthesis more generally shows that the multi purpose reservoirs are associated with non trivial scheduling that contribute to the observed complex fluctuations in rwl fig 5 and related impacts on rc fig 4 one aspect of this complexity is that reservoir schedules can differ considerably between different years in extreme drought years such as 1963 and 1978 the hongmen reservoir in fuhe has supplied water for residential water use despite the fact that the main objective of hongmen reservoir in fuhe is hydroelectricity table 1 another important aspect of the complexity is that the actual usage of the multi purpose reservoirs can differ considerably between different sub catchments depending on location specific needs that change over the year according to needs for water and food supply flood control energy production and environmental goals for instance in the communism reservoir in raohe the water needs for industry are considerable with water withdrawals for industrial use of over 3 million m3 every year despite its main operational goal being irrigation altogether the pronounced differences in multi purpose reservoir operation targets depending on season and location can largely explain the fact that seasonal hydrological characteristics in particular the rc values which before the construction of multi purpose reservoirs in the poyang lake basin were uniform across its sub catchments fig 4 blue bars presently exhibit significant spatial differences fig 4 red bars 4 2 et losses and overall water availability in the poyang lake basin our model supported interpretations of observational data showed that despite increased temperature construction of reservoirs and considerable irrigation expansion in the poyang lake basin during 1953 2010 the et has on average only increased marginally by about 2 section 3 2 and the basin average fraction of p lost through et remained essentially unchanged as shown by the rc value analysis section 3 1 this result contrasts to observations in many other world regions undergoing agricultural intensification for instance significant increases in et have been seen in agricultural regions of southern europe the middle east and central asia gordon et al 2008 karthe et al 2017 with probably the most notable example being the aral sea disaster largely caused by water demanding cotton cultivation jarsjö et al 2012 törnqvist and jarsjö 2012 a factor that likely has contributed to maintaining basin scale et losses at pre 1950 s levels in the poyang lake basin is the large scale drainage of wetlands and lakes after the 1950 s as shown in the results section this drainage has reduced the total area of natural surface waters which has compensated for the simultaneous increase in the area of reservoirs and irrigated fields apart from the here quantified impacts of surface water area changes other land use transitions can also have impacted the et losses after the 1950 s for instance despite the expansion of irrigated agriculture up to 14 of the cultivated land in the poyang lake basin has been lost due to e g urbanization and natural hazards between 1957 and 2002 zhao et al 2006 such changes which probably decrease basin scale et reflect accelerated cultivated land conversions in china as part of the agricultural structural changes that have taken place following the 1978 economic reforms on the other hand there are simultaneously occurring land use transitions that are likely to increase et such as the expansion of forest coverage of the poyang lake basin from about 40 in 1950 to a considerable 63 in 2010 jiangxi bureau of statistics jxbs 2016 whereas an unraveling of the detailed dynamics of these processes would be worth further studies we can through our present overall water balance quantifications show that the evaporation from the reservoirs as well as the increased et associated with irrigation expansion have had limited impact on the basin scale et under the historical hydroclimatic conditions of the poyang lake basin the long term basin scale net increase in et since the 1950 s has been limited to a couple of percent only 2 1 table 4 which e g is smaller than the estimated individual contribution from climate warming our calculated average post dam et increase of 2 1 for the poyang lake basin was based on an assumed negligible water storage change on the basin scale the actual year to year storage changes can mainly be related to weather driven differences in groundwater and surface water levels whereas the impact of annual differences in soil moisture is likely small e g zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 quantified the annual amplitudes of water storage within the poyang lake basin to be about 60 mm per year varying annually between 33 mm 92 mm during the period 2003 2016 this corresponds to about 7 of the annual average et in the poyang lake basin which indicates that the potential errors in estimating annual et of the poyang lake basin based on water balance closure falls within the reported method specific maximum errors of about 15 asokan et al 2010 the difference in basin scale water storage over a 20 year to 30 year period relevant for our comparison between pre dam and post dam conditions is likely to be much smaller than the annual fluctuations even in presence of climate change and land use change for example although the filling of reservoirs in the post dam period clearly constitutes a water storage change the effect is small on the estimated long term post dam et the reservoir filling volume is large in absolute terms 19 km3 however when averaged over the entire catchment area during the 25 year post dam period this volume corresponds to only 4 mm year or 0 5 of the estimated average post dam et the above discussed counteracting drivers of change may in part explain why the historical anthropogenic impacts on basin scale water flows and poyang lake water levels have been found to be relatively low for instance focusing on net effects on stream flow the quantitative assessment by ye et al 2013 indicated that relative effect of human activities in the whole poyang lake basin during the period 1970 2007 was only about one third of the effect of climate change in another study by mei et al 2015 the average contribution of human activities within the poyang lake catchment on the observed water level decrease of the lake was estimated to about 5 only looking ahead land drainage is no longer occurring within the poyang lake basin and have in some cases even been replaced by lake and wetland restauration zhang et al 2016 this means that a main driver acting to decrease basin scale et has been lost whereas drivers that act to increase et including agricultural expansion afforestation and continued construction of reservoirs are expected to remain and can even be expected to accelerate in the future cpc central committee and council 2010 present quantifications therefore imply that the net anthropogenic impacts on river flows and freshwater inputs to the poyang lake are likely to increase in the future the planned controversial poyang lake dam project aims at building a dam in the narrow northern channel that connects poyang lake with the yangtze river in order to alleviate impacts of droughts on the lake region the idea is to hinder excess outflow and pronounced lake level lowering that have occurred since the completion in 2003 of the upstream located tgd which have been caused by tgd related low water stands in the yangtze river zhang et al 2014 however the success of such a management strategy depends on the lake inflows from the drainage basin being sufficient to maintain lake water levels even during extended periods of droughts this implies that an understanding of basin internal processes may become increasingly important in the future regarding the basin s overlapping effects of human changes and climate change it may be useful to pay attention to impacts of re forestation in future studies the reason is that re forestation may occur over relatively large areas and since forests can have notable impacts on et there is a risk that basin scale runoff patterns can be impacted furthermore a particular challenge shared with many other lake and river basins of the world would be to increase the understanding of net impacts of different complex multi purpose dam regulation schemes which here were shown to cause pronounced regional hydrological differences among the five main sub catchments of the poyang lake hence a useful next step for future studies would be to systematically model the various impacts associated with the application of different conceivable reservoir operation rules e g lauri et al 2012 5 conclusions in contrast to many other regions subject to considerable land use change dam constructions irrigation expansion and climate change the annual average et r and rc r p runoff per unit precipitation of the poyang lake basin have remained essentially unchanged since the 1950 s throughout pre dam and post dam periods present model results show that this can be explained by the historical hydroclimatic conditions of the poyang lake basin under which the evaporation from the reservoirs as well as the increased et associated with irrigation expansion have limited impact on the basin scale et in addition basin wide implementation of lake to land transitions including wetland drainage since the 1950 s has had a dampening effect on the et increases this explains why several previous studies about the water resources of the basin have found anthropogenic impacts to be low we furthermore find that the observed modest et increases since the 1950 s can fully be attributed to the warmer climate in the region with continued climate warming it is hence likely the basin s et losses will increase in the future impacts of the multi purpose reservoir constructed since the 1950 s are complex in the pre dam period the monthly rc had similar intra annual distribution patterns in all sub catchments present results show that the operation schedules of the basin s multi purpose reservoirs have resulted in rwl fluctuations and intra annual rc patterns hydrological flow patterns that differ across the sub catchments the operations can be related to location specific conditions that change over the year according to needs for water and food supply flood control energy production and environmental goals the combined effect of these different sub catchment operations on the overall water resources of the poyang lake may therefore need to further attention the poyang lake has already witnessed an enhanced seasonal dryness that might have been aggravated by the tgd operation in the yangtze river successful management strategies under possible drought conditions will in the future be dependent on the inflows from the poyang lake basin rather than flows from the yangtze river such as the proposed poyang lake dam project the internal flows must be sufficient to maintain the lake water levels even during extended dry periods which implies that an increased

8362,study region the poyang lake basin at the yangtze river china study focus impacts of multi purpose reservoirs on runoff are investigated through the lens of spatio temporal shifts in runoff coefficients rc before and after reservoir construction we furthermore use evapotranspiration et modelling to interpret possible additional impacts of climate change and other ambient changes since the 1950s within the poyang lake basin comprising one of china s most important freshwater resources new hydrological insights for the region results show that annual average rc and et remain essentially unchanged despite reservoir constructions and irrigation development we show that simultaneous basin wide implementation of lake to land transitions including wetland drainage has had a dampening effect on et contributing to unexpectedly weak et trends our model furthermore shows that the observed modest et increases since the 1950s can be fully attributed to the warmer climate in the region furthermore the intra annual distribution of the monthly rc used to be almost identical in all sub basins during the pre dam period we show that the different operation schedules of multi purpose reservoirs which reflect location specific differences in water need over the year have resulted in pronounced temporal differences in sub basin runoff characteristics including rc values the present analysis contributes to process understanding relevant for water management decisions in the poyang lake basin and other major multi purpose dam regions across the world keywords climate

change e g jarsjö et al 2012 törnqvist et al 2014 land use practices such as afforestation deforestation mining farming and urbanization carlson and arthur 2000 sahin and hall 1996 zhai and tao 2017 as well as water use practices such as construction of dams channels and irrigation systems ferguson and maxwell 2012 magilligan and nislow 2005 modify landscapes including their hydrological functioning ultimately such land use and water use changes can have significant impacts on evapotranspiration infiltration surface water storage and runoff which hence must be considered in water resource management in addition to regional impacts of global climate change e g lacombe et al 2016 however it is a scientific challenge to separate signatures of natural precipitation variability in the landscape from the impact of human induced and climate induced changes furthermore since these impacts occur simultaneously it is challenging to determine the relative importance of climate change and other human induced changes such as land use change on regional hydrological processes jarsjö et al 2020 lyon et al 2017 china is a significant example where impacts of climate change have interacted with unprecedented impacts of various anthropogenic changes during the past decades piao et al 2010 zhai and tao 2017 regarding climate the warming rates in western eastern and northern china are more significant than those in southern china over the past decades kan 2011 and there is evidence that these rates are accelerating ipcc 2013 in the yangtze river basin including dongting and poyang lake regions climate change has not only brought about temperature increases but also altered precipitation net increase unevenly distributed and evapotranspiration net increase this has in turn impacted streamflow and soil moisture li and zhang 2015 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 regarding anthropogenic changes along with an increased population and urbanization china has experienced an expansion in the irrigation area over the past 60 years tong et al 2016 zhu et al 2013 now china possesses over 20 of the world s total irrigation areas and 10 of the world s total number of reservoirs these reservoirs were constructed not only for irrigation but also for flood control and hydropower food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2016 liu et al 2013 the mega scale reservoir development across china and associated reservoir induced streamflow changes have received wide attention and brought about global concerns the most famous three gorges dam tgd which was constructed in the upper yangtze river is one of the world s largest hydraulic projects yang and lu 2014 the tgd was constructed about 800 km upstream of the largest fresh water lake in china the poyang lake fig 1 a which is the main focus of the present study there are unresolved questions and controversy regarding alterations of the natural flow regime by the operation of tgd which has considerably affected the hydrological interactions between the yangtze river and the downstream dongting and poyang lakes guo et al 2012 hu et al 2018 lai et al 2014 mao et al 2016 the interactions include river lake flow exchanges associated lake water level fluctuations and their eco hydrological consequences bunn and arthington 2002 hu et al 2018 nilsson et al 2005 the drainage basin of poyang lake plays an important hydrological and ecological role in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river hu et al 2007 however the poyang lake has been subject to considerable shrinkage after the 1990s along with an increased frequency and severity of floods and droughts in the lake basin li et al 2015a ye et al 2014 in addition to concerns regarding tgd impacts the aforementioned problems have raised concerns about the lake and water resources management from the local government including the role of the numerous dams and reservoirs that have been constructed in the near vicinity of the lake some studies have addressed the increased streamflow variations in the poyang lake basin and reported a series of findings relating to impacts of climatic anomalies land use land cover changes and the impact of the changing hydrology of the yangtze river on poyang lake gu et al 2017 guo et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 other studies were focused on climate induced and human induced runoff changes in different regions of poyang lake basin ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 however attempts in previous studies were not made to systematically quantify and compare prevailing hydroclimatic conditions before and after the construction of the numerous multi purpose dams that now are characteristic of poyang lake basin our current study seeks to improve the understanding of the changing water balance dynamics in the basin which is essential for management of its water resources and can also contribute to improve generic understanding of similar processes in many other world regions subject to complex and overlapping pressures from different human activities and climate change we use a water balance approach and evapotranspiration modelling in combination with analyses of runoff coefficients rc a dimensionless ratio of total runoff over total precipitation mcnamara et al 1998 savenije 1996 to access causes behind observed changes in runoff on various time scales more specifically this study considers all five main sub catchments of the poyang lake basin under pre dam and post dam conditions aiming at detecting impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities including multi purpose reservoir construction on i long term water balances including water losses through evapotranspiration and resulting runoff and ii seasonal runoff characteristics including rc values we hypothesize that increased temperature irrigation area and reservoir area in the poyang lake basin will bring about change in more regional evapotranspiration and thus reduce rcs by comparing between pre dam and post dam periods we determine how rcs vary in different sub catchments at both annual and seasonal monthly scales to test our hypothesis we quantify long term water balance changes through net changes of annual evapotranspiration caused by land use transitions during the whole studied period we further evaluate the relation between reservoir water level and precipitation of the recent year 2017 to assess operational strategies of multi purpose reservoirs in different sub catchments 2 methods 2 1 study area the poyang lake basin occupies an area of 162 225 km2 accounting for approximately 10 of the yangtze river basin the digital elevation model of this basin jarvis et al 2008 shows large elevation differences from the upstream mountain peaks at a maximum elevation of 2108 m to the downstream plains at about 8 m fig 1c the basin s five major river branches are ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui which flow into the yangtze river via the poyang lake through a narrow northern channel the land cover across the poyang lake basin derived from global land cover facility http glcf umd edu data can be divided into the main categories of forest shrub crop water and urban areas as a typical agricultural basin in this part of china this region has considerable production of rice cotton and oilseed rape over 12 of the area is currently irrigated including large regions surrounding the poyang lake and flatlands of ganjiang and fuhe fig 1b food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2016 dominated by a humid subtropical climate the annual mean temperature of the poyang lake basin is 17 4 c and the annual mean precipitation is 1569 mm cru ts v4 01 climate data harris et al 2014 the precipitation of the poyang lake basin is unevenly distributed over the year on average 45 of the annual precipitation falls during the relatively short wet season between april and june thereafter the precipitation gradually decreases with the dry season lasting from about september until february during the past decades numerous water conservation projects have been implemented across the poyang lake basin until 2011 27 large volume 0 1 billion m3 reservoirs had been constructed in this region jiangxi bureau of statistics jxbs 2016 with a total storage capacity over 17 billion m3 among them five major reservoirs were selected for detailed analysis in this current study based on their proximity to discharge measurement stations and their location in the downstream parts of the sub catchment these are zhelin reservoir in xiushui wan an reservoir in gangjing hongmen reservoir in fuhe da ao reservoir in xinjiang and communism reservoir in raohe fig 1c they have a range of different operational objectives including flood control hydroelectricity generation agriculture irrigation and seasonal water supply table 1 2 2 datasets water balance terms the area of poyang lake basin and stream networks were derived from the strm digital elevation data that has a spatial resolution of 90 m jarvis et al 2008 daily discharge q data for the period between 1953 and 2010 were obtained from observations at five gauging stations waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and qiujin before 1975 the flow was gauged in the nearby station of zhelin as reported by the bureau of hydrology boh of changjiang water resources commission the monthly and annual runoff r values were calculated from corresponding q statistics as r q a where a is the drainage area upstream of the considered gauging station table 1 the area averaged monthly data of temperature t and precipitation p were collected for the period 1953 2010 from the cru ts v 4 01 datasets harris et al 2014 this cru dataset is a high resolution gridded datasets containing global climatic data for multiple variables on 0 5 0 5 grids considering the orographic effects due to underrepresentation of gauge at high elevations we applied a correction factor 1 1 for orographic effects on p data calculated according to adam et al 2006 annual average evapotranspiration et was estimated from observation data by closing the water balance equation as 1 e t p r δ s on such annual time scales we have furthermore assumed that the change of water storage δ s within the catchment is negligible compared to p r over the catchment i e δ s 0 which previously have been shown to yield smaller errors in estimated et on the order of 15 than estimation methods that do not consider runoff data which commonly yield errors of up to 50 asokan et al 2010 verstraeten et al 2008 the storage capacity of the five selected reservoirs table 1 accounts for 69 of the storage volume of the 27 major reservoirs in the poyang lake basin jiangxi bureau of statistics jxbs 2016 the monthly average reservoir water levels rwls of the selected five reservoirs in 2017 were collected from the water resources department of the jiangxi province http www jxsl gov cn the corresponding monthly average precipitation values were collected from the chinese climatic brief of year 2017 http www qh323 com to check whether or not the hydro climatic conditions of 2017 were similar to typical i e average conditions of past years the annual average p and monthly average p values from 2017 were compared to the long term annual average and monthly averages of the period 1953 2010 2 3 statistical testing and quantitative analyses 2 3 1 long term hydroclimatic and hydrologic trends linear regression was used to detect trends in multi decadal series of annual average t p et and r the significance of the derived long term trends of hydroclimatic parameters were identified by the mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 pearson correlations were used to detect whether or not significant correlations exist between the variables r p and rwl the statistical significance of correlations was defined in this study considering p value thresholds of 0 01 and 0 05 both pre dam and post dam periods were considered as well as both annual and monthly averages 2 3 2 spatial and temporal differences in rc values in estimating impacts of land use change and flow regulation we will primarily analyze spatial and temporal differences in rc rather than r since differences in rc will to larger extent reflect direct human impacts and to lesser extent climate driven differences in p this is because a change in r may constitute a trivial response to changed p whereas rc values are normalized by p being calculated as r p savenije 1996 for instance on short timescales e g daily or one hydrological event rcs have frequently been applied to analyze floods taguas et al 2017 on longer timescales e g monthly seasonal or annual rcs have been used to understand signals from soil moisture conditions land use change and storage infrastructure such as dams knapp et al 1991 taguas et al 2015 in the present study we evaluate rc changes between pre dam and post dam periods in different sub catchments of poyang lake and therefore divide the hydrological data series using the year of completed major dam construction as breakpoint this breakpoint differed between the different sub catchments table 1 for comparison we also calculated streamflow changes while keeping the early and late periods fixed in all sub catchments comparing the first 20 year period 1953 1972 and the last 20 year period 1991 2010 of the considered total period 1953 2010 see the supplementary information the relative change in rc drc between the periods is then given by 2 d r c r c p o s t r c p r e r c p o s t 100 where r c p r e and r c p o s t are the runoff coefficients in every sub catchment of the pre post dam periods respectively in addition an area averaged rc for the whole poyang lake basin r c p l was calculated as 3 r c p l r s c a s c p s c a s c where r s c p s c and a s c are the runoff the precipitation and the area of the five sub catchments sc respectively the relative change in r c p l d r c p l between pre dam and post dam periods were calculated by applying eq 2 for r c p l 2 3 3 evapotranspiration quantifications for model scenarios 1 actual and potential et equations the actual evapotranspiration e t a was then determined from the annual mean precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e t p according to from turc 1954 and used e g by jarsjö et al 2008 4 e t a p 0 9 p 2 e t p 2 where e t p was estimated by two evapotranspiration calculation methods for comparing the two modelled results as well as to compare the modelled results from the water balance the first langbein 1949 was a simple method as follows 5 e t p 325 21 t 0 9 t 2 the second method is the thornthwaite 1948 method calculated by the following equation 6 e t p i 16 t d i 30 n i 12 10 t i i α where t d i is the number of days of month i n i is the averaged day length in hours of month i t i is the average temperature of month i and i i 1 12 t i 5 1 514 is the heat index and parameter α is calculated as 7 α 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 79 10 2 i 0 49 2 net change in et from various land changes derived observation based et trends using eq 1 were compared to calculated et changes in model scenarios accounting for effects of historical lake to farmland transitions lake drainage reservoir construction and irrigation development the relative changes in et det between pre disturbance 1950 s and post disturbance periods 2010 s were calculated by substituting et for rc in eq 2 in this study both climatic and anthropogenic factors were considered in quantifying net changes of annual et by estimating 1 areal changes due to lake drainage reservoir construction and irrigated agriculture and 2 areal changes as well as changes in 20 year average t from 1953 to 2010 evaporation over water surfaces from lakes and reservoirs were quantified by etp both the langbein and the thornthwaite methods of eqs 5 7 while et elsewhere over land were quantified eta eq 4 in this way et values for year i regarding to water surface e t w s i between 1953 and 2010 which differ due to land use transitions and reservoir developments were estimated from the related annual changes in land surface area and water surface area within the catchments according to 8 e t w s i α i e t p β i e t a where α i is the catchment poyang basin fraction covered by surface water and β i 1 α i is the complementary catchment fraction covered by land regarding et values due to irrigation developments e t i r we estimated by using 9 e t i r α i r e t a a f t e r β i r e t a b e f o r e where α i r is the changed percentage of irrigation area from the 1950 s to 2000 s and β ir 1 α ir e t a b e f o r e and e t a a f t e r are actual evapotranspiration before and after irrigation developments we used p i r r i a f t e r p l o c a l p e x t r a to calculate e t a a f t e r after irrigation where p l o c a l is the local precipitation over the considered irrigation fields we estimated p e x t r a due to irrigation developments as p e x t r a x i r r i a i r r i where x i r r i is the water volume of annual irrigation and a i r r i is the area of the irrigated fields 2 3 4 reservoir operation and anthropogenic changes the regulation procedures of the multi purpose reservoirs in the poyang lake basin are designed to control the reservoir water release during different seasons in order to meet various functional objectives as indicated in table 1 hydroelectricity is a main objective of reservoir operation for all dams considered the annual average electricity production of the five reservoirs in poyang lake basin is about 2 4 billion kwh jiangxi province 2010 apart from targeting energy demands the reservoirs in the poyang lake basin have another important objective namely flood control the reservoirs are required to keep the water levels lower than flood related threshold levels in order to provide adequate storage capacity for seasonal maximum inflows at the end of any given flood season reservoirs generally start to store water until reaching their normal water levels with sufficient water storage at the onset of the dry season reservoirs can discharge water to downstream regions to provide water for agricultural and industrial use and for improved navigation conditions 3 results 3 1 observed long term changes in climate water balance terms and rc during the considered period 1953 2010 the mean annual t in all sub catchments showed increasing trends which were statistically significant p value 0 001 according to the mann kendall test the trends including 10 year running averages are illustrated in fig 2 a c e g and i for the whole poyang lake basin t increased by on average 0 01 c year 1 during the 58 year investigation period which is approximately the same rate as the average global warming during the period 1951 2012 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 the annual mean p showed temporal fluctuations over the whole period without significant trends fig 2a c e g and i there were certain tendencies towards higher post dam p than pre dam p in ganjiang and xiushui and lower post dam p than pre dam p in fuhe xinjiang and raohe table 2 see also table 1 for the start and end years of the periods in each sub catchment for et there was a significantly increasing trend in the fuhe sub catchment p value 0 001 whereas the changes were found to be insignificant in the other four sub catchments the tendencies were towards decreased annual mean et during the post dam period in ganjiang raohe and xiushui and increased et in xinjiang overall the net sum of the et changes of all five sub catchments between the pre dam and post dam periods had increased by only 2 the annual mean r in ganjiang and xiushui was slightly higher during the post dam period than during the pre dam period fuhe xinjiang and raohe showed the opposite result table 2 none of the long term 1953 2010 trends in r fig 2b d f h and j were however statistically significant which is a result shared by several other catchments e g lyon et al 2009 2017 over shorter decadal time scales annual average r in all sub catchments had similar temporal fluctuations with relatively low values in the end of the 1980 s followed by relatively high values around 2000 the running average of r of ganjiang fuhe and xinjiang peaked in 2002 whereas raohe and xiushui reached their peak values in 1999 the annual average rc has decreased considerably in fuhe table 3 both when considering differences between pre dam and post dam periods and when considering differences between the first 20 years and the last 20 years of the considered period 1953 2010 for the other four sub catchments the rc differences between the periods were small and showed no consistent trend for example during the post dam period the annual average rc was slightly higher than during the pre dam period in ganjiang and xiushui whereas it was slightly lower in raohe and essentially unchanged in xinjiang table 3 as a result of these opposing weak trends in all catchments but one the annual average rc for the whole poyang region remained nearly unchanged between the pre dam period and the post dam period 3 2 model supported interpretations of long term water balance changes we here use et modelling to find process based explanations for our observation based result that basin scale et and r were essentially unchanged between 1953 and 2010 showing a small increase of 2 only section 3 1 despite climate change and considerable land use changes within the poyang lake basin since the 1950 s historical records show that back then the water surface area of lakes and wetlands in the poyang lake basin accounted for approximately 10 of the whole basin jiangxi provincial department of forestry jxpdf 2000 this area had decreased by around 4 3 percentage points in 2010 table 4 jiangxi provincial department of forestry jxpdf 2000 zhao et al 2006 xu 2017 due to basin wide implementation of lake to land transitions our et modelling showed that such a decrease in water surface area corresponds to a net decrease of annual et over the basin of about 0 52 table 4 on the other hand between 1953 and 2011 the water surface area increased by about 710 km2 global reservoir and dam database lehner et al 2011 messager et al 2016 as newly constructed reservoirs in the poyang lake basin were filled with water this corresponds to an increased annual et of about only 0 054 table 4 additionally the irrigated area of the basin has increased by about 6800 km2 between the 1950 s and 2010 jiangxi government 2020 zhao et al 2006 party history research center of the cpc central committee hprc 2009 editorial committee of the china census for water ecccw 2017 our quantifications show that this yields a limited annual et increase over basin of about 0 14 table 4 which hence is clearly smaller than the above estimated et decrease due to the lake to land transitions of 0 52 overall the modelled net effect of lake drainage reservoir construction and irrigated agricultural land development since the 1950 s is a very small et decrease of 0 33 we had to include also the impact of increased temperatures 0 55 since the 1950 s in our et modelling to obtain a non negative et change 4 6 over the poyang lake basin this is reasonably similar to the observed et increase 2 1 derived by water balance closure table 4 see also section 4 3 for discussion of this result in order to investigate to which extent our langbein method based results can be reproduced also with other et models we independently applied the thornthwaite method to quantify the et changes in response to land use changes and increased temperatures results indicated negligible differences of up to 0 3 in the modelled net effects of et comparing the two methods table s1 3 3 observed intra annual changes in water balance terms and rc the intra annual distributions of p were relatively similar during the pre dam period and the post dam period in all five sub catchments fig 3 a c e g and i with maximum values in may june and minimum values usually in december more specifically the monthly average p consistently peaked in june for xinjiang and xiushui in gaijang fuhe and rahoe p peaked in may during the pre dam period blue lines which was delayed until june in the post dam period red lines the intra annual distributions of r fig 3b d f h j in the pre dam period and the small differences between the pre dam blue lines and the post dam red lines periods followed almost exactly the same patterns as seen for p except for xiushui in the latter catchment there was a pronounced decrease in post dam r compared with pre dam r between april and june as well as a clear increase in post dam r between august and march fig 3j which could not have been driven by the relatively small changes seen in p fig 3i intra annual trends of change apart from those directly driven by p become apparent also in other catchments than xiushui when considering normalized distributions of rc r p fig 4 during the pre dam period all sub catchments had similar base line distributions of rc fig 4 blue bars generally the monthly rc reached a maximum in june or july it then decreased sharply reaching in most cases a minimum already in august just before the onset of the dry period the monthly rc then typically increased gradually over the year until next june or july except for some occasional drops in the winter period during the post dam period red bars the intra annual rc distributions exhibited shifts in a majority of the sub catchments but not all of them clear shifts were seen in ganjiang xinjiang and xiushui where post dam rc values were higher than pre dam values during the autumn and winter months august to february and lower during the summer months fig 4a c and e reflecting seasonal water storage in reservoirs see further section 4 1 this trend was most pronounced in xiushui were the monthly maximum rc shifted from july in the pre dam period to december in the post dam period and the minimum value shifted from january to june after reservoir regulation for fuhe and raohe there were no apparent intra annual redistribution of monthly rc between the pre dam and post dam periods fig 4b and d despite the fact that there was an approximately uniform decrease of monthly absolute rc values in fuhe 4 discussion 4 1 operational strategies of multi purpose reservoirs overall our results demonstrate that r shows strong positive correlation with local p in the poyang lake basin table 5 as one would expect in unregulated river systems however more detailed analysis of streamflow data is required to reveal the actual extent to which streamflow are impacted by various of reservoir operations as shown and discussed below we then consider reservoir water level data from 2017 fig 5 which is a year that had an average p deviating less than 2 from the long term average p 1953 2010 and which also had a seasonal distribution of p fig 5 red solid lines that was similar to long term conditions fig 5 red dashed lines not least in terms of the timing month of maximum p and minimum p 4 1 1 flood control during january to march april at the rising limb of the annual hydrographs precipitation gradually increased fig 5 red curves and water was released from the reservoirs in ganjiang xinjiang and xiushui see also shao et al 2017 to such an extent that the rwl clearly decreased fig 5a c d orange bars as a result rwl in these catchments showed a strong negative correlation with p table 5 which was significant for ganjiang where the wan an reservoir is located furthermore this impacted the rc values providing an explanation for the post dam rc increases relative to pre dam conditions fig 4 primarily in ganjiang and xiushui during the first quarter of the year more generally this reflects a period when the reservoir operations are focused on the early stage of flood control targets to facilitate sufficient storage volume to mitigate wet season floods reservoirs start to use the facilitated storage volume by allowing rwl increases and discharge reductions again as precipitation peaks in june fig 5 impounding of water and associated rwl increases usually occur until at least july or early autumn fig 5 after which p decreases this is a strategy similar to the three gorges dam china three gorges corporation ctg 2015 these reservoir operations for flood control purpose are estimated to decrease the reoccurrence of floods causing downstream damage from 5 or 10 years to at least 20 years up to 50 years in ganjiang and xiushui jiangxi province 2010 4 1 2 water supply for irrigation hydroelectricity and other operational targets in most tributary rivers flood control is just one of several operational purposes of the reservoirs table 1 for example the wan an reservoir operation schedule considers flood control see 4 1 1 hydroelectricity production with an annual average production over 1 5 billion kwh navigation support water storage for irrigation and various environmental goals notably the use of the wan an reservoir for water supply in the start of the dry season in early autumn is reflected in a slightly decreased the rwl fig 5a and increased the rc in the post dam period between august to april in ganjiang fig 4a a similar operational strategy in the dry season was implemented in xiushui as reflected by the runoff characteristics fig 3j and the relatively high post dam average value of monthly rc in winter time fig 4e that reflect net water releases from the zhelin reservoir as also independently noted by shao et al 2017 irrigation is another main target for reservoirs in poyang lake basin impacting rwl for example the da ao reservoir in xinjiang showed an rwl decrease in early in february which is consistent with early spring irrigation water needs when the minimum t increases over 5 c the sowing season starts for early spring crops such as various vegetable seeding in february and early rice in march furthermore water releases for agricultural water supply generally contribute to the observed decreases in rwl after august fig 5 for instance to meet the water requirements of the late season rice sowing in june and harvesting is in october and the oilseed rape sowing in september and harvesting in april some reservoirs have ambitious targets related to irrigation like the hongmen reservoir in fuhe which was intended to increase the supply of irrigation water to the gan fu plain by up to 7 presently fuhe occupies the largest proportion 17 of irrigated agricultural fields among the 5 considered sub catchments food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2016 consequently the water withdrawal in fuhe was considerable corresponding to about 30 of the annual total streamflow in the sub catchment zhang et al 2016 our results section 3 3 demonstrated that the annual average flows in fuhe showed a decreasing tendency over time during the study period 1953 2010 fig 2d this resulted in a clearly lower annual average rc value for the post dam period than for the pre dam period in fuhe fig 3b right most bars which is consistent with the considerable expansion of irrigated agriculture during this period our synthesis more generally shows that the multi purpose reservoirs are associated with non trivial scheduling that contribute to the observed complex fluctuations in rwl fig 5 and related impacts on rc fig 4 one aspect of this complexity is that reservoir schedules can differ considerably between different years in extreme drought years such as 1963 and 1978 the hongmen reservoir in fuhe has supplied water for residential water use despite the fact that the main objective of hongmen reservoir in fuhe is hydroelectricity table 1 another important aspect of the complexity is that the actual usage of the multi purpose reservoirs can differ considerably between different sub catchments depending on location specific needs that change over the year according to needs for water and food supply flood control energy production and environmental goals for instance in the communism reservoir in raohe the water needs for industry are considerable with water withdrawals for industrial use of over 3 million m3 every year despite its main operational goal being irrigation altogether the pronounced differences in multi purpose reservoir operation targets depending on season and location can largely explain the fact that seasonal hydrological characteristics in particular the rc values which before the construction of multi purpose reservoirs in the poyang lake basin were uniform across its sub catchments fig 4 blue bars presently exhibit significant spatial differences fig 4 red bars 4 2 et losses and overall water availability in the poyang lake basin our model supported interpretations of observational data showed that despite increased temperature construction of reservoirs and considerable irrigation expansion in the poyang lake basin during 1953 2010 the et has on average only increased marginally by about 2 section 3 2 and the basin average fraction of p lost through et remained essentially unchanged as shown by the rc value analysis section 3 1 this result contrasts to observations in many other world regions undergoing agricultural intensification for instance significant increases in et have been seen in agricultural regions of southern europe the middle east and central asia gordon et al 2008 karthe et al 2017 with probably the most notable example being the aral sea disaster largely caused by water demanding cotton cultivation jarsjö et al 2012 törnqvist and jarsjö 2012 a factor that likely has contributed to maintaining basin scale et losses at pre 1950 s levels in the poyang lake basin is the large scale drainage of wetlands and lakes after the 1950 s as shown in the results section this drainage has reduced the total area of natural surface waters which has compensated for the simultaneous increase in the area of reservoirs and irrigated fields apart from the here quantified impacts of surface water area changes other land use transitions can also have impacted the et losses after the 1950 s for instance despite the expansion of irrigated agriculture up to 14 of the cultivated land in the poyang lake basin has been lost due to e g urbanization and natural hazards between 1957 and 2002 zhao et al 2006 such changes which probably decrease basin scale et reflect accelerated cultivated land conversions in china as part of the agricultural structural changes that have taken place following the 1978 economic reforms on the other hand there are simultaneously occurring land use transitions that are likely to increase et such as the expansion of forest coverage of the poyang lake basin from about 40 in 1950 to a considerable 63 in 2010 jiangxi bureau of statistics jxbs 2016 whereas an unraveling of the detailed dynamics of these processes would be worth further studies we can through our present overall water balance quantifications show that the evaporation from the reservoirs as well as the increased et associated with irrigation expansion have had limited impact on the basin scale et under the historical hydroclimatic conditions of the poyang lake basin the long term basin scale net increase in et since the 1950 s has been limited to a couple of percent only 2 1 table 4 which e g is smaller than the estimated individual contribution from climate warming our calculated average post dam et increase of 2 1 for the poyang lake basin was based on an assumed negligible water storage change on the basin scale the actual year to year storage changes can mainly be related to weather driven differences in groundwater and surface water levels whereas the impact of annual differences in soil moisture is likely small e g zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 quantified the annual amplitudes of water storage within the poyang lake basin to be about 60 mm per year varying annually between 33 mm 92 mm during the period 2003 2016 this corresponds to about 7 of the annual average et in the poyang lake basin which indicates that the potential errors in estimating annual et of the poyang lake basin based on water balance closure falls within the reported method specific maximum errors of about 15 asokan et al 2010 the difference in basin scale water storage over a 20 year to 30 year period relevant for our comparison between pre dam and post dam conditions is likely to be much smaller than the annual fluctuations even in presence of climate change and land use change for example although the filling of reservoirs in the post dam period clearly constitutes a water storage change the effect is small on the estimated long term post dam et the reservoir filling volume is large in absolute terms 19 km3 however when averaged over the entire catchment area during the 25 year post dam period this volume corresponds to only 4 mm year or 0 5 of the estimated average post dam et the above discussed counteracting drivers of change may in part explain why the historical anthropogenic impacts on basin scale water flows and poyang lake water levels have been found to be relatively low for instance focusing on net effects on stream flow the quantitative assessment by ye et al 2013 indicated that relative effect of human activities in the whole poyang lake basin during the period 1970 2007 was only about one third of the effect of climate change in another study by mei et al 2015 the average contribution of human activities within the poyang lake catchment on the observed water level decrease of the lake was estimated to about 5 only looking ahead land drainage is no longer occurring within the poyang lake basin and have in some cases even been replaced by lake and wetland restauration zhang et al 2016 this means that a main driver acting to decrease basin scale et has been lost whereas drivers that act to increase et including agricultural expansion afforestation and continued construction of reservoirs are expected to remain and can even be expected to accelerate in the future cpc central committee and council 2010 present quantifications therefore imply that the net anthropogenic impacts on river flows and freshwater inputs to the poyang lake are likely to increase in the future the planned controversial poyang lake dam project aims at building a dam in the narrow northern channel that connects poyang lake with the yangtze river in order to alleviate impacts of droughts on the lake region the idea is to hinder excess outflow and pronounced lake level lowering that have occurred since the completion in 2003 of the upstream located tgd which have been caused by tgd related low water stands in the yangtze river zhang et al 2014 however the success of such a management strategy depends on the lake inflows from the drainage basin being sufficient to maintain lake water levels even during extended periods of droughts this implies that an understanding of basin internal processes may become increasingly important in the future regarding the basin s overlapping effects of human changes and climate change it may be useful to pay attention to impacts of re forestation in future studies the reason is that re forestation may occur over relatively large areas and since forests can have notable impacts on et there is a risk that basin scale runoff patterns can be impacted furthermore a particular challenge shared with many other lake and river basins of the world would be to increase the understanding of net impacts of different complex multi purpose dam regulation schemes which here were shown to cause pronounced regional hydrological differences among the five main sub catchments of the poyang lake hence a useful next step for future studies would be to systematically model the various impacts associated with the application of different conceivable reservoir operation rules e g lauri et al 2012 5 conclusions in contrast to many other regions subject to considerable land use change dam constructions irrigation expansion and climate change the annual average et r and rc r p runoff per unit precipitation of the poyang lake basin have remained essentially unchanged since the 1950 s throughout pre dam and post dam periods present model results show that this can be explained by the historical hydroclimatic conditions of the poyang lake basin under which the evaporation from the reservoirs as well as the increased et associated with irrigation expansion have limited impact on the basin scale et in addition basin wide implementation of lake to land transitions including wetland drainage since the 1950 s has had a dampening effect on the et increases this explains why several previous studies about the water resources of the basin have found anthropogenic impacts to be low we furthermore find that the observed modest et increases since the 1950 s can fully be attributed to the warmer climate in the region with continued climate warming it is hence likely the basin s et losses will increase in the future impacts of the multi purpose reservoir constructed since the 1950 s are complex in the pre dam period the monthly rc had similar intra annual distribution patterns in all sub catchments present results show that the operation schedules of the basin s multi purpose reservoirs have resulted in rwl fluctuations and intra annual rc patterns hydrological flow patterns that differ across the sub catchments the operations can be related to location specific conditions that change over the year according to needs for water and food supply flood control energy production and environmental goals the combined effect of these different sub catchment operations on the overall water resources of the poyang lake may therefore need to further attention the poyang lake has already witnessed an enhanced seasonal dryness that might have been aggravated by the tgd operation in the yangtze river successful management strategies under possible drought conditions will in the future be dependent on the inflows from the poyang lake basin rather than flows from the yangtze river such as the proposed poyang lake dam project the internal flows must be sufficient to maintain the lake water levels even during extended dry periods which implies that an increased

8363,study region karnali mohana karmo river basin western nepal study focus this study has developed a hydrological model using multi site calibration approach for a large basin the karnali mohana karmo in western nepal which has a lot of potential for water resources development and contribute to the national prosperity it further applies the model to characterize hydrology and water resources

reproducing the hydrological pattern the average flows and the flow duration curve at the outlet of the basin and five major sub basins new hydrological insights for this region the model simulated results showed that about 34 of average annual precipitation in the karmo basin is lost as evapotranspiration but with a large spatio temporal heterogeneity the hills and tarai are relatively wetter

spatial and temporal resolution is resource intensive therefore many countries are yet to reach to that level even though the coverage is improving over the years even if the coverage is adequate developing hydrological simulation models can provide reliable estimates for water yield and availability in a basin over a wide range of input watershed conditions under a variety of climatic scenarios spatial explicit hydrological models are particularly useful to evaluate impacts under various scenarios on water availability and distribution thapa et al 2017 furthermore the simulation models provide an excellent platform for evaluating various options for water and environmental planning such information is crucial for policy decision makers implementing agencies and practitioners to quantify different types of threats to water and environmental security design policies and programmes and devise strategies for better allocation utilization and management of freshwater resources sunsnik 2010 thapa et al 2017 as well as environmental protection for the country s prosperity the need for such a modelling system is stimulated and sometimes even enforced by many activities required by river basin planning and management halwatura and najim 2013 for example water balance studies in iran are customary for allocating budgets to water resource policies and projects ghandhari and alavi moghaddam 2011 it is therefore imperative to develop hydrological models for the basins of interest and apply to characterize spatio temporal distribution of hydrology and water resources western nepal is generally perceived as one of the poorest regions in the country with low literacy limited development high poverty very little market access and similar disadvantages pandey et al 2018 such perceptions reflect inadequate understanding of the untapped natural resources potential that the region has the karnali and mahakali basins in the region account for 28 of total available water resources in nepal pandey et al 2010 natural resources are also abundant and tourism potentials are also high with steep slopes and meandering rivers western nepal also offers tremendous potential for hydropower development there are 150 identified hydropower projects of various types including 19 storage projects under various stages of development with proposed installed capacity ranging from 0 5 to 6 720 megawatts mw iwmi 2018 total estimated installed capacity of all these projects is more than 21 000 mw implementing all these projects will contribute to energy security and fuel economic growth for national prosperity mohana basin with the catchment area of 3730 km2 is located in the south of the karnali basin originates from nepali churia hills and varies in topography from 113 to 1928 masl the mohana basin hosts at least 11 irrigation projects under operation with a total net command area of 26 583 hectares ha the net command area of the 11 projects vary from 155 ha to 15 800 ha an endangered species of ganges river dolphin platanista gangetica were recently reported to inhabit the mohana river it is therefore imperative to maintain a healthy aquatic environment in order to protect an endangered species despite having tremendous potentials of the region adequate development and management of water resources is yet to gain momentum for various reasons including inadequate scientific understanding on spatio temporal distributional of water availability there are several studies focusing on hydrological modelling at nepalese watersheds babel et al 2014 bajracharya et al 2018 bharati et al 2014 however only one dhami et al 2019 focuses on the karnali basin in the western nepal and none in the karnali mohana karmo basin fig 1 even the one focusing on the karnali has used limited number of stations for model calibration and has not characterized hydrology adequately from spatio temporal distribution perspective furthermore various hydrological models have been used over the time to reproduce hydrological patterns over a watershed some of them are empirical e g tank model sugawara 1979 while others are lumped e g hec hms feldman 2000 semi distributed e g swat arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 or fully distributed e g btopmc takeuchi et al 1999 however application for a specific purpose and for a typical study area depends upon several factors the soil and water assessment tool swat is widely used at different spatial scales to simulate hydrology soil erosion sedimentation and impacts studies among others aryal et al 2018 bajracharya et al 2018 bharati et al 2016 devkota and gyawali 2015 jeong et al 2010 the swat model is therefore selected in this study for hydrological simulation of the study basin many studies use swat model with calibration at only the outlet to characterize hydrology however in highly heterogeneous large basins such as karmo with basin area of 49 892 km2 it needs to be calibrated at multiple sites should we expect the model truly reproduce spatial heterogeneity in hydrological processes recent literatures e g hasan and pradhanang 2017 nkiaka et al 2018 pandey et al 2019 also put emphasis on multi variable multi site calibration approach considering the need to better represent spatial heterogeneity within the modelled watershed this study therefore aims to develop a hydrological model in swat environment for the karmo basin with multi site calibration approach and then apply it to characterize spatio temporal distribution in water availability across the basin the fully calibrated and validated hydrological model is then used for climate change impact assessment in forthcoming concurrent paper environmental flows assessment and evaluating trade offs among various water development pathways pakhtigian et al 2019 2 study area the karmo basin area above nepal india border covers 49 892 km2 of which 6 9 falls in the tibetan plateau china and the rest in western nepal the karnali river originates in tibetan plateau and trans himalayas trh at altitudes of 5500 m to 7726 m and flows through mountains mnt hills hil and indo gangetic plain igp as shown in figs 1 and 2 the river spans 230 km from the northern basin boundary to the chisapani station q280 in the south length of mainstream karnali river the smaller mohana river originates in churia hills of nepal descends through the terai and drains into karnali river at the nepal india border the watershed area of mohana alone above the nepal india border is 3730 km2 karnali has a dendritic stream network in most of the areas while mohana comprises of parallel stream network characterized by flash floods in the monsoon major tributaries of the karnali river are bheri thuli bheri seti mugu karnali and humla karnali the karmo basin has a wide spatial heterogeneity in biophysical and climatic characteristics the topographical variation ranges from 69 7 726 m above mean sea level masl fig 1 there are nine generic land use cover classes with dominance of forest cover about one third of the basin area fig 3 a and 21 soil types with dominance of gleic leptosol 34 2 of basin area fig 3b in the basin hydro climatic conditions also vary as evident from data at 36 meteorological stations from department of hydrology and meteorology dhm and six grid points from indian meteorological department imd fig 1 a database compiled by the digo jal bikas project http djb iwmi org shows that there are 127 hydropower projects ranging from 0 5 to 1003 megawatts mw at various stages of development in the karmo basin similarly 48 existing and one under construction irrigation projects are also located within the basin the net command area of these projects range from 100 98 026 ha there are ample prospects for future water resources development activities in the basin including tourism and therefore understanding spatio temporal distribution in water availability and implications of climate change cc is important for the stakeholders across various water use sectors 3 methodology and data fig 4 depicts the methodological flowchart and following sub sections describe them in detail 3 1 model overview swat is a process based hydrological model capable of simulating hydrology sediment transport vegetation growth and management practices in complex basins with varying soils land use cover and management conditions arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 conceptually swat divides a basin into sub basins and further into hydrologic response units hrus a stream channel connects the sub basins each hru represents a unique combination of a soil land use cover and slope type within a sub watershed the hydrologic cycle as simulated by swat is based on the water balance equation s w t s w o i 1 n r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where swt is final soil water content mm sw0 is initial soil water content mm t is time in days rday is amount of precipitation on day i mm qsurf is amount of surface runoff on day i mm ea is amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm wseep is amount of percolation on day i mm and qgw is amount of return flow on day i mm swat simulates water balance at the hru level and then aggregates into sub basin level subdivision of the basin into hrus enables it to reflect differences in evapotranspiration for various land cover crops and soils runoff is predicted separately for each sub basin and routed along the stream channel to obtain total runoff at the basin outlet such spatial representation increases accuracy and gives a much better physical description of the water balance arnold et al 1998 and srinivasan et al 1998 provide descriptions of the model 3 2 model set up spatially distributed data for topography fig 1 land use cover fig 3a and soil fig 3b were used as inputs to set up the model daily time series of observed meteorological variables at various locations fig 1 were taken from secondary sources as indicated in table 1 the climatic data were then pre processed to convert into swat compatible format precipitation and temperature were used in the same unit as collected from dhm in case of relative humidity two sets of observed data per day morning and evening were averaged and converted into a fraction before feeding into swat daily sunshine hours were converted into solar radiation mj m2 day using angstrom prescott ap model allen et al 1998 daily wind speed data available in km hr was converted into m s before using with swat arcswat2012 was used as a platform to set up swat model a threshold area of 3000 ha was defined to generate river network to capture spatial heterogeneity the basin was divided into 111 sub basins with areas ranging from 44 3183 km2 and hru area from 100 1000 km2 next 2122 hrus were defined using land use cover 2 soil type 5 and three slope classes 0 15 15 30 and more than 30 ten elevation bands at an interval of 500 m were defined to model snowmelt as well as orographic distribution of temperature and precipitation weather input was fed in the form of daily precipitation 78 stations maximum and minimum temperatures 19 stations relative humidity 15 stations wind speed 7 stations and sunshine hours 5 stations appendix b fig 1 scs curve number method was used to estimate surface runoff where daily curve number was estimated as a function of soil moisture the penman monteith method was used to estimate potential evapotranspiration pet variable storage method was adopted to route channel flow no point source discharge was defined eight existing irrigation projects were included as water abstraction points in the setup rice wheat maize cropping pattern was assigned as the representative cropping pattern in the sub basins of mohana 3 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out using swat cup which combines the latin hypercube lh and one factor at a time oat sampling van griensven 2005 in the oat approach one parameter values are changed at a time while keeping others constant twenty 20 model parameters table 2 were shortlisted for sensitivity analysis based on literature review e g bharati et al 2014 shrestha et al 2016 bajracharya et al 2018 dhami et al 2019 pandey et al 2019 and prior experience of the modelling team for each calibration point sensitivity of parameters for the sub watersheds upstream of the point is expected differ some parameters could be highly sensitive in some sub watersheds while other parameters in other sub watersheds therefore it is not possible to assign a sensitivity rank across the entire basin to the parameters 3 4 model calibration and validation multi station and multi variable calibration approach was adopted to better represent spatial heterogeneity in the karmo basin the calibration and validation was first performed at upstream stations and then gradually moved towards downstream stations once calibrated sub basins above upstream stations were locked and model parameters were not changed the swat model was calibrated and validated against daily and monthly observed flows at 10 hydrological stations shown in fig 2 please refer appendix a for details of the stations along five major tributaries in karmo basin three stations q215 q250 and q280 are in the karnali main river two q265 and q270 in bheri three q259 2 q256 5 and q260 in seti one q 220 in tila one q 283 3 in mohana stations were selected to represent upstream downstream conditions in each tributary to analyse spatial variation in model performance the calibrated and validation periods considered are 1995 2002 and 2003 2009 respectively for six stations i e q220 q250 q259 2 q265 q270 a280 whereas varying periods for other stations based on availability of good quality and continuous time series appendix b a warm up period of three years was used to develop appropriate soil and groundwater conditions the model was calibrated in three stages i sensitivity analysis ii auto calibration and iii manual calibration after sensitivity analysis swat cup was used for auto calibration the model was run for 1000 iterations initially to narrow down the range of values for the sensitive parameters then auto calibration results were further subjected to manual calibration based on knowledge of the basin during manual calibration adjustments were made firstly to those parameters which were most sensitive and then moving to the less sensitive ones observed and simulated flows were visually compared in terms of the hydrographs peak time to peak shape of the hydrograph and baseflow scatter plots flow duration curve statistical parameters and water accumulation to evaluate and improve model performance during manual calibration following statistical parameters were considered mean coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias details of these methods are available in nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 1999 and moriasi et al 2007 the model performance was evaluated for both monthly and daily simulations due care was given to keep physically based parameters within a reasonable range table 2 throughout the calibration process 3 5 data and sources both geo spatial and time series data reflecting biophysical hydro climatic and future climatic contexts are required in this study they were collected from local and global sources as described in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of swat model the swat model is calibrated and validated at 10 hydrological stations fig 2 spread across five major tributaries of the karmo basin namely karnali main bheri seti tila and mohana the calibrated parameter values are listed in table 3 the number of parameters calibrated varies across the sub basins from 6 in q280 to 18 in q283 5 depending upon their sensitivity table 3 the sensitive parameters were not consistent across the sub basins however baseflow recession factor alpha bf curve number cn2 and groundwater delay gw delay were among the most sensitive parameters for most of the sub basins the level of influence of those parameters to the results however varied from one to another sub basin the model under estimated baseflow with default swat parameter values therefore cn2 was fine tuned to increase infiltration and subsequent increase in groundwater contribution to the baseflow values of alpha bf was adjusted based on visual inspection of shape of the recession limb of hydrograph similarly other flow related parameters such as soil depth sol z available capacity of soil moisture sol awc saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k soil evaporation compensation factor esco and lateral flow travel time lattime among others were adjusted to match simulated and observed flows as well as reasonably approximate the water balance components defining elevation bands allowed for variable temperature laps rate tlaps and precipitation laps rate plaps to account for spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation the model performance within major tributaries is discussed hereunder at each station a summary plot as shown in fig 5 was prepared to compare fit of hydrological simulation at daily and monthly scales scattering of observed versus simulated points from the mean model capability to reproduce flow duration curve fdc and model performance indicators 4 1 1 karnali main stations three hydrological stations located in upstream mid stream and downstream points of the karnali main are considered at q215 lalighat upstream of karnali main observed data for 1995 2004 are available so calibration and validation periods are shorter than for other stations in fig 6 a it is clear that the model is not fully capturing extremes both high and low flows the inadequate capturing of low flows holds true for both snowmelt and non snow melt seasons therefore relatively larger size of the basin area 15 200 km2 with only one hydrological station snowmelt contribution as key source of inflow but relatively weak snowmelt module of swat could be attributed as potential reasons for lower performance on capturing low flows furthermore the issue is more prominent for the years 1999 2003 whereas low flows is reproduced well for other years as evident from monthly hydrograph it indicates that data quality can also be a potential reason for overall low performance of the model for the low flows similarly for high flows too except for few years e g 1997 1998 2000 and 2004 it is reproduced reasonably same reasons for low flows may hold true for low performance in high flows for selected years as well there is a wide range scattering of the observed simulation dots indicating relatively weaker performance as well as underestimation of high flows nevertheless average flow conditions are reproduced to a good extent with bias of around 16 fig 6a the nse is 0 6 for calibration and more than 0 7 for validation period for daily simulation the values at over 0 8 are better for the monthly simulation at the mid stream of the karnali main i e at q250 benighat daily observed data for the period of 1995 2009 are available hydrological patterns for daily and monthly flows are reasonably reproduced r2 for daily and monthly simulation are 0 83 and 0 91 for calibration and better for validation nse values are 0 75 and 0 82 for daily and monthly calibration scatter points lie closer to the centerline but still reflects under estimation for high flows as q250 is at downstream of q215 in the karnali main the reasons for q215 holds true for q250 as well therefore the snowmelt as dominant source of input but relatively weaker snow module in swat and data quality could be attributed as potential reasons for note capturing high flows across all the years the pbias for average flow simulation is around 20 for calibration and 24 for validation higher bias than upstream station can be expected as errors from upstream sub basins propagate downstream downstream of the karnali main i e at q280 chisapani daily and monthly flows are simulated for the period of 1995 2009 the simulated hydrographs correspond to the precipitation pattern and reasonably reproduce hydrological regime as well as fdc fig 5 the higher flows are again underestimated most likely due to cumulative error in the upstream sub basins however average flows are well reproduced with pbias of around 15 for both calibration and validation periods nse values during calibration are 0 84 for daily and 0 94 for monthly simulation and during validation are over 0 84 for both time scales considering all stations along the karnali main river the model is better suited for application based on average flows than for evaluation of extreme events such as high and low flow periods 4 1 2 bheri sub basin simulated hydrographs at the two stations in bheri sub basin upstream at q265 rimna and downstream at q270 jamu are comparable with observed for daily as well as monthly simulations for the period of 1995 2009 at q265 as shown in fig 6c the long term average flow is underestimated by less than 1 for calibration and by 18 8 for validation periods however mostly high flows are underestimated while low flows are reasonably reproduced the nse for calibration and validation of daily flows are 0 83 and 0 66 respectively with better performance for monthly simulation the r2 values are also over 0 8 for both calibration and validation at q270 as shown in fig 6d flow patterns as indicated by hydrographs and fdc as well as average flow conditions are well reproduced with a long term average bias of only 13 during calibration and 8 8 during validation for the daily flows the nse and r2 for all cases are over 0 8 and except daily validation period for which nse and r2 are 0 76 and 0 78 respectively as at the stations along the karnali main low and average flow are better simulated than high flows 4 1 3 seti sub basin the swat model in the seti sub basin is evaluated at three stations located in upstream at q259 2 ghopa ghat at q256 5 budhi ganga and downstream at q260 bangna as shown in fig 2 at the upstream station q259 2 simulated hydrographs correspond well to precipitation pattern and reproduce observed daily as well as monthly flows there is slight underestimation of long term average flows by less than 5 during calibration and 10 during validation fig 6e the fdc is well reproduced the nse is 0 8 for daily and 0 9 for monthly simulations the r2 values are also in the same range as nse in case of q256 5 i e in budhi ganga hydrograph patterns as well as fdc are reproduced reasonably with a slight underestimation of long term average flows by less than 3 for daily as well as monthly simulations fig 6f the r2 and nse values are 0 68 for daily simulation and over 0 86 for monthly however there is relatively wide scattering of observed simulated dots thus reflecting a wider variation in simulated values at the downstream q260 very close to the outlet of seti the simulated and observed hydrographs as well as fdcs match closely unlike other stations in karnali and seti at q260 simulations slightly over estimate long term average flows by 6 5 during calibration and around 10 during validation fig 6g the downstream hrus generate enough runoff to compensate the flow underestimation in upstream indicating more contribution of the downstream hrus to the flow at the basin outlet land and water management practices in these downstream hrus therefore can have a significant impact on water availability in the sub basin the evaluation at three stations suggest that the model is capable of reproducing hydrological regime and average flow conditions in the seti 4 1 4 mohana sub basin simulated and observed hydrographs at q283 5 located in pathriya a tributary of mohana was made for swat performance in mohana very limited reliable data from 2001 to 2003 is available at this station due to the seasonal flash floods in the region hydrological stations in mohana have been difficult to maintain and monitor for continuous long term data as per our personal communication with dhm as indicated by hydrograph and fdc in fig 6h the flow pattern is reproduced well with long term average flows underestimated by less than 10 for both daily and monthly simulations the nse and r2 for calibration are also over 0 8 for monthly simulation even though it drops down to about 0 6 for daily flows the scattering of simulated observed dots is very high which indicates less reliability in simulated flow pattern across all the seasons even though long term average is reproduced reasonably however considering potential errors in hydrological data collection in the southern rivers like mohana the performance can be considered as acceptable 4 1 5 tila sub basin the model performance at tila is evaluated at q220 station for the simulation period of 1995 2009 the hydrograph pattern is reproduced satisfactorily with same nse and r2 values of 0 6 and 0 7 for daily and monthly calibrations respectively fig 6b the long term average flow is slightly underestimated by 0 6 during calibration the scatter plot indicates good model fit with dots aligned along the central line the fdc is well reproduced compared to other sub basins the calibrated swat model is capable of reproducing average as well as high flow conditions in the tila 4 2 spatial distribution of water balance fig 7 depicts sub basin wide distribution of major water balance components average annual p aet and net water yield within the karmo basin as simulated by the model for the hydrological baseline period 1995 2009 the net water yield nwy refers to a combination of surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow with deduction in transmission losses and pond abstractions arnold et al 1998 the average annual p over the entire basin is 1375 mm net water yield is 927 mm the average annual aet over the entire basin is 474 mm which is about 34 of the average annual p it however varies across the regions the water balance components vary spatially across the sub basins with pattern matching the geographical regions of northern trans himalayas trh mountains mnt hills hil and southern tarai flatland which is a part of indo gangetic plan igp the precipitation varies from less than 500 mm to above 2000 mm across the 111 sub basins fig 7a fig 8 depicts variation in the average annual precipitation aet and nwy in different geographical regions in the study basin the error bars indicate the maximum minimum range for each parameter with the specific region the mnt p 1435 mm hil p 1625 mm and igp p 1566 mm regions of the basin are relatively wetter compared to the trh p 875 mm region fig 8 the values of the water balance components across the sub basins in all the geographical regions vary widely as shown in fig 8 similarly the average annual aet across the sub basins varies from less than 200 mm to over 650 mm fig 7b the aet value are higher in the hil 587 mm and igp 553 mm regions compared to other two regions fig 8 owing to greater area under cultivation and proximity to the oceanfront and equator especially in case of igp furthermore due to large forest covers and greenery in the hil aet is expected to be higher the aet decreases as we move to the sub basins from the southern plains to the northern trans himalayan regions fig 7b as temperature decreases with altitude this trend is comparable with the case of koshi river basin in the eastern nepal in which too aet increases from igp towards the trh region bharati et al 2019 the aet in hil mnt and trh regions are 587 mm 528 mm and 227 mm respectively the aet as percentage of p in trh mnt hil and igp regions are 26 37 36 and 35 respectively the distribution pattern of aet also follows that of precipitation which is the major source of moisture in the western nepal long term average nwy in the form of discharge at the sub basin outlet varies across the sub basins from 1 1 to 1 357 5 m3 s where sub basin areas range from 44 to 3183 km2 the nwy across the karmo sub basins varies from less than 450 mm to above 1150 mm fig 7c in terms of geographical regions the long term average nwy aggregated over the region decreases as we move upstream from hil to trh with values of 1105 mm in hil 961 mm in mnt and 587 mm in trh fig 8 in fifty or 45 sub basins nwy are more than 80 of p and in 101 or 91 sub basins the nwy are more than half of p the surface runoff has the dominant contribution in the net water yield across most of the sub basins whereas contribution of groundwater and lateral flow varies two third of the sub basins have more than one third contribution from surface runoff and rest from other components in 28 of the sub basins contribution of surface runoff is above 50 the groundwater contribution to the net water yield is less than one third in 105 or 94 6 sub basins and less than one quarter in 93 or 83 8 sub basins it is to be noted that direct comparison in terms of absolute values may not provide critical insights as the sub basin sizes vary largely from 44 to 3183 km2 the sum of nwy and aet are different than p in all the regions primarily because nwy is not simply the difference between p and aet but it refers to a combination of surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow with deduction in transmission losses and pond abstractions the net water yield does not always follow the precipitation pattern but it gets affected by factors such as rainfall intensity soil properties and land use cover characteristics bharati et al 2019 therefore nwy is actually higher than the difference between p and aet in the entire basin as well as some regions e g mnt hil and igp and lower in other region i e trh as evident in fig 8 due to various reasons such issues are evident in other studies as well such as in the koshi basin eastern nepal bharati et al 2019 in the trh region change in storage the collective term including groundwater recharge change in soil moisture storage in the vadose zone and model inaccuracies is 7 positive of the precipitation rainfall and snowmelt ideally the change in storage in the entire basin as well as regions are supposed to be near to zero for a long term average the positive value of change in storage may reflect that not all the precipitation ina year in the trh region is contributing to streamflow part of that may have been lost in the form of infiltration through steep hills covered with snows which may re emerge as lateral flow in the downstream in the basin and major part of the remaining precipitation could have been stored in the trh region itself in the form of snow accumulation similarly in mnt and hil regions change in storage are around 4 negative of the precipitation reflecting that nwy is higher than the difference between p and aet it is likely that the nwy in the mnt and hil regions gets contribution from snowmelt and lateral flow emerging from the percolation of precipitation in the trh region when moving further downward in the igp the southern plain of the basin the change in storage is still negative but with only 2 7 in this region potential contributors to the excess nwy to p aet could be lateral flow as well as fluctuation in groundwater table as igp is a part of large groundwater aquifer shared by both india and nepal and extends beyond the hydrological boundary both inflow as well as outflow of groundwater from to the basin is possible depending upon situation finally average change in storage of the entire basin is 1 9 negative the deficit of precipitation in the basin to contribute to nwy might have been compensated from fluctuation in groundwater table inflow of groundwater from other part of the aquifer extending beyond the karmo basin boundary and snowmelt contribution in the upstream of the basin though the model results are reasonable at the basin major sub basins as well as a regional scales and useful for planning purpose model accuracy related and data related limitations are certainly embedded in the simulation results therefore results for the small sub basins located far from the calibration points should be used cautiously because of possible low confidence in results due to calibration and validation of the model at limited number of stations 4 3 temporal distribution of water balance the monthly average water balance for the baseline period shows a large temporal variation fig 9 the precipitation p is taken as a sum of rainfall and snowmelt p is taken as observed value while snowmelt which accounts of 11 of total precipitation is the model simulated value mean seasonal distribution of p in karmo varies from 68 mm in the post monsoon on season to 1098 mm in the monsoon jjas aet is related to p land use cover as well as temperature mean seasonal distribution of aet in the basin varies from 23 mm in the winter djf season to 290 mm in the monsoon season and nyw too varies across the season from 72 mm in the winter to 654 mm in the monsoon season the nwy does not always follow the p patterns because it is also affected by precipitation intensity soil properties subsurface storage and land use cover for example rain falling with high intensity on bare and compacted soils will produce higher runoff than longer precipitation events on deep soils and cropped areas bharati et al 2014 the results still show that the monsoon is the main hydrological driver as all the water balance components i e p aet and nwy are highest during the monsoon the monsoon season jjas contribution is 73 61 and 71 in the average annual p aet and nwy respectively at the karmo outlet fig 9 which is comparable to values obtained by bookhagen and burbank 2010 as per the results from swat simulation average annual flow volume at the basin outlet under the current climatic scenarios is 46 250 million cubic meters mcm 71 of which is available during jjas the monsoon season contribution varies across the sub basins from 63 at the outlet of q220 to 68 at q215 71 at q270 and 73 at q260 please refer fig 2 for the locations the δ storage is negative in the monsoon jjas season with the absolute value of 17 mm indicating recharge to aquifer or add to the storage and positive in the post monsoon until december and then becomes negative from january onwards albeit with minimal values the highest positive value of 91 mm in the post monsoon on season indicates groundwater contribution to streamflow which might have appeared as a result of recharge during the monsoon season jjas and discharge of that recharge water in the post monsoon similarly minimal negative values from january onwards can be explained as the result of winter precipitation 5 conclusions this study discretized the karnali mohana karmo basin in western nepal into 111 sub basins and developed a hydrological model in swat using multi site calibration approach to characterize spatio temporal distribution in water availability the model was reasonably calibrated and validated using visual inspection of hydrological pattern as well as statistical indicators for average flows and biases the annual average precipitation p of the karmo basin is estimated as 1375 mm and actual evapotranspiration aet is 34 approximately of the p but with a large spatio temporal heterogeneity the p across the sub basins vary from less than 500 mm to above 2000 mm the mountain hill and tarai a part of indo gangetic plain regions are relatively wetter compared to the trans himalayan and tibetan plateau regions the aet on the other hand varies from less than 200 mm to over 650 mm which decreases as we move to the sub basins from southern plains to the northern trans himalayan regions and average annual flow volume at the basin outlet under the baseline scenario is 46 250 million cubic meters mcm and the discharge at the sub basin outlets vary from 1 1 to 1 357 5 m3 s majority of p in most of the sub basins flow out as river discharge or net water yield nwy the surface runoff has the dominant contribution in nwy across most of the sub basins whereas contribution of groundwater and later flow varies in terms of seasons p varies from 68 mm post monsoon to 1098 mm monsoon aet from 23 mm winter to 290 mm monsoon and nwy from 72 mm winter to 654 mm monsoon the monsoon season jjas contribution is 73 61 and 71 in the average annual p aet and nwy respectively at the karmo outlet these model results are adopted for developing national irrigation master plans estimating environmental flows and evaluating trade offs among various future water development pathways furthermore the model is used for climate change impact assessment part b of this paper the model results are therefore valuable for water resources planners and managers for developing location

8363,study region karnali mohana karmo river basin western nepal study focus this study has developed a hydrological model using multi site calibration approach for a large basin the karnali mohana karmo in western nepal which has a lot of potential for water resources development and contribute to the national prosperity it further applies the model to characterize hydrology and water resources availability across spatio temporal scales to enhance understanding on water availability and potential uses the newly developed hydrological model in soil and water assessment tool swat is capable of reproducing the hydrological pattern the average flows and the flow duration curve at the outlet of the basin and five major sub basins new hydrological insights for this region the model simulated results showed that about 34 of average annual precipitation in the karmo basin is lost as evapotranspiration but with a large spatio temporal heterogeneity the hills and tarai are relatively wetter than the mountains the average annual flow volume at the basin outlet is estimated as 46 250 million cubic meters mcm the hydrological characterization made in this study are further used for climate change impact assessment part b in the same journal environmental flows assessment and evaluating trade offs among various water development pathways which are published elsewhere this model therefore

spatial and temporal resolution is resource intensive therefore many countries are yet to reach to that level even though the coverage is improving over the years even if the coverage is adequate developing hydrological simulation models can provide reliable estimates for water yield and availability in a basin over a wide range of input watershed conditions under a variety of climatic scenarios spatial explicit hydrological models are particularly useful to evaluate impacts under various scenarios on water availability and distribution thapa et al 2017 furthermore the simulation models provide an excellent platform for evaluating various options for water and environmental planning such information is crucial for policy decision makers implementing agencies and practitioners to quantify different types of threats to water and environmental security design policies and programmes and devise strategies for better allocation utilization and management of freshwater resources sunsnik 2010 thapa et al 2017 as well as environmental protection for the country s prosperity the need for such a modelling system is stimulated and sometimes even enforced by many activities required by river basin planning and management halwatura and najim 2013 for example water balance studies in iran are customary for allocating budgets to water resource policies and projects ghandhari and alavi moghaddam 2011 it is therefore imperative to develop hydrological models for the basins of interest and apply to characterize spatio temporal distribution of hydrology and water resources western nepal is generally perceived as one of the poorest regions in the country with low literacy limited development high poverty very little market access and similar disadvantages pandey et al 2018 such perceptions reflect inadequate understanding of the untapped natural resources potential that the region has the karnali and mahakali basins in the region account for 28 of total available water resources in nepal pandey et al 2010 natural resources are also abundant and tourism potentials are also high with steep slopes and meandering rivers western nepal also offers tremendous potential for hydropower development there are 150 identified hydropower projects of various types including 19 storage projects under various stages of development with proposed installed capacity ranging from 0 5 to 6 720 megawatts mw iwmi 2018 total estimated installed capacity of all these projects is more than 21 000 mw implementing all these projects will contribute to energy security and fuel economic growth for national prosperity mohana basin with the catchment area of 3730 km2 is located in the south of the karnali basin originates from nepali churia hills and varies in topography from 113 to 1928 masl the mohana basin hosts at least 11 irrigation projects under operation with a total net command area of 26 583 hectares ha the net command area of the 11 projects vary from 155 ha to 15 800 ha an endangered species of ganges river dolphin platanista gangetica were recently reported to inhabit the mohana river it is therefore imperative to maintain a healthy aquatic environment in order to protect an endangered species despite having tremendous potentials of the region adequate development and management of water resources is yet to gain momentum for various reasons including inadequate scientific understanding on spatio temporal distributional of water availability there are several studies focusing on hydrological modelling at nepalese watersheds babel et al 2014 bajracharya et al 2018 bharati et al 2014 however only one dhami et al 2019 focuses on the karnali basin in the western nepal and none in the karnali mohana karmo basin fig 1 even the one focusing on the karnali has used limited number of stations for model calibration and has not characterized hydrology adequately from spatio temporal distribution perspective furthermore various hydrological models have been used over the time to reproduce hydrological patterns over a watershed some of them are empirical e g tank model sugawara 1979 while others are lumped e g hec hms feldman 2000 semi distributed e g swat arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 or fully distributed e g btopmc takeuchi et al 1999 however application for a specific purpose and for a typical study area depends upon several factors the soil and water assessment tool swat is widely used at different spatial scales to simulate hydrology soil erosion sedimentation and impacts studies among others aryal et al 2018 bajracharya et al 2018 bharati et al 2016 devkota and gyawali 2015 jeong et al 2010 the swat model is therefore selected in this study for hydrological simulation of the study basin many studies use swat model with calibration at only the outlet to characterize hydrology however in highly heterogeneous large basins such as karmo with basin area of 49 892 km2 it needs to be calibrated at multiple sites should we expect the model truly reproduce spatial heterogeneity in hydrological processes recent literatures e g hasan and pradhanang 2017 nkiaka et al 2018 pandey et al 2019 also put emphasis on multi variable multi site calibration approach considering the need to better represent spatial heterogeneity within the modelled watershed this study therefore aims to develop a hydrological model in swat environment for the karmo basin with multi site calibration approach and then apply it to characterize spatio temporal distribution in water availability across the basin the fully calibrated and validated hydrological model is then used for climate change impact assessment in forthcoming concurrent paper environmental flows assessment and evaluating trade offs among various water development pathways pakhtigian et al 2019 2 study area the karmo basin area above nepal india border covers 49 892 km2 of which 6 9 falls in the tibetan plateau china and the rest in western nepal the karnali river originates in tibetan plateau and trans himalayas trh at altitudes of 5500 m to 7726 m and flows through mountains mnt hills hil and indo gangetic plain igp as shown in figs 1 and 2 the river spans 230 km from the northern basin boundary to the chisapani station q280 in the south length of mainstream karnali river the smaller mohana river originates in churia hills of nepal descends through the terai and drains into karnali river at the nepal india border the watershed area of mohana alone above the nepal india border is 3730 km2 karnali has a dendritic stream network in most of the areas while mohana comprises of parallel stream network characterized by flash floods in the monsoon major tributaries of the karnali river are bheri thuli bheri seti mugu karnali and humla karnali the karmo basin has a wide spatial heterogeneity in biophysical and climatic characteristics the topographical variation ranges from 69 7 726 m above mean sea level masl fig 1 there are nine generic land use cover classes with dominance of forest cover about one third of the basin area fig 3 a and 21 soil types with dominance of gleic leptosol 34 2 of basin area fig 3b in the basin hydro climatic conditions also vary as evident from data at 36 meteorological stations from department of hydrology and meteorology dhm and six grid points from indian meteorological department imd fig 1 a database compiled by the digo jal bikas project http djb iwmi org shows that there are 127 hydropower projects ranging from 0 5 to 1003 megawatts mw at various stages of development in the karmo basin similarly 48 existing and one under construction irrigation projects are also located within the basin the net command area of these projects range from 100 98 026 ha there are ample prospects for future water resources development activities in the basin including tourism and therefore understanding spatio temporal distribution in water availability and implications of climate change cc is important for the stakeholders across various water use sectors 3 methodology and data fig 4 depicts the methodological flowchart and following sub sections describe them in detail 3 1 model overview swat is a process based hydrological model capable of simulating hydrology sediment transport vegetation growth and management practices in complex basins with varying soils land use cover and management conditions arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 conceptually swat divides a basin into sub basins and further into hydrologic response units hrus a stream channel connects the sub basins each hru represents a unique combination of a soil land use cover and slope type within a sub watershed the hydrologic cycle as simulated by swat is based on the water balance equation s w t s w o i 1 n r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where swt is final soil water content mm sw0 is initial soil water content mm t is time in days rday is amount of precipitation on day i mm qsurf is amount of surface runoff on day i mm ea is amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm wseep is amount of percolation on day i mm and qgw is amount of return flow on day i mm swat simulates water balance at the hru level and then aggregates into sub basin level subdivision of the basin into hrus enables it to reflect differences in evapotranspiration for various land cover crops and soils runoff is predicted separately for each sub basin and routed along the stream channel to obtain total runoff at the basin outlet such spatial representation increases accuracy and gives a much better physical description of the water balance arnold et al 1998 and srinivasan et al 1998 provide descriptions of the model 3 2 model set up spatially distributed data for topography fig 1 land use cover fig 3a and soil fig 3b were used as inputs to set up the model daily time series of observed meteorological variables at various locations fig 1 were taken from secondary sources as indicated in table 1 the climatic data were then pre processed to convert into swat compatible format precipitation and temperature were used in the same unit as collected from dhm in case of relative humidity two sets of observed data per day morning and evening were averaged and converted into a fraction before feeding into swat daily sunshine hours were converted into solar radiation mj m2 day using angstrom prescott ap model allen et al 1998 daily wind speed data available in km hr was converted into m s before using with swat arcswat2012 was used as a platform to set up swat model a threshold area of 3000 ha was defined to generate river network to capture spatial heterogeneity the basin was divided into 111 sub basins with areas ranging from 44 3183 km2 and hru area from 100 1000 km2 next 2122 hrus were defined using land use cover 2 soil type 5 and three slope classes 0 15 15 30 and more than 30 ten elevation bands at an interval of 500 m were defined to model snowmelt as well as orographic distribution of temperature and precipitation weather input was fed in the form of daily precipitation 78 stations maximum and minimum temperatures 19 stations relative humidity 15 stations wind speed 7 stations and sunshine hours 5 stations appendix b fig 1 scs curve number method was used to estimate surface runoff where daily curve number was estimated as a function of soil moisture the penman monteith method was used to estimate potential evapotranspiration pet variable storage method was adopted to route channel flow no point source discharge was defined eight existing irrigation projects were included as water abstraction points in the setup rice wheat maize cropping pattern was assigned as the representative cropping pattern in the sub basins of mohana 3 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out using swat cup which combines the latin hypercube lh and one factor at a time oat sampling van griensven 2005 in the oat approach one parameter values are changed at a time while keeping others constant twenty 20 model parameters table 2 were shortlisted for sensitivity analysis based on literature review e g bharati et al 2014 shrestha et al 2016 bajracharya et al 2018 dhami et al 2019 pandey et al 2019 and prior experience of the modelling team for each calibration point sensitivity of parameters for the sub watersheds upstream of the point is expected differ some parameters could be highly sensitive in some sub watersheds while other parameters in other sub watersheds therefore it is not possible to assign a sensitivity rank across the entire basin to the parameters 3 4 model calibration and validation multi station and multi variable calibration approach was adopted to better represent spatial heterogeneity in the karmo basin the calibration and validation was first performed at upstream stations and then gradually moved towards downstream stations once calibrated sub basins above upstream stations were locked and model parameters were not changed the swat model was calibrated and validated against daily and monthly observed flows at 10 hydrological stations shown in fig 2 please refer appendix a for details of the stations along five major tributaries in karmo basin three stations q215 q250 and q280 are in the karnali main river two q265 and q270 in bheri three q259 2 q256 5 and q260 in seti one q 220 in tila one q 283 3 in mohana stations were selected to represent upstream downstream conditions in each tributary to analyse spatial variation in model performance the calibrated and validation periods considered are 1995 2002 and 2003 2009 respectively for six stations i e q220 q250 q259 2 q265 q270 a280 whereas varying periods for other stations based on availability of good quality and continuous time series appendix b a warm up period of three years was used to develop appropriate soil and groundwater conditions the model was calibrated in three stages i sensitivity analysis ii auto calibration and iii manual calibration after sensitivity analysis swat cup was used for auto calibration the model was run for 1000 iterations initially to narrow down the range of values for the sensitive parameters then auto calibration results were further subjected to manual calibration based on knowledge of the basin during manual calibration adjustments were made firstly to those parameters which were most sensitive and then moving to the less sensitive ones observed and simulated flows were visually compared in terms of the hydrographs peak time to peak shape of the hydrograph and baseflow scatter plots flow duration curve statistical parameters and water accumulation to evaluate and improve model performance during manual calibration following statistical parameters were considered mean coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias details of these methods are available in nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 1999 and moriasi et al 2007 the model performance was evaluated for both monthly and daily simulations due care was given to keep physically based parameters within a reasonable range table 2 throughout the calibration process 3 5 data and sources both geo spatial and time series data reflecting biophysical hydro climatic and future climatic contexts are required in this study they were collected from local and global sources as described in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of swat model the swat model is calibrated and validated at 10 hydrological stations fig 2 spread across five major tributaries of the karmo basin namely karnali main bheri seti tila and mohana the calibrated parameter values are listed in table 3 the number of parameters calibrated varies across the sub basins from 6 in q280 to 18 in q283 5 depending upon their sensitivity table 3 the sensitive parameters were not consistent across the sub basins however baseflow recession factor alpha bf curve number cn2 and groundwater delay gw delay were among the most sensitive parameters for most of the sub basins the level of influence of those parameters to the results however varied from one to another sub basin the model under estimated baseflow with default swat parameter values therefore cn2 was fine tuned to increase infiltration and subsequent increase in groundwater contribution to the baseflow values of alpha bf was adjusted based on visual inspection of shape of the recession limb of hydrograph similarly other flow related parameters such as soil depth sol z available capacity of soil moisture sol awc saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k soil evaporation compensation factor esco and lateral flow travel time lattime among others were adjusted to match simulated and observed flows as well as reasonably approximate the water balance components defining elevation bands allowed for variable temperature laps rate tlaps and precipitation laps rate plaps to account for spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation the model performance within major tributaries is discussed hereunder at each station a summary plot as shown in fig 5 was prepared to compare fit of hydrological simulation at daily and monthly scales scattering of observed versus simulated points from the mean model capability to reproduce flow duration curve fdc and model performance indicators 4 1 1 karnali main stations three hydrological stations located in upstream mid stream and downstream points of the karnali main are considered at q215 lalighat upstream of karnali main observed data for 1995 2004 are available so calibration and validation periods are shorter than for other stations in fig 6 a it is clear that the model is not fully capturing extremes both high and low flows the inadequate capturing of low flows holds true for both snowmelt and non snow melt seasons therefore relatively larger size of the basin area 15 200 km2 with only one hydrological station snowmelt contribution as key source of inflow but relatively weak snowmelt module of swat could be attributed as potential reasons for lower performance on capturing low flows furthermore the issue is more prominent for the years 1999 2003 whereas low flows is reproduced well for other years as evident from monthly hydrograph it indicates that data quality can also be a potential reason for overall low performance of the model for the low flows similarly for high flows too except for few years e g 1997 1998 2000 and 2004 it is reproduced reasonably same reasons for low flows may hold true for low performance in high flows for selected years as well there is a wide range scattering of the observed simulation dots indicating relatively weaker performance as well as underestimation of high flows nevertheless average flow conditions are reproduced to a good extent with bias of around 16 fig 6a the nse is 0 6 for calibration and more than 0 7 for validation period for daily simulation the values at over 0 8 are better for the monthly simulation at the mid stream of the karnali main i e at q250 benighat daily observed data for the period of 1995 2009 are available hydrological patterns for daily and monthly flows are reasonably reproduced r2 for daily and monthly simulation are 0 83 and 0 91 for calibration and better for validation nse values are 0 75 and 0 82 for daily and monthly calibration scatter points lie closer to the centerline but still reflects under estimation for high flows as q250 is at downstream of q215 in the karnali main the reasons for q215 holds true for q250 as well therefore the snowmelt as dominant source of input but relatively weaker snow module in swat and data quality could be attributed as potential reasons for note capturing high flows across all the years the pbias for average flow simulation is around 20 for calibration and 24 for validation higher bias than upstream station can be expected as errors from upstream sub basins propagate downstream downstream of the karnali main i e at q280 chisapani daily and monthly flows are simulated for the period of 1995 2009 the simulated hydrographs correspond to the precipitation pattern and reasonably reproduce hydrological regime as well as fdc fig 5 the higher flows are again underestimated most likely due to cumulative error in the upstream sub basins however average flows are well reproduced with pbias of around 15 for both calibration and validation periods nse values during calibration are 0 84 for daily and 0 94 for monthly simulation and during validation are over 0 84 for both time scales considering all stations along the karnali main river the model is better suited for application based on average flows than for evaluation of extreme events such as high and low flow periods 4 1 2 bheri sub basin simulated hydrographs at the two stations in bheri sub basin upstream at q265 rimna and downstream at q270 jamu are comparable with observed for daily as well as monthly simulations for the period of 1995 2009 at q265 as shown in fig 6c the long term average flow is underestimated by less than 1 for calibration and by 18 8 for validation periods however mostly high flows are underestimated while low flows are reasonably reproduced the nse for calibration and validation of daily flows are 0 83 and 0 66 respectively with better performance for monthly simulation the r2 values are also over 0 8 for both calibration and validation at q270 as shown in fig 6d flow patterns as indicated by hydrographs and fdc as well as average flow conditions are well reproduced with a long term average bias of only 13 during calibration and 8 8 during validation for the daily flows the nse and r2 for all cases are over 0 8 and except daily validation period for which nse and r2 are 0 76 and 0 78 respectively as at the stations along the karnali main low and average flow are better simulated than high flows 4 1 3 seti sub basin the swat model in the seti sub basin is evaluated at three stations located in upstream at q259 2 ghopa ghat at q256 5 budhi ganga and downstream at q260 bangna as shown in fig 2 at the upstream station q259 2 simulated hydrographs correspond well to precipitation pattern and reproduce observed daily as well as monthly flows there is slight underestimation of long term average flows by less than 5 during calibration and 10 during validation fig 6e the fdc is well reproduced the nse is 0 8 for daily and 0 9 for monthly simulations the r2 values are also in the same range as nse in case of q256 5 i e in budhi ganga hydrograph patterns as well as fdc are reproduced reasonably with a slight underestimation of long term average flows by less than 3 for daily as well as monthly simulations fig 6f the r2 and nse values are 0 68 for daily simulation and over 0 86 for monthly however there is relatively wide scattering of observed simulated dots thus reflecting a wider variation in simulated values at the downstream q260 very close to the outlet of seti the simulated and observed hydrographs as well as fdcs match closely unlike other stations in karnali and seti at q260 simulations slightly over estimate long term average flows by 6 5 during calibration and around 10 during validation fig 6g the downstream hrus generate enough runoff to compensate the flow underestimation in upstream indicating more contribution of the downstream hrus to the flow at the basin outlet land and water management practices in these downstream hrus therefore can have a significant impact on water availability in the sub basin the evaluation at three stations suggest that the model is capable of reproducing hydrological regime and average flow conditions in the seti 4 1 4 mohana sub basin simulated and observed hydrographs at q283 5 located in pathriya a tributary of mohana was made for swat performance in mohana very limited reliable data from 2001 to 2003 is available at this station due to the seasonal flash floods in the region hydrological stations in mohana have been difficult to maintain and monitor for continuous long term data as per our personal communication with dhm as indicated by hydrograph and fdc in fig 6h the flow pattern is reproduced well with long term average flows underestimated by less than 10 for both daily and monthly simulations the nse and r2 for calibration are also over 0 8 for monthly simulation even though it drops down to about 0 6 for daily flows the scattering of simulated observed dots is very high which indicates less reliability in simulated flow pattern across all the seasons even though long term average is reproduced reasonably however considering potential errors in hydrological data collection in the southern rivers like mohana the performance can be considered as acceptable 4 1 5 tila sub basin the model performance at tila is evaluated at q220 station for the simulation period of 1995 2009 the hydrograph pattern is reproduced satisfactorily with same nse and r2 values of 0 6 and 0 7 for daily and monthly calibrations respectively fig 6b the long term average flow is slightly underestimated by 0 6 during calibration the scatter plot indicates good model fit with dots aligned along the central line the fdc is well reproduced compared to other sub basins the calibrated swat model is capable of reproducing average as well as high flow conditions in the tila 4 2 spatial distribution of water balance fig 7 depicts sub basin wide distribution of major water balance components average annual p aet and net water yield within the karmo basin as simulated by the model for the hydrological baseline period 1995 2009 the net water yield nwy refers to a combination of surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow with deduction in transmission losses and pond abstractions arnold et al 1998 the average annual p over the entire basin is 1375 mm net water yield is 927 mm the average annual aet over the entire basin is 474 mm which is about 34 of the average annual p it however varies across the regions the water balance components vary spatially across the sub basins with pattern matching the geographical regions of northern trans himalayas trh mountains mnt hills hil and southern tarai flatland which is a part of indo gangetic plan igp the precipitation varies from less than 500 mm to above 2000 mm across the 111 sub basins fig 7a fig 8 depicts variation in the average annual precipitation aet and nwy in different geographical regions in the study basin the error bars indicate the maximum minimum range for each parameter with the specific region the mnt p 1435 mm hil p 1625 mm and igp p 1566 mm regions of the basin are relatively wetter compared to the trh p 875 mm region fig 8 the values of the water balance components across the sub basins in all the geographical regions vary widely as shown in fig 8 similarly the average annual aet across the sub basins varies from less than 200 mm to over 650 mm fig 7b the aet value are higher in the hil 587 mm and igp 553 mm regions compared to other two regions fig 8 owing to greater area under cultivation and proximity to the oceanfront and equator especially in case of igp furthermore due to large forest covers and greenery in the hil aet is expected to be higher the aet decreases as we move to the sub basins from the southern plains to the northern trans himalayan regions fig 7b as temperature decreases with altitude this trend is comparable with the case of koshi river basin in the eastern nepal in which too aet increases from igp towards the trh region bharati et al 2019 the aet in hil mnt and trh regions are 587 mm 528 mm and 227 mm respectively the aet as percentage of p in trh mnt hil and igp regions are 26 37 36 and 35 respectively the distribution pattern of aet also follows that of precipitation which is the major source of moisture in the western nepal long term average nwy in the form of discharge at the sub basin outlet varies across the sub basins from 1 1 to 1 357 5 m3 s where sub basin areas range from 44 to 3183 km2 the nwy across the karmo sub basins varies from less than 450 mm to above 1150 mm fig 7c in terms of geographical regions the long term average nwy aggregated over the region decreases as we move upstream from hil to trh with values of 1105 mm in hil 961 mm in mnt and 587 mm in trh fig 8 in fifty or 45 sub basins nwy are more than 80 of p and in 101 or 91 sub basins the nwy are more than half of p the surface runoff has the dominant contribution in the net water yield across most of the sub basins whereas contribution of groundwater and lateral flow varies two third of the sub basins have more than one third contribution from surface runoff and rest from other components in 28 of the sub basins contribution of surface runoff is above 50 the groundwater contribution to the net water yield is less than one third in 105 or 94 6 sub basins and less than one quarter in 93 or 83 8 sub basins it is to be noted that direct comparison in terms of absolute values may not provide critical insights as the sub basin sizes vary largely from 44 to 3183 km2 the sum of nwy and aet are different than p in all the regions primarily because nwy is not simply the difference between p and aet but it refers to a combination of surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow with deduction in transmission losses and pond abstractions the net water yield does not always follow the precipitation pattern but it gets affected by factors such as rainfall intensity soil properties and land use cover characteristics bharati et al 2019 therefore nwy is actually higher than the difference between p and aet in the entire basin as well as some regions e g mnt hil and igp and lower in other region i e trh as evident in fig 8 due to various reasons such issues are evident in other studies as well such as in the koshi basin eastern nepal bharati et al 2019 in the trh region change in storage the collective term including groundwater recharge change in soil moisture storage in the vadose zone and model inaccuracies is 7 positive of the precipitation rainfall and snowmelt ideally the change in storage in the entire basin as well as regions are supposed to be near to zero for a long term average the positive value of change in storage may reflect that not all the precipitation ina year in the trh region is contributing to streamflow part of that may have been lost in the form of infiltration through steep hills covered with snows which may re emerge as lateral flow in the downstream in the basin and major part of the remaining precipitation could have been stored in the trh region itself in the form of snow accumulation similarly in mnt and hil regions change in storage are around 4 negative of the precipitation reflecting that nwy is higher than the difference between p and aet it is likely that the nwy in the mnt and hil regions gets contribution from snowmelt and lateral flow emerging from the percolation of precipitation in the trh region when moving further downward in the igp the southern plain of the basin the change in storage is still negative but with only 2 7 in this region potential contributors to the excess nwy to p aet could be lateral flow as well as fluctuation in groundwater table as igp is a part of large groundwater aquifer shared by both india and nepal and extends beyond the hydrological boundary both inflow as well as outflow of groundwater from to the basin is possible depending upon situation finally average change in storage of the entire basin is 1 9 negative the deficit of precipitation in the basin to contribute to nwy might have been compensated from fluctuation in groundwater table inflow of groundwater from other part of the aquifer extending beyond the karmo basin boundary and snowmelt contribution in the upstream of the basin though the model results are reasonable at the basin major sub basins as well as a regional scales and useful for planning purpose model accuracy related and data related limitations are certainly embedded in the simulation results therefore results for the small sub basins located far from the calibration points should be used cautiously because of possible low confidence in results due to calibration and validation of the model at limited number of stations 4 3 temporal distribution of water balance the monthly average water balance for the baseline period shows a large temporal variation fig 9 the precipitation p is taken as a sum of rainfall and snowmelt p is taken as observed value while snowmelt which accounts of 11 of total precipitation is the model simulated value mean seasonal distribution of p in karmo varies from 68 mm in the post monsoon on season to 1098 mm in the monsoon jjas aet is related to p land use cover as well as temperature mean seasonal distribution of aet in the basin varies from 23 mm in the winter djf season to 290 mm in the monsoon season and nyw too varies across the season from 72 mm in the winter to 654 mm in the monsoon season the nwy does not always follow the p patterns because it is also affected by precipitation intensity soil properties subsurface storage and land use cover for example rain falling with high intensity on bare and compacted soils will produce higher runoff than longer precipitation events on deep soils and cropped areas bharati et al 2014 the results still show that the monsoon is the main hydrological driver as all the water balance components i e p aet and nwy are highest during the monsoon the monsoon season jjas contribution is 73 61 and 71 in the average annual p aet and nwy respectively at the karmo outlet fig 9 which is comparable to values obtained by bookhagen and burbank 2010 as per the results from swat simulation average annual flow volume at the basin outlet under the current climatic scenarios is 46 250 million cubic meters mcm 71 of which is available during jjas the monsoon season contribution varies across the sub basins from 63 at the outlet of q220 to 68 at q215 71 at q270 and 73 at q260 please refer fig 2 for the locations the δ storage is negative in the monsoon jjas season with the absolute value of 17 mm indicating recharge to aquifer or add to the storage and positive in the post monsoon until december and then becomes negative from january onwards albeit with minimal values the highest positive value of 91 mm in the post monsoon on season indicates groundwater contribution to streamflow which might have appeared as a result of recharge during the monsoon season jjas and discharge of that recharge water in the post monsoon similarly minimal negative values from january onwards can be explained as the result of winter precipitation 5 conclusions this study discretized the karnali mohana karmo basin in western nepal into 111 sub basins and developed a hydrological model in swat using multi site calibration approach to characterize spatio temporal distribution in water availability the model was reasonably calibrated and validated using visual inspection of hydrological pattern as well as statistical indicators for average flows and biases the annual average precipitation p of the karmo basin is estimated as 1375 mm and actual evapotranspiration aet is 34 approximately of the p but with a large spatio temporal heterogeneity the p across the sub basins vary from less than 500 mm to above 2000 mm the mountain hill and tarai a part of indo gangetic plain regions are relatively wetter compared to the trans himalayan and tibetan plateau regions the aet on the other hand varies from less than 200 mm to over 650 mm which decreases as we move to the sub basins from southern plains to the northern trans himalayan regions and average annual flow volume at the basin outlet under the baseline scenario is 46 250 million cubic meters mcm and the discharge at the sub basin outlets vary from 1 1 to 1 357 5 m3 s majority of p in most of the sub basins flow out as river discharge or net water yield nwy the surface runoff has the dominant contribution in nwy across most of the sub basins whereas contribution of groundwater and later flow varies in terms of seasons p varies from 68 mm post monsoon to 1098 mm monsoon aet from 23 mm winter to 290 mm monsoon and nwy from 72 mm winter to 654 mm monsoon the monsoon season jjas contribution is 73 61 and 71 in the average annual p aet and nwy respectively at the karmo outlet these model results are adopted for developing national irrigation master plans estimating environmental flows and evaluating trade offs among various future water development pathways furthermore the model is used for climate change impact assessment part b of this paper the model results are therefore valuable for water resources planners and managers for developing location

8364,study region karnali mohana river basin western nepal study focus this study aims to project future climate and assess impacts of climate change cc on water availability in the karnali mohana karmo basin bias corrected future climate was projected based on ensembles of multiple models selected from a set of 19 regional climate models rcms the impacts on water availability were then assessed by forcing a well calibrated and validated hydrological model with projected future precipitation p and temperature t for various climatic scenarios new hydrological insights for this region results showed that future t is projected to increase spatio temporally with higher rate for the mountain stations in the winter season whereas future p has no distinct spatio temporal trend but increase in dry season precipitation for future periods the projected changes in p t and evapotranspiration are expected to alter average annual flow at the outlets of the karmo and its sub basins albeit with varying rate the simulated results showed higher impacts in water availabilty at higher altitudes thus indicating higher vulnerability of northern mountainous region to cc than the southern flatlands being the first ever study of such nature in the study area these results will be useful for planning and development of climate resilient water development projects in the region keywords climate change karnali mohana water resources western nepal 1 introduction climate change cc is projected to impact availability and quality of water in future ipcc 2014 climate change alters the timing and intensity of rainfall temperature and runoff challenges coping capacities of existing infrastructures and brings higher risk of drought and floods which ultimately affects the hydrological cycle locally and globally kundzewicz et al 2009 zhu and ringler 2012 the impacts will be further aggravated by demographic economic environmental social and technological activities un wwap 2015 understanding the extent and significance of cc induced alterations in the hydrological cycle and subsequent water availability is of a great interest to environment and water resources managers globally bates et al 2008 honti et al 2014 several studies are being carried out at global local and regional scales to understand water availability under cc abbaspour et al 2009 aryal et al 2018 bharati et al 2016 devkota and gyawali 2015 pandey et al 2019 shrestha et al 2016 trang et al 2017 however many local basins such as karnali mohana karmo in western nepal fig 1 still lack such studies the karmo basin in the region covers the area of 49 892 km2 above nepal india border of which 6 9 falls in the tibetan plateau china and the rest in western nepal as elaborated in pandey et al 2020 part a of this paper the watershed area of mohana alone is 3730 km2 the karnali river originates in the trans himalayas trh and flows through mountains mnt hills hil and indo gangetic plain igp annex 1 the karmo basin offers large fertile lands for agriculture in addition steep slopes with topographical variations from 69 to 7 726 m above mean sea level masl and meandering rivers further offer tremendous potential for hydropower development water resources development activities in the karmo basin are expected to accelerate in future given the country s focus on harnessing water as resource and the potential the karmo basin has for that alterations in streamflow and hydrology induced by cc may affect availability of water for irrigation and hydropower production and then impacts food production energy generation and provincial and national economies therefore understanding implications of projected change in climate on spatio temporal distribution in water availability provides a useful knowledgebase for the policy decision makers to quantify different types of water security threats design policies and programmes and devise strategies for better allocation utilization and management of freshwater resources for the country s prosperity there are several studies focusing on hydrological modelling and cc impacts assessments at both local and watershed scales in nepal bajracharya et al 2018 bharati et al 2014 dhami et al 2019 pandey et al 2019 however none are focused in the karmo basin the western nepal is mostly susceptible to drought flood and climate shocks with increasing magnitude and frequency in the recent years wecs 2011 in addition increase in extreme precipitation events in western mountains are observed in recent decades talchabhadel et al 2018 which could impact aversely to the hydrological cycle and water availability and then hydropower and agriculture sectors among others a typical cc impact study exploring the hydrological perspective requires time series of projected meteorological variables at minimum precipitation and temperature representing future climate and a well calibrated and validated hydrological model future climate projections can be obtained from global circulation models gcms and regional climate models rcms for local scale basins such as karmo projections from rcms are considered better than that from gcms however rcm projections are not free of biases due to coarse spatial resolution and therefore need bias correction before using for local scale cc impact assessments maraun 2014 teutschbein and seibert 2010 statistical techniques such as empirical quantile mapping qm maraun 2014 are used for correcting the biases berg et al 2012 shrestha et al 2017 pandey et al 2019 additionally to reduce uncertainties in the projections bias corrected rcm outputs are combined into ensembles representing various climate models as described in dhaubanjar et al 2018 ensemble time series are fed to hydrological model for cc impact assessment aryal et al 2018 tuetschbein and seibert 2012 climate change impacts on hydrology and water resources availability are generally assessed by forcing a well calibrated and validated hydrological model with bias corrected rcm outputs under different future scenarios bastola et al 2011 a well calibrated and validated hydrological model in soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is already developed for the karmo basin by pandey et al 2020 this study therefore uses that model to assess cc impacts on spatio temporal distribution in water availability in the basin under current and future conditions for the most recent representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios from multiple rcms during the process it also characterizes future climate in the study basin using multi rcm approach 2 methodology and data this study adopts a model based approach to assess impacts of projected future climate on spatio temporal distribution of water availability in the karmo basin fig 2 depicts a flowchart of adopted methodology and following sub sections describes them in detail future climate were projected using multiple rcms current and future water availabilities were assessed using a hydrological model developed in swat 2 1 hydrological model we used the swat arnold et al 1998 hydrological model developed by pandey et al 2020 part a of this paper by discretizing the karmo basin into 111 sub basins and 2122 hydrologic response units hrus the model was calibrated and validated at 10 hydrological stations along five tributaries of the karmo fig 1 2 2 future climate projection nineteen rcms available in coordinated regional downscaling experiment for south asia cordex sa platform were evaluated as discussed in dhaubanjar et al 2019 the study first compared the annual projections for the northern mountains mid hills and southern terai regions in western nepal from the 19 rcms using the australian climate futures framework clarke et al 2011 whetton et al 2012 for each region projected changes in annual temperature and precipitation were classified into qualitative categories of changes to generate a climate future matrix three future periods were investigated near future nf 2021 2045 mid future mf 2046 2070 and far future ff 2071 2095 considering two rcps rcp 4 5 and 8 5 and three future periods six climate future matrices were developed representing six climate scenarios in each region from the 18 matrices 6 scenarios x 3 regions 18 matrices the rcms that represent the consensus case i e the matrix category that majority of the rcms project were identified and selected the future climate data at the meteorological stations were then bias corrected using quantile mapping qm method gudmundsson et al 2012 teutchbein and seibert 2012 implemented in r using a qmap package gudmundsson et al 2012 qm corrects quantiles of rcm data to match with that of observed ones by creating suitable transfer functions the bias corrected times series from the selected rcms for each station were averaged to create a multi model averaged ensemble for each climate scenario the projected future cc and associated impacts were analysed based on those ensembles 2 3 climate change impacts assessment bias corrected precipitation and temperature ensemble projections for six climate scenarios 2 rcps and three future periods at the meteorological stations were fed into the calibrated and validated swat model developed by pandey et al 2020 the simulated streamflows were then characterized in terms of average annual and seasonal values for the three future periods the deviation of streamflow annual and seasonal with respect to baseline 1980 2005 were considered as impact of projected cc on water availability similarly impact of cc in other water balance components such as precipitation and actual evapotranspiration were also assessed as deviation of future values with respect to baseline using similar approach as used for streamflows the spatial distribution of change in key water balance components compared to baseline in each sub basin were explored through spatial maps 2 4 data and sources the data used in hydrological modelling are reported in pandey et al 2019 daily precipitation data at 36 stations temperature data at 16 stations relative humidity data at 15 stations sunshine hours data at 5 stations and wind speed data at 7 stations were collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm the government of nepal future time series of precipitation mm and temperature c data projected by 19 rcms were extracted from spatial grids of 0 44 x 0 44 1981 2100 as detailed in dhaubanjar et a 2019 3 projected future climate given the large size of the karmo one certainly expects spatial heterogeneity in the projected future climate to reflect that future climate at three representative stations spread across the three physiological regions are analysed the stations are st303 region mountain elevation 2300 masl sub basin tila st406 region hill elevation 720 masl sub basin thuli bheri and st207 region terai in igb elevation 140 masl sub basin mohana the station locations are shown in fig 1 all changes are reported with respective to average of 1980 2005 as the climatic baseline the spatio temporal distribution in the projected precipitation and temperature across the three stations are provided in figs 3 and 4 respectively and their ranges are tabulated in annex 2 and annex 3 at a mountain station 303 average annual precipitation p for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 4 7 10 10 and 13 17 in nf mf and ff respectively however with variation in rate of change across the seasons fig 3 the rate of change in p varies across the seasons with the highest amount of increase as well as range of projection for on season for all the future periods and climate scenarios considered thus indicating wetter future in terms of temperature average annual maximum temperature tmax for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 1 3 c 1 3 c in nf 2 3 c 2 7 c in mf and 2 5 c 4 5 c in ff fig 4 a higher increase is projected for djf and mam seasons which in djf is 1 6 c 1 7 c in nf 2 8 c 3 6 c in mf and 3 2 c 5 9 c in ff under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios fig 4 the average annual minimum temperature tmin under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios as reported in dhaubanjar et al 2019 on the other hand is projected to increase by 1 0 c 1 1 c in nf 1 7 c 2 3 c in mf and 1 8 c 3 9 c in ff albeit with higher increase in mam and on seasons at a hill station 406 average annual p under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 5 8 9 11 and 11 13 in nf mf and ff respectively with projection ranges as shown in fig 3 with higher increase projected for mam and on seasons there exists seasonality in amount and ranges of change in p in terms of temperature average annual tmax under rcp4 5 is projected to increase by 0 9 c 1 2 c and 1 9 c in nf mf and ff respectively fig 4 for both the scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 higher increase in tmax is projected for djf and mam seasons reflecting warmer winters in future the average annual tmin as discussed in dhaubanjar et al 2019 is also projected to increase by 1 8 c 2 7 c and 3 9 c during nf mf and ff respectively under rcp4 5 with changes varying across the seasons in case of a tarai station 207 the p for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 5 9 in nf 7 9 in mf and 6 6 in ff fig 3 there is no distinct trend towards the future in terms of seasons p is projected to increase in all the seasons however with more increase for on and mam than others seasons for both the scenarios and all the future considered average annual tmax for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 1 0 c 1 2 c in nf 1 3 c 2 1 c in mf and 1 2 c 3 3 c in ff fig 4 all the seasons project increase in tmax however higher amount of increase is projected for djf and mam seasons in case of tmin annual averages under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 1 2 c 1 5 c in nf 1 7 c 2 8 c in mf and 1 8 c 4 4 c in ff the mam and on seasons are projected to have higher increase in tmin compared to other seasons as well as annual averages across the three stations the projection ranges for annual as well as seasonal changes in precipitation and maximum temperature are increasing in general though not consistent for all the stations seasons and scenarios when we move farther into the future years it indicates increase in uncertainty in the projection when moved farther in the future the annual projections for temperature and precipitation seen here are comparable to the ranges reported in lutz et al 2016 sanjay et al 2017 and choudhary and dimri 2018 for the greater hindu kush himalayas however seasonal ranges not reported explicitly in most of the studies vary especially for precipitation local orographic effects affect seasonal changes in climate more than annual averages variation across the mountain hill and tarai in figs 3 and 4 are likely due to heterogeneity in local conditions and microclimates furthermore given the larger size of the basin global warming phenomenon might also have contributed to change sin both precipitation and temperature in the entire basin 4 climate change impacts on water availability projected future temperature and rainfall time series based on an ensemble of the selected rcms for six consensus scenarios were used as input to the calibrated and validated swat model to simulate the cc impacts on future water balance components changes in water balance components over the sub basins as well as months season were analyzed to understand spatio temporal distribution of the changes under projected future climates since observed data of different water balance components are not available for the basin output from the swat model was used as the baseline to compare with future scenarios the sub basin wide distribution in the change of water balance components namely precipitation p actual evapotranspiration aet and net water yield for two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 and three future periods nf mf and ff are shown in the figs 5 and 6 as seen in the plots for station 406 figs 3 4 average annual p is projected to increase gradually from nf to ff the rate of projected change however varies widely across the sub basins extending beyond 25 fig 5 change in p as well as temperature t has altered aet from baseline value by varying rates across the sub basins as shown in fig 6 the sub basin wide aet varies from less than 15 to above 50 under the six future scenarios considered the change in aet is more pronounced at the sub basins in higher and middle elevations than at the lower elevations potentially due to higher rate of increase in t in these regions similar results are reported for the koshi basin in nepal as well bharati et al 2014 the percentages of sub basins that show increase and decrease in p aet and q are reported in table 1 for example the percentages of sub basins that show increase decrease in p by more than 10 under rcp4 5 are 10 15 in nf 26 12 in mf and 32 12 in ff under bot the rcp scenarios table 1 similarly the percentages of the sub basins that show increase decrease in aet by more than 10 under the rcp4 5 scenarios are 51 3 in nf 51 3 in mf and 51 4 in ff similar results for rcp8 5 are reported in table 1 as a result of changes in p and aet average annual flow at outlets of the karmo sub basins are projected to alter as shown in fig 7 in comparison to temperature and precipitation other input variables such as radiation relative humidity and wind speed have a less significant effect on water yield stonefelt et al 2000 the fig 7 shows variation in projected changes in average annual flows under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios for the three future periods considered i e nf mf and ff the spatial variation in the change in average annual flow also follows similar pattern as future p however the variations across the sub basins fluctuate a lot the impacts in the sub basins at higher altitudes are relatively higher perhaps due to melting of snow glaciers as a result in change in t this indicates that high mountain regions are more vulnerable to cc than the flatlands in the lower part of the basin for example under rcp4 5 scenarios the regional average net water yield in nf for igp hil mnt mnt and trh are projected to change by 8 3 0 2 2 8 and 5 6 respectively 4 1 bheri river basin the bheri river basin above the q270 hydrological station has a catchment area of 12 290 km2 the average annual flow volume at q270 for the baseline period is estimated at 11 383 mcm which under rcp4 5 scenarios are projected to decrease in nf by 5 4 and then increase in mf by 3 under rcp8 5 scenarios it is projected to decrease by 2 5 and 1 3 for nf and mf respectively however intra annual variations of the projected changes vary across the scenarios and future periods considered projected changes under both the scenarios vary from 30 5 may to 11 7 january in nf 28 5 may to 26 2 january in mf and 28 5 may to 13 4 january in ff while moving towards farter in the future the flow volume in the bheri river is projected to decrease during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons but increase in post monsoon and winter seasons january november and december the decrease during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons are linked both to overall decrease in precipitation though there are mixed trends both increase and decrease for different sub basins of bheri fig 5 and increase in aet as we move farther in the future as evident from fig 6 however projected increase in river flows during post monsoon and winter seasons are likely due to contribution from the melting of snows and ice that are covering the headwaters of the bheri river basin please refer pandey et al 2020 for the land use cover map at least a quarter of the watershed area of thuli bheri above q265 please refer fig 1 for location is covered with permanent snow and ice furthermore percolation of monsoon season precipitation to aquifers and appearing that into the river in the form of baseflow could also have contributed to increase in the river flows in the post monsoon and winter seasons 4 2 seti river basin the seti river basin above q260 hydrological station covers an area of 7460 km2 the average annual flow volume at q260 for the baseline period is estimated at 8944 mcm which under rcp4 5 scenarios is projected to increase from 13 9 in nf to 16 1 in ff in case of rcp8 5 scenarios it is projected to increase from 14 5 in nf to 16 0 in mf the rate of increase however is not consistent across the months scenarios and future periods considered the projected changes in monthly flow volumes under both the scenarios vary from 4 5 july to 57 3 january in nf 1 3 september to 82 4 april in mf and 1 5 june to 46 0 january in ff the flow volumes in the seti river is projected to increase across all the months albeit with varying rates higher increase in winter pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons and lower during the monsoon season the increase in flow volume in the seti river outlet is likely due to increase in precipitation in the basin fig 5 and varying rates across the seasons are due to varying amount of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration therefore future water infrastructure projects such as hydropower and irrigation have potential to get benefited from more water availability during dry seasons 4 3 upper karnali river basin the upper karnali river basin in this study refers to the area above q215 hydrological station it covers an area of 15 200 km2 the average annual flow volume at q215 is estimated at 8993 mcm which is projected to change by 7 3 in nf and 2 3 in mf under the rcp8 5 scenarios the projected changes are 7 2 in nf and 5 8 in ff the projected changes are not uniform throughout the months which vary from 31 2 june to 43 6 april in nf 26 8 june to 72 april in mf and 33 8 june to 51 2 march in ff the flow volumes are projected to decrease during monsoon season jjas and increase during winter and pre monsoon season albeit with varying rates both decrease in precipitation and increase in aet are projected for the sub basins in the upper karnali river basin figs 5 and 6 thus resulting in decrease in flows during monsoon season however given the large area of the upper karnali river basin covered with permanent snow and ice melting of snow and ice contributes to increase in river flows during pre monsoon and winter seasons 4 4 tila river basin the tila river basin here refers to the area above q220 hydrological station it covers an area of 1870 km2 the average annual flow volume at q220 is estimated at 1470 mcm which under rcp4 5 scenarios is projected to change by 21 6 in nf and 13 4 in ff under the rcp8 5 scenarios it is projected to alter by 19 5 in nf 17 2 in mf and 13 2 in ff the intra annual variations across the months are 35 1 june to 11 2 january in nf 31 5 june to 33 6 april in mf and 32 1 june to 2 9 july in ff except in march and april in mf under rcp4 5 projections for all other scenarios and futures show decrease in flow volume across all the months seasons it is because sub basins of tila also shows projected decrease in precipitation fig 5 and increase in actual evapotranspiration fig 6 4 5 karnali main river basin the karnali main river basin here refers to the area above q280 hydrological station it covers an area of 42 890 km2 the average annual flow volume near to the outlet of karnali main before joining mohana at q280 station for the baseline period is estimated at 44 602 mcm which in nf and mf are projected to increase by only 0 6 and 6 4 under rcp4 5 and 9 and 4 2 under rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the projections however varies across the months for different scenarios and future periods for example projected changes under both the scenarios in nf vary from 12 9 june to 25 2 january when moving towards mid future it varies from 10 6 june to 47 3 april and in far future it ranges from 14 9 june to 28 7 january future flow volume is projected to decrease in june and increase winter and later stage of the monsoon season even though the average annual is projected to increase as the karmo is the snow fed river basins increase in river flows from the later stage of the monsoon to winter are potentially the contributions from melting of snow and ice 5 conclusions this study applied a well calibrated and validated swat hydrological model to assess impacts of climate change on spatio temporal distribution of water availability in the karnali mohana karmo basin located in western nepal future climate was projected based on an ensemble of selected rcms for six consensus cases from a set of 19 the temperature t is projected to have an increasing trend across all regions and seasons with highest amount of increase for the mountain stations in the winter season the amount of increase in the projections vary across the seasons however no strong skewness suggests annual values can represent a seasonal change in the region projection in the minimum temperature also follows similar spatio temporal trends across the stations in case of projected precipitation it does not have a distinct spatio temporal trend at the seasonal or annual scale the highest variability in total p is seen for the post monsoon season on especially for the mountains and hills indicating wetter dry seasons for future with both maximum t and p increasing on an average in the winter seasons glacier and snow melt may be expected to increase the impacts of projected change in climate to spatio temporal distribution of water availability was assessed by perturbing the climatic inputs to the calibrated validated swat model with projected future time series of p and t as a result of changes in p t and aet average annual flow at outlets of the karmo sub basins are projected to alter however in general following similar patterns as p the impacts in the sub basins at higher altitudes are relatively higher indicating higher vulnerability to cc of the high mountain regions of the basin than the flat lands in tarai for example in nf under rcp4 5 scenarios the annual flow volume at the outlet of tila is projected to change by 21 6 at upper karnali by 7 2 seti by 13 9 bheri by 5 4 and karnali main by 0 6 it clearly reflects the spatial heterogeneity in the impacts of projected cc on an annual scale in addition projected alterations also vary across the seasons taking the case of rcp4 5 and nf again it alters

8364,study region karnali mohana river basin western nepal study focus this study aims to project future climate and assess impacts of climate change cc on water availability in the karnali mohana karmo basin bias corrected future climate was projected based on ensembles of multiple models selected from a set of 19 regional climate models rcms the impacts on water availability were then assessed by forcing a well calibrated and validated hydrological model with projected future precipitation p and temperature t for various climatic scenarios new hydrological insights for this region results showed that future t is projected to increase spatio temporally with higher rate for the mountain stations in the winter season whereas future p has no distinct spatio temporal trend but increase in dry season precipitation for future periods the projected changes in p t and evapotranspiration are expected to alter average annual flow at the outlets of the karmo and its sub basins albeit with varying rate the simulated results showed higher impacts in water availabilty at higher altitudes thus indicating higher vulnerability of northern mountainous region to cc than the southern flatlands being the first ever study of such nature in the study area these results will be useful for planning and development of climate resilient water development projects in the region keywords climate change karnali mohana water resources western nepal 1 introduction climate change cc is projected to impact availability and quality of water in future ipcc 2014 climate change alters the timing and intensity of rainfall temperature and runoff challenges coping capacities of existing infrastructures and brings higher risk of drought and floods which ultimately affects the hydrological cycle locally and globally kundzewicz et al 2009 zhu and ringler 2012 the impacts will be further aggravated by demographic economic environmental social and technological activities un wwap 2015 understanding the extent and significance of cc induced alterations in the hydrological cycle and subsequent water availability is of a great interest to environment and water resources managers globally bates et al 2008 honti et al 2014 several studies are being carried out at global local and regional scales to understand water availability under cc abbaspour et al 2009 aryal et al 2018 bharati et al 2016 devkota and gyawali 2015 pandey et al 2019 shrestha et al 2016 trang et al 2017 however many local basins such as karnali mohana karmo in western nepal fig 1 still lack such studies the karmo basin in the region covers the area of 49 892 km2 above nepal india border of which 6 9 falls in the tibetan plateau china and the rest in western nepal as elaborated in pandey et al 2020 part a of this paper the watershed area of mohana alone is 3730 km2 the karnali river originates in the trans himalayas trh and flows through mountains mnt hills hil and indo gangetic plain igp annex 1 the karmo basin offers large fertile lands for agriculture in addition steep slopes with topographical variations from 69 to 7 726 m above mean sea level masl and meandering rivers further offer tremendous potential for hydropower development water resources development activities in the karmo basin are expected to accelerate in future given the country s focus on harnessing water as resource and the potential the karmo basin has for that alterations in streamflow and hydrology induced by cc may affect availability of water for irrigation and hydropower production and then impacts food production energy generation and provincial and national economies therefore understanding implications of projected change in climate on spatio temporal distribution in water availability provides a useful knowledgebase for the policy decision makers to quantify different types of water security threats design policies and programmes and devise strategies for better allocation utilization and management of freshwater resources for the country s prosperity there are several studies focusing on hydrological modelling and cc impacts assessments at both local and watershed scales in nepal bajracharya et al 2018 bharati et al 2014 dhami et al 2019 pandey et al 2019 however none are focused in the karmo basin the western nepal is mostly susceptible to drought flood and climate shocks with increasing magnitude and frequency in the recent years wecs 2011 in addition increase in extreme precipitation events in western mountains are observed in recent decades talchabhadel et al 2018 which could impact aversely to the hydrological cycle and water availability and then hydropower and agriculture sectors among others a typical cc impact study exploring the hydrological perspective requires time series of projected meteorological variables at minimum precipitation and temperature representing future climate and a well calibrated and validated hydrological model future climate projections can be obtained from global circulation models gcms and regional climate models rcms for local scale basins such as karmo projections from rcms are considered better than that from gcms however rcm projections are not free of biases due to coarse spatial resolution and therefore need bias correction before using for local scale cc impact assessments maraun 2014 teutschbein and seibert 2010 statistical techniques such as empirical quantile mapping qm maraun 2014 are used for correcting the biases berg et al 2012 shrestha et al 2017 pandey et al 2019 additionally to reduce uncertainties in the projections bias corrected rcm outputs are combined into ensembles representing various climate models as described in dhaubanjar et al 2018 ensemble time series are fed to hydrological model for cc impact assessment aryal et al 2018 tuetschbein and seibert 2012 climate change impacts on hydrology and water resources availability are generally assessed by forcing a well calibrated and validated hydrological model with bias corrected rcm outputs under different future scenarios bastola et al 2011 a well calibrated and validated hydrological model in soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is already developed for the karmo basin by pandey et al 2020 this study therefore uses that model to assess cc impacts on spatio temporal distribution in water availability in the basin under current and future conditions for the most recent representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios from multiple rcms during the process it also characterizes future climate in the study basin using multi rcm approach 2 methodology and data this study adopts a model based approach to assess impacts of projected future climate on spatio temporal distribution of water availability in the karmo basin fig 2 depicts a flowchart of adopted methodology and following sub sections describes them in detail future climate were projected using multiple rcms current and future water availabilities were assessed using a hydrological model developed in swat 2 1 hydrological model we used the swat arnold et al 1998 hydrological model developed by pandey et al 2020 part a of this paper by discretizing the karmo basin into 111 sub basins and 2122 hydrologic response units hrus the model was calibrated and validated at 10 hydrological stations along five tributaries of the karmo fig 1 2 2 future climate projection nineteen rcms available in coordinated regional downscaling experiment for south asia cordex sa platform were evaluated as discussed in dhaubanjar et al 2019 the study first compared the annual projections for the northern mountains mid hills and southern terai regions in western nepal from the 19 rcms using the australian climate futures framework clarke et al 2011 whetton et al 2012 for each region projected changes in annual temperature and precipitation were classified into qualitative categories of changes to generate a climate future matrix three future periods were investigated near future nf 2021 2045 mid future mf 2046 2070 and far future ff 2071 2095 considering two rcps rcp 4 5 and 8 5 and three future periods six climate future matrices were developed representing six climate scenarios in each region from the 18 matrices 6 scenarios x 3 regions 18 matrices the rcms that represent the consensus case i e the matrix category that majority of the rcms project were identified and selected the future climate data at the meteorological stations were then bias corrected using quantile mapping qm method gudmundsson et al 2012 teutchbein and seibert 2012 implemented in r using a qmap package gudmundsson et al 2012 qm corrects quantiles of rcm data to match with that of observed ones by creating suitable transfer functions the bias corrected times series from the selected rcms for each station were averaged to create a multi model averaged ensemble for each climate scenario the projected future cc and associated impacts were analysed based on those ensembles 2 3 climate change impacts assessment bias corrected precipitation and temperature ensemble projections for six climate scenarios 2 rcps and three future periods at the meteorological stations were fed into the calibrated and validated swat model developed by pandey et al 2020 the simulated streamflows were then characterized in terms of average annual and seasonal values for the three future periods the deviation of streamflow annual and seasonal with respect to baseline 1980 2005 were considered as impact of projected cc on water availability similarly impact of cc in other water balance components such as precipitation and actual evapotranspiration were also assessed as deviation of future values with respect to baseline using similar approach as used for streamflows the spatial distribution of change in key water balance components compared to baseline in each sub basin were explored through spatial maps 2 4 data and sources the data used in hydrological modelling are reported in pandey et al 2019 daily precipitation data at 36 stations temperature data at 16 stations relative humidity data at 15 stations sunshine hours data at 5 stations and wind speed data at 7 stations were collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm the government of nepal future time series of precipitation mm and temperature c data projected by 19 rcms were extracted from spatial grids of 0 44 x 0 44 1981 2100 as detailed in dhaubanjar et a 2019 3 projected future climate given the large size of the karmo one certainly expects spatial heterogeneity in the projected future climate to reflect that future climate at three representative stations spread across the three physiological regions are analysed the stations are st303 region mountain elevation 2300 masl sub basin tila st406 region hill elevation 720 masl sub basin thuli bheri and st207 region terai in igb elevation 140 masl sub basin mohana the station locations are shown in fig 1 all changes are reported with respective to average of 1980 2005 as the climatic baseline the spatio temporal distribution in the projected precipitation and temperature across the three stations are provided in figs 3 and 4 respectively and their ranges are tabulated in annex 2 and annex 3 at a mountain station 303 average annual precipitation p for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 4 7 10 10 and 13 17 in nf mf and ff respectively however with variation in rate of change across the seasons fig 3 the rate of change in p varies across the seasons with the highest amount of increase as well as range of projection for on season for all the future periods and climate scenarios considered thus indicating wetter future in terms of temperature average annual maximum temperature tmax for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 1 3 c 1 3 c in nf 2 3 c 2 7 c in mf and 2 5 c 4 5 c in ff fig 4 a higher increase is projected for djf and mam seasons which in djf is 1 6 c 1 7 c in nf 2 8 c 3 6 c in mf and 3 2 c 5 9 c in ff under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios fig 4 the average annual minimum temperature tmin under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios as reported in dhaubanjar et al 2019 on the other hand is projected to increase by 1 0 c 1 1 c in nf 1 7 c 2 3 c in mf and 1 8 c 3 9 c in ff albeit with higher increase in mam and on seasons at a hill station 406 average annual p under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 5 8 9 11 and 11 13 in nf mf and ff respectively with projection ranges as shown in fig 3 with higher increase projected for mam and on seasons there exists seasonality in amount and ranges of change in p in terms of temperature average annual tmax under rcp4 5 is projected to increase by 0 9 c 1 2 c and 1 9 c in nf mf and ff respectively fig 4 for both the scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 higher increase in tmax is projected for djf and mam seasons reflecting warmer winters in future the average annual tmin as discussed in dhaubanjar et al 2019 is also projected to increase by 1 8 c 2 7 c and 3 9 c during nf mf and ff respectively under rcp4 5 with changes varying across the seasons in case of a tarai station 207 the p for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 5 9 in nf 7 9 in mf and 6 6 in ff fig 3 there is no distinct trend towards the future in terms of seasons p is projected to increase in all the seasons however with more increase for on and mam than others seasons for both the scenarios and all the future considered average annual tmax for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 1 0 c 1 2 c in nf 1 3 c 2 1 c in mf and 1 2 c 3 3 c in ff fig 4 all the seasons project increase in tmax however higher amount of increase is projected for djf and mam seasons in case of tmin annual averages under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 scenarios are projected to increase by 1 2 c 1 5 c in nf 1 7 c 2 8 c in mf and 1 8 c 4 4 c in ff the mam and on seasons are projected to have higher increase in tmin compared to other seasons as well as annual averages across the three stations the projection ranges for annual as well as seasonal changes in precipitation and maximum temperature are increasing in general though not consistent for all the stations seasons and scenarios when we move farther into the future years it indicates increase in uncertainty in the projection when moved farther in the future the annual projections for temperature and precipitation seen here are comparable to the ranges reported in lutz et al 2016 sanjay et al 2017 and choudhary and dimri 2018 for the greater hindu kush himalayas however seasonal ranges not reported explicitly in most of the studies vary especially for precipitation local orographic effects affect seasonal changes in climate more than annual averages variation across the mountain hill and tarai in figs 3 and 4 are likely due to heterogeneity in local conditions and microclimates furthermore given the larger size of the basin global warming phenomenon might also have contributed to change sin both precipitation and temperature in the entire basin 4 climate change impacts on water availability projected future temperature and rainfall time series based on an ensemble of the selected rcms for six consensus scenarios were used as input to the calibrated and validated swat model to simulate the cc impacts on future water balance components changes in water balance components over the sub basins as well as months season were analyzed to understand spatio temporal distribution of the changes under projected future climates since observed data of different water balance components are not available for the basin output from the swat model was used as the baseline to compare with future scenarios the sub basin wide distribution in the change of water balance components namely precipitation p actual evapotranspiration aet and net water yield for two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 and three future periods nf mf and ff are shown in the figs 5 and 6 as seen in the plots for station 406 figs 3 4 average annual p is projected to increase gradually from nf to ff the rate of projected change however varies widely across the sub basins extending beyond 25 fig 5 change in p as well as temperature t has altered aet from baseline value by varying rates across the sub basins as shown in fig 6 the sub basin wide aet varies from less than 15 to above 50 under the six future scenarios considered the change in aet is more pronounced at the sub basins in higher and middle elevations than at the lower elevations potentially due to higher rate of increase in t in these regions similar results are reported for the koshi basin in nepal as well bharati et al 2014 the percentages of sub basins that show increase and decrease in p aet and q are reported in table 1 for example the percentages of sub basins that show increase decrease in p by more than 10 under rcp4 5 are 10 15 in nf 26 12 in mf and 32 12 in ff under bot the rcp scenarios table 1 similarly the percentages of the sub basins that show increase decrease in aet by more than 10 under the rcp4 5 scenarios are 51 3 in nf 51 3 in mf and 51 4 in ff similar results for rcp8 5 are reported in table 1 as a result of changes in p and aet average annual flow at outlets of the karmo sub basins are projected to alter as shown in fig 7 in comparison to temperature and precipitation other input variables such as radiation relative humidity and wind speed have a less significant effect on water yield stonefelt et al 2000 the fig 7 shows variation in projected changes in average annual flows under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios for the three future periods considered i e nf mf and ff the spatial variation in the change in average annual flow also follows similar pattern as future p however the variations across the sub basins fluctuate a lot the impacts in the sub basins at higher altitudes are relatively higher perhaps due to melting of snow glaciers as a result in change in t this indicates that high mountain regions are more vulnerable to cc than the flatlands in the lower part of the basin for example under rcp4 5 scenarios the regional average net water yield in nf for igp hil mnt mnt and trh are projected to change by 8 3 0 2 2 8 and 5 6 respectively 4 1 bheri river basin the bheri river basin above the q270 hydrological station has a catchment area of 12 290 km2 the average annual flow volume at q270 for the baseline period is estimated at 11 383 mcm which under rcp4 5 scenarios are projected to decrease in nf by 5 4 and then increase in mf by 3 under rcp8 5 scenarios it is projected to decrease by 2 5 and 1 3 for nf and mf respectively however intra annual variations of the projected changes vary across the scenarios and future periods considered projected changes under both the scenarios vary from 30 5 may to 11 7 january in nf 28 5 may to 26 2 january in mf and 28 5 may to 13 4 january in ff while moving towards farter in the future the flow volume in the bheri river is projected to decrease during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons but increase in post monsoon and winter seasons january november and december the decrease during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons are linked both to overall decrease in precipitation though there are mixed trends both increase and decrease for different sub basins of bheri fig 5 and increase in aet as we move farther in the future as evident from fig 6 however projected increase in river flows during post monsoon and winter seasons are likely due to contribution from the melting of snows and ice that are covering the headwaters of the bheri river basin please refer pandey et al 2020 for the land use cover map at least a quarter of the watershed area of thuli bheri above q265 please refer fig 1 for location is covered with permanent snow and ice furthermore percolation of monsoon season precipitation to aquifers and appearing that into the river in the form of baseflow could also have contributed to increase in the river flows in the post monsoon and winter seasons 4 2 seti river basin the seti river basin above q260 hydrological station covers an area of 7460 km2 the average annual flow volume at q260 for the baseline period is estimated at 8944 mcm which under rcp4 5 scenarios is projected to increase from 13 9 in nf to 16 1 in ff in case of rcp8 5 scenarios it is projected to increase from 14 5 in nf to 16 0 in mf the rate of increase however is not consistent across the months scenarios and future periods considered the projected changes in monthly flow volumes under both the scenarios vary from 4 5 july to 57 3 january in nf 1 3 september to 82 4 april in mf and 1 5 june to 46 0 january in ff the flow volumes in the seti river is projected to increase across all the months albeit with varying rates higher increase in winter pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons and lower during the monsoon season the increase in flow volume in the seti river outlet is likely due to increase in precipitation in the basin fig 5 and varying rates across the seasons are due to varying amount of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration therefore future water infrastructure projects such as hydropower and irrigation have potential to get benefited from more water availability during dry seasons 4 3 upper karnali river basin the upper karnali river basin in this study refers to the area above q215 hydrological station it covers an area of 15 200 km2 the average annual flow volume at q215 is estimated at 8993 mcm which is projected to change by 7 3 in nf and 2 3 in mf under the rcp8 5 scenarios the projected changes are 7 2 in nf and 5 8 in ff the projected changes are not uniform throughout the months which vary from 31 2 june to 43 6 april in nf 26 8 june to 72 april in mf and 33 8 june to 51 2 march in ff the flow volumes are projected to decrease during monsoon season jjas and increase during winter and pre monsoon season albeit with varying rates both decrease in precipitation and increase in aet are projected for the sub basins in the upper karnali river basin figs 5 and 6 thus resulting in decrease in flows during monsoon season however given the large area of the upper karnali river basin covered with permanent snow and ice melting of snow and ice contributes to increase in river flows during pre monsoon and winter seasons 4 4 tila river basin the tila river basin here refers to the area above q220 hydrological station it covers an area of 1870 km2 the average annual flow volume at q220 is estimated at 1470 mcm which under rcp4 5 scenarios is projected to change by 21 6 in nf and 13 4 in ff under the rcp8 5 scenarios it is projected to alter by 19 5 in nf 17 2 in mf and 13 2 in ff the intra annual variations across the months are 35 1 june to 11 2 january in nf 31 5 june to 33 6 april in mf and 32 1 june to 2 9 july in ff except in march and april in mf under rcp4 5 projections for all other scenarios and futures show decrease in flow volume across all the months seasons it is because sub basins of tila also shows projected decrease in precipitation fig 5 and increase in actual evapotranspiration fig 6 4 5 karnali main river basin the karnali main river basin here refers to the area above q280 hydrological station it covers an area of 42 890 km2 the average annual flow volume near to the outlet of karnali main before joining mohana at q280 station for the baseline period is estimated at 44 602 mcm which in nf and mf are projected to increase by only 0 6 and 6 4 under rcp4 5 and 9 and 4 2 under rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the projections however varies across the months for different scenarios and future periods for example projected changes under both the scenarios in nf vary from 12 9 june to 25 2 january when moving towards mid future it varies from 10 6 june to 47 3 april and in far future it ranges from 14 9 june to 28 7 january future flow volume is projected to decrease in june and increase winter and later stage of the monsoon season even though the average annual is projected to increase as the karmo is the snow fed river basins increase in river flows from the later stage of the monsoon to winter are potentially the contributions from melting of snow and ice 5 conclusions this study applied a well calibrated and validated swat hydrological model to assess impacts of climate change on spatio temporal distribution of water availability in the karnali mohana karmo basin located in western nepal future climate was projected based on an ensemble of selected rcms for six consensus cases from a set of 19 the temperature t is projected to have an increasing trend across all regions and seasons with highest amount of increase for the mountain stations in the winter season the amount of increase in the projections vary across the seasons however no strong skewness suggests annual values can represent a seasonal change in the region projection in the minimum temperature also follows similar spatio temporal trends across the stations in case of projected precipitation it does not have a distinct spatio temporal trend at the seasonal or annual scale the highest variability in total p is seen for the post monsoon season on especially for the mountains and hills indicating wetter dry seasons for future with both maximum t and p increasing on an average in the winter seasons glacier and snow melt may be expected to increase the impacts of projected change in climate to spatio temporal distribution of water availability was assessed by perturbing the climatic inputs to the calibrated validated swat model with projected future time series of p and t as a result of changes in p t and aet average annual flow at outlets of the karmo sub basins are projected to alter however in general following similar patterns as p the impacts in the sub basins at higher altitudes are relatively higher indicating higher vulnerability to cc of the high mountain regions of the basin than the flat lands in tarai for example in nf under rcp4 5 scenarios the annual flow volume at the outlet of tila is projected to change by 21 6 at upper karnali by 7 2 seti by 13 9 bheri by 5 4 and karnali main by 0 6 it clearly reflects the spatial heterogeneity in the impacts of projected cc on an annual scale in addition projected alterations also vary across the seasons taking the case of rcp4 5 and nf again it alters from 35 1 june to 11 2 january in tila 31 2 june to 43 6 april in upper karnali 4 5 july to 57 3 january in seti 30 5 may to 11 7 january in bheri and 12 9 june to 25 2 january in karnali main these findings from this study are valuable information for water resources planners and managers for developing location specific strategies even within a single basin for sustainable utilization of water
