17135,due to the fast reaction of superoxide radical o 2 with ozone o3 it has been suggested that o 2 is present at very low concentrations during ozonation therefore while o 2 has been considered a critical chain carrier for promoting o3 decomposition to hydroxyl radicals oh the direct reactions of o 2 with micropollutants have been assumed to be insignificant during ozonation in this study we monitored the exposures of o3 oh and o 2 by following the depletion of o3 p chlorobenzoic acid pcba as oh probe and tetrachloromethane ccl4 as o 2 probe during ozonation of various water matrices surface water groundwater and secondary wastewater effluent for a given water matrix the ratio between oh and o3 exposures rct o 2 and o3 exposures rso as well as o 2 and oh exposures rsh remained almost constant over the entire reaction time this suggests that during ozonation the ratios between the transient concentrations of oh and o3 o 2 and o3 and o 2 and oh were also constant and equaled to the rct rso and rsh respectively based on the o3 oh and o 2 exposures observed during ozonation a chemical kinetic model was proposed to simulate the abatement of ten ozone resistant micropollutants in the three water matrices by ozonation the results indicate that due to the higher concentrations of o 2 than oh rsh 5 8 the reactions with o 2 played a non negligible or even dominant role in the abatement of some micropollutants that have similar or higher o 2 reactivity than oh reactivity e g tetrachloroethylene chloroform and pfoa compared with the previous model that neglected the contribution of o 2 to micropollutant abatement the proposed model more accurately simulated the abatement efficiencies of the test micropollutants during ozonation these results

and industrial solvents in water and wastewater treatment marron et al 2019 ternes et al 2003 von gunten 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone o3 is a selective oxidant and can quickly oxidize micropollutants with electron rich moieties such as olefins activated aromatics and reduced sulfur groups von sonntag and von gunten 2012 hence ozone reactive micropollutants can typically be efficiently eliminated by direct o3 oxidation during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 meanwhile with typical ozone doses applied in ozonation e g 0 5 1 5 mg o3 mg dissolved organic carbon doc ozone resistant micropollutants that have no electron rich moieties can also be abated to certain degrees primarily through reactions with radicals e g hydroxyl radicals oh generated from o3 decomposition in water von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to its high cost effectiveness for micropollutant abatement ozonation has been increasingly integrated in multi barrier treatment trains for micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater utilities worldwide marron et al 2019 miklos et al 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 besides oh a variety of reactive oxygen species ros are generated from o3 decomposition during ozonation such as singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radicals o 2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 among these ros oh has been generally considered the main oxidant for ozone resistant micropollutant abatement during ozonation because of its high oxidation potential e0 2 8 v and non selective reactivity von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in contrast it is conventionally assumed that the direct reactions of 1o2 and o 2 with micropollutants play an insignificant role in their abatement during ozonation on account of the lower reactivity and or concentrations of 1o2 and o 2 than o3 and oh this assumption is probably justifiable in most cases scully and hoigné 1987 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for example 1o2 exhibits similar selectivity toward organics as o3 scully and hoigné 1987 therefore similar to o3 1o2 will contribute negligibly to the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants during ozonation scully and hoigné 1987 tratnyek and hoigne 1991 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 moreover because 1o2 is a weaker oxidant and present in lower concentrations than o3 during ozonation it is understandable that 1o2 also plays a minor role in the abatement of ozone reactive micropollutants compared to o3 scully and hoigné 1987 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 similarly due to the fast reaction of o 2 with o3 eq 1 k 1 1 5 109 m 1 s 1 it has been suggested that once formed o 2 will be quickly consumed in the radical chain reactions that promote o3 decomposition to oh eqs 1 3 k 2 1 4 103 s 1 elliot and mccracken 1989 k 3 9 4 107 s 1 zehavi and rabani 1971 resulting in very low steady o 2 concentrations during ozonation staehelin and hoigne 1985 meanwhile the reactivity of o 2 with most organics is significantly lower than that of oh farhataziz and ross 1977 hayyan et al 2016 therefore it has long been assumed that while o 2 is an important chain carrier for promoting o3 decomposition to oh which can then oxidize o3 resistant micropollutants its direct reactions with micropollutants play a negligible role in their abatement during ozonation staehelin and hoigne 1985 1 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 o h 2 o oh o h based on the assumption that micropollutants are mainly abated by o3 and or oh oxidation chemical kinetic models have been developed to predict the abatement of many micropollutants during ozonation acero et al 2000 elovitz and von gunten 1999 lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2016 zucker et al 2016 the results show that by following the o3 and oh exposures observed during ozonation the abatement efficiencies of many micropollutants can be reasonably simulated using the chemical kinetic model eq 4 4 ln p p 0 k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt where k o3 and k oh are the second order rate constant for the reaction of micropollutant p with o3 and oh respectively o 3 dt and oh are the o3 and oh exposures which are defined as the time integrated concentration of o3 and oh over a given reaction period elovitz and von gunten 1999 the consistency between the experimentally measured and model predicted abatement efficiencies corroborates the conventional assumption that o3 and or oh are the main oxidants responsible for micropollutant abatement during ozonation cruz alcalde et al 2019 guo et al 2020 hübner et al 2013 lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2016 nevertheless it should be noted that almost all micropollutants tested in the previous studies have relatively high oh reactivity k oh 1 109 m 1 s 1 which facilitates their abatement by oh oxidation acero et al 2000 hübner et al 2013 lee et al 2014 it is still unclear whether the conventional assumption holds true for the micropollutants that have low o3 and oh reactivity for example electrophilic compounds such as alkyl halides perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos which are often micropollutants of concern in drinking water treatment and wastewater reuse applications glover et al 2018 hayyan et al 2016 martin et al 2016 notably in a recent study guo et al 2021 measured the oh and o 2 exposures during ozonation of a surface water and found the ratio of o 2 and oh exposures remain almost constant at 8 8 during the whole process the constant ratio of o 2 and oh exposures suggests that the ratio of the transient concentrations of o 2 and oh kept stably at 8 8 over the entire ozonation process this finding indicates that unlike the previous assumption o 2 is actually present at higher concentrations than oh during ozonation o 2 is a versatile reactant and can act as either a reductant or an oxidant in the reactions with many compounds hayyan et al 2016 in particular due to its strong nucleophilicity o 2 reacts actively with some electrophilic compounds e g chloroform chcl3 at similar or even higher rates than oh guo et al 2021 hayyan et al 2016 considering the higher concentrations of o 2 than oh we therefore hypothesized that during ozonation o 2 may play a non negligible role in the abatement of some micropollutants e g electrophilic compounds that have relatively high o 2 reactivity note that although there are increasing studies recently suggesting o 2 as the main ros for pollutant abatement during ozone based processes e g heterogeneous catalytic ozonation wang and chen 2020 yu et al 2020 the findings of most studies are probably debatable artifact because the method used to evaluate o 2 in these studies involves adding high concentration o 2 scavengers typically p benzoquinone to the system which will fundamentally change the reaction mechanisms of the system and thus result in misleading conclusions guo et al 2021 therefore the role of o 2 in ozone based processes has yet to be evaluated by more convincible methodologies the main objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the role of o 2 in micropollutant abatement during ozonation based on the probe approach and chemical kinetic model several ozone resistant compounds that have varying oh and o 2 reactivity were selected as model micropollutants and spiked in various water matrices groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent which were then treated by ozonation under conditions simulating real water and wastewater treatment during ozonation the oh and o 2 exposures were determined by using p chlorobenzoic acid pcba and tetrachloromethane ccl4 as the oh and o 2 probe respectively a chemical kinetic model was then developed based on the observed oh and o 2 exposures to analyze the relative contributions of oh and o 2 for micropollutant abatement during ozonation the results provide new insight into the role of o 2 and the mechanisms of micropollutant abatement in ozonation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples 1 3 dichlorobenzene m dcb pcba potassium indigotrisulfonate diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid detapac xanthine and xanthine oxidase xod with purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich nitrotetrazolium blue chloride nbt2 atrazine deethlyatrazine diquat and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa with purity 98 were obtained from aladdin all other reagents e g chloroform chcl3 tetranitromethane tnm were of analytical grade and purchased from beijing chemical works co china ozone stock solutions were prepared by bubbling o3 and o2 mixtures through milli q water cooled in an ice bath three types of water samples were used for ozonation experiments in this study including a groundwater a surface water from a reservoir and a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in beijing the main water quality parameters of the three water matrices are summarized in table 1 to facilitate the evaluation of micropollutant abatement during ozonation small volumes of micropollutant stock solutions were spiked in the water samples to achieve an initial concentration of 50 100 µg l for each micropollutant in addition 100 µg l of pcba and 50 µg l of ccl4 were spiked in the waters as oh probe and o 2 probe respectively 2 2 ozonation ozonation experiments were conducted in batch mode using similar experimental setup described previously guo et al 2021 approximately 250 ml of the three water samples were added in an airtight acrylic column reactor appropriate volumes of freshly prepared ozone stock solutions were then dosed in the waters to obtain desired specific ozone doses of 1 0 3 0 mg o3 mg doc to initiate oxidation treatment all experiments were conducted twice at 15 1 c 2 3 analytical methods ozone concentration was measured with indigo method

order rate constant for the reaction of o 2 with test compounds k o 2 was measured using the competition kinetics method in a xanthine xanthine oxidase system guo et al 2021 pasternack and halliwell 1979 see text s1 for detailed description the second order rate constant for the reaction of o3 with pfoa or pfos were measured with competition kinetics method using pcba as a reference compound von sonntag and von gunten 2012 2 4 model development during ozonation o3 oh and o 2 exposures were measured to represent the oxidation capacity of o3 oh and o 2 in the system elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021 the o3 exposures o 3 dt were obtained from the time integrated o3 concentration over a given reaction time using eq 5 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while the oh exposures oh dt and o 2 exposures o 2 dt were calculated using the binary equations eqs 6 and 7 according to the observed abatement efficiency of pcba and ccl4 during ozonation guo et al 2021 pcba and ccl4 were selected as the oh and o 2 probe because they react with the target ros at significantly higher rates than with other ros in the system see table 2 which is helpful to minimize the interference of other ros elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021 based on the obtained o3 oh and o 2 exposures a chemical kinetic model eq 8 was proposed to simulate the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants during

results and discussion 3 1 rate constants for the reaction of o 2 with test compounds as reported in table 2 the second order rate constants for the reaction of the test compounds with o 2 k o 2 vary significantly from 4 2 104 m 1 s 1 to 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 this observation can be mainly attributed to the fact that o 2 reacts selectively with various compounds through different mechanisms e g nucleophilic substitution and proton abstraction hayyan et al 2016 due to its high nucleophilicity o 2 reacts quickly with the halogenated hydrocarbons tested in this study k o 2 of 107 109 m 1 s 1 for m dcb c2cl4 chcl3 and ccl4 in contrast o 2 is a relative stable radical and can only slowly react with the herbicides k o 2 of 105 m 1 s 1 for atrazine deethylatrazine and diquat hayyan et al 2016 in addition o 2 exhibits a significantly higher reactivity with pfoa k o 2 6 4 107 m 1 s 1 than pfos k o 2 4 2 104 m 1 s 1 this result is consistent with the previous findings that o 2 can quickly degrade pfoa but not pfos mitchell et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 it has been suggested that o 2 may react with pfoa through the similar mechanism reported for perhalogenated compounds such as ccl4 and hexachloroethane furman et al 2009 mitchell et al 2013 however o 2 is not reactive with pfos due to the high reaction barrier of pfos zhang et al 2017 overall the data shown in table 2 suggest that o 2 may contribute to different extent to the abatement of the various test compounds during ozonation unlike o 2 oh is a significantly less selective oxidant with k oh typically ranging from 108 to 1010 m 1 s 1 for most organics buxton et al 1988 nevertheless oh is not very reactive with alkyl halides pfoa and pfos hayyan et al 2016 plumlee et al 2009 as reported in table 2 the k oh of chcl3 ccl4 pfoa and pfos are generally within the range of 105 107 m 1 s 1 which are about one to three orders of magnitude lower than the k o 2 of these compounds 3 2 ozonation of the selected surface water with varying o3 doses fig 1 a shows that during ozonation the concentrations of pcba and ccl4 decreased in parallel with decreasing o3 concentrations based on the observed depletion curves of o3 pcba and ccl4 o3 exposures were obtained from the time integrated o3 concentration over a given treatment time using eq 5 while oh and o 2 exposures were back calculated according to the abatement efficiency of pcba and ccl4 by solving the binary equations eqs 6 and 7 assuming k cc l 4 oh 2 106 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig 1b o3 oh and o 2 exposures increased simultaneously during ozonation when ozone depletion was completed at 50 min of ozonation o3 oh and o 2 exposures reached approximately 7 4 10 2 2 4 10 10 and 1 4 10 9 m s respectively notably fig 1c shows that the ratios between o3 oh and o 2 exposures measured at each sampling time remained almost constant during the entire ozonation time similar observations have been reported in previous studies where the ratio of oh exposure and o3 exposure and the ratio of o 2 exposures and o3 exposure have been defined as the rct elovitz and von gunten 1999 and the rso guo et al 2021 respectively eqs 9 and 10 in addition a term rsh is defined herein to describe the ratio of o 2 exposure and oh exposure eq 11 9 r ct oh dt o 3 dt oh o 3 10 r so o 2 dt o 3 dt o 2 o 3 11 r sh o 2 dt oh dt o 2 oh because the rct rso and rsh are constant and independent of the reaction time they also represent the ratios of transient o3 oh and o 2 concentrations at any time during the ozonation process see eqs 9 11 elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021 as shown in fig 1c the rct rso and rsh values were 2 8 10 9 1 6 10 8 and 6 1 during ozonation of the selected surface water respectively based on the constant rct and rso values and o3 concentrations observed during ozonation the evolutions of oh and o 2 concentrations during ozonation of the selected surface water are modelled using eq 9 and 10 and shown in fig 1d as fig 1d shows oh and o 2 concentrations decreased in parallel with decreasing o3 concentrations during the ozonation process over the entire reaction time the transient concentrations of o3 were about 9 and 8 orders of magnitude higher than that of oh and o 2 respectively meanwhile the transient concentration of o 2 was 6 1 times higher than that of oh fig 1d the higher concentrations of o 2 than oh can be probably attributed to the lower reactivity of o 2 than oh with most organics and inorganics e g carbonate hayyan et al 2016 which results in less significant scavenging of o 2 by the water matrix during ozonation note that due to its high oh reactivity k oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 and low o3 reactivity k o3 0 1 m 1 s 1 pcba is the most used oh probe for quantifying oh exposures during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in previous studies it is conventionally assumed that pcba is exclusively abated by oh oxidation during ozonation whereas the contribution of o 2 to pcba abatement is overlooked therefore oh exposure is conventionally calculated using eq 12 based on only the abatement efficiency of pcba during ozonation elovitz and von gunten 1999 12 oh dt ln pcba 0 pcba t k oh pcba for comparison oh exposures calculated using eq 12 are also shown in fig 1b the result indicates that the oh exposure calculated using the previous model eq 12 is 11 higher than that calculated using the modified model eqs 6 and 7 this difference can be mainly attributed to the fact that the contribution of o 2 to pcba abatement has been mistakenly credited to oh oxidation in the previous model which thus leads to an overestimation of oh exposure see fig 1b for more discussion 3 3 modelling micropollutant abatement eight ozone resistant compounds were selected as model micropollutants for the validation of the proposed model see table 2 pcba and ccl4 served as the oh and o 2 probe according to their k oh and k o 2 the ten compounds were classified into four groups group i has both high oh and o 2 reactivity k oh 108 m 1 s 1 and k o 2 107 m 1 s 1 group ii has high oh reactivity but low o 2 reactivity k oh 108 m 1 s 1 and k o 2 107 m 1 s 1 group iii has low oh reactivity but high o 2 reactivity k oh 108 m 1 s 1 and k o 2 107 m 1 s 1 group iv has both low oh and o 2 reactivity k oh 108 m 1 s 1 and k o 2 107 m 1 s 1 due to their differing oh and o 2 reactivity these micropollutants were abated at different kinetics and to different degrees during ozonation of the selected surface water in general the abatement kinetics and efficiencies decreased in the order of group i group ii group iii group iv see fig 2 for c2cl4 atrazine ccl3 and pfos as an example for each group see si fig s4 for the other compounds based on the k o3 k oh and k o 2 of the test micropollutants table 2 as well as the o3 oh and o 2 exposures observed during ozonation fig 1b the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants are modelled using eq 8 and compared to the experimentally measured abatement efficiencies in fig 3 specific o3 dose of 3 mg o3 mg doc and si figs s5 and s6 specific o3 doses of 1 and 2 mg o3 mg doc in addition the abatement efficiencies are also modelled using the previous model eq 4 based on the oh exposures determined by eq 12 as shown in fig 3 the modified model eq 8 reasonably simulated the abatement of test compounds in the four groups during ozonation of the selected surface water r2 0 917 0 986 with the exception of pfos sxy 1 54 4 87 in comparison the previous model eq 4 well simulated the abatement efficiencies of group ii compounds and the group i compound mdcb r2 0 928 0 974 sxy 1 98 5 16 but underestimate to different extent the abatement efficiencies of group iii compounds and the group i compound c2cl4 r2 2 1 0 377 sxy 7 87 22 9 these observations indicate that the modified model which further includes the contribution of o 2 reactions to micropollutant abatement into the previous model can better simulate the abatement of micropollutants especially those having high o 2 reactivity and low oh reactivity e g group iii compounds note that both models well simulated the ineffective abatement of pfos during ozonation fig 3h nevertheless the coefficients of correlation of the simulations are negative these results can be mainly attributed to the small change in pfos concentrations during ozonation 5 relative change which caused large relative error in measuring its abatement efficiency by lc ms ms to get more insight into the different simulation results of the previous and modified models the items in the two models k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt and k o 2 o 2 dt were calculated based on the overall o3 oh and o 2 exposures observed at complete ozone depletion during ozonation see fig 4 a note that the k oh oh dt item in the previous and modified models were calculated based on oh exposures obtained from eq 12 and the binary eqs 6 and 7 respectively see fig 1b as shown in fig 4a the value of k o 3 o 3 dt was significantly smaller than that of k oh oh dt and or k o 2 o 2 dt for all micropollutants tested in this study this observation indicates that because of the low k o3 values of the test compounds k o3 3 m 1 s 1 see table 2 o3 oxidation contributed negligibly to their abatement during ozonation of the selected surface water in contrast the test micropollutants were mainly abated by oh oxidation and or o 2 reaction in contrast to the modified model the contribution of o 2 reaction to micropollutant abatement is not considered in the previous model on the other hand neglecting o 2 contribution to pcba the oh probe abatement leads to an overestimation of oh exposures by the previous model see fig 1b consequently for a given micropollutant the k oh oh dt value calculated using the previous model was 11 higher than that by the modified model which results in an overestimation of oh contribution to micropollutant abatement in the previous model compared to the modified model see fig 4a depending on the oh and o 2 reactivity of micropollutants the two effects neglect of o 2 contribution and overestimation of oh contribution caused different influences on the modeling results of the previous model see discussion below as reported in table 2 group ii compounds atrazine deethylatrazine and diquat have significantly higher oh reactivity than o 2 reactivity k oh k o 2 3810 5854 therefore although the o 2 exposure was 6 1 times higher than the oh exposure fig 1b the k oh oh dt value is considerably larger than the k o 2 o 2 dt value fig 4a therefore neglecting the contribution of o 2 reaction to micropollutant abatement does not considerably influence the modeling results consequently both the previous model eq 4 and the modified model eq 8 similarly simulated the abatement efficiency of group ii compounds in contrast group iii compounds pfoa chcl3 and ccl4 have a lower oh reactivity than o 2 reactivity k oh k o 2 0 002 0 23 see table 2 this difference together with the fact that o 2 exposure was 6 1 times higher than oh exposure during ozonation resulted in the k oh oh dt value to be substantially smaller than the k o 2 o 2 dt value for the group iii micropollutants fig 4a hence the neglected o 2 contribution cannot be counterbalanced by the overestimated oh contribution for the group iii compounds thus the previous model considerably underestimated the abatement efficiencies of group iii compounds compared to the modified model and the experimentally measured results fig 4a for group i compounds mdcb pcba and c2cl4 which show high oh and o 2 reactivity both the previous and modified model reasonably simulated the abatement efficiencies of mdcb and pcba fig 4a however the previous model considerably underestimated the abatement efficiencies of c2cl4 compared to the modified model fig 4a this difference can be mainly attributed to the higher k oh k o 2 ratio of mdcb and pcba than c2cl4 81 4 and 58 1 vs 5 6 see table 2 consequently the neglected o 2 contribution can be adequately compensated by the overestimated oh contribution during the simulation of mdcb abatement by the previous model but not during the simulation of c2cl4 abatement see fig 4a the group iv compound pfos has low reactivity toward o3 oh and o 2 hence it was hardly removed by ozonation with only 3 5 abatement efficiency being obtained at the high specific ozone dose of 3 mg o3 mg doc fig 4a both the previous and modified model predicted the inefficient removal of pfos based on the modified model the relative contributions of o 2 reaction f o 2 as well as o3 oxidation fo3 oh oxidation f oh to micropollutant abatement are estimated using eqs 13 15 see fig 4b the results show that during ozonation o 2 can contribute to different extent to the abatement of various micropollutants e g 2 for m dcb 50 for c2cl4 and 90 for chcl3 13 f o 3 k o 3 o 3 dt k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt 14 f oh k oh oh dt k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt 15 f o 2 k o 2 o 2 dt k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt as shown in fig 1b o3 exposures were about 9 and 8 orders of magnitude higher than oh and o 2 exposures during ozonation of the selected surface water see rct and rso in table 3 considering that k oh and k o 2 of most compounds are typically lower than 1010 and 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 hayyan et al 2016 eq 13 suggests that micropollutants with relatively high ozone reactivity e g k o3 500 m 1 s 1 will be mainly abated by the direct o3 oxidation during ozonation in agreement with the general findings of previous studies guo et al 2018 lee et al 2014 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang et al 2018 in contrast ozone resistant micropollutants e g k o3 10 m 1 s 1 will be mainly abated by the reaction with oh and or o 2 given that o 2 exposures are about 5 10 times higher than oh exposures during ozonation see rsh in table 3 and the recent study of guo et al 2021 the model suggests that most ozone resistant micropollutants will be primarily abated by oh oxidation because the k oh of most compounds are typically two or several orders of magnitude higher than their k o 2 bielski 1985 buxton et al 1988 farhataziz and ross 1977 however for some ozone resistant micropollutants that have similar or higher k o 2 than k oh e g alkyl halides and pfoa o 2 will be the main species responsible for their abatement consistent with this inference fig 4b shows that as the k oh k o 2 ratio of micropollutants decreased from 5854 atrazine to 0 002 ccl4 f oh decreased from 95 to 0 1 while f o 2 increased progressively from 1 to 95 overall the results presented above indicate that o 2 plays a critical role in ozone resistant micropollutant abatement during ozonation besides acting as the chain carrier for promoting o3 transformation to oh o 2 can also directly react with micropollutants resulting in their abatement due to the high concentrations mg l level and o 2 reactivity of o3 k 1 5 109 m 1 s 1 most o 2 generated in the system is expected to quickly react with o3 to produce oh which results in low concentrations of o 2 during ozonation e g 10 9 10 10 mm see fig 1d nevertheless the direct reaction with o 2 can still contribute non negligibly or even dominantly to the abatement of some micropollutants that have high o 2 e g alkyl halides the previous model eq 4 which neglects the direct reaction of o 2 with micropollutants will thus considerably underestimate the abatement efficiencies of o 2 reactive micropollutants during ozonation by including the contribution of o 2 for micropollutant abatement into the previous model the modified model allows better generalized modeling of the abatement of various micropollutants especially those having relatively low o3 and oh reactivity but high o 2 reactivity e g alkyl halides and pfoa in addition this model provides a useful way to estimate the transient concentrations of oh and o 2 during ozonation which are difficult to directly measure because of their extremely short lifetime in water 3 4 effects of water matrix on the ratios of o3 oh and o 2 exposures to validate the relationship among o3 oh and o 2 concentrations represented by eqs 9 11 rct rso and rhs in different water matrices ozonation experiments were conducted in three water matrices surface water groundwater and secondary wastewater effluent that had different water constituents see table 1 as shown in figs 5 a c for the same specific ozone dose of 1 mg o3 mg doc complete ozone depleted was attained in 40 30 and 10 min during ozonation of the selected groundwater surface water and wastewater respectively the different o3 depletion kinetics can be mainly attributed to the differing dom and carbonate contents of the three water matrices as reported in table 1 the secondary wastewater had a considerably higher doc concentration than the groundwater and surface water in addition the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva i e the ratio of uv254 of the wastewater was substantially higher than that of the groundwater and surface water these differences indicate that the dom in the selected wastewater had more uv254 absorbing moieties e g olefins and aromatic rings which are also often ozone reactive moieties of dom per unit mass of doc hua and reckhow 2013 mao et al 2018 on the other hand the groundwater had a considerably higher bicarbonate concentration than the surface water and wastewater table 1 during ozonation dom can promote o3 depletion by acting as initiators and promotors in the radical chain reactions of o3 decomposition to oh staehelin and hoigne 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in contrast carbonate can increase the ozone stability by acting as inhibitors of the radical chain reactions staehelin and hoigne 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to the different dom and carbonate contents of the three water matrices shown in table 1 ozone depletion occurred fastest in the selected secondary wastewater but slowest in the selected groundwater figs 5a c similar to what has been observed in fig 1b the concentrations of pcba and ccl4 decreased in parallel with decreasing o3 concentrations during ozonation of the three water matrices figs 5a c based on the depletion curves of o3 pcba and ccl4 the exposures of o3 oh and o 2 during ozonation of the three water samples were calculated using eqs 5 6 and 7 and shown in si fig s7 as shown in figs 5d f the ratios among o3 oh and o 2 exposures i e rct rso and rsh remained almost constant during ozonation of all three water matrices these observations confirm that the linear relationships among o3 oh and o 2 concentrations represented by eqs 9 11 rct rso and rhs hold true in the different water matrices consequently oh and o 2 concentrations during ozonation of the three water matrices can be estimated from o3 concentrations as well as the rct and rso observed during ozonation see figs 5g i similar to what has been shown in fig 1d the transient concentrations of o 2 were about 6 8 times higher than those of oh during ozonation of the three water matrices notably for the same specific ozone dose of 1 mg o3 mg doc the rct and rso value of the selected groundwater were considerably lower than that of the surface water and secondary effluent table 3 the exact reasons for the difference are still unknown and can be possibly attributed partly to the higher bicarbonate hco3 concentration of the selected groundwater than the other two water matrices table 1 in the ph range of the three water matrices 7 8 8 4 carbonate exists mainly as hco3 which is a well known oh scavenger k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 as the reaction of hco3 with oh does not lead to o 2 eq 16 the increase of hco3 concentration in the water matrix will inhibit the radical chain reactions that are important for oh and o 2 formation during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 moreover hco3 can also scavenge o 2 generated in the system eq 17 k 1 2 106 m 1 s 1 farhataziz and ross 1977 these effects may account for the lower rct and rso value of the selected groundwater compared to the surface water and secondary effluent overall the results shown in table 3 suggest that the water matrix has a considerable effect on the formation transformation and transient concentrations of oh and o 2 during ozonation as the o 2 rate constants of many organic and inorganics e g dom and chloride that are commonly present in natural water and wastewater are still unknown additional studies are needed to systematically evaluate the effects of water matrix on o 2 during ozone based processes 16 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o 17 hco 3 o 2 co 3 ho 2 based on the overall o3 oh and o 2 exposures observed at complete ozone depletion during ozonation of the three water matrices see table 3 the abatement efficiencies of test micropollutants were simulated using the modified model eq 8 and compared to the experimentally measured abatement efficiencies in fig 6 as shown the modified model reasonably simulated the abatement efficiencies of the various micropollutants during ozonation of the three water samples which confirms the applicability of the modified model in various water matrices due to their significantly higher oh reactivity than o 2 reactivity k oh k o 2 50 see table 2 group ii compounds atrazine deethylatrazine and diquat and the group i compounds mdcb and pcba were abated mainly by oh oxidation during ozonation of the three water samples figs 6a c and fig s8 in contrast group iii compounds chcl3 ccl4 and pfoa were essentially abated by the reactions with o 2 due to their lower oh reactivity than o 2 reactivity k oh k o 2 0 5 for c2cl4 oh and o 2 contributed almost equally to its abatement because the k oh oh dt and k o 2 o 2 dt values of c2cl4 were generally comparable 3 5 implications overall the results of this study confirm that o 2 can play a non negligible or even dominant role in the abatement of some ozone resistant micropollutants e g alkyl halides that have similar or higher o 2 reactivity than oh reactivity during ozonation nevertheless it should be noted that the concentration of o 2 is just about 5 8 times higher than that of oh under typical condition of ozonation of water and wastewater table 3 considering that the oh rate constant of most organics is typically orders of magnitude higher than their o 2 oh is expected to be the main ros for most ozone resistant micropollutant abatement during ozonation as conventionally assumed moreover although catalytic ozonation can moderately increase the ratio of o 2 and oh concentrations e g the rsh value increased from 8 8 during ozonation of a surface water to 11 2 during catalytic ozonation with manganese dioxide guo et al 2021 it is unlikely that o 2 rather than oh will be main ros for the abatement of many micropollutants e g pcba and atrazine as suggested in the previous catalytic ozonation studies wang et al 2020 yu et al 2020 based on the probe approach and chemical kinetic model shown in this work further studies will be conducted to verify the role of o 2 for micropollutants in other ozone based processes such as heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrate that during ozonation the ratios among o3 oh and o 2 concentrations remain almost constant over the entire reaction time specifically the ratios between the concentrations of oh and o3 rct o 2 and o3 rso as well as o 2 and oh rsh were in the range of 10 8 10 9 10 7 10 8 and 5 8 during ozonation of the selected groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent due to the higher concentrations of o 2 than oh o 2 can contribute non negligibly or even dominantly to the abatement of micropollutants that have high o 2 reactivity such as c2cl4 chcl3 ccl4 and pfoa during ozonation based on the o3 oh and o 2 rate constants of micropollutants and the o3 oh and o 2 exposures observed during ozonation the modified chemical kinetic model satisfactorily simulated the abatement of various micropollutants during ozonation including those e g alkyl halides and pfoa that cannot be well simulated by the previous model in which the contribution of o 2 to micropollutant abatement is neglected the modified model can thus provide a useful tool for

17135,due to the fast reaction of superoxide radical o 2 with ozone o3 it has been suggested that o 2 is present at very low concentrations during ozonation therefore while o 2 has been considered a critical chain carrier for promoting o3 decomposition to hydroxyl radicals oh the direct reactions of o 2 with micropollutants have been assumed to be insignificant during ozonation in this study we monitored the exposures of o3 oh and o 2 by following the depletion of o3 p chlorobenzoic acid pcba as oh probe and tetrachloromethane ccl4 as o 2 probe during ozonation of various water matrices surface water groundwater and secondary wastewater effluent for a given water matrix the ratio between oh and o3 exposures rct o 2 and o3 exposures rso as well as o 2 and oh exposures rsh remained almost constant over the entire reaction time this suggests that during ozonation the ratios between the transient concentrations of oh and o3 o 2 and o3 and o 2 and oh were also constant and equaled to the rct rso and rsh respectively based on the o3 oh and o 2 exposures observed during ozonation a chemical kinetic model was proposed to simulate the abatement of ten ozone resistant micropollutants in the three water matrices by ozonation the results indicate that due to the higher concentrations of o 2 than oh rsh 5 8 the reactions with o 2 played a non negligible or even dominant role in the abatement of some micropollutants that have similar or higher o 2 reactivity than oh reactivity e g tetrachloroethylene chloroform and pfoa compared with the previous model that neglected the contribution of o 2 to micropollutant abatement the proposed model more accurately simulated the abatement efficiencies of the test micropollutants during ozonation these results

and industrial solvents in water and wastewater treatment marron et al 2019 ternes et al 2003 von gunten 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone o3 is a selective oxidant and can quickly oxidize micropollutants with electron rich moieties such as olefins activated aromatics and reduced sulfur groups von sonntag and von gunten 2012 hence ozone reactive micropollutants can typically be

ozone resistant micropollutants that have no electron rich moieties can also be abated to certain degrees primarily through reactions with radicals e g hydroxyl radicals oh generated from o3 decomposition in water von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to its high cost effectiveness for micropollutant abatement ozonation has been increasingly integrated in multi barrier treatment trains for micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater utilities worldwide marron et al 2019 miklos et al 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 besides oh a variety of reactive oxygen species ros are generated from o3 decomposition during ozonation such as singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radicals o 2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 among these ros oh has been generally considered the main oxidant for ozone resistant micropollutant abatement during ozonation because of its high oxidation potential e0 2 8 v and non selective reactivity von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in contrast it is conventionally assumed that the direct reactions of 1o2 and o 2 with micropollutants play an insignificant role in their abatement during ozonation on account of the lower reactivity and or concentrations of 1o2 and o 2 than o3 and oh this assumption is probably justifiable in most cases scully and hoigné 1987 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for example 1o2 exhibits similar selectivity toward organics as o3 scully and hoigné 1987 therefore similar to o3 1o2 will contribute negligibly to the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants during ozonation scully and hoigné 1987 tratnyek and hoigne 1991 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 moreover because 1o2 is a weaker oxidant and present in lower concentrations than o3 during ozonation it is understandable that 1o2 also plays a minor role in the abatement of ozone reactive micropollutants compared to o3 scully and hoigné 1987 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 similarly due to the fast reaction of o 2 with o3 eq 1 k 1 1 5 109 m 1 s 1 it has been suggested that once formed o 2 will be quickly consumed in the radical chain reactions that promote o3 decomposition to oh eqs 1 3 k 2 1 4 103 s 1 elliot and mccracken 1989 k 3 9 4 107 s 1 zehavi and rabani 1971 resulting in very low steady o 2 concentrations during ozonation staehelin and hoigne 1985 meanwhile the reactivity of o 2 with most organics is significantly lower than that of oh farhataziz and ross 1977 hayyan et al 2016 therefore it has long been assumed that while o 2 is an important chain carrier for promoting o3 decomposition to oh which can then oxidize o3 resistant micropollutants its direct reactions with micropollutants play a negligible role in their abatement during ozonation staehelin and hoigne 1985 1 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 o h 2 o oh o h based on the assumption that micropollutants are mainly abated by o3 and or oh oxidation chemical kinetic models have been developed to predict the abatement of many micropollutants during ozonation acero et al 2000 elovitz and von gunten 1999 lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2016 zucker et al 2016 the results show that by following the o3 and oh exposures observed during ozonation the abatement efficiencies of many micropollutants can be reasonably simulated using the chemical kinetic model eq 4 4 ln p p 0 k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt where k o3 and k oh are the second order rate constant for the reaction of micropollutant p with o3 and oh respectively o 3 dt and oh are the o3 and oh exposures which are defined as the time integrated concentration of o3 and oh over a given reaction period elovitz and von gunten 1999 the consistency between the experimentally measured and model predicted abatement efficiencies corroborates the conventional assumption that o3 and or oh are the main oxidants responsible for micropollutant abatement during ozonation cruz alcalde et al 2019 guo et al 2020 hübner et al 2013 lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2016 nevertheless it should be noted that almost all micropollutants tested in the previous studies have relatively high oh reactivity k oh 1 109 m 1 s 1 which facilitates their abatement by oh oxidation acero et al 2000 hübner et al 2013 lee et al 2014 it is still unclear whether the conventional assumption holds true for the micropollutants that have low o3 and oh reactivity for example electrophilic compounds such as alkyl halides perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos which are often micropollutants of concern in drinking water treatment and wastewater reuse applications glover et al 2018 hayyan et al 2016 martin et al 2016 notably in a recent study guo et al 2021 measured the oh and o 2 exposures during ozonation of a surface water and found the ratio of o 2 and oh exposures remain almost constant at 8 8 during the whole process the constant ratio of o 2 and oh exposures suggests that the ratio of the transient concentrations of o 2 and oh kept stably at 8 8 over the entire ozonation process this finding indicates that unlike the previous assumption o 2 is actually present at higher concentrations than oh during ozonation o 2 is a versatile reactant and can act as either a reductant or an oxidant in the reactions with many compounds hayyan et al 2016 in particular due to its strong nucleophilicity o 2 reacts actively with some electrophilic compounds e g chloroform chcl3 at similar or even higher rates than oh guo et al 2021 hayyan et al 2016 considering the higher concentrations of o 2 than oh we therefore hypothesized that during ozonation o 2 may play a non negligible role in the abatement of some micropollutants e g electrophilic compounds that have relatively high o 2 reactivity note that although there are increasing studies recently suggesting o 2 as the main ros for pollutant abatement during ozone based processes e g heterogeneous catalytic ozonation wang and chen 2020 yu et al 2020 the findings of most studies are probably debatable artifact because the method used to evaluate o 2 in these studies involves adding high concentration o 2 scavengers typically p benzoquinone to the system which will fundamentally change the reaction mechanisms of the system and thus result in misleading conclusions guo et al 2021 therefore the role of o 2 in ozone based processes has yet to be evaluated by more convincible methodologies the main objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the role of o 2 in micropollutant abatement during ozonation based on the probe approach and chemical kinetic model several ozone resistant compounds that have varying oh and o 2 reactivity were selected as model micropollutants and spiked in various water matrices groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent which were then treated by ozonation under conditions simulating real water and wastewater treatment during ozonation the oh and o 2 exposures were determined by using p chlorobenzoic acid pcba and tetrachloromethane ccl4 as the oh and o 2 probe respectively a chemical kinetic model was then developed based on the observed oh and o 2 exposures to analyze the relative contributions of oh and o 2 for micropollutant abatement during ozonation the results provide new insight into the role of o 2 and the mechanisms of micropollutant abatement in ozonation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples 1 3 dichlorobenzene m dcb pcba potassium indigotrisulfonate diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid detapac xanthine and xanthine oxidase xod with purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich

tnm were of analytical grade and purchased from beijing chemical works co china ozone stock solutions were prepared by bubbling o3 and o2 mixtures through milli q water cooled in an ice bath three types of water samples were used for ozonation experiments in this study including a groundwater a surface water from a reservoir and a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in beijing the main water quality parameters of the three water matrices are summarized in table 1 to facilitate the evaluation of micropollutant abatement during ozonation small volumes of micropollutant stock solutions were spiked in the water samples to achieve an initial concentration of 50 100 µg l for each micropollutant in addition 100 µg l of pcba and 50 µg l of ccl4 were spiked in the waters as oh probe and o 2 probe respectively 2 2 ozonation ozonation experiments were conducted in batch mode using similar experimental setup described previously guo et al 2021 approximately 250 ml of the three water samples were added in an airtight acrylic column reactor appropriate volumes of freshly prepared ozone stock solutions were then dosed in the waters to obtain desired specific ozone doses of 1 0 3 0 mg o3 mg doc to initiate oxidation treatment all experiments were conducted twice at 15 1 c 2 3 analytical methods ozone concentration was measured with indigo method

guo et al 2021 the o3 exposures o 3 dt were obtained from the time integrated o3 concentration over a given reaction time using eq 5 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while the oh exposures oh dt and o 2 exposures o 2 dt were calculated using the binary equations eqs 6 and 7 according to the observed abatement efficiency of pcba and ccl4 during ozonation guo et al 2021 pcba and ccl4 were selected as the oh and o 2 probe because they react with the target ros at significantly higher rates than with other ros in the system see table 2 which is helpful to minimize the interference of other ros elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021 based on the obtained o3 oh and o 2 exposures a chemical kinetic model eq 8 was proposed to simulate the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants during

results and discussion 3 1 rate constants for the reaction of o 2 with test compounds as reported in table 2 the second order rate constants for the reaction of the test compounds with o 2 k o 2 vary significantly from 4 2 104 m 1 s 1 to 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 this observation can be mainly attributed to the fact that o 2 reacts selectively with various compounds through different mechanisms e g nucleophilic substitution and proton abstraction hayyan et al 2016 due to its high nucleophilicity o 2 reacts quickly with the halogenated hydrocarbons tested in this study k o 2 of 107 109 m 1 s 1 for m dcb c2cl4 chcl3 and ccl4 in contrast o 2 is a relative stable radical and can only slowly react with the herbicides k o 2 of 105 m 1 s 1 for atrazine deethylatrazine and diquat hayyan et al 2016 in addition o 2 exhibits a significantly higher reactivity with pfoa k o 2 6 4 107 m 1 s 1 than pfos k o 2 4 2 104 m 1 s 1 this result is consistent with the previous findings that o 2 can quickly degrade pfoa but not pfos mitchell et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 it has been suggested that o 2 may react with pfoa through the similar mechanism reported for perhalogenated compounds such as ccl4 and hexachloroethane furman et al 2009 mitchell et al 2013 however o 2 is not reactive with pfos due to the high reaction barrier of pfos zhang et al 2017 overall the data shown in table 2 suggest that o 2 may contribute to different extent to the abatement of the various test compounds during ozonation unlike o 2 oh is a significantly less selective oxidant with k oh typically ranging from 108 to 1010 m 1 s 1 for most organics buxton et al 1988 nevertheless oh is not very reactive with alkyl halides pfoa and pfos hayyan et al 2016 plumlee et al 2009 as reported in table 2 the k oh of chcl3 ccl4 pfoa and pfos are generally within the range of 105 107 m 1 s 1 which are about one to three orders of magnitude lower than the k o 2 of these compounds 3 2 ozonation of the selected surface water with varying o3 doses fig 1 a shows that during ozonation the concentrations of pcba and ccl4 decreased in parallel with decreasing o3 concentrations based on the observed depletion curves of o3 pcba and ccl4 o3 exposures were obtained from the time integrated o3 concentration over a given treatment time using eq 5 while oh and o 2 exposures were back calculated according to the abatement efficiency of pcba and ccl4 by solving the binary equations eqs 6 and 7 assuming k cc l 4 oh 2 106 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig 1b o3 oh and o 2 exposures increased simultaneously during ozonation when ozone depletion was completed at 50 min of ozonation o3 oh and o 2 exposures reached approximately 7 4 10 2 2 4 10 10 and 1 4 10 9 m s respectively notably fig 1c shows that the ratios between o3 oh and o 2 exposures measured at each sampling time remained almost constant during the entire ozonation time similar observations have been reported in previous studies where the ratio of oh exposure and o3 exposure and the ratio of o 2 exposures and o3 exposure have been defined as the rct elovitz and von gunten 1999 and the rso guo et al 2021 respectively eqs 9 and 10 in addition a term rsh is defined herein to describe the ratio of o 2 exposure and oh exposure eq 11 9 r ct oh dt o 3 dt oh o 3 10 r so o 2 dt o 3 dt o 2 o 3 11 r sh o 2 dt oh dt o 2 oh because the rct rso and rsh are constant and independent of the reaction time they also represent the ratios of transient o3 oh and o 2 concentrations at any time during the ozonation process see eqs 9 11 elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021 as shown in fig 1c the rct rso and rsh values were 2 8 10 9 1 6 10 8 and 6 1 during ozonation of the selected surface water respectively based on the constant rct and rso values and o3 concentrations observed during ozonation the evolutions of oh and o 2 concentrations during ozonation of the selected surface water are modelled using eq 9 and 10 and shown in fig 1d as fig 1d shows oh and o 2 concentrations decreased in parallel with decreasing o3 concentrations during the ozonation process over the entire reaction time the transient concentrations of o3 were about 9 and 8 orders of magnitude higher than that of oh and o 2 respectively meanwhile the transient concentration of o 2 was 6 1 times higher than that of oh fig 1d the higher concentrations of o 2 than oh can be probably attributed to the lower reactivity of o 2 than oh with most organics and inorganics e g carbonate hayyan et al 2016 which results in less significant scavenging of o 2 by the water matrix during ozonation note that due to its high oh reactivity k oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 and low o3 reactivity k o3 0 1 m 1 s 1 pcba is the most used oh probe for quantifying oh exposures during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in previous studies it is conventionally assumed that pcba is exclusively abated by oh oxidation during ozonation whereas the contribution of o 2 to pcba abatement is overlooked therefore oh exposure is conventionally calculated using eq 12 based on only the abatement efficiency of pcba during ozonation elovitz and von gunten 1999 12 oh dt ln pcba 0 pcba t k oh pcba for comparison oh exposures calculated using eq 12 are also shown in fig 1b the result indicates that the oh exposure calculated using the previous model eq 12 is 11 higher than that calculated using the modified model eqs 6 and 7 this difference can be mainly attributed to the fact that the contribution of o 2 to pcba abatement has been mistakenly credited to oh oxidation in the previous model which thus leads to an overestimation of oh exposure see fig 1b for more discussion 3 3 modelling micropollutant abatement eight ozone resistant compounds were selected as model micropollutants for the validation of the proposed model see table 2 pcba and ccl4 served as the oh and o 2 probe according to their k oh and k o 2 the ten compounds were classified into four groups group i has both high oh and o 2 reactivity k oh 108 m 1 s 1 and k o 2 107 m 1 s 1 group ii has high oh reactivity but low o 2 reactivity k oh 108 m 1 s 1 and k o 2 107 m 1 s 1 group iii has low oh reactivity but high o 2 reactivity k oh 108 m 1 s 1 and k o 2 107 m 1 s 1 group iv has both low oh and o 2 reactivity k oh 108 m 1 s 1 and k o 2 107 m 1 s 1 due to their differing oh and o 2 reactivity these micropollutants were abated at different kinetics and to different degrees during ozonation of the selected surface water in general the abatement kinetics and efficiencies decreased in the order of group i group ii group iii group iv see fig 2 for c2cl4 atrazine ccl3 and pfos as an example for each group see si fig s4 for the other compounds based on the k o3 k oh and k o 2 of the test micropollutants table 2 as well as the o3 oh and o 2 exposures observed during ozonation fig 1b the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants are modelled using eq 8 and compared to the experimentally measured abatement efficiencies in fig 3 specific o3 dose of 3 mg o3 mg doc and si figs s5 and s6 specific o3 doses of 1 and 2 mg o3 mg doc in addition the abatement efficiencies are also modelled using the previous model eq 4 based on the oh exposures determined by eq 12 as shown in fig 3 the modified model eq 8 reasonably simulated the abatement of test compounds in the four groups during ozonation of the selected surface water r2 0 917 0 986 with the exception of pfos sxy 1 54 4 87 in comparison the previous model eq 4 well simulated the abatement efficiencies of group ii compounds and the group i compound mdcb r2 0 928 0 974 sxy 1 98 5 16 but underestimate to different extent the abatement efficiencies of group iii compounds and the group i compound c2cl4 r2 2 1 0 377 sxy 7 87 22 9 these observations indicate that the modified model which further includes the contribution of o 2 reactions to micropollutant abatement into the previous model can better simulate the abatement of micropollutants especially those having high o 2 reactivity and low oh reactivity e g group iii compounds note that both models well simulated the ineffective abatement of pfos during ozonation fig 3h nevertheless the coefficients of correlation of the simulations are negative these results can be mainly attributed to the small change in pfos concentrations during ozonation 5 relative change which caused large relative error in measuring its abatement efficiency by lc ms ms to get more insight into the different simulation results of the previous and modified models the items in the two models k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt and k o 2 o 2 dt were calculated based on the overall o3 oh and o 2 exposures observed at complete ozone depletion during ozonation see fig 4 a note that the k oh oh dt item in the previous and modified models were calculated based on oh exposures obtained from eq 12 and the binary eqs 6 and 7 respectively see fig 1b as shown in fig 4a the value of k o 3 o 3 dt was significantly smaller than that of k oh oh dt and or k o 2 o 2 dt for all micropollutants tested in this study this observation indicates that because of the low k o3 values of the test compounds k o3 3 m 1 s 1 see table 2 o3 oxidation contributed negligibly to their abatement during ozonation of the selected surface water in contrast the test micropollutants were mainly abated by oh oxidation and or o 2 reaction in contrast to the modified model the contribution of o 2 reaction to micropollutant abatement is not considered in the previous model on the other hand neglecting o 2 contribution to pcba the oh probe abatement leads to an overestimation of oh exposures by the previous model see fig 1b consequently for a given micropollutant the k oh oh dt value calculated using the previous model was 11 higher than that by the modified model which results in an overestimation of oh contribution to micropollutant abatement in the previous model compared to the modified model see fig 4a depending on the oh and o 2 reactivity of micropollutants the two effects neglect of o 2 contribution and overestimation of oh contribution caused different influences on the modeling results of the previous model see discussion below as reported in table 2 group ii compounds atrazine deethylatrazine and diquat have significantly higher oh reactivity than o 2 reactivity k oh k o 2 3810 5854 therefore although the o 2 exposure was 6 1 times higher than the oh exposure fig 1b the k oh oh dt value is considerably larger than the k o 2 o 2 dt value fig 4a therefore neglecting the contribution of o 2 reaction to micropollutant abatement does not considerably influence the modeling results consequently both the previous model eq 4 and the modified model eq 8 similarly simulated the abatement efficiency of group ii compounds in contrast group iii compounds pfoa chcl3 and ccl4 have a lower oh reactivity than o 2 reactivity k oh k o 2 0 002 0 23 see table 2 this difference together with the fact that o 2 exposure was 6 1 times higher than oh exposure during ozonation resulted in the k oh oh dt value to be substantially smaller than the k o 2 o 2 dt value for the group iii micropollutants fig 4a hence the neglected o 2 contribution cannot be counterbalanced by the overestimated oh contribution for the group iii compounds thus the previous model considerably underestimated the abatement efficiencies of group iii compounds compared to the modified model and the experimentally measured results fig 4a for group i compounds mdcb pcba and c2cl4 which show high oh and o 2 reactivity both the previous and modified model reasonably simulated the abatement efficiencies of mdcb and pcba fig 4a however the previous model considerably underestimated the abatement efficiencies of c2cl4 compared to the modified model fig 4a this difference can be mainly attributed to the higher k oh k o 2 ratio of mdcb and pcba than c2cl4 81 4 and 58 1 vs 5 6 see table 2 consequently the neglected o 2 contribution can be adequately compensated by the overestimated oh contribution during the simulation of mdcb abatement by the previous model but not during the simulation of c2cl4 abatement see fig 4a the group iv compound pfos has low reactivity toward o3 oh and o 2 hence it was hardly removed by ozonation with only 3 5 abatement efficiency being obtained at the high specific ozone dose of 3 mg o3 mg doc fig 4a both the previous and modified model predicted the inefficient removal of pfos based on the modified model the relative contributions of o 2 reaction f o 2 as well as o3 oxidation fo3 oh oxidation f oh to micropollutant abatement are estimated using eqs 13 15 see fig 4b the results show that during ozonation o 2 can contribute to different extent to the abatement of various micropollutants e g 2 for m dcb 50 for c2cl4 and 90 for chcl3 13 f o 3 k o 3 o 3 dt k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt 14 f oh k oh oh dt k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt 15 f o 2 k o 2 o 2 dt k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt as shown in fig 1b o3 exposures were about 9 and 8 orders of magnitude higher than oh and o 2 exposures during ozonation of the selected surface water see rct and rso in table 3 considering that k oh and k o 2 of most compounds are typically lower than 1010 and 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 hayyan et al 2016 eq 13 suggests that micropollutants with relatively high ozone reactivity e g k o3 500 m 1 s 1 will be mainly abated by the direct o3 oxidation during ozonation in agreement with the general findings of previous studies guo et al 2018 lee et al 2014 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang et al 2018 in contrast ozone resistant micropollutants e g k o3 10 m 1 s 1 will be mainly abated by the reaction with oh and or o 2 given that o 2 exposures are about 5 10 times higher than oh exposures during ozonation see rsh in table 3 and the recent study of guo et al 2021 the model suggests that most ozone resistant micropollutants will be primarily abated by oh oxidation because the k oh of most compounds are typically two or several orders of magnitude higher than their k o 2 bielski 1985 buxton et al 1988 farhataziz and ross 1977 however for some ozone resistant micropollutants that have similar or higher k o 2 than k oh e g alkyl halides and pfoa o 2 will be the main species responsible for their abatement consistent with this inference fig 4b shows that as the k oh k o 2 ratio of micropollutants decreased from 5854 atrazine to 0 002 ccl4 f oh decreased from 95 to 0 1 while f o 2 increased progressively from 1 to 95 overall the results presented above indicate that o 2 plays a critical role in ozone resistant micropollutant abatement during ozonation besides acting as the chain carrier for promoting o3 transformation to oh o 2 can also directly react with micropollutants resulting in their abatement due to the high concentrations mg l level and o 2 reactivity of o3 k 1 5 109 m 1 s 1 most o 2 generated in the system is expected to quickly react with o3 to produce oh which results in low concentrations of o 2 during ozonation e g 10 9 10 10 mm see fig 1d nevertheless the direct reaction with o 2 can still contribute non negligibly or even dominantly to the abatement of some micropollutants that have high o 2 e g alkyl halides the previous model eq 4 which neglects the direct reaction of o 2 with micropollutants will thus considerably underestimate the abatement efficiencies of o 2 reactive micropollutants during ozonation by including the contribution of o 2 for micropollutant abatement into the previous model the modified model allows better generalized modeling of the abatement of various micropollutants especially those having relatively low o3 and oh reactivity but high o 2 reactivity e g alkyl halides and pfoa in addition this model provides a useful way to estimate the transient concentrations of oh and o 2 during ozonation which are difficult to directly measure because of their extremely short lifetime in water 3 4 effects of water matrix on the ratios of o3 oh and o 2 exposures to validate the relationship among o3 oh and o 2 concentrations represented by eqs 9 11 rct rso and rhs in different water matrices ozonation experiments were conducted in three water matrices surface water groundwater and secondary wastewater effluent that had different water constituents see table 1 as shown in figs 5 a c for the same specific ozone dose of 1 mg o3 mg doc complete ozone depleted was attained in 40 30 and 10 min during ozonation of the selected groundwater surface water and wastewater respectively the different o3 depletion kinetics can be mainly attributed to the differing dom and carbonate contents of the three water matrices as reported in table 1 the secondary wastewater had a considerably higher doc concentration than the groundwater and surface water in addition the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva i e the ratio of uv254 of the wastewater was substantially higher than that of the groundwater and surface water these differences indicate that the dom in the selected wastewater had more uv254 absorbing moieties e g olefins and aromatic rings which are also often ozone reactive moieties of dom per unit mass of doc hua and reckhow 2013 mao et al 2018 on the other hand the groundwater had a considerably higher bicarbonate concentration than the surface water and wastewater table 1 during ozonation dom can promote o3 depletion by acting as initiators and promotors in the radical chain reactions of o3 decomposition to oh staehelin and hoigne 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in contrast carbonate can increase the ozone stability by acting as inhibitors of the radical chain reactions staehelin and hoigne 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to the different dom and carbonate contents of the three water matrices shown in table 1 ozone depletion occurred fastest in the selected secondary wastewater but slowest in the selected groundwater figs 5a c similar to what has been observed in fig 1b the concentrations of pcba and ccl4 decreased in parallel with decreasing o3 concentrations during ozonation of the three water matrices figs 5a c based on the depletion curves of o3 pcba and ccl4 the exposures of o3 oh and o 2 during ozonation of the three water samples were calculated using eqs 5 6 and 7 and shown in si fig s7 as shown in figs 5d f the ratios among o3 oh and o 2 exposures i e rct rso and rsh remained almost constant during ozonation of all three water matrices these observations confirm that the linear relationships among o3 oh and o 2 concentrations represented by eqs 9 11 rct rso and rhs hold true in the different water matrices consequently oh and o 2 concentrations during ozonation of the three water matrices can be estimated from o3 concentrations as well as the rct and rso observed during ozonation see figs 5g i similar to what has been shown in fig 1d the transient concentrations of o 2 were about 6 8 times higher than those of oh during ozonation of the three water matrices notably for the same specific ozone dose of 1 mg o3 mg doc the rct and rso value of the selected groundwater were considerably lower than that of the surface water and secondary effluent table 3 the exact reasons for the difference are still unknown and can be possibly attributed partly to the higher bicarbonate hco3 concentration of the selected groundwater than the other two water matrices table 1 in the ph range of the three water matrices 7 8 8 4 carbonate exists mainly as hco3 which is a well known oh scavenger k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 as the reaction of hco3 with oh does not lead to o 2 eq 16 the increase of hco3 concentration in the water matrix will inhibit the radical chain reactions that are important for oh and o 2 formation during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 moreover hco3 can also scavenge o 2 generated in the system eq 17 k 1 2 106 m 1 s 1 farhataziz and ross 1977 these effects may account for the lower rct and rso value of the selected groundwater compared to the surface water and secondary effluent overall the results shown in table 3 suggest that the water matrix has a considerable effect on the formation transformation and transient concentrations of oh and o 2 during ozonation as the o 2 rate constants of many organic and inorganics e g dom and chloride that are commonly present in natural water and wastewater are still unknown additional studies are needed to systematically evaluate the effects of water matrix on o 2 during ozone based processes 16 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o 17 hco 3 o 2 co 3 ho 2 based on the overall o3 oh and o 2 exposures observed at complete ozone depletion during ozonation of the three water matrices see table 3 the abatement efficiencies of test micropollutants were simulated using the modified model eq 8 and compared to the experimentally measured abatement efficiencies in fig 6 as shown the modified model reasonably simulated the abatement efficiencies of the various micropollutants during ozonation of the three water samples which confirms the applicability of the modified model in various water matrices due to their significantly higher oh reactivity than o 2 reactivity k oh k o 2 50 see table 2 group ii compounds atrazine deethylatrazine and diquat and the group i compounds mdcb and pcba were abated mainly by oh oxidation during ozonation of the three water samples figs 6a c and fig s8 in contrast group iii compounds chcl3 ccl4 and pfoa were essentially abated by the reactions with o 2 due to their lower oh reactivity than o 2 reactivity k oh k o 2 0 5 for c2cl4 oh and o 2 contributed almost equally to its abatement because the k oh oh dt and k o 2 o 2 dt values of c2cl4 were generally comparable 3 5 implications overall the results of this study confirm that o 2 can play a non negligible or even dominant role in the abatement of some ozone resistant micropollutants e g alkyl halides that have similar or higher o 2 reactivity than oh reactivity during ozonation nevertheless it should be noted that the concentration of o 2 is just about 5 8 times higher than that of oh under typical condition of ozonation of water and wastewater table 3 considering that the oh rate constant of most organics is typically orders of magnitude higher than their o 2 oh is expected to be the main ros for most ozone resistant micropollutant abatement during ozonation as conventionally assumed moreover although catalytic ozonation can moderately increase the ratio of o 2 and oh concentrations e g the rsh value increased from 8 8 during ozonation of a surface water to 11 2 during catalytic ozonation with manganese dioxide guo et al 2021 it is unlikely that o 2 rather than oh will be main ros for the abatement of many micropollutants e g pcba and atrazine as suggested in the previous catalytic ozonation studies wang et al 2020 yu et al 2020 based on the probe approach and chemical kinetic model shown in this work further studies will be conducted to verify the role of o 2 for micropollutants in other ozone based processes such as heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrate that during ozonation the ratios among o3 oh and o 2 concentrations remain almost constant over the entire reaction time specifically the ratios between the concentrations of oh and o3 rct o 2 and o3 rso as well as o 2 and oh rsh were in the range of 10 8 10 9 10 7 10 8 and 5 8 during ozonation of the selected groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent due to the higher concentrations of o 2 than oh o 2 can contribute non negligibly or even dominantly to the abatement of micropollutants that have high o 2 reactivity such as c2cl4 chcl3 ccl4 and pfoa during ozonation based on the o3 oh and o 2 rate constants of micropollutants and the o3 oh and o 2 exposures observed during ozonation the modified chemical kinetic model satisfactorily simulated the abatement of various micropollutants during ozonation including those e g alkyl halides and pfoa that cannot be well simulated by the previous model in which the contribution of o 2 to micropollutant abatement is neglected the modified model can thus provide a useful tool for revealing the mechanisms and predicting the efficiency of micropollutant abatement during ozonation declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this study is funded by the nsfc project

17136,the effects of anaerobic digestion ad on the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes args are highly related to operational temperature however the removal performance of args in psychrophilic ad and changed temperatures simulating variable seasonal temperatures is poorly understood herein we investigated the fate of args correlated bacterial communities and physicochemical properties of ad operation at psychrophilic 15 mesophilic 35 and temperature changed conditions 15 to 35 and 35 to 15 the results indicated that ammonia release was positively correlated with temperature the mesophilic ad facilitated phosphorous intake and args proliferation and selection with oxytetracycline otc while psychrophilic ad was conducive to the removal and control of args if no otc existed the diversity and composition of ad bacterial communities were influenced more by temperature than otc the dominant genera like candidatus microthrix and acinetobacter had dramatical abundance discrepancies at different temperatures and were obviously positively correlated with args tet39 tetc and mexd mobile genetic elements mges inti insert sequences is and plasmid the physicochemical properties of ad influenced the bacterial richness which in turn significantly correlated with the args abundances therefore args removal could be potentially optimized by eliminating bacterial hosts with deteriorated living conditions and decreased nutrients this study clarified the response of antibiotic resistome to different temperature variation and highlighted the potential strategies for improved args removal in ad keywords antibiotic resistance genes args municipal sludge temperature changes psychrophilic and mesophilic anaerobic digestion mobile genetic elements mges 1 introduction the introduction of antibiotics has benefited a lot to human health over the past decades meanwhile the widely misuse or overuse of antibiotics for livestock and humans make it an emerging and serious threat to human society and global environments due to the induction of known and even novel antibiotic resistance genes args chen et al 2019 zhu et al 2013 at least 23 000 and 25 000 death are related to args per year in the usa and europe lorenzo et al 2018 the death would reach over 10 million and related costs for healthcare would be more than 100 trillion dollars by 2050 per year worldwide shao et al 2018 the aggravated args burden in the environment mainly results from their ubiquitous detection and accelerated proliferation ma et al 2014 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered as the reservoirs of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args where various kinds of bacteria either containing args or potential hosts of args like pathogenic bacteria antibiotic residues and other potential inducers that favor the selection of args are gathered su et al 2018 the rich nutrients and high biomass also facilitate the proliferation high frequency of horizontal gene transfer hgt and occurrence of multi drug resistant bacteria shao et al 2018 however wwtps can sufficiently remove neither args inducers nor args yu et al 2020 args generally adsorb on activated sludge and over 1011 copies g could be accumulated in sewage sludge at final treatment kim et al 2005 mao et al 2015 so far the production of waste activated sludge from wwtps is around 45 million tons by dry weight annually worldwide xu et al 2018a zhang et al 2015 therefore args have large opportunities to transfer into surface waters sediment and soils by sludge disposal brown et al 2020 su et al 2012 wang et al 2019 args have been listed as emerging contaminants due to the persistence and strong spread ability therefore the control and removal of args as much as possible during the wastewater treatment process especially paying more attention to the disposal of sewage sludge is of great importance anaerobic digestion ad has advantages of biomass reduction sludge dewatering enhancement and gas recovery from sludge treatment novak et al 2011 the efficiency of ad yet could be influenced by such operational parameters as temperature hydraulic retention time ph and so on gavala et al 2003 sun et al 2019 in view of args removal during ad temperature can play a critical role tian et al 2019 zou et al 2020 mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad and thermophilic anaerobic digestion tad at temperature ranges of 30 to 38 and 50 to 57 respectively appels et al 2008 have some removal efficiency to args however many wwtps worldwide are located in the moderate climate zone with prevailing low temperature in winter and variable seasonal temperatures dev et al 2019 heating and insulation systems undoubtedly are necessary for the sustainable operation witarsa and lansing 2015 this would increase the operational costs though some energy could be offset psychrophilic ad is recommended particularly for regions where temperatures could be lower than 15 like the winter for northern china lettinga et al 2001 it could be an economically technology for biomethanation dev et al 2019 but few studies have investigated the fate of args with psychrophilic ad in addition the changes of args and their correlation with microbial community and ad physicochemical properties suffering from temperature changes remain unknown in this study sludge ad operated at 15 35 or 15 to 35 35 to 15 was tested the selection of 15 was based on the local climate lanzhou china oxytetracycline otc one of the high frequency detected antibiotics in wwtps huang et al 2019 was selected as a model to illustrate the influence of antibiotic residual on the abundance of args during temperature changed ad process the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the removal of args influenced by ad physicochemical properties ii investigate the fate of args suffered from psychrophilic and mesophilic ad and temperature changes and iii determine the influence of bacterial community composition and diversity on args our results would shed light on the operational optimization of wwtps in case of args removal and supply theoretical explanation for the influence of temperature

other used chemicals were at least of analytical grade 2 2 experimental setup batch ad experiments were conducted with 18 serum bottles each filled with 300 ml of ps 10 mg l of otc 1000 stock solution prepared with methanol was added into the antibiotic treatment group o group but not to the control group n group the operation process was divided into phase i and ii with different temperature treatments 15 or 35 the detailed treatment and group information was shown in table s1 considering a low ad temperature 15 and a relatively high concentration of the sludge the sludge retention time

of ad temperature on the sludge physicochemical factors 3 1 1 variations of nitrogen during ad the initial nitrate nitrite and ammonia were 24 00 2 47 mg l 5 32 1 33 mg l and 57 06 0 73 mg l respectively in the ps nitrate and nitrite were undetectable within 5 d while ammonia concentrations were around 6 4 8 5 times and twice of the s0 for groups at 35 and 15 without and with otc the ammonia concentration had a rapid increase within 18 d at 35 extremely significantly higher than those at 15 p 0 01 meanwhile ammonia concentrations for the otc groups were relatively lower than their counterparts ad at 35 availed the accumulation of ammonia even for groups of o15 35 and n15 in phase ii the concentration of ammonia could be as high as 749 77 16 32 mg l and 759 54 54 23 mg l respectively both o35 15a and o15 15a kept low ammonia formation different from n35a with another peak concentration 535 89 43 19 mg l in total n15a had the highest ammonia release after ad followed by n35a and otc groups fig 1 ab thus both temperature and otc effected the concentration of ammonia in ad system genes taking part in ammonia metabolism had been classified into two parts ammonia formation e g dissimilatory assimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation and ammonia transformation e g nitrification and comammox table s2 the relative abundances of genes encoding ammonia formation had remarkable decline for o35 15a o35 35a and n35a in agreement with the detected ammonia concentration compared with phase i genes related to ammonia transformation increased for o15 15 o35 15 and n35 in phase ii the final tn release had obvious disparities between otc and n groups fig s3 p 0 01 and o15 15a had the fewest tn release suggesting the influence from both low temperature and otc 3 1 2 variations of phosphorus during ad for sludge of the n groups fig 1d tdp had a sharp decrease from 316 44 13 34 mg l to 46 77 1 59 mg l 35 and 53 11 0 93 mg l 15 within 21 d during which n15b had a more rapid tdp loss than that at 35 then the concentration of tdp fluctuated a little at both temperatures on the contrary the tdp loss was relatively faster for o35b than o15b at the same period in comparison with n35b the tdp loss rates of o35b and o15b were faster during 0 to 5 d which may be stimulated by otc however phosphorus release likely occurred in phase ii especially for o15 15a which had nearly twice the concentrations of tdp from the n groups and that of o15b fig 1c with the influence of otc the concentration of tdp kept over 65 mg l for the other three groups whilst the corresponding data was less than 50 mg l for the n groups in phase ii exopolyphosphatase and polyphosphate kinase were reported taking part in phosphorus release and intake respectively xu et al 2020a phosphorus intake was likely relatively lower at low temperature exopolyphosphatase had relatively high abundance for o15 15a and o35 15a in responding to the partial phosphorus release table s2 3 1 3 variations of carbonaceous matters the ph values at 35 were higher than those at 15 fig s1 in the whole ad process in accordance with ammonia production the ph values changed in a range of 6 98 0 06 to 7 55 0 06 for the otc groups a little bit narrower than 7 04 0 03 to 7 87 0 04 for the n groups n35b and o15b had relatively higher cod removal in comparison with n15b and o35b fig s2 perhaps due to more obvious inhibition from otc at 35 interestingly o35 35a had contrastable cod removal with n15a in phase ii while higher compared to those of o15 35a p 0 049 n35a p 0 014 o35 15a p 0 023 and o15 15a p 0 009 respectively the toc release for o35 35a was also relatively higher and data for groups kept at 15 in phase ii was relatively lower than those at 35 fig s3b the tss and vss loss at 35 was higher than data at 15 but the n35 groups were inferior to the o35 groups neither o15 nor o35 showed negative influence on tss loss after temperature changes compared with the n groups fig s2cd however vss loss had been conversely affected by low temperature the methanogenic capacity seemed to be inhibited in psychrophilic ad and otc also showed negative influence leading to the limited methane accumulation fig s2e 3 2 effect of ad operation on bacterial community 3 2 1 variation of bacterial community diversity and structure the basic information of sequencing and biodiversity indices were summarized in si table s3 all indices reflecting the biodiversity evenness and richness displayed an increasing trend from phase i to ii to clarify the difference between each group pca based on the identified otus were analyzed which had 43 2 and 18 7 explanation from axes pc1 and pc2 respectively samples from the n groups were separated with the otc groups in phase i across the axis pc2 fig 2 a groups suffering from different temperatures were basically separated between phases i and ii and samples from s0 clustered with those from phase ii fig 2ac 3 2 2 shift of bacterial community composition a total of 14 bacterial phyla with relative abundance over 1 were identified fig s4 proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and firmicutes were the predominant phyla in all groups which had significant differences between otc and n groups p 0 01 proteobacteria was selectively enriched or maintained while firmicutes had opposite fate for the otc groups actinobacteria dropped obviously for groups o15 15a p 0 03 o15 35a p 0 007 and o35 35a p 0 025 compared with those of phases i bacteroidetes had dramatically increased in all treatments p 0 0004 minority phyla like myxococcota desulfobacterota and acidobacteria occurred extremely increases when temperature changes p 0 01 the increase of temperature benefited the myriad diversity of bacteria communities for the n groups while the influence of temperature changes on bacterial community diversity contacting with otc seemed limited at the genus level fig s5 58 genera had relative abundance over 1 candidatus microthrix dominated in most of tested samples its abundance decreased in all treatment compared between phase ii and i p 0 01 the following top genus was acinetobacter whose abundance in s0 was only 0 44 0 00 acinetobacter had relatively higher abundance 14 in phase i except in group o35b but was dramatically removed in phase ii p 0 01 dojkabacteria and bacteroidetes vadinha17 were highly enriched when operated at 35 while norank f caldilineaceae had relatively higher abundance in otc groups than in n groups norank f saprospiraceae and norank c olb14 had raised abundance during temperature changes of otc groups nearly equal number 14 and 16 for o35 15a and o15 35a of genera had increased abundance after temperature changes in which 6 genera were shared in both groups 19 and 22 genera had boosted abundance for n15a and n35a in comparison with n15b and n35b among them 4 genera unclassified f comamonadaceae thauera norank c olb12 and norank c olb14 shared with the otc groups besides typical polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos including candidatus accumulimonas candidatus accumulibacter and tetrasphaera were also detected 3 2 3 associations between bacterial community and ad physicochemical properties to further understand the bacterial community differences between different treatments rda based on physicochemical parameters was used to reflect the distribution of individual samples fig s6 ammonia with temperature and tdp with temperature had positive correlation with each other temperature and tdp displayed obvious correlation with these community species to a greater extent p 0 01 which were positively correlated with bacterial communities in phase ii especially from proteobacteria and firmicutes ammonia and cod showed positive correlation with phyla actinobacteria and chloroflexi the positive influence of otc to species of the otc groups was obvious 3 3 effect of ad operation on args 3 3 1 variations of args types and relative abundances during ad based on the annotation of high throughput sequence a total of 86 arg subtypes belonging to 14 arg types including beta lactam tetracycline tc rifampin macrolide sulfonamide aminoglycoside streptogramin chloramphenicol quinolone trimethoprim multidrug bacitracin polymyxin and others were detected within all the tested ad samples except args related to bacitracin baca genes conferring resistance to tetracyclines aminoglycoside sulfonamide and beta lactam accounted for most types while args related to chloramphenicol and macrolide generally had relative abundance less than 5 fig 3 and fig s7a for the above six types of args in phase i more args tended to be accumulated at 35 and the lowest and highest relative abundance were corresponding to n15b 29 20 1 4 and n35b 45 90 7 4 the existence of otc went against the removal of args even with longer srt for the groups o15 15 and o35 35 the abundance of above args noticeably increased for o15 35 when temperature changed p 0 011 fig 3 while the abundance obviously decreased for n35 the top abundant tc args were tet39 for groups n15b n35b and o15b and tetc for other groups but all changed to tetc in phase ii similarly tet36 ribosomal protection and tetg efflux pump displayed increased trends in groups n15 n35 and o15 from phase i to ii tetx modify tetracycline had distinct growth for the o35 groups showing more complex resistance mechanism toward otc at 35 fig s8 and table s4 sul1 and sul2 responsible for sulfonamide resistance showed inducible enrichment by otc and sul1 accumulated when temperature changed from 15 to 35 ermf and ermb are args related to macrolides the former one had higher abundances along with time while the latter one had declined at least twice in all treatments cml e3 responsible for chloramphenicol efflux was co selected by otc as shown by their higher abundances in the otc groups fig s8 the relative abundances of baca were all over 50 for all treatments and only had decrease in o15 35a group perhaps relating to its bacterial hosts fig s9a the multidrug args had declined abundances as a whole in comparison with s0 but were greatly enriched in o15 35a and o35 35a typically mexd corresponding to the induction from otc the related args clustered or separated obviously at different temperatures and different phases like bacterial community distribution as shown in pca args of o15b clustered with n15b and n35b at phase i but separated from o35 and samples of phase ii fig 2bd considering the major antibiotic resistance mechanisms these args included genes encoding efflux pump antibiotic inactivity antibiotic target changes and other mechanisms in which efflux pump displayed dominated roles 50 without noticeable changes after temperature changes followed by antibiotic target changes fig s7b 3 3 2 correlations among args and bacterial community the correlations between bacterial community and args were analyzed at two levels with the top abundant phyla and genera based on rda fig 4 actinobacteria firmicutes and proteobacteria are positively related to tet39 and baca but negatively related to sul1 mexd and tetc bacteroidetes showed positive correlation to above args in most samples in phase ii concretely acinetobacter mainly positively related to tet39 baca bl2c bro and sul2 candidatus microthrix also positively related with tet39 and baca dojkabacteria and bacteroidetes vadinha17 positively related to tetc tet36 mexd and sul1 to detailed evaluate the correlation between args and more dominant genera the top abundant args for types beta lactam tetracycline macrolide sulfonamide aminoglycoside chloramphenicol and genera among the top 30 in the relative abundances were selected fig s10 more genera showed negative correlation than positive correlation to tet39 ermf and bl2 veb extremely significantly correlated to more than 10 genera longilinea and unclassified o bacteroidales obviously positively correlated to args responsible for tetracycline sulfonamide macrolide and chloramphenicol resistance and tetrasphaera negatively correlated to above args candidatus microthrix and acinetobacter significantly positively correlated to tet39 and strongly negatively correlated to ermf bl2 veb and mexd besides results from environmental factor regression analysis showed acinetobacter and candidatus microthrix had positive explanation for args fig s11 r2 0 73 and 0 53 p 0 01 3 3 3 correlations among args mges and bacterial community mges generally contain transposon integrons insert sequences iss and plasmid which co exist with args li et al 2017 the relative abundances of integrons is and plasmid identity 70 were in the range of 0 0004 to 0 0007 0 0021 to 0 0062 and 0 23 to 0 44 respectively inti1 was the most abundant integrons and tended to decrease without otc fig 5 inti showed accumulation at 15 in phase i and was apt to be selected by otc the abundance of inti3 was higher in phase ii than that in phase i except o35 15 similarly inti4 had higher abundances in phase ii and lower abundances than that of s0 in phase i p 0 05 n35b had a relatively highest abundance for is and there had some decrease after temperature changes but not for the o35 groups the abundance of plasmid dropped in phase ii compared with those in phase i corresponding to the negative correlation with most ad communities and args in phase ii fig s12 rda showed that most of mges played major roles in shaping args like tet39 sul as well as most ad communities indicating the frequency occurrence of hgt inti3 positively correlated to sul1 mexcd ant erm tet36 and tetc for most ad communities corresponding to its relatively high abundance in phase ii 3 3 4 associations between args and ad physicochemical properties a sem was constructed to explain the effect of tdp ammonia temperature tm ph and bacterial richness on the args abundance dynamics fig 6 the listed factors influencing tc args in view of standardized direct effect showed the following order ammonia λ 0 652 ph λ 0 0 richness λ 0 174 tdp λ 0 181 temperature λ 0 536 while for sulfonamides related args richness λ 0 497 temperature λ 0 487 ammonia λ 0 181 tdp λ 0 092 ph λ 0 0 and for other identified args richness λ 0 623 temperature λ 0 510 tdp λ 0 320 ammonia λ 0 157 ph λ 0 0 the bacterial richness and temperature played major roles in shaping args abundance and subtype especially for tetracycline non related args p 0 001 but their influence trends on tc args tended to be opposite ammonia and tdp also showed striking effect towards args temperature imposed an extremely significantly positive total effect on ammonia and ammonia extremely significantly negatively impacted the bacterial richness p 0 001 4 discussion 4 1 temperature influenced args by altering bacterial community with temperature variation the bacterial community changes reshuffled the args potential hosts tad was generally recommended for its higher args removal than mad bai et al 2019 but some results found contradictory differences compared with mad tad had advantages of reduced microbial community diversity and potentially enhanced removal of args and mges xu et al 2020b but args and mges had the risks of rebound sun et al 2019 a lot of potential hosts from phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and firmicutes were speculated hardly survival in the microbial community during tad tian et al 2019 the fate of args at low temperatures were rarely reported resende et al 2014 previous research showed that biosolids stored statically at 4 10 and 20 for 4 months led to a 3 to 0 5 log increase of sul1 and inti1 which may be attributed to the stimulation of hgt at low temperature miller et al 2014 the highest absolute abundance of args and mges occurred in spring with average temperature 14 3 to 16 5 in a river reservoir system chen et al 2019 this temperature range was similar with the psychrophilic ad in our study and the highest relative abundance of mges coincidently occurred for o15 35b group another research stated otu richness peaked at a mean air temperature around 15 for wwtps sludge wu et al 2019 and the richness from phase ii was in accordance with it only the abundance of dominant bacteroidetes increased during the ad which contained many bacteria correlated with args and mges liao et al 2018 proteobacteria is one of phyla harboring most of the known plasmids and chromosomal integrons and lots of hosts of args like tetracycline beta lactams and aminoglycosides forsberg et al 2014 acinetobacter in this phylum a human pathogen harboring args referring to many antibiotics and multidrug resistance resende et al 2014 yu et al 2020 was nearly eliminated in phase ii it was positively correlated to args referring aminoglycoside sulfonamide and tetracycline in this study as reported previously fig s5 xiong et al 2015 besides it had the ability to biodegrade several sulfonamide antibiotics xia et al 2019 many genera belonging to actinobacteria are antibiotic producers and have args to several types of antibiotics d costa et al 2011 the declined args referring to tc was close related to it firmicutes also contained the dominant bacteria with tetracycline resistance and potential hosts of tetm and tetq zhang and li 2020 the abundance of firmicutes decreased for otc groups while the abundance of tetm had sustained growth illustrating other potential hosts existed despite a selection pressure from low temperatures on dominant potential hosts the hgt may be stimulated for some minorities kretschmer and cohen 1979 achromobacter an opportunistic pathogen and potential sulfamethoxazole degrader was nearly undetectable in phase i but had abundances over 1 in all treatments which could take part in ammonia removal reis et al 2014 other reported potential pathogens abundance over 0 1 like clostridium bacteroides and bacillus had been partly removed whilst collinsella arcobacter and prevotella became more abundant after temperature changes jang et al 2019 for the 58 genera with relative abundance over 1 42 genera had clear gram stain identification in which 16 genera were gram positive g g pathogens and many gram negative g bacteria are more likely otc tolerance in this study g bacteria seemed to be selected more which might be due to the protection from its outer membrane in addition species containing multidrug resistance were difficult to be weeded out briefly low temperature and temperature changes could decrease the abundance of dominant genera but the community richness was maintained potential hosts could be weakened by deteriorating living conditions like temperature 4 2 temperature influenced args by mges and inducers the removal of mges was also pivotal to control args tetm and tetc taking part in ribosomal protection and tetracycline efflux pump were frequently detected in environmental samples and highly related to transposons and inti1 bai et al 2019 they were the top abundance tc args in this study yet no clear decrease was detected at any tested temperatures the co occurrence of tetm and ermb in a transposon taken by clostridium was revealed soge et al 2009 ermf carried by plasmids and ermb embedded in a conjugative transposon showed opposite trends after temperature change the genetic linkage between inti1 and sul1 has been widely confirmed harnisz et al 2020 therefore increasing the spread risk of these args the abundance of sul1 was nearly doubled at 35 than at 15 for otc groups while for sul2 the growth was inferior to sul1 suggesting the co selection among different args besides this was corresponding to the increased abundance of inti1 at 35 fig 5 mges like inti1 inti2 tn916 1545 and iscr1 facilitated the dissemination of args and multidrug resistance and more efficient inhibition of mges contributed a lot to the reduction of args in manure ad huang et al 2019 however the changes of microbial community just slightly affect the abundance of mges compared with args leading to the persistence in sewage sludge and hgt liao et al 2018 the residues of antibiotics other pharmaceuticals and heavy metals are vital factors to args enrichment especially exposure with high concentration in a short time zhang et al 2018 though some researchers suggested weak correlation between antibiotics and args in environmental samples you et al 2018 antibiotics could select the same subtypes args or args with the same resistance mechanism jia et al 2017 otc significantly enriched args referring tc like tetc and tet39 as well as mexd sul1 and sul2 compared with the corresponding n groups p 0 05 the abundances of sul1 and sul2 were relevant to the residue of sulfonamides amoxicillin and tetracycline guo et al 2018 lorenzo et al 2018 longer srt at low temperature spurred the otc selection besides args referring beta lactam generally genetically linked with metal resistance genes to zn cu and as while baca could be co selected by polymyxin and fosfomycin li et al 2017 therefore the elimination of such inducers would facilitate args removal ad combined with other protocols had been applied ionizing radiation shen et al 2019 zero valent iron and the thermal hydrolysis pre treatment improved the removal of antibiotics and further enhanced the removal of args and mges sun et al 2019 in summary the influence of temperature on the abundance of args was complex a higher temperature did not mean better args removal the control and elimination of mges and other inducers are also crucial in real treatments in view of major resistance mechanisms previous research regarded antibiotic deactivation 41 43 as the main mechanism followed by cellular protection 28 29 and efflux pump 23 11 in an integrated wastewater reclamation system yu et al 2020 for an ad treating municipal sewage sludge temperature from 35 to 55 the detected resistance mechanism had similarity with this study and the importance was in the sequence of efflux pump antibiotic target replacement and antibiotic inactivity xu et al 2020b suggesting a limited degradation of otc 4 3 temperature influenced args by nutrients concentration changes the dynamic nutrition transportation and utilization in sludge could also play indirect roles in the fate of args nutrients in wastewater can accelerate args replication on mges previous researches had stated a negative correlation of nutrients with args abundance in saline soil tan et al 2019 the abundances of most tet genes were influenced by the feeding nutrition in a co digested swine waste system couch et al 2019 at 15 most of microorganisms had interrupted metabolism and proliferation leading to a relatively lower args abundance and nutrients removal figs s2 and s3 in contrast 35 is suitable for biomass accumulation and organics consumption making args also more abundant than those of s0 and groups at 15 the addition of otc could stimulate the proliferation of resistance genes and substance assimilation as shown with cod tss and vss removal as for ammonia variation results illustrated that mad had dramatically higher ammonia accumulation which was not greatly influenced by otc more protein synthesis was necessary at low temperature which process assimilated ammonia phosphorus removal and partially release effected by otc and low temperature phosphorus could be used in the formation of extracellular polymeric substances for cell protection and energy storage when encountering with otc and released as energy when nutrition was restricted in a sequencing batch reactor both biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal was inhibited by 2 and 5 mg l tc grabert et al 2018 the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients would facilitate the args elimination the abundance of sul1 and sul2 could also be influenced by ph which could be determined by ammonia and organic acids production acidization could enhance their removal in swine manure lin et al 2020 therefore to improve the args removal during ad both temperature and physicochemical characteristics of the sludge have to be considered fig s13 to our best knowledge this study firstly investigated the fate of args at psychrophilic ad and temperature changes between psychrophilic 15 and mesophilic 35 it can be concluded that compared with temperature changes from psychrophilic to mesophilic mesophilic to psychrophilic conditions may exert more influences on bacterial richness and relative abundances of args this may suggest that efficient control of inducers and nutrients when summer to winter would facilitate args removal of municipal sludge deeper researches are necessary to understand the effect of low temperature on args and mges in complex systems 5 conclusions nutrients like carbonaceous matters tdp and ammonia were efficiently removed at low temperature or changed temperatures the bacterial composition abundance and richness can be significantly influenced by low temperature ad physicochemical properties and otc temperature exerted extremely significantly influence on ammonia and ammonia had determination to the bacterial richness which further effected the fate of args interestingly bacterial richness negatively correlated to tetracycline args but positively to other args to decrease the bacterial richness the potential hosts containing args are warranted to be identified widely so they can be selectively eliminated by regulating nutrients and temperature to deteriorate living environments besides other protocols can be combined with ad to further improve the elimination of potential inducers and mges which would enhance the args control

17136,the effects of anaerobic digestion ad on the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes args are highly related to operational temperature however the removal performance of args in psychrophilic ad and changed temperatures simulating variable seasonal temperatures is poorly understood herein we investigated the fate of args correlated bacterial communities and physicochemical properties of ad operation at psychrophilic 15 mesophilic 35 and temperature changed conditions 15 to 35 and 35 to 15 the results indicated that ammonia release was positively correlated with temperature the mesophilic ad facilitated phosphorous intake and args proliferation and selection with oxytetracycline otc while psychrophilic ad was conducive to the removal and control of args if no otc existed the diversity and composition of ad bacterial communities were influenced more by temperature than otc the dominant genera like candidatus microthrix and acinetobacter had dramatical abundance discrepancies at different temperatures and were obviously positively correlated with args tet39 tetc and mexd mobile genetic elements mges inti insert sequences is and plasmid the physicochemical properties of ad influenced the bacterial richness which in turn significantly correlated with the args abundances therefore args removal could be potentially optimized by eliminating bacterial hosts with deteriorated living conditions and decreased nutrients this study clarified the response of antibiotic resistome to different temperature variation and highlighted the potential strategies for improved args removal in ad keywords antibiotic resistance genes args municipal sludge temperature changes psychrophilic and mesophilic anaerobic digestion mobile genetic elements mges 1 introduction the introduction of antibiotics has benefited a lot to human health over the past decades meanwhile the widely misuse or overuse of antibiotics for livestock and humans make it an emerging and serious threat to human society and global environments due to the induction of known and even novel antibiotic resistance genes args chen et al 2019 zhu et al 2013 at least 23 000 and 25 000 death are related to args per year in the usa and europe lorenzo et al 2018 the death would reach over 10 million and related costs for healthcare would be more than 100 trillion dollars by 2050 per year worldwide shao et al 2018 the aggravated args burden in the environment mainly results from their ubiquitous detection and accelerated proliferation ma et al 2014 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered as the reservoirs of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args where various kinds of bacteria either containing args or potential hosts of args like pathogenic bacteria antibiotic residues and other potential inducers that favor the selection of args are gathered su et al 2018 the rich nutrients and high biomass also facilitate the proliferation high frequency of horizontal gene transfer hgt and occurrence of multi drug resistant bacteria shao et al 2018 however wwtps can sufficiently remove neither args inducers nor args yu et al 2020 args generally adsorb on activated sludge and over 1011 copies g could be accumulated in sewage sludge at final treatment kim et al 2005 mao et al 2015 so far the production of waste activated sludge from wwtps is around 45 million tons by dry weight annually worldwide xu et al 2018a zhang et al 2015 therefore args have large opportunities to transfer into surface waters sediment and soils by sludge disposal brown et al 2020 su et al 2012 wang et al 2019 args have been listed as emerging contaminants due to the persistence and strong spread ability therefore the control and removal of args as much as possible during the wastewater treatment process especially paying more attention to the disposal of sewage sludge is of great importance anaerobic digestion ad has advantages of biomass reduction sludge dewatering enhancement and gas recovery from sludge treatment novak et al 2011 the efficiency of ad yet could be influenced by such operational parameters as temperature hydraulic retention time ph and so on gavala et al 2003 sun et al 2019 in view of args removal during ad temperature can play a critical role tian et al 2019 zou et al 2020 mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad and thermophilic anaerobic digestion tad at temperature ranges of 30 to 38 and 50 to 57 respectively appels et al 2008 have some removal efficiency to args however many wwtps worldwide are located in the moderate climate zone with prevailing low temperature in winter and variable seasonal temperatures dev et al 2019 heating and insulation systems undoubtedly are necessary for the sustainable operation witarsa and lansing 2015 this would increase the operational costs though some energy could be offset psychrophilic ad is recommended particularly for regions where temperatures could be lower than 15 like the winter for northern china lettinga et al 2001 it could be an economically technology for biomethanation dev et al 2019 but few studies have investigated the fate of args with psychrophilic ad in addition the changes of args and their correlation with microbial community and ad physicochemical properties suffering from temperature changes remain unknown in this study sludge ad operated at 15 35 or 15 to 35 35 to 15 was tested the selection of 15 was based on the local climate lanzhou china oxytetracycline otc one of the high frequency detected antibiotics in wwtps huang et al 2019 was selected as a model to illustrate the influence of antibiotic residual on the abundance of args during temperature changed ad process the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the removal of args influenced by ad physicochemical properties ii investigate the fate of args suffered from psychrophilic and mesophilic ad and temperature changes and iii determine the influence of bacterial community composition and diversity on args our results would shed light on the operational optimization of wwtps in case of args removal and supply theoretical explanation for the influence of temperature potential inducers and bacterial community on the fate of args 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of sludge and chemicals the sludge used here was collected from a municipal wwtp in lanzhou china 36 2 47 n 103 51 28 e 1500 m above sea level running with anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o system the sludge pretreatment included gravitational precipitation and screening with 1 mm sieve and then was stored at 4 for feeding main physicochemical parameters of pretreated sludge ps were supplied in supporting information si otc 98 purity and methanol hplc grade were purchased from sigma aldrich merck china other used chemicals were at least of analytical grade 2 2 experimental setup batch ad experiments were conducted with 18 serum bottles each filled with 300 ml of ps 10 mg l of otc 1000 stock solution prepared with methanol was added into the antibiotic treatment group o group but not to the control group n group the operation process was divided into phase i and ii with different temperature treatments 15 or 35 the detailed treatment and group information was shown in table s1 considering a low ad temperature 15 and a relatively high concentration of the sludge the sludge retention time srt was 35 d 30 ml of the digested sludge was replaced with equal volume ps for each sampling and oxygen was removed by purging with purified nitrogen gas for 15 min the bottles were stirred in air bath shakers 120 rpm at 35 1 or 15 1 in dark all treatments were carried out in triplicate 2 3 physicochemical analysis of sludge the ph ammonia total dissolved phosphorus tdp codcr total suspended solid tss and volatile suspended solid vss were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 no3 n and no2 n were detected with an ion chromatograph shine china total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were analyzed with a tc n analyzer elemental vario toc cube germany 2 4 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing with initial sludge s0 as control a total of 36 sludge samples were collected during two phases and 2 ml sludge was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and the pellet was used for dna extraction with the method reported previously zhou et al 1996 the quality and quantity were evaluated with nanodrop and agarose gel primer pairs of 338f 806r were used for 16s rrna gene illumina miseq sequencing by majorbio bpt co ltd shanghai china the above samples also suffered from metagenomic sequencing the data were analyzed on the platform of majorbio cloud www majorbio com and detailed information was available in si 2 5 statistical analysis and correlation analysis for statistics comparison student t test was used and a significant difference was considered when p value was below 0 05 correlation heatmap pca principal component analysis and rda redundancy analysis were used to determine the influence or correlation among ad physicochemical properties bacterial community mobile genetic elements mges and args a structural equation model sem was employed to explore the direct and indirect effects of ad physicochemical parameters bacterial richness and args chen et al 2019 the detailed information was shown in si 3 results 3 1 effect of ad temperature on the sludge physicochemical factors 3 1 1 variations of nitrogen during ad the initial nitrate nitrite and ammonia were 24 00 2 47 mg l 5 32 1 33 mg l and 57 06 0 73 mg l respectively in the ps nitrate and nitrite were undetectable within 5 d while ammonia concentrations were around 6 4 8 5 times and twice of the s0 for groups at 35 and 15 without and with otc the ammonia concentration had a rapid increase within 18 d at 35 extremely significantly higher than those at 15 p 0 01 meanwhile ammonia concentrations for the otc groups were relatively lower than their counterparts ad at 35 availed the accumulation of ammonia even for groups of o15 35 and n15 in phase ii the concentration of ammonia could be as high as 749 77 16 32 mg l and 759 54 54 23 mg l respectively both o35 15a and o15 15a kept low ammonia formation different from n35a with another peak concentration 535 89 43 19 mg l in total n15a had the highest ammonia release after ad followed by n35a and otc groups fig 1 ab thus both temperature and otc effected the concentration of ammonia in ad system genes taking part in ammonia metabolism had been classified into two parts ammonia formation e g dissimilatory assimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation and ammonia transformation e g nitrification and comammox table s2 the relative abundances of genes encoding ammonia formation had remarkable decline for o35 15a o35 35a and n35a in agreement with the detected ammonia concentration compared with phase i genes related to ammonia transformation increased for o15 15 o35 15 and n35 in phase ii the final tn release had obvious disparities between otc and n groups fig s3 p 0 01 and o15 15a had the fewest tn release suggesting the influence from both low temperature and otc 3 1 2 variations of phosphorus during ad for sludge of the n groups fig 1d tdp had a sharp decrease from 316 44 13 34 mg l to 46 77 1 59 mg l 35 and 53 11 0 93 mg l 15 within 21 d during which n15b had a more rapid tdp loss than that at 35 then the concentration of tdp fluctuated a little at both temperatures on the contrary the tdp loss was relatively faster for o35b than o15b at the same period in comparison with n35b the tdp loss rates of o35b and o15b were faster during 0 to 5 d which may be stimulated by otc however phosphorus release likely occurred in phase ii especially for o15 15a which had nearly twice the concentrations of tdp from the n groups and that of o15b fig 1c with the influence of otc the concentration of tdp kept over 65 mg l for the other three groups whilst the corresponding data was less than 50 mg l for the n groups in phase ii exopolyphosphatase and polyphosphate kinase were reported taking part in phosphorus release and intake respectively xu et al 2020a phosphorus intake was likely relatively lower at low temperature exopolyphosphatase had relatively high abundance for o15 15a and o35 15a in responding to the partial phosphorus release table s2 3 1 3 variations of carbonaceous matters the ph values at 35 were higher than those at 15 fig s1 in the whole ad process in accordance with ammonia production the ph values changed in a range of 6 98 0 06 to 7 55 0 06 for the otc groups a little bit narrower than 7 04 0 03 to 7 87 0 04 for the n groups n35b and o15b had relatively higher cod removal in comparison with n15b and o35b fig s2 perhaps due to more obvious inhibition from otc at 35 interestingly o35 35a had contrastable cod removal with n15a in phase ii while higher compared to those of o15 35a p 0 049 n35a p 0 014 o35 15a p 0 023 and o15 15a p 0 009 respectively the toc release for o35 35a was also relatively higher and data for groups kept at 15 in phase ii was relatively lower than those at 35 fig s3b the tss and vss loss at 35 was higher than data at 15 but the n35 groups were inferior to the o35 groups neither o15 nor o35 showed negative influence on tss loss after temperature changes compared with the n groups fig s2cd however vss loss had been conversely affected by low temperature the methanogenic capacity seemed to be inhibited in psychrophilic ad and otc also showed negative influence leading to the limited methane accumulation fig s2e 3 2 effect of ad operation on bacterial community 3 2 1 variation of bacterial community diversity and structure the basic information of sequencing and biodiversity indices were summarized in si table s3 all indices reflecting the biodiversity evenness and richness displayed an increasing trend from phase i to ii to clarify the difference between each group pca based on the identified otus were analyzed which had 43 2 and 18 7 explanation from axes pc1 and pc2 respectively samples from the n groups were separated with the otc groups in phase i across the axis pc2 fig 2 a groups suffering from different temperatures were basically separated between phases i and ii and samples from s0 clustered with those from phase ii fig 2ac 3 2 2 shift of bacterial community composition a total of 14 bacterial phyla with relative abundance over 1 were identified fig s4 proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and firmicutes were the predominant phyla in all groups which had significant differences between otc and n groups p 0 01 proteobacteria was selectively enriched or maintained while firmicutes had opposite fate for the otc groups actinobacteria dropped obviously for groups o15 15a p 0 03 o15 35a p 0 007 and o35 35a p 0 025 compared with those of phases i bacteroidetes had dramatically increased in all treatments p 0 0004 minority phyla like myxococcota desulfobacterota and acidobacteria occurred extremely increases when temperature changes p 0 01 the increase of temperature benefited the myriad diversity of bacteria communities for the n groups while the influence of temperature changes on bacterial community diversity contacting with otc seemed limited at the genus level fig s5 58 genera had relative abundance over 1 candidatus microthrix dominated in most of tested samples its abundance decreased in all treatment compared between phase ii and i p 0 01 the following top genus was acinetobacter whose abundance in s0 was only 0 44 0 00 acinetobacter had relatively higher abundance 14 in phase i except in group o35b but was dramatically removed in phase ii p 0 01 dojkabacteria and bacteroidetes vadinha17 were highly enriched when operated at 35 while norank f caldilineaceae had relatively higher abundance in otc groups than in n groups norank f saprospiraceae and norank c olb14 had raised abundance during temperature changes of otc groups nearly equal number 14 and 16 for o35 15a and o15 35a of genera had increased abundance after temperature changes in which 6 genera were shared in both groups 19 and 22 genera had boosted abundance for n15a and n35a in comparison with n15b and n35b among them 4 genera unclassified f comamonadaceae thauera norank c olb12 and norank c olb14 shared with the otc groups besides typical polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos including candidatus accumulimonas candidatus accumulibacter and tetrasphaera were also detected 3 2 3 associations between bacterial community and ad physicochemical properties to further understand the bacterial community differences between different treatments rda based on physicochemical parameters was used to reflect the distribution of individual samples fig s6 ammonia with temperature and tdp with temperature had positive correlation with each other temperature and tdp displayed obvious correlation with these community species to a greater extent p 0 01 which were positively correlated with bacterial communities in phase ii especially from proteobacteria and firmicutes ammonia and cod showed positive correlation with phyla actinobacteria and chloroflexi the positive influence of otc to species of the otc groups was obvious 3 3 effect of ad operation on args 3 3 1 variations of args types and relative abundances during ad based on the annotation of high throughput sequence a total of 86 arg subtypes belonging to 14 arg types including beta lactam tetracycline tc rifampin macrolide sulfonamide aminoglycoside streptogramin chloramphenicol quinolone trimethoprim multidrug bacitracin polymyxin and others were detected within all the tested ad samples except args related to bacitracin baca genes conferring resistance to tetracyclines aminoglycoside sulfonamide and beta lactam accounted for most types while args related to chloramphenicol and macrolide generally had relative abundance less than 5 fig 3 and fig s7a for the above six types of args in phase i more args tended to be accumulated at 35 and the lowest and highest relative abundance were corresponding to n15b 29 20 1 4 and n35b 45 90 7 4 the existence of otc went against the removal of args even with longer srt for the groups o15 15 and o35 35 the abundance of above args noticeably increased for o15 35 when temperature changed p 0 011 fig 3 while the abundance obviously decreased for n35 the top abundant tc args were tet39 for groups n15b n35b and o15b and tetc for other groups but all changed to tetc in phase ii similarly tet36 ribosomal protection and tetg efflux pump displayed increased trends in groups n15 n35 and o15 from phase i to ii tetx modify tetracycline had distinct growth for the o35 groups showing more complex resistance mechanism toward otc at 35 fig s8 and table s4 sul1 and sul2 responsible for sulfonamide resistance showed inducible enrichment by otc and sul1 accumulated when temperature changed from 15 to 35 ermf and ermb are args related to macrolides the former one had higher abundances along with time while the latter one had declined at least twice in all treatments cml e3 responsible for chloramphenicol efflux was co selected by otc as shown by their higher abundances in the otc groups fig s8 the relative abundances of baca were all over 50 for all treatments and only had decrease in o15 35a group perhaps relating to its bacterial hosts fig s9a the multidrug args had declined abundances as a whole in comparison with s0 but were greatly enriched in o15 35a and o35 35a typically mexd corresponding to the induction from otc the related args clustered or separated obviously at different temperatures and different phases like bacterial community distribution as shown in pca args of o15b clustered with n15b and n35b at phase i but separated from o35 and samples of phase ii fig 2bd considering the major antibiotic resistance mechanisms these args included genes encoding efflux pump antibiotic inactivity antibiotic target changes and other mechanisms in which efflux pump displayed dominated roles 50 without noticeable changes after temperature changes followed by antibiotic target changes fig s7b 3 3 2 correlations among args and bacterial community the correlations between bacterial community and args were analyzed at two levels with the top abundant phyla and genera based on rda fig 4 actinobacteria firmicutes and proteobacteria are positively related to tet39 and baca but negatively related to sul1 mexd and tetc bacteroidetes showed positive correlation to above args in most samples in phase ii concretely acinetobacter mainly positively related to tet39 baca bl2c bro and sul2 candidatus microthrix also positively related with tet39 and baca dojkabacteria and bacteroidetes vadinha17 positively related to tetc tet36 mexd and sul1 to detailed evaluate the correlation between args and more dominant genera the top abundant args for types beta lactam tetracycline macrolide sulfonamide aminoglycoside chloramphenicol and genera among the top 30 in the relative abundances were selected fig s10 more genera showed negative correlation than positive correlation to tet39 ermf and bl2 veb extremely significantly correlated to more than 10 genera longilinea and unclassified o bacteroidales obviously positively correlated to args responsible for tetracycline sulfonamide macrolide and chloramphenicol resistance and tetrasphaera negatively correlated to above args candidatus microthrix and acinetobacter significantly positively correlated to tet39 and strongly negatively correlated to ermf bl2 veb and mexd besides results from environmental factor regression analysis showed acinetobacter and candidatus microthrix had positive explanation for args fig s11 r2 0 73 and 0 53 p 0 01 3 3 3 correlations among args mges and bacterial community mges generally contain transposon integrons insert sequences iss and plasmid which co exist with args li et al 2017 the relative abundances of integrons is and plasmid identity 70 were in the range of 0 0004 to 0 0007 0 0021 to 0 0062 and 0 23 to 0 44 respectively inti1 was the most abundant integrons and tended to decrease without otc fig 5 inti showed accumulation at 15 in phase i and was apt to be selected by otc the abundance of inti3 was higher in phase ii than that in phase i except o35 15 similarly inti4 had higher abundances in phase ii and lower abundances than that of s0 in phase i p 0 05 n35b had a relatively highest abundance for is and there had some decrease after temperature changes but not for the o35 groups the abundance of plasmid dropped in phase ii compared with those in phase i corresponding to the negative correlation with most ad communities and args in phase ii fig s12 rda showed that most of mges played major roles in shaping args like tet39 sul as well as most ad communities indicating the frequency occurrence of hgt inti3 positively correlated to sul1 mexcd ant erm tet36 and tetc for most ad communities corresponding to its relatively high abundance in phase ii 3 3 4 associations between args and ad physicochemical properties a sem was constructed to explain the effect of tdp ammonia temperature tm ph and bacterial richness on the args abundance dynamics fig 6 the listed factors influencing tc args in view of standardized direct effect showed the following order ammonia λ 0 652 ph λ 0 0 richness λ 0 174 tdp λ 0 181 temperature λ 0 536 while for sulfonamides related args richness λ 0 497 temperature λ 0 487 ammonia λ 0 181 tdp λ 0 092 ph λ 0 0 and for other identified args richness λ 0 623 temperature λ 0 510 tdp λ 0 320 ammonia λ 0 157 ph λ 0 0 the bacterial richness and temperature played major roles in shaping args abundance and subtype especially for tetracycline non related args p 0 001 but their influence trends on tc args tended to be opposite ammonia and tdp also showed striking effect towards args temperature imposed an extremely significantly positive total effect on ammonia and ammonia extremely significantly negatively impacted the bacterial richness p 0 001 4 discussion 4 1 temperature influenced args by altering bacterial community with temperature variation the bacterial community changes reshuffled the args potential hosts tad was generally recommended for its higher args removal than mad bai et al 2019 but some results found contradictory differences compared with mad tad had advantages of reduced microbial community diversity and potentially enhanced removal of args and mges xu et al 2020b but args and mges had the risks of rebound sun et al 2019 a lot of potential hosts from phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and firmicutes were speculated hardly survival in the microbial community during tad tian et al 2019 the fate of args at low temperatures were rarely reported resende et al 2014 previous research showed that biosolids stored statically at 4 10 and 20 for 4 months led to a 3 to 0 5 log increase of sul1 and inti1 which may be attributed to the stimulation of hgt at low temperature miller et al 2014 the highest absolute abundance of args and mges occurred in spring with average temperature 14 3 to 16 5 in a river reservoir system chen et al 2019 this temperature range was similar with the psychrophilic ad in our study and the highest relative abundance of mges coincidently occurred for o15 35b group another research stated otu richness peaked at a mean air temperature around 15 for wwtps sludge wu et al 2019 and the richness from phase ii was in accordance with it only the abundance of dominant bacteroidetes increased during the ad which contained many bacteria correlated with args and mges liao et al 2018 proteobacteria is one of phyla harboring most of the known plasmids and chromosomal integrons and lots of hosts of args like tetracycline beta lactams and aminoglycosides forsberg et al 2014 acinetobacter in this phylum a human pathogen harboring args referring to many antibiotics and multidrug resistance resende et al 2014 yu et al 2020 was nearly eliminated in phase ii it was positively correlated to args referring aminoglycoside sulfonamide and tetracycline in this study as reported previously fig s5 xiong et al 2015 besides it had the ability to biodegrade several sulfonamide antibiotics xia et al 2019 many genera belonging to actinobacteria are antibiotic producers and have args to several types of antibiotics d costa et al 2011 the declined args referring to tc was close related to it firmicutes also contained the dominant bacteria with tetracycline resistance and potential hosts of tetm and tetq zhang and li 2020 the abundance of firmicutes decreased for otc groups while the abundance of tetm had sustained growth illustrating other potential hosts existed despite a selection pressure from low temperatures on dominant potential hosts the hgt may be stimulated for some minorities kretschmer and cohen 1979 achromobacter an opportunistic pathogen and potential sulfamethoxazole degrader was nearly undetectable in phase i but had abundances over 1 in all treatments which could take part in ammonia removal reis et al 2014 other reported potential pathogens abundance over 0 1 like clostridium bacteroides and bacillus had been partly removed whilst collinsella arcobacter and prevotella became more abundant after temperature changes jang et al 2019 for the 58 genera with relative abundance over 1 42 genera had clear gram stain identification in which 16 genera were gram positive g g pathogens and many gram negative g bacteria are more likely otc tolerance in this study g bacteria seemed to be selected more which might be due to the protection from its outer membrane in addition species containing multidrug resistance were difficult to be weeded out briefly low temperature and temperature changes could decrease the abundance of dominant genera but the community richness was maintained potential hosts could be weakened by deteriorating living conditions like temperature 4 2 temperature influenced args by mges and inducers the removal of mges was also pivotal to control args tetm and tetc taking part in ribosomal protection and tetracycline efflux pump were frequently detected in environmental samples and highly related to transposons and inti1 bai et al 2019 they were the top abundance tc args in this study yet no clear decrease was detected at any tested temperatures the co occurrence of tetm and ermb in a transposon taken by clostridium was revealed soge et al 2009 ermf carried by plasmids and ermb embedded in a conjugative transposon showed opposite trends after temperature change the genetic linkage between inti1 and sul1 has been widely confirmed harnisz et al 2020 therefore increasing the spread risk of these args the abundance of sul1 was nearly doubled at 35 than at 15 for otc groups while for sul2 the growth was inferior to sul1 suggesting the co selection among different args besides this was corresponding to the increased abundance of inti1 at 35 fig 5 mges like inti1 inti2 tn916 1545 and iscr1 facilitated the dissemination of args and multidrug resistance and more efficient inhibition of mges contributed a lot to the reduction of args in manure ad huang et al 2019 however the changes of microbial community just slightly affect the abundance of mges compared with args leading to the persistence in sewage sludge and hgt liao et al 2018 the residues of antibiotics other pharmaceuticals and heavy metals are vital factors to args enrichment especially exposure with high concentration in a short time zhang et al 2018 though some researchers suggested weak correlation between antibiotics and args in environmental samples you et al 2018 antibiotics could select the same subtypes args or args with the same resistance mechanism jia et al 2017 otc significantly enriched args referring tc like tetc and tet39 as well as mexd sul1 and sul2 compared with the corresponding n groups p 0 05 the abundances of sul1 and sul2 were relevant to the residue of sulfonamides amoxicillin and tetracycline guo et al 2018 lorenzo et al 2018 longer srt at low temperature spurred the otc selection besides args referring beta lactam generally genetically linked with metal resistance genes to zn cu and as while baca could be co selected by polymyxin and fosfomycin li et al 2017 therefore the elimination of such inducers would facilitate args removal ad combined with other protocols had been applied ionizing radiation shen et al 2019 zero valent iron and the thermal hydrolysis pre treatment improved the removal of antibiotics and further enhanced the removal of args and mges sun et al 2019 in summary the influence of temperature on the abundance of args was complex a higher temperature did not mean better args removal the control and elimination of mges and other inducers are also crucial in real treatments in view of major resistance mechanisms previous research regarded antibiotic deactivation 41 43 as the main mechanism followed by cellular protection 28 29 and efflux pump 23 11 in an integrated wastewater reclamation system yu et al 2020 for an ad treating municipal sewage sludge temperature from 35 to 55 the detected resistance mechanism had similarity with this study and the importance was in the sequence of efflux pump antibiotic target replacement and antibiotic inactivity xu et al 2020b suggesting a limited degradation of otc 4 3 temperature influenced args by nutrients concentration changes the dynamic nutrition transportation and utilization in sludge could also play indirect roles in the fate of args nutrients in wastewater can accelerate args replication on mges previous researches had stated a negative correlation of nutrients with args abundance in saline soil tan et al 2019 the abundances of most tet genes were influenced by the feeding nutrition in a co digested swine waste system couch et al 2019 at 15 most of microorganisms had interrupted metabolism and proliferation leading to a relatively lower args abundance and nutrients removal figs s2 and s3 in contrast 35 is suitable for biomass accumulation and organics consumption making args also more abundant than those of s0 and groups at 15 the addition of otc could stimulate the proliferation of resistance genes and substance assimilation as shown with cod tss and vss removal as for ammonia variation results illustrated that mad had dramatically higher ammonia accumulation which was not greatly influenced by otc more protein synthesis was necessary at low temperature which process assimilated ammonia phosphorus removal and partially release effected by otc and low temperature phosphorus could be used in the formation of extracellular polymeric substances for cell protection and energy storage when encountering with otc and released as energy when nutrition was restricted in a sequencing batch reactor both biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal was inhibited by 2 and 5 mg l tc grabert et al 2018 the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients would facilitate the args elimination the abundance of sul1 and sul2 could also be influenced by ph which could be determined by ammonia and organic acids production acidization could enhance their removal in swine manure lin et al 2020 therefore to improve the args removal during ad both temperature and physicochemical characteristics of the sludge have to be considered fig s13 to our best knowledge this study firstly investigated the fate of args at psychrophilic ad and temperature changes between psychrophilic 15 and mesophilic 35 it can be concluded that compared with temperature changes from psychrophilic to mesophilic mesophilic to psychrophilic conditions may exert more influences on bacterial richness and relative abundances of args this may suggest that efficient control of inducers and nutrients when summer to winter would facilitate args removal of municipal sludge deeper researches are necessary to understand the effect of low temperature on args and mges in complex systems 5 conclusions nutrients like carbonaceous matters tdp and ammonia were efficiently removed at low temperature or changed temperatures the bacterial composition abundance and richness can be significantly influenced by low temperature ad physicochemical properties and otc temperature exerted extremely significantly influence on ammonia and ammonia had determination to the bacterial richness which further effected the fate of args interestingly bacterial richness negatively correlated to tetracycline args but positively to other args to decrease the bacterial richness the potential hosts containing args are warranted to be identified widely so they can be selectively eliminated by regulating nutrients and temperature to deteriorate living environments besides other protocols can be combined with ad to further improve the elimination of potential inducers and mges which would enhance the args control

17137,anaerobic methanotrophic anme archaea are critical microorganisms mitigating methane emission from anoxic zones in previous studies sulfate dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane aom and nitrate dependent aom performed by different clades of anme archaea were detected in marine sediments and freshwater environments respectively this study shows that simultaneous sulfate and nitrate dependent aom can be mediated by a clade of anme archaea which may occur in estuaries and coastal zones at the interface of marine and freshwater environments enriched with sulfate and nitrate long term 1 200 days performance data of a bioreactor metagenomic analysis and batch experiments demonstrated that anme 2d not only conducted aom coupled to reduction of nitrate to nitrite but also coupled to the conversion of sulfate to sulfide in collaboration with sulfate reducing bacteria srb sulfide was oxidized back to sulfate by sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrifiers with nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptors in turn alleviating sulfide accumulation in addition dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium performed by anme 2d was detected providing substrates to anammox metatranscriptomic analysis revealed significant upregulation of flab in anme 2d and pila in desulfococcus which likely resulted in the formation of unique nanonets connecting cells and expanding within the biofilm and putatively providing structural links between anme 2d and srb for electron transfer simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom as observed in this study could be an important link between the carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles in natural environments such as nearshore environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfate dependent anaerobic

the anme archaea and srb cells which further support direct interspecies electron transfer wegener et al 2015 however members of the anme 2 clade were suggested to perform incomplete dissimilatory sulfate reduction to zero valent sulfur via an yet unknow pathway milucka et al 2012 thus the mechanism of sulfate dependent aom induced by anme archaea is still under debate bhattarai et al 2019 1 c

pharmaceutical paper processing and mining activities khanal and huang 2003 and atmospheric sulfur deposits clark et al 2019 as a result nitrate and sulfate would be major terminal electron acceptors in nearshore sediments laverman et al 2012 and some freshwater environments chen et al 2016 lamers et al 1998 which offers important habitats for microorganisms involved in the carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles however the link of nitrogen and sulfur cycles by simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom is still unknown given the coexistence of methane sulfate and nitrate in nearshore sediments a methane based membrane biofilm reactor fed with nitrate and sulfate was operated for 1200 days to mimic the subsistence of microbial communities in natural sediments chadwick et al 2019 performance of the reactor was closely monitored and the dynamics of microbial community was investigated through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing transformations of methane nitrate and sulfate were determined through batch tests and microelectrode analysis of biofilm the microstructure of biofilm was revealed by scanning electron microscope sem to identify structural link between anme 2d and their bacterial partners simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom driven by anme 2d were also verified through metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor configuration and operation a lab scale membrane biofilm reactor mbfr with a work volume of 645 ml was equipped with 8 bundles of gas permeable hollow fiber membranes oxymem ireland for continuous supply of methane v v 95 ch4 5 co2 and a water jacket was used for temperature control fig s1 and si text a the phases of the mbfr operation are summarized in table 1 initially the reactor was inoculated with 100 ml sludge from a parent bioreactor where anme 2d archaea nc10 bacteria and anammox bacteria were dominant nie et al 2019 after inoculation concentrated nitrate and sulfate solution was daily pulse dosed into the reactor to maintain the bulk nitrate and sulfate concentration in the range of 20 50 mg n s l 1 for biofilm development phase i from day 104 the reactor was turned into continuous operation phase ii viii the influent contained nitrate and sulfate table 1 as well as mineral medium for microbial growth si text b the hydraulic retention time hrt was initially set at 2 1 days and then stepwise decreased due to the constantly low concentrations of nitrate in effluent table s1 after stable operation at 30 c the temperature was decreased to 25 c on day 506 phase iii then progressively reduced at interval of 1 c to 10 c phase iv and to 5 c phase v finally the temperature of the mbfr operation was held constant at 5 c from day 1109 phase vi viii which is close to temperature in nature sediments biddle et al 2012 gudasz et al 2010 the more specific parameters of the reactor operation are listed in supplementary information table s1 2 2 batch tests in mbfr in order to confirm the active bio reaction and electron balance of the simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom in the biofilm batch tests were undertaken at the end of phase v the conditions of each batch test are summarized in table 2 the methane consumption rate was calculated based on the nitrate and sulfate consumption rate nitrite ammonium and sulfide production rate and the microbial community as described in si text c to measure the methane consumption the mbfr was disconnected from the methane gas cylinder to terminate methane supplying the bulk liquids in mbfr were replaced by freshly prepared medium the prepared medium was sparged with the gas mixture 95 ch4 and 5 co2 for 10 min at a flow rate of 500 ml min 1 which made the medium rich in dissolved methane the liquid phase in the mbfr was continuously circulated during the batch tests the three batch tests were run in the batch mode for 12 h with liquid samples collected at hourly intervals at the end of each batch test

pcr kit perfect real time and gdna eraser takara china according to manufacturer s protocol rt qpcr was accomplished by an abi 7500 system applied biosystems china with sybr premix ex taq takara china using published primers table s2 the transcription levels of each functional gene were normalized against the total 16s rrna gene copies since 16s rrna gene copies were relatively stable during the batch tests kapoor et al 2015 the detailed methods of rt qpcr were referred to the previous study nie et al 2021 2 4 microelectrode measurements for the measurement of substrate profiles in the biofilm biofilms in the reactor were cultured for 6 h with the influent containing nitrate only sulfate only nitrate and sulfate respectively concentration gradients of no3 no2 nh4 so4 2 and s2 within biofilm were measured with a suite of microelectrodes liquid ion exchange lix membrane microsensors with tip diameters of approximately 10 15 μm for no3 n no2 n and nh4 n measurements were prepared according to a previous description debeer et al 1997 the microelectrode for measurement so4 2 and s2 in biofilm with a tip diameter of about 20 micrometers was used and operated referring to a previous description liu et al 2020 the microelectrode placed inside a faraday cage was mounted on a motor driven micromanipulator mm33 2 unisense denmark each measurement of different positions along the biofilm axis was performed three times by advancing the microelectrode at depth steps of 50 μm through the biofilm 2 5 fluorescence in situ hybridization biofilm samples were taken from the reactor on day 1200 and fixed by a pbs buffered ph 7 2 4 v v paraformaldehyde sigma germany solution for 45 min at room temperature glöckner et al 1996 hybridization was performed using 40 formamide as described in previous work ettwig et al 2008 the oligonucleotide probes table s3 were purchased with specific fluorescence labels from sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china hybridized slides were examined via a zeiss lsm800 confocal laser scanning microscope carl zeiss meditec ag jena germany 2 6 sample processing and sem analysis at the end of operation day 1200 biofilm samples were collected and first fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer 0 1 m ph 7 0 for over 4 h and then washed three times in the phosphate buffer for 15 min at each step post fixation and dehydration of biofilm samples were then carried out si text d the dehydrated sample was coated with gold palladium in a hitachi model e 1010 ion sputter for approximately 5 min and observed in a hitachi su8010 sem for morphological analysis 2 7 chemical analytical methods liquid samples were immediately filtered through millipore filter units 0 22 μm pore size for the analysis of no3 n no2 n nh4 n so4 2 s and

concentration of s2 s was measured immediately using the methylene blue method miner 2006 an agilent 7890a agilent usa gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector ecd was used to measure dissolved methane concentrations 2 8 dna and rna library preparation and sequencing twelve biofilm samples were collected from the biofilm sampling port of the reactor on day 0 103 250 456 540 640 750 835 910 970 1080 and 1175 for biological analysis each biofilm sample was divided equally into two parts for dna and rna extraction which were centrifuged at 4 c with 10 000 g for 15 min by a high speed centrifuge hermle labortechnik gmbh germany for obtaining cell pellets the dna of biofilm samples was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mobio laboratories inc following the manufacturer s instructions a part of the dna was analysed with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and the other part was analysed with metagenomic sequencing another biofilm sample was frozen with

archive under accessions numbers of samn15394707 samn15394709 and samn15398743 samn15398745 2 9 metagenomic assembly and binning all of raw reads from the constructed libraries generated by illumina hiseq sequencers were quality trimmed by homemade perl scripts hua et al 2015 and the trimmed sequences were filtered with sickle version 1 33 based on the parameters of q 20 l 50 joshi and sickle 2011 then contigs and scaffolds were assembled by spades version 3 11 0 with default parameters bankevich et al 2012 as a sequence pool all high quality reads were mapped on them by bbmap version 38

tetranucleotide frequency kang et al 2015 the recovered draft genomes were assessed for genome completeness and potential contamination by checkm version 1 0 7 parks et al 2015 the genome bins with completeness of 50 were kept and then optimized for removing the contaminations 2 10 analyses of genome bins the functional annotations for each bin were curated and revised based on the comparison with the databases to the kegg eggnog and ncbi nr by the diamond programs with the blast e value of 1e 5 buchfink et al 2015 based on the gene annotations all the predicted putative genes were mapped onto different modules in kegg system using kaas moriya et al 2007 especially onto relevant methane nitrogen sulfur flagellar and pilus metabolism the 16s rrna gene sequences were identified with rnammer lagesen et al 2007 and the closely related 16s rrna gene sequences in ncbi gen bank were searched with blastn buhler et al 2007 the calculation methods of relative abundance and transcript abundance for expression level of each gene were as reported previously tan et al 2019 further described in si text f one way analysis of variance anova by spss 16 0 was used to determine the gene expression differences between samples in each bin 3 results 3 1 reactor performance and microbial community dynamics the performance of the methane based mbfr for biotransformation of nitrogen and sulfur during the whole operation is shown in fig 1 the average methane oxidation rate at a steady state during each phase was calculated and shown in table s4 after inoculation an increase in nitrate removal rate from about 10 to 30 mg no3 n l 1 d 1 was observed during phase i for the mbfr startup day 0 103 fig 1c at a steady state of phase i total nrr was stable at about 25 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 1f during phase ii nitrate accumulated obviously in effluent with the decreased hrt then gradually declined to below 1 mg no3 n l 1 d 1 fig 1b afterwards the hrt was stepwise shortened to 0 1 days on day 430 fig 1a resulting in an increased nitrate removal rate and total nrr to 500 and 497 mg n l 1 d 1 respectively day 505 fig 1c and f from phase iii to phase v the performance of nitrogen removal was restricted by the stepwise decrease of operational temperature fig 1a c and f the nitrate conversion rate dropped to about 110 mg no3 l 1 d 1 at 5 c fig 1c during those periods there was not only significant accumulation of nitrate in effluent but also accumulation of nitrite and ammonium fig 1b d and e which resulted in the total nrr at the steady state of only about 95 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 1f the concentration of sulfate in effluent started to decrease from around day 350 phase ii accompanied by an increase of effluent sulfide with a sulfate removal rate of about 90 mg s l 1 d 1 achieved by day 748 phase iv fig 1g sulfate removal rate then gradually decreased and was stabilized at about 10 mg s l 1 d 1 at the steady state of phase v without accumulation of sulfide in effluent fig 1g when the sulfate concentration in influent was increased from 40 to 80 mg so4 2 s l 1 during phase vi the sulfate removal rate increased to about 50 mg s l 1 d 1 fig 1g interestingly higher sulfate reduction rate produced more sulfide that provided more electron donors for nitrate reduction resulting in the nitrate removal rate increased to 200 mg n l 1 d 1 in this period phase vi fig 1c what s more the increase of sulfate in influent also enhanced the rate of aom table s4 when nitrate in influent decreased there was significant accumulation of sulfide in effluent fig 1b and g and the decrease in the rate of aom was evident table s4 analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences confirmed that genera ca methanoperedens desulfococcus ca methylomirabilis thiobacillus sulfurovum ca kuenenia and ca brocadia dominated in the biofilm at the end of reactor operation with relative abundance of 25 5 13 8 13 4 6 1 2 4 2 9 and 1 4 respectively fig 2 a and table s5 all anme archaea detected in biofilm fell within one genus ca methanoperedens of anme 2d clade fig 2a b and s2 its relative abundance increased from 19 7 initially to 30 8 on day 540 and then stabilized at about 20 during day 750 1080 fig 2b the desulfococcus spp a typical srb cooperating with anme archaea bhattarai et al 2019 was detected in the inoculum with the relative abundance of only 0 7 and gradually increased to 13 8 on day 1175 the genus thiobacillus and sulfurovum with a known function of sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrifier sad liu et al 2016a moraes et al 2011 also had an increase in their relative percentage from 0 2 to 8 8 on day 1080 the increased abundance of genus ca methylomirabilis belonging to nc10 phylum from 3 0 to 25 8 on day 540 was observed but then it was decreased slightly fig 2b due to the lack of ammonium in feed the relative abundance of anammox ca kuenenia and ca brocadia spp decreased significantly from the initial 12 3 to 1 3 on day 250 fig 2b however anammox re emerged in the biofilm after day 540 the accumulation of nitrite and ammonium in effluent could provide substrates for the growth of anammox bacteria fig 1d and e 3 2 metabolic pathways of the microbial populations metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencings were performed on biofilm samples collected on day 0 910 and 1175 the metagenomic data table s6 allowed assembly of 8 high quality draft genomes which ranged in size from 2 7 to 5 7 mb and gc content from 43 4 to 66 5 these included bin anme2d for ca methanoperedens bins nc10 1 2 for ca methylomirabilis bins srb 1 2 for desulfococcus bin sad 1 for thiobacillus and bins sad 2 3 for sulfurovum the main metabolic potentials of those microorganisms fig 3 a d and table s7 were constructed from the metagenomes which were described in conjunction with gene expressions evaluated through metatranscriptomics table s8 and s9 the highest abundance rpkm and the highest relative transcriptional activity rta of 20 transcripts as a whole were characterized among which 13 transcripts involved in methane metabolism map00680 mcra fmda frhb mer mtd and ftr nitrogen metabolism map00910 narg nirs norb and nosz and sulfur metabolism map00920 dsra aprb and sulp were shared by both expression profiles of the rpkm and rta fig 4 the unshared expression transcripts were associated with methane metabolism genes pmoac mdh fdhb fold mch and fmdb nitrogen metabolism genes nrfa and napa sulfur metabolism genes apra dsrb and sat archaeal flagellin of gene flab and type iv pilus assembly protein of gene pila fig 4 the expression of gene narg encoding nitrate reductase was mainly confirmed in bin anme2d and sad 1 3 illustrating that nitrate removal in the mbfr was owing to both anme 2d and sad the analysis of gene expression revealed that gene narg is highly expressed in both microbes however a significant disparity in rpkm values of the gene narg in sad with time anova p 0 05 was observed the nitrate reductase rta in sad as a whole increased significantly over time p 0 05 and in anme 2d declined slightly after an initial increase indicating that the nitrate removal function in the mbfr gradually shifted from solely by anme 2d to jointly by anme 2d and sad the expression of gene nirs encoding nitrite reductase in nc10 bacteria also had a trend of a gradual decrease following an initial rise in both rpkm and rta levels while that in sad increased with operation time as in the case of nitrate reduction to nitrite nitrite reduction was initially performed mainly by nc10 and then jointly by nc10 and sad the expressions of genes norb and nosz possessed by sad for the further reduction of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide supported the role of sad in nitrite reduction fig 4 the high expression of genes sulp aprb and dsra as the shared top 20 transcripts in both rpkm and rta was observed in both bins srb 1 2 and sad 1 3 which are required for sulfate dissimilatory reduction and sulfide oxidation the significantly increased rta of genes sat dsrb and apra over time was also present in both bins srb 1 2 and sad 1 3 p 0 05 the gene groups associated with the reverse methanogenic pathway including genes mcra fmdab frhb mer mtd ftr and mch showed an overall increasing trend in both rpkm and rta levels while the gene groups pmoac mdh fdhb and fold associated with the intra aerobic methane oxidation pathway using the oxygen produced intracellularly from dismutation of nitric oxide under anaerobic condition showed significant downregulation after a temporary increasing trend with the increased sulfate concentration and decreased nitrate concentration in the influent for the mbfr there were significant up regulation of expression of genes associated with reverse methanogenesis in anme 2d and sulfate dissimilatory reduction in desulfococcus but downregulation of narg expression for nitrate reduction in anme 2d this provides evidence for the aom by anme 2d supporting sulfate reduction further statistical analyses demonstrated that the rta level of flab and pila in anme 2d and desulfococcus respectively increased significantly both p 0 05 during operation of mbfr fig 4 3 3 biotransformation of methane nitrogen and sulfur in biofilm the nitrate nitrite ammonium sulfate sulfide and dissolved methane profiles measured in batch test a i a ii and a iii are shown in fig 5 with nitrate as electron acceptor in batch test a i the concentration of nitrate dropped from 3 45 to 1 51 mm within 12 h accompanied by ammonium and nitrite accumulation of 0 18 and 0 66 mm respectively fig 5a in contrast when nitrate and sulfate co existed as electron acceptors in batch test a iii there was a higher nitrate removal rate of about 5 73 mm and almost no accumulation of ammonium and nitrite in the same incubation time table 2 and fig 5c however the rates of sulfate conversion and sulfide accumulation with sulfate as single electron acceptor in batch test a ii were higher than that in the case of nitrate and sulfate co existence table 2 and fig 5b as summarized in table 2 the predicted dissolved methane consumption rate compares very well with the measured rate in all case with mass balance errors below 5 table 2 the difference was that the aom rate of 4 19 mm d 1 was highest under the condition of nitrate and sulfate co existence as electron acceptors for aom table 2 the expression patterns of key genes related to reverse methanogenic pathway mcra nitrate reduction pathway narg dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway dsra extracellular electron transfer cytc and formation of conductive appendages flab and pila in batch test a i a ii and a iii were further investigated as shown in fig 5d comparing relative gene expression of anme 2d in consortial growth using sulfate or sulfate plus nitrate versus single growth using nitrate genes cytc pila and flab were clearly overexpressed this was also the case when compared to gene dsra expression fig 5d in addition the combination of nitrate and sulfate as electron acceptors caused a significant overexpression in gene mcra which was in response to the highest aom rate in batch test a iii fig 5d microscale levels of no3 no2 nh4 so4 2 and s2 in the biofilm were measured for the biotransformation of nitrogen and sulfur with methane feeding fig 6 the highest nitrate concentration of 355 6 μm and highest sulfate concentration of 1014 8 μm were observed on the surface of the biofilm and the nitrate concentration decreased hastily in the inner part of the biofilm compared with that in absence of sulfate fig 6a and c while the sulfate concentration decreased relaxedly compared with that in absence of nitrate fig 6b and c the interactions with both nitrate and sulfate as electron acceptors in biofilm resulted in a niche zone at about depth of 500 850 μm where nitrate was absent but sulfate is present for anme 2d and srb development fig 6c 3 4 microscopic characterization of biofilm at the end of the mbfr operation day 1200 biofilm samples were harvested from the hollow fibers and analyzed using fish and sem we focused on anme 2d and its potential symbiotic relationship with srb in the presence of nitrate and sulfate srb interlaced around anme 2d fig 7 a and a widely distributed nanonet of flagellum like structures overlaid the aggregations between anme 2d and srb fig 7b this nanonet resembles the nanowire connecting anme 2d and srb but presented a non linear non stacking network structure fig 7c and f with diameters of approximately 10 50 nm and apparent lengths of about 1500 nm or more fig 7d and e in contrast the suspended culture of anme 2d fed with nitrate and sulfate show smooth surfaces without any extracelluar appendages fig s3 indicating that the observed intercellular structures are specific to consortial growth in biofilm and related to cellular attachment 4 discussion 4 1 simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom by anme 2d the nitrate reductase subunit harboring an active site narg for nitrate reduction and a rieske cytochrome b complex for electron transport are encoded in the genome of anme 2d clade arshad et al 2015 haroon et al 2013 which permits the anme 2d clade to perform nitrate dependent aom without any syntrophic partners welte et al 2016 previously known syntrophic partner for anme 1 and 2a b c affiliated within srb desulfococcus spp knittel and boetius 2009 was detected in our study based on the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence analysis while only the clade of anme 2d existed in the biofilm without any other known anme lineages fig 2 and s2 the results in our study suggested that aom coupled to dissimilatory sulfate reduction was mediated by the anme 2d clade in the syntrophic association with srb partners there is the genomic evidence suggesting that the subsurface anme 2d clade detected in groundwater environment may directly couple aom to sulfate reduction by using assimilatory sulfate reduction pathways ino et al 2018 however a dissimilatory role of sulfate reduction supported by the assimilatory genes in anme lineages has not been shown yu et al 2018 the results of batch tests in our study confirmed that simultaneous reduction of nitrate and sulfate was associated with aom which suggested the anme 2d clade not only carried out nitrate dependent aom but also worked with srb for converting sulfate to sulfide simultaneously it is interesting that how sulfate dependent aom compete with nitrate dependent aom in the biofilm since the anme 2d clade yields free energy change δg0 of 521 kj mol 1 ch4 for nitrate reduction eq 2 but the energy yield for sulfate reduction is as low as 21 kj mol 1 ch4 eq 1 previous studies suggested that the observed low growth rate of anme lineages for mediating sulfate dependent aom might be owing to the restricted energetics caldwell et al 2008 evans et al 2019 mcglynn 2017 however even with the available energy and the apparent ability to utilize it the anme 2d clade performing nitrate dependent aom has been reported with a similar growth rate to sulfate dependent aom nauhaus et al 2007 nauhaus et al 2005 orphan et al 2001a thus the energy yield does not directly explain the lack of sulfate dependent aom activity in presence of methane nitrate and sulfate in lab reactors where the anme 2d clade was dominated hu et al 2009 nie et al 2019 vaksmaa et al 2017a based on the microelectrode measurements in our study nitrate was consumed up soon in outer layers of biofilm 0 500 µm while sulfate fully penetrated the biofilm and its reduction to sulfide mainly occurred inner layer 500 850 µm fig 6c as a result stratification of biofilms provided a niche zone for the anme 2d clade and srb where nitrate is absent but sulfate is present previous studies have speculated that the presence of sulfate enabled the anme 2d clade to be active in nitrate free lake sediments schubert et al 2011 su et al 2019 in response to our findings that the absence of nitrate may provide an opportunity for the anme 2d clade coupling with srb for sulfate reduction thus division of anme archaea in anaerobic methane oxidation is not obligate and all clades of anme organisms including anme 2d could cooperate with srb for sulfate dependent aom which will have profound impacts for future microbiology research on anaerobic methane oxidation 4 2 putative mechanism of electron transfer between anme 2d and srb surface morphology of biofilm in our study showed novel nanonet structures connecting cells and expanding within the biofilm fig 7b f which was speculated as conductive appendages involved in extracellular electron transfer in the syntrophy of anme 2d clade and srb previous study has demonstrated the direct interspecies electron transfer as principal mechanism for syntrophic coupling anme 2b c and srb in consortia excluding the intermediates transfer between those two mcglynn et al 2015 in addition there was other evidence for electron transfer between anme 1 2a 3 and srb which showed the mechanism of extension anme s redox active surfaces beyond their cell envelope confines via forming nanowires similar with that in geobacter and shewanella spp gao et al 2017 mcglynn et al 2015 wegener et al 2015 however the observed nanonet structures in our work are distinct from pili like structures which are not a simple stack of nanowires in general the conductive protein appendages of the type iv pili class form flexible filaments with one end anchored in the cell envelope and the other end connected extracellular biotic or abiotic electron acceptors for electron transfer craig et al 2019 shi et al 2016 metatrascriptomic analysis in our study revealed significant upregulation of gene flab in anme 2d for archaellum formation and gene pila in srb for pili formation during sulfate dependent aom fig 4 which suggested that the unique nanonets were supposedly instructed by both pili and archaellum the electrons from anme 2d might travel along the nanonet to cells of srb located on the nanonet where it could be consumed for sulfate reduction previous studies have shown that microbial cells can exchange electrons over centimeter distances through electrical connections lovley 2017 consequently the activity of sulfate dependent aom would be independent of the distance between anme 2d and srb within biofilm in fact the archaellum from the other subtribe of anme 2d clade has been suggested as conductive appendages for electron transfer during mn iv dependent aom process leu et al 2020a the archaellum from methanospirillum hungatei archaea was capable of reducing extracellular electron acceptors which was confirmed to be electrically conductive based on the analysis of conductive atomic force microscopy walker et al 2019 in addition to the deductive conductive strictures cytochrome c is proposed to be important for electron transfer between the anme 2d and their syntrophic srb partners a large number of gene cytc encoding cytochrome c exist in the anme 2d clade and the expression of gene cytc in anme 2d was significantly up regulated with the development of srb in our study cytochrome c reductase can act as electron storage in the cell membrane which can overcome the physical and electrical barrier of cell envelop lai et al 2020 shi et al 2016 for the cooperation of anme 2d and srb therefore anme 2d not only form partnership with nc10 bacteria and anammox bacteria through chemical diffusion of nitrite and ammonium for nitrogen removal but also might work with srb through direct electron transfer via intercellular nanonet for sulfate reduction as corollaries the nanonets may serve as a matrix scaffold of biofilms to accommodate more cytochrome c with orderly arrangements which might enhance the electron diffusion inside the biofilms and the underlying bioelectrochemical characteristics of nanonet for direct electron transfer require further investigation 4 3 aom linking carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles the microbial aom plays a role in global methane regulation and reducing methane release from marine and freshwater ecosystems which is well known to link the cycle of carbon and sulfur in marine fig 8 a knittel and boetius 2009 mccalley 2020 smemo and yavitt 2011 valentine 2002 and carbon and nitrogen in freshwater fig 8b deutzmann and schink 2011 deutzmann et al 2014 martinez cruz et al 2018 segarra et al 2015 the results of our study show that aom can link carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles in a biofilm reactor with counter diffusional substrates methane nitrate and sulfate in the reactor methane as substrate diffuses through the membrane to biofilms while nitrate and sulfate as complementary substrates diffuse from bulk liquid into the biofilm which is similar to the distribution of substances in the natural environments methane diffuses upwards from deeper sediments egger et al 2018 while nitrate and sulfate with higher concentrations in overlaying water diffuse downwards burgin and hamilton 2007 glombitza et al 2016 myrbo et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 it is well established that the diffusion of those substances possibly provides suitable prerequisites for aom linking carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles by the anme 2d clade the observed potential cycles involved with carbon nitrogen and sulfur are shown in fig 8c in the consortia for simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom the active nc10 and anammox bacteria in the biofilm fig s4a and b reflected the syntrophic relationship between anme 2d and other bacteria based on exchange of microbial metabolites in addition the active thiobacillus spp and sulfurovum spp sad for sulfide oxidation with nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptor fig s4c and d confirmed the production of sulfide which showed the syntrophy of anme 2d and desulfococcus spp srb the oxidation of sulfide with nitrate reduction not only avoided the accumulation of sulfide to inhibit the activity of aom fig s5 but also accelerated the formation of nitrate deficient regions in the biofilm fig 6 as microbial communities in natural environments predominantly existing as biofilms flemming et al 2016 p stoodley et al 2002 the dense cell aggregates coating mineral surfaces battin et al 2003 in methane sulfate and nitrate rich sediments may control the carbon sulfur and nitrogen cycles via simultaneous sulfate and nitrate dependent aom process since nitrous oxide is a metabolic intermediate in the process of nitrate nitrite reduction to dinitrogen gas by sad lan et al 2019 liu et al 2016b the release of nitrous oxide in the simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom process should be of further concern this work also suggested that the cooperation among the anme 2d clade and other bacterial partners for simultaneous sulfate and nitrate dependent aom process not only occurred at optimal temperature 30 c and room temperature 25 c but also occurred at the temperature close to that of the natural sediments 10 c or 5 c nevertheless the microbial interactions presented here are susceptible to interference by other coexisting electron acceptors in the environments such as iron manganese humus and so on bai et al 2019 ettwig et al 2016 still the environments such as nearshore sediments receiving reactive nitrogen compounds laverman et al 2012 and freshwater environments with anthropogenic sulfate input chen et al 2016 lamers et al 1998 possibly provide suitable prerequisites for simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom by anme 2d the link of carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles bonded by aom could broad the implication to global methane cycle in addition nitrate dependent amo has been proposed to provide alternative solutions to simultaneously remove nitrogen and mitigate methane emission during wastewater treatment nie et al 2020 xie et al 2017 xie et al 2018 however sewage also contain considerable concentration of sulfate resulting from application of sulfate coagulants during drinking water treatment and seawater toilet flushing zhang et al 2019 the potential role of anme 2d in carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles and the contribution to methane and nitrogen turnover in natural environments and engineered wastewater treatment systems requires further investigation 5 conclusion overall our findings provide a novel insight into aom by anme 2d clade which may link carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycle occurring in estuary or coastal zone as the interface of marine and freshwater environments based on the bioreactor performance reconstructed metabolic pathways and profiles of gene expression this work shows that anme 2d not only conduct nitrate reduction but also work with srb for converting sulfate to sulfide gene cytc encoded by anme 2d is found to be highly expressed during sulfate dependent aom suggesting cytochrome c plays an active role in electron transport form anme 2d to srb for sulfate reduction interestingly unique nanonets connecting anme 2d and srb are observed in the biofilm which are hypothesized as conductive appendages involved in extracellular electron transfer in addition our work also demonstrates that the produced sulfide can be oxidized back to sulfate by sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrifier with nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptors in turn alleviating sulfide accumulation and enhancing nitrogen removal meanwhile future research should focus on confirming the conductivity of the unique nanonets similar to nanowires for electron transfer and the potential role of anme 2d in carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles in natural environments and engineered wastewater treatment systems such the efforts will further expand our

17137,anaerobic methanotrophic anme archaea are critical microorganisms mitigating methane emission from anoxic zones in previous studies sulfate dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane aom and nitrate dependent aom performed by different clades of anme archaea were detected in marine sediments and freshwater environments respectively this study shows that simultaneous sulfate and nitrate dependent aom can be mediated by a clade of anme archaea which may occur in estuaries and coastal zones at the interface of marine and freshwater environments enriched with sulfate and nitrate long term 1 200 days performance data of a bioreactor metagenomic analysis and batch experiments demonstrated that anme 2d not only conducted aom coupled to reduction of nitrate to nitrite but also coupled to the conversion of sulfate to sulfide in collaboration with sulfate reducing bacteria srb sulfide was oxidized back to sulfate by sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrifiers with nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptors in turn alleviating sulfide accumulation in addition dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium performed by anme 2d was detected providing substrates to anammox metatranscriptomic analysis revealed significant upregulation of flab in anme 2d and pila in desulfococcus which likely resulted in the formation of unique nanonets connecting cells and expanding within the biofilm and putatively providing structural links between anme 2d and srb for electron transfer simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom as observed in this study could be an important link between the carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles in natural environments such as nearshore environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfate dependent anaerobic

pharmaceutical paper processing and mining activities khanal and huang 2003 and atmospheric sulfur deposits clark et al 2019 as a result nitrate and sulfate would be major terminal electron acceptors in nearshore sediments laverman et al 2012 and some freshwater environments chen et al 2016 lamers et al 1998 which offers important habitats for microorganisms involved in the carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles however the link of nitrogen and sulfur cycles by simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom is still unknown given the coexistence of methane sulfate and nitrate in nearshore sediments a methane based membrane biofilm reactor fed with nitrate and sulfate was operated for 1200 days to mimic the subsistence of microbial communities in natural sediments chadwick et al 2019 performance of the reactor was closely monitored and the dynamics of microbial community was investigated through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing transformations of methane nitrate and sulfate were determined through batch tests and microelectrode analysis of biofilm the microstructure of biofilm was revealed by scanning electron microscope sem to identify structural link between anme 2d and their bacterial partners simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom driven by anme 2d were also verified through metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor configuration and operation a lab scale membrane biofilm reactor mbfr with a work volume of 645 ml was equipped with 8 bundles of gas permeable hollow fiber membranes oxymem ireland for continuous supply of methane v v 95 ch4 5 co2 and a water jacket was used for temperature control fig s1 and si text a the phases of the mbfr operation are summarized in table 1 initially the reactor was inoculated with 100 ml sludge from a parent bioreactor where anme 2d archaea nc10 bacteria and anammox bacteria were dominant nie et al 2019 after inoculation concentrated nitrate and sulfate solution was daily pulse dosed into the reactor to maintain the bulk nitrate and sulfate concentration in the range of 20 50 mg n s l 1 for biofilm development phase i from day 104 the reactor was turned into continuous operation phase ii viii the influent contained nitrate and sulfate table 1 as well as mineral medium for microbial growth si text b the hydraulic retention time hrt was initially set at 2 1 days and then stepwise decreased due to the constantly low concentrations of nitrate in effluent table s1 after stable operation at 30 c the temperature was decreased to 25 c on day 506 phase iii then progressively reduced at interval of 1 c to 10 c phase iv and to 5 c phase v finally the temperature of the mbfr operation was held constant at 5 c from day 1109 phase vi viii which is close to temperature in nature sediments biddle et al 2012 gudasz et al 2010 the more specific parameters of the reactor operation are listed in supplementary information table s1 2 2 batch tests in mbfr in order to confirm the active bio reaction and electron balance of the simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom in the biofilm batch tests were undertaken at the end of phase v the conditions of each batch test are summarized in table 2 the methane consumption rate was calculated based on the nitrate and sulfate consumption rate nitrite ammonium and sulfide production rate and the microbial community as described in si text c to measure the methane consumption the mbfr was disconnected from the methane gas cylinder to terminate methane supplying the bulk liquids in mbfr were replaced by freshly prepared medium the prepared medium was sparged with the gas mixture 95 ch4 and 5 co2 for 10 min at a flow rate of 500 ml min 1 which made the medium rich in dissolved methane the liquid phase

archive under accessions numbers of samn15394707 samn15394709 and samn15398743 samn15398745 2 9 metagenomic assembly and binning all of raw reads from the constructed libraries generated by illumina hiseq sequencers were quality trimmed by homemade perl scripts hua et al 2015 and the trimmed sequences were filtered with sickle version 1 33 based on the parameters of q 20 l 50 joshi and sickle 2011 then contigs and scaffolds were assembled by spades version 3 11 0 with default parameters bankevich et al 2012 as a sequence pool all high quality reads were mapped on them by bbmap version 38 85 with the parameters of k 15 minid 0 97 build 1 these scaffolds generated were binned into the draft genomes by metabat version 0 32 5 with the sensitive model which considers abundance and tetranucleotide frequency kang et al 2015 the recovered draft genomes were assessed for genome completeness and potential contamination by checkm version 1 0 7 parks et al 2015 the genome bins with completeness of 50 were kept and then optimized for removing the contaminations 2 10 analyses of genome bins the functional annotations for each bin were curated and revised based on the comparison with the databases to the kegg eggnog and ncbi nr by the diamond programs with the blast e value of 1e 5 buchfink et al 2015 based on the gene annotations all the predicted putative genes were mapped onto different modules in kegg system using kaas moriya et al 2007 especially onto relevant methane nitrogen sulfur flagellar and pilus metabolism the 16s rrna gene sequences were identified with rnammer lagesen et al 2007 and the closely related 16s rrna gene sequences in ncbi gen bank were searched with blastn buhler et al 2007 the calculation methods of relative abundance and transcript abundance for expression level of each gene were as reported previously tan et al 2019 further described in si text f one way analysis of variance anova by spss 16 0 was used to determine the gene expression differences between samples in each bin 3 results 3 1 reactor performance and microbial community dynamics the performance of the methane based mbfr for biotransformation of nitrogen and sulfur during the whole operation is shown in fig 1 the average methane oxidation rate at a steady state during each phase was calculated and shown in table s4 after inoculation an increase in nitrate removal rate from about 10 to 30 mg no3 n l 1 d 1 was observed during phase i for the mbfr startup day 0 103 fig 1c at a steady state of phase i total nrr was stable at about 25 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 1f during phase ii nitrate accumulated obviously in effluent with the decreased hrt then gradually declined to below 1 mg no3 n l 1 d 1 fig 1b afterwards the hrt was stepwise shortened to 0 1 days on day 430 fig 1a resulting in an increased nitrate removal rate and total nrr to 500 and 497 mg n l 1 d 1 respectively day 505 fig 1c and f from phase iii to phase v the performance of nitrogen removal was restricted by the stepwise decrease of operational temperature fig 1a c and f the nitrate conversion rate dropped to about 110 mg no3 l 1 d 1 at 5 c fig 1c during those periods there was not only significant accumulation of nitrate in effluent but also accumulation of nitrite and ammonium fig 1b d and e which resulted in the total nrr at the steady state of only about 95 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 1f the concentration of sulfate in effluent started to decrease from around day 350 phase ii accompanied by an increase of effluent sulfide with a sulfate removal rate of about 90 mg s l 1 d 1 achieved by day 748 phase iv fig 1g sulfate removal rate then gradually decreased and was stabilized at about 10 mg s l 1 d 1 at the steady state of phase v without accumulation of sulfide in effluent fig 1g when the sulfate concentration in influent was increased from 40 to 80 mg so4 2 s l 1 during phase vi the sulfate removal rate increased to about 50 mg s l 1 d 1 fig 1g interestingly higher sulfate reduction rate produced more sulfide that provided more electron donors for nitrate reduction resulting in the nitrate removal rate increased to 200 mg n l 1 d 1 in this period phase vi fig 1c what s more the increase of sulfate in influent also enhanced the rate of aom table s4 when nitrate in influent decreased there was significant accumulation of sulfide in effluent fig 1b and g and the decrease in the rate of aom was evident table s4 analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences confirmed that genera ca methanoperedens desulfococcus ca methylomirabilis thiobacillus sulfurovum ca kuenenia and ca brocadia dominated in the biofilm at the end of reactor operation with relative abundance of 25 5 13 8 13 4 6 1 2 4 2 9 and 1 4 respectively fig 2 a and table s5 all anme archaea detected in biofilm fell within one genus ca methanoperedens of anme 2d clade fig 2a b and s2 its relative abundance increased from 19 7 initially to 30 8 on day 540 and then stabilized at about 20 during day 750 1080 fig 2b the desulfococcus spp a typical srb cooperating with anme archaea bhattarai et al 2019 was detected in the inoculum with the relative abundance of only 0 7 and gradually increased to 13 8 on day 1175 the genus thiobacillus and sulfurovum with a known function of sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrifier sad liu et al 2016a moraes et al 2011 also had an increase in their relative percentage from 0 2 to 8 8 on day 1080 the increased abundance of genus ca methylomirabilis belonging to nc10 phylum from 3 0 to 25 8 on day 540 was observed but then it was decreased slightly fig 2b due to the lack of ammonium in feed the relative abundance of anammox ca kuenenia and ca brocadia spp decreased significantly from the initial 12 3 to 1 3 on day 250 fig 2b however anammox re emerged in the biofilm after day 540 the accumulation of nitrite and ammonium in effluent could provide substrates for the growth of anammox bacteria fig 1d and e 3 2 metabolic pathways of the microbial populations metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencings were performed on biofilm samples collected on day 0 910 and 1175 the metagenomic data table s6 allowed assembly of 8 high quality draft genomes which ranged in size from 2 7 to 5 7 mb and gc content from 43 4 to 66 5 these included bin anme2d for ca methanoperedens bins nc10 1 2 for ca methylomirabilis bins srb 1 2 for desulfococcus bin sad 1 for thiobacillus and bins sad 2 3 for sulfurovum the main metabolic potentials of those microorganisms fig 3 a d and table s7 were constructed from the metagenomes which were described in conjunction with gene expressions evaluated through metatranscriptomics table s8 and s9 the highest abundance rpkm and the highest relative transcriptional activity rta of 20 transcripts as a whole were characterized among which 13 transcripts involved in methane metabolism map00680 mcra fmda frhb mer mtd and ftr nitrogen metabolism map00910 narg nirs norb and nosz and sulfur metabolism map00920 dsra aprb and sulp were shared by both expression profiles of the rpkm and rta fig 4 the unshared expression transcripts were associated with methane metabolism genes pmoac mdh fdhb fold mch and fmdb nitrogen metabolism genes nrfa and napa sulfur metabolism genes apra dsrb and sat archaeal flagellin of gene flab and type iv pilus assembly protein of gene pila fig 4 the expression of gene narg encoding nitrate reductase was mainly confirmed in bin anme2d and sad 1 3 illustrating that nitrate removal in the mbfr was owing to both anme 2d and sad the analysis of gene expression revealed that gene narg is highly expressed in both microbes however a significant disparity in rpkm values of the gene narg in sad with time anova p 0 05 was observed the nitrate reductase rta in sad as a whole increased significantly over time p 0 05 and in anme 2d declined slightly after an initial increase indicating that the nitrate removal function in the mbfr gradually shifted from solely by anme 2d to jointly by anme 2d and sad the expression of gene nirs encoding nitrite reductase in nc10 bacteria also had a trend of a gradual decrease following an initial rise in both rpkm and rta levels while that in sad increased with operation time as in the case of nitrate reduction to nitrite nitrite reduction was initially performed mainly by nc10 and then jointly by nc10 and sad the expressions of genes norb and nosz possessed by sad for the further reduction of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide supported the role of sad in nitrite reduction fig 4 the high expression of genes sulp aprb and dsra as the shared top 20 transcripts in both rpkm and rta was observed in both bins srb 1 2 and sad 1 3 which are required for sulfate dissimilatory reduction and sulfide oxidation the significantly increased rta of genes sat dsrb and apra over time was also present in both bins srb 1 2 and sad 1 3 p 0 05 the gene groups associated with the reverse methanogenic pathway including genes mcra fmdab frhb mer mtd ftr and mch showed an overall increasing trend in both rpkm and rta levels while the gene groups pmoac mdh fdhb and fold associated with the intra aerobic methane oxidation pathway using the oxygen produced intracellularly from dismutation of nitric oxide under anaerobic condition showed significant downregulation after a temporary increasing trend with the increased sulfate concentration and decreased nitrate concentration in the influent for the mbfr there were significant up regulation of expression of genes associated with reverse methanogenesis in anme 2d and sulfate dissimilatory reduction in desulfococcus but downregulation of narg expression for nitrate reduction in anme 2d this provides evidence for the aom by anme 2d supporting sulfate reduction further statistical analyses demonstrated that the rta level of flab and pila in anme 2d and desulfococcus respectively increased significantly both p 0 05 during operation of mbfr fig 4 3 3 biotransformation of methane nitrogen and sulfur in biofilm the nitrate nitrite ammonium sulfate sulfide and dissolved methane profiles measured in batch test a i a ii and a iii are shown in fig 5 with nitrate as electron acceptor in batch test a i the concentration of nitrate dropped from 3 45 to 1 51 mm within 12 h accompanied by ammonium and nitrite accumulation of 0 18 and 0 66 mm respectively fig 5a in contrast when nitrate and sulfate co existed as electron acceptors in batch test a iii there was a higher nitrate removal rate of about 5 73 mm and almost no accumulation of ammonium and nitrite in the same incubation time table 2 and fig 5c however the rates of sulfate conversion and sulfide accumulation with sulfate as single electron acceptor in batch test a ii were higher than that in the case of nitrate and sulfate co existence table 2 and fig 5b as summarized in table 2 the predicted dissolved methane consumption rate compares very well with the measured rate in all case with mass balance errors below 5 table 2 the difference was that the aom rate of 4 19 mm d 1 was highest under the condition of nitrate and sulfate co existence as electron acceptors for aom table 2 the expression patterns of key genes related to reverse methanogenic pathway mcra nitrate reduction pathway narg dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway dsra extracellular electron transfer cytc and formation of conductive appendages flab and pila in batch test a i a ii and a iii were further investigated as shown in fig 5d comparing relative gene expression of anme 2d in consortial growth using sulfate or sulfate plus nitrate versus single growth using nitrate genes cytc pila and flab were clearly overexpressed this was also the case when compared to gene dsra expression fig 5d in addition the combination of nitrate and sulfate as electron acceptors caused a significant overexpression in gene mcra which was in response to the highest aom rate in batch test a iii fig 5d microscale levels of no3 no2 nh4 so4 2 and s2 in the biofilm were measured for the biotransformation of nitrogen and sulfur with methane feeding fig 6 the highest nitrate concentration of 355 6 μm and highest sulfate concentration of 1014 8 μm were observed on the surface of the biofilm and the nitrate concentration decreased hastily in the inner part of the biofilm compared with that in absence of sulfate fig 6a and c while the sulfate concentration decreased relaxedly compared with that in absence of nitrate fig 6b and c the interactions with both nitrate and sulfate as electron acceptors in biofilm resulted in a niche zone at about depth of 500 850 μm where nitrate was absent but sulfate is present for anme 2d and srb development fig 6c 3 4 microscopic characterization of biofilm at the end of the mbfr operation day 1200 biofilm samples were harvested from the hollow fibers and analyzed using fish and sem we focused on anme 2d and its potential symbiotic relationship with srb in the presence of nitrate and sulfate srb interlaced around anme 2d fig 7 a and a widely distributed nanonet of flagellum like structures overlaid the aggregations between anme 2d and srb fig 7b this nanonet resembles the nanowire connecting anme 2d and srb but presented a non linear non stacking network structure fig 7c and f with diameters of approximately 10 50 nm and apparent lengths of about 1500 nm or more fig 7d and e in contrast the suspended culture of anme 2d fed with nitrate and sulfate show smooth surfaces without any extracelluar appendages fig s3 indicating that the observed intercellular structures are specific to consortial growth in biofilm and related to cellular attachment 4 discussion 4 1 simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom by anme 2d the nitrate reductase subunit harboring an active site narg for nitrate reduction and a rieske cytochrome b complex for electron transport are encoded in the genome of anme 2d clade arshad et al 2015 haroon et al 2013 which permits the anme 2d clade to perform nitrate dependent aom without any syntrophic partners welte et al 2016 previously known syntrophic partner for anme 1 and 2a b c affiliated within srb desulfococcus spp knittel and boetius 2009 was detected in our study based on the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence analysis while only the clade of anme 2d existed in the biofilm without any other known anme lineages fig 2 and s2 the results in our study suggested that aom coupled to dissimilatory sulfate reduction was mediated by the anme 2d clade in the syntrophic association with srb partners there is the genomic evidence suggesting that the subsurface anme 2d clade detected in groundwater environment may directly couple aom to sulfate reduction by using assimilatory sulfate reduction pathways ino et al 2018 however a dissimilatory role of sulfate reduction supported by the assimilatory genes in anme lineages has not been shown yu et al 2018 the results of batch tests in our study confirmed that simultaneous reduction of nitrate and sulfate was associated with aom which suggested the anme 2d clade not only carried out nitrate dependent aom but also worked with srb for converting sulfate to sulfide simultaneously it is interesting that how sulfate dependent aom compete with nitrate dependent aom in the biofilm since the anme 2d clade yields free energy change δg0 of 521 kj mol 1 ch4 for nitrate reduction eq 2 but the energy yield for sulfate reduction is as low as 21 kj mol 1 ch4 eq 1 previous studies suggested that the observed low growth rate of anme lineages for mediating sulfate dependent aom might be owing to the restricted energetics caldwell et al 2008 evans et al 2019 mcglynn 2017 however even with the available energy and the apparent ability to utilize it the anme 2d clade performing nitrate dependent aom has been reported with a similar growth rate to sulfate dependent aom nauhaus et al 2007 nauhaus et al 2005 orphan et al 2001a thus the energy yield does not directly explain the lack of sulfate dependent aom activity in presence of methane nitrate and sulfate in lab reactors where the anme 2d clade was dominated hu et al 2009 nie et al 2019 vaksmaa et al 2017a based on the microelectrode measurements in our study nitrate was consumed up soon in outer layers of biofilm 0 500 µm while sulfate fully penetrated the biofilm and its reduction to sulfide mainly occurred inner layer 500 850 µm fig 6c as a result stratification of biofilms provided a niche zone for the anme 2d clade and srb where nitrate is absent but sulfate is present previous studies have speculated that the presence of sulfate enabled the anme 2d clade to be active in nitrate free lake sediments schubert et al 2011 su et al 2019 in response to our findings that the absence of nitrate may provide an opportunity for the anme 2d clade coupling with srb for sulfate reduction thus division of anme archaea in anaerobic methane oxidation is not obligate and all clades of anme organisms including anme 2d could cooperate with srb for sulfate dependent aom which will have profound impacts for future microbiology research on anaerobic methane oxidation 4 2 putative mechanism of electron transfer between anme 2d and srb surface morphology of biofilm in our study showed novel nanonet structures connecting cells and expanding within the biofilm fig 7b f which was speculated as conductive appendages involved in extracellular electron transfer in the syntrophy of anme 2d clade and srb previous study has demonstrated the direct interspecies electron transfer as principal mechanism for syntrophic coupling anme 2b c and srb in consortia excluding the intermediates transfer between those two mcglynn et al 2015 in addition there was other evidence for electron transfer between anme 1 2a 3 and srb which showed the mechanism of extension anme s redox active surfaces beyond their cell envelope confines via forming nanowires similar with that in geobacter and shewanella spp gao et al 2017 mcglynn et al 2015 wegener et al 2015 however the observed nanonet structures in our work are distinct from pili like structures which are not a simple stack of nanowires in general the conductive protein appendages of the type iv pili class form flexible filaments with one end anchored in the cell envelope and the other end connected extracellular biotic or abiotic electron acceptors for electron transfer craig et al 2019 shi et al 2016 metatrascriptomic analysis in our study revealed significant upregulation of gene flab in anme 2d for archaellum formation and gene pila in srb for pili formation during sulfate dependent aom fig 4 which suggested that the unique nanonets were supposedly instructed by both pili and archaellum the electrons from anme 2d might travel along the nanonet to cells of srb located on the nanonet where it could be consumed for sulfate reduction previous studies have shown that microbial cells can exchange electrons over centimeter distances through electrical connections lovley 2017 consequently the activity of sulfate dependent aom would be independent of the distance between anme 2d and srb within biofilm in fact the archaellum from the other subtribe of anme 2d clade has been suggested as conductive appendages for electron transfer during mn iv dependent aom process leu et al 2020a the archaellum from methanospirillum hungatei archaea was capable of reducing extracellular electron acceptors which was confirmed to be electrically conductive based on the analysis of conductive atomic force microscopy walker et al 2019 in addition to the deductive conductive strictures cytochrome c is proposed to be important for electron transfer between the anme 2d and their syntrophic srb partners a large number of gene cytc encoding cytochrome c exist in the anme 2d clade and the expression of gene cytc in anme 2d was significantly up regulated with the development of srb in our study cytochrome c reductase can act as electron storage in the cell membrane which can overcome the physical and electrical barrier of cell envelop lai et al 2020 shi et al 2016 for the cooperation of anme 2d and srb therefore anme 2d not only form partnership with nc10 bacteria and anammox bacteria through chemical diffusion of nitrite and ammonium for nitrogen removal but also might work with srb through direct electron transfer via intercellular nanonet for sulfate reduction as corollaries the nanonets may serve as a matrix scaffold of biofilms to accommodate more cytochrome c with orderly arrangements which might enhance the electron diffusion inside the biofilms and the underlying bioelectrochemical characteristics of nanonet for direct electron transfer require further investigation 4 3 aom linking carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles the microbial aom plays a role in global methane regulation and reducing methane release from marine and freshwater ecosystems which is well known to link the cycle of carbon and sulfur in marine fig 8 a knittel and boetius 2009 mccalley 2020 smemo and yavitt 2011 valentine 2002 and carbon and nitrogen in freshwater fig 8b deutzmann and schink 2011 deutzmann et al 2014 martinez cruz et al 2018 segarra et al 2015 the results of our study show that aom can link carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles in a biofilm reactor with counter diffusional substrates methane nitrate and sulfate in the reactor methane as substrate diffuses through the membrane to biofilms while nitrate and sulfate as complementary substrates diffuse from bulk liquid into the biofilm which is similar to the distribution of substances in the natural environments methane diffuses upwards from deeper sediments egger et al 2018 while nitrate and sulfate with higher concentrations in overlaying water diffuse downwards burgin and hamilton 2007 glombitza et al 2016 myrbo et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 it is well established that the diffusion of those substances possibly provides suitable prerequisites for aom linking carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles by the anme 2d clade the observed potential cycles involved with carbon nitrogen and sulfur are shown in fig 8c in the consortia for simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom the active nc10 and anammox bacteria in the biofilm fig s4a and b reflected the syntrophic relationship between anme 2d and other bacteria based on exchange of microbial metabolites in addition the active thiobacillus spp and sulfurovum spp sad for sulfide oxidation with nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptor fig s4c and d confirmed the production of sulfide which showed the syntrophy of anme 2d and desulfococcus spp srb the oxidation of sulfide with nitrate reduction not only avoided the accumulation of sulfide to inhibit the activity of aom fig s5 but also accelerated the formation of nitrate deficient regions in the biofilm fig 6 as microbial communities in natural environments predominantly existing as biofilms flemming et al 2016 p stoodley et al 2002 the dense cell aggregates coating mineral surfaces battin et al 2003 in methane sulfate and nitrate rich sediments may control the carbon sulfur and nitrogen cycles via simultaneous sulfate and nitrate dependent aom process since nitrous oxide is a metabolic intermediate in the process of nitrate nitrite reduction to dinitrogen gas by sad lan et al 2019 liu et al 2016b the release of nitrous oxide in the simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom process should be of further concern this work also suggested that the cooperation among the anme 2d clade and other bacterial partners for simultaneous sulfate and nitrate dependent aom process not only occurred at optimal temperature 30 c and room temperature 25 c but also occurred at the temperature close to that of the natural sediments 10 c or 5 c nevertheless the microbial interactions presented here are susceptible to interference by other coexisting electron acceptors in the environments such as iron manganese humus and so on bai et al 2019 ettwig et al 2016 still the environments such as nearshore sediments receiving reactive nitrogen compounds laverman et al 2012 and freshwater environments with anthropogenic sulfate input chen et al 2016 lamers et al 1998 possibly provide suitable prerequisites for simultaneous nitrate and sulfate dependent aom by anme 2d the link of carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles bonded by aom could broad the implication to global methane cycle in addition nitrate dependent amo has been proposed to provide alternative solutions to simultaneously remove nitrogen and mitigate methane emission during wastewater treatment nie et al 2020 xie et al 2017 xie et al 2018 however sewage also contain considerable concentration of sulfate resulting from application of sulfate coagulants during drinking water treatment and seawater toilet flushing zhang et al 2019 the potential role of anme 2d in carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles and the contribution to methane and nitrogen turnover in natural environments and engineered wastewater treatment systems requires further investigation 5 conclusion overall our findings provide a novel insight into aom by anme 2d clade which may link carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycle occurring in estuary or coastal zone as the interface of marine and freshwater environments based on the bioreactor performance reconstructed metabolic pathways and profiles of gene expression this work shows that anme 2d not only conduct nitrate reduction but also work with srb for converting sulfate to sulfide gene cytc encoded by anme 2d is found to be highly expressed during sulfate dependent aom suggesting cytochrome c plays an active role in electron transport form anme 2d to srb for sulfate reduction interestingly unique nanonets connecting anme 2d and srb are observed in the biofilm which are hypothesized as conductive appendages involved in extracellular electron transfer in addition our work also demonstrates that the produced sulfide can be oxidized back to sulfate by sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrifier with nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptors in turn alleviating sulfide accumulation and enhancing nitrogen removal meanwhile future research should focus on confirming the conductivity of the unique nanonets similar to nanowires for electron transfer and the potential role of anme 2d in carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles in natural environments and engineered wastewater treatment systems such the efforts will further expand our

17138,reservoirs have been constructed as clean energy sources in recent decades with various environmental impacts karst rivers typically exhibit high dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations whether and how reservoirs affect carbon cycling especially organic carbon oc related biogeochemical processes in karst rivers are unclear to fill this knowledge gap multiple tracer methods including fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem ultraviolet uv absorption and stable carbon δ13c and radiocarbon δ14c isotopes were utilized to track composition and property changes of both particulate oc poc and dissolved oc doc along river transition reservoir transects in the southwest china karst area the changes in chemical properties indicated that from the river to the reservoir terrestrial poc is largely replaced by phytoplankton derived oc while gradual coloured dissolved organic matter cdom removal and addition of phytoplankton derived oc to the doc pool occurred as water flowed to the reservoir higher primary production in the transition area than that in the reservoir area was observed which may be caused by nutrient released from suspended particles within the reservoir the production surpassed degradation in the upper 5 m resulting in a net dic transformation into doc and poc and terrestrial dom degradation the primary production was then gradually weakened and microbial degradation became more important down the profile it is estimated that 3 1 6 3 mg l 1 15 5 31 5 mg c m 2 10 21 dic was integrated into the oc pool through the biological carbon pump bcp process in the upper 5 m in the transition and reservoir areas our results emphasize the reservoir impact on riverine oc transport and due to their characteristics karst areas exhibit a higher bcp potential which is sensitive to human activities more nutrient are provided than non karst areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reservoir biological carbon pump dissolved organic matter fluorescence radiocarbon 1 introduction rivers comprise the major link between the land and ocean transporting up to 260 tg yr 1 of dissolved organic carbon doc and approximately 200 tg yr 1 of particulate organic carbon poc to the ocean hedges 1992 raymond and spencer 2015 however due to the pressure exerted by human activities on rivers only 37 of the rivers worldwide remain free flowing rivers best 2019 grill et al 2019 approximately 60 tg of organic carbon oc is buried globally in inland reservoirs each year accounting for approximately 40 of the global oc burial mendonca et al 2017 more than 48 000 reservoirs with a depth greater than 15 m have been established globally since 1980 dams 2000 with increasing number of reservoirs the environmental problems caused by reservoirs become increasingly prominent maavara et al 2017 wang 2020 for example a reservoir may change the light conditions and hydraulic retention time of a river and may increase the retention of nutrients and the burial of sediments resulting in different degrees of change in the transport and transformation of organic matter om over natural river systems matzinger et al 2007 however systematic research on how reservoirs alter riverine oc cycling remains lacking dissolved om dom plays an important role in all biological and abiotic processes in aquatic ecosystems hansen et al 2016 yang et al 2014 dom may be affected by many processes whereby photodegradation and biodegradation are among the two main processes in inland water bodies dittmar 2015 hansen et al 2016 raymond and spencer 2015 photodegradation of dom produces active nitrogen n bushaw et al 1996 teeling et al 2012 which is beneficial to the growth of phytoplankton in the aquatic environment teeling et al 2012 moreover during biodegradation refractory dom is produced which then forms a potential carbon sink after burial in sediments jiao et al 2010 therefore it is particularly important to investigate the sources and transport and transformation processes of dom natural dom is a complex mixture composed of tens of thousands of different molecules dittmar 2015 to better understand the transport and transformation of dom in river systems multiple methods are required ultraviolet uv absorption and the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem technique are simple and efficient methods that have been widely applied to characterize and quantify the composition of dom in aquatic environments derrien et al 2019 holland et al 2018 while the stable and radioactive isotopes of oc effectively track the sources and transformations in water environments raymond and bauer 2001a therefore the combination of the optical properties and isotopic composition of om may help to explain its biogeochemical cycle qualitatively and quantitatively and may further provide a perspective from the bulk to the molecular level global karst areas account for 15 of the earth land area ipcc climate 2007 which imposes a major effect on the terrestrial c uptake and environmental quality liu et al 2018 piao et al 2010 as a carbon sink reservoirs play an important role in the global carbon cycle especially the reservoirs in karst areas beaulieu et al 2012 cole et al 2007 since karst water bodies usually contain 6 10 times higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic than do those in non karst areas due to weathering shih 2018 zhong et al 2020 they provide more favourable conditions for the biological carbon pump bcp process the bcp process is an important part of the oc cycle which often occurs on the surface of water bodies including rivers lakes reservoirs and oceans the bcp process converts inorganic carbon into oc in aquatic systems and thereby affects the carbon cycle liu et al 2018 therefore understanding the reservoir effect in karst areas is significant in a global scale in terms of carbon cycle china contains the largest karst area worldwide which is mainly found in the southwest region due to the abundant water resources and canyon shaped terrain the southwest region has become an important hydropower development area with a notable reservoir effect wang et al 2019 the hongjiadu hjd reservoir is the first reservoir with a multi year regulation function in the wujiang river basin in addition to the reservoir effect it is also possible to intuitively observe the change in oc from the river to the reservoir and exclude the influence of the cascade reservoir effect therefore the hjd reservoir is an ideal site to study oc transport and transformation in river reservoir systems our previous investigations focused on physical conditions and bulk oc properties showed that the most intense stratification and largest differences between rivers and reservoirs occurred in summer supplementary file fig s1 and s2 therefore we focused our study in the summer period due to the high dynamics of the water environment wang et al 2019 multiple techniques including optical properties and stable and radioactive isotopes were applied our objectives are 1 to characterize the changes in the sources and composition of oc in the river reservoir continuum 2 to quantify how the reservoir affects the transport and transform of oc and 3 to propose a conceptual model of the effect of the reservoir on carbon cycling our results not only reflect the important role that reservoirs play in reservoir systems but also provide a theoretical basis to analyze the transport and transformation of oc from a systematic perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the wujiang river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river in guizhou province china the wujiang river has a total length of 1037 km with a watershed area of 87 92ⅹ106 km2 the climate in the

features notable carbonate weathering the depth of the hjd is 125 m and due to its water volume regulation function the average annual flow rate is 155 m3 s 1 the hjd reservoir exhibits the longest water retention time and highest water level in summer and the lowest values are observed in winter table s1 the site has been classified to three regions river region transition region and reservoir

density polyethylene bottles at 4 c and tested within two days for uv and eem analysis for the dic analysis the water samples were first filtered in the field using 0 45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene

dic doc and poc the concentration of the doc was determined on an aurora 1030 total oc analyser oi analytical usa with duplicates 1 5 analytical error in regard to the elemental and carbon isotope analysis of the particulate samples the gf f filters were first acidified to remove any inorganic carbon bao et al 2014 and the concentration of poc and total nitrogen tn was tested with an elemental analyser euro vector ea3000 italy 5 analytical error the c n was then calculated as the weight ratio of poc to tn the concentration of dic was determined by titration with hcl at 0 02 mol l 1 in the field within 12 h telmer and veizer 1999 for the isotopes of doc the filtrate 5 l were first concentrated through rotary evaporation and oxidized into co2 gas in a vacuum line system via wet oxidation leonard et al 2013 the generated co2 were then divided into two parts for δ13c δ13cdoc and δ14c δ14cdoc analysis the co2 partitioned for the δ13cdoc analysis was directly tested with a 253 plus

university for δ13c of poc δ13cpoc the sample after acidification was directly tested in a flash 2000 ht device coupled with the 253 plus instrument thermo fisher 0 2 analytical error and the δ14c sample was combusted at 850 c for 2 h under vacuum and evolved co2 was transformed into graphite and tested via ams the δ14cdoc and δ14cpoc were calibrated with the δ13c value of the sample stuiver and polach 1977 the δ13c of dic δ13cdic were determined with a gas bench coupled with a delta v plus instrument thermo fisher 0 3 analytical error as previously reported zhou et al 2015 2 2 2 optical

concentrations from 60 to 80 m were close to those at the riverine sites 3 3 the optical properties of dom the a254 indicating the content of cdom and suva254 indicating the aromaticity of dom griffin et al 2018 helms et al 2008 values demonstrated similar decreasing trends along the river reservoir transect fig 2 c and were 14 34 m 1 to 12 3 m 1 and 15 34 l mg 1 m 1 to 7 59 l mg 1 m 1 respectively both parameters then increased to values similar to those observed at the riverine sites at the reservoir outlet three fluorescent dom fdom components were identified including terrestrial humic like c type substances autochthonous humic like m type substances and tryptophan like t type substances in the surface samples fig s3 peaks c m and t showed similar trends to those of a254 and suva254 and were all significantly higher in the river area h1 h4 and outflow area h15 than they were in the transition and reservoir areas h5 h14 fig 2 d in the reservoir a254 attained the highest value 14 74 m

and remained relatively constant below 60 m 16 61 0 99 l mg 1 m 1 in the reservoir profile all the fluorescent components were relatively low from 0 5 m fig 3 d peak c exhibited a slight change from

phytoplankton origin with a strong signal 0 17 0 02 was generated from 100 120 m peak t was the highest from 100 120 m 0 093 0 005 followed by 15 45 m 0 055 0 005 and it was the lowest from 60 80 m 0 034 0 002 3 4 the stable and radioactive isotopes of dic doc and poc the δ13cdic and δ13cdoc was 9 5 to 2 6 and 28 6 to 26 8 respectively and showed similar trends with most enriched values occurring in the transition area and most depleted values occurring in the river area the δ13cpoc ranged from 29 5 to 24 7 which also exhibited the most enriched value 22 1 in the transition area and the most depleted value in the reservoir area the δ14cdoc became increasingly depleted from the river area 67 9 to the reservoir area 140 22 while δ14cpoc became increasingly enriched from the river area 495 43 to the reservoir area 186 17 in the reservoir profile δ13cdic was enriched at 0 10 m 3 1 0 1 and then remained at a relatively depleted and invariable value below 15 m 9 40 2 fig 3 e δ13cdoc was 28 5 to 27 1 and first showed an increasing trend from 0 m to 15 m followed by a decreased from 15 m to 80 m 30 1 and gradually increased to 27 7 at 120 m δ13cpoc was 32 9 to 29 5 and exhibited almost the opposite trends to those of doc the δ14cdoc andδ14cpoc also showed opposite trends in the profile fig 3 f δ14cdoc increased from 0 m 131 to 120 m 78 of which the most positive value occurred at 80 m 71 while δ14cpoc decreased from 0 m 204 to 120 m 303 with the most negative value also observed at 80 m 330 4 discussion 4 1 sources and transformation of organic carbon along the flow path a typical reservoir effect on poc is the removal of terrestrial om from the water column and the increase in phytoplankton derived om due to the decrease in flow velocity settling of suspended particles and reduction in water turbidity thus increasing primary production matzinger et al 2007 a continuous decrease in tsm was observed along the transition reservoir transect fig 2 b reflecting the effect of reservoirs in trapping terrestrial suspended particles and om phytoplankton mainly consumes water soluble co2 for photosynthesis liu et al 2018 which causes a reduction in the dic concentration and an enrichment in δ13cdic wang et al 2019 the dic concentration in the river area was approximately 30 mg l 1 which is a typical value observed in karst regions but is more than 5 times higher than that observed in non karst areas shih 2018 in the hjd reservoir the dic concentration decrease and δ13cdic enrichment along the river reservoir transect suggested an enhanced primary production due to dam construction the poc was nearly 30 which is a typical value for phytoplankton airoldi and cinelli 1997 agreed with the increased contribution of in situ production the values and ranges of δ13cpoc 30 0 to 24 7 as well as of the c n weight ratio 6 0 10 1 further revealed a gradual transition from the soil om observed in the river area to the typical phytoplankton source in the transition reservoir area fig 4 lamb et al 2006 the soil om source in the river area is likely an aged deep soil layer as reflected by the depleted δ14cpoc 550 value marwick et al 2015 the changes in δ13cpoc suggested that the newly produced poc had a more enriched δ13c in the transition region than that in the reservoir earlier study in the greifen lake found that δ13cpoc of phytoplankton derived oc was much enriched during higher productivity season and was attributed to the different carbon sources utilized co2 aq vs bicarbonate hollander and mckenzie 1991 the enriched δ13cpoc in the transition region than that in the reservoir was also in accord with the higher productivity see discussion in section 4 3 interestingly the δ14cpoc value of the surface water in the transition reservoir region was more depleted than the fresh phytoplankton signal observed in the other regions chen et al 2018 which could be caused by the depleted δ14cdic in karst areas liu et al 2017 therefore the changes in the poc properties all reflect a typical reservoir effect on the poc sources in this head reservoir doc in the river region indicated a much younger δ14c signal 67 9 than did poc fig 3 f which suggests that the contribution of the main source was derived from the surface soil fig 5 younger doc than the poc were also observed in other rivers which were attributed to the pre aging process of poc in soil and the leaching of freshly produced om raymond and bauer 2001b the suva254 15 l mg 1 m 1 values in the river area were much higher than those observed for the phytoplankton derived dom and even higher than the riverine dom ranges observed during flooding mainly soil derived om fellman et al 2013 suggesting the dominance of soil derived om consistent with the information retrieved from δ14cdoc the increase in the doc concentration fig 2 b in the transition reservoir areas suggested a net addition of doc in the water column which is unlikely caused by the input from tributaries since doc concentrations were similar between those tributaries table s2 and mainstream the slight enrichment in δ13cdoc agreed with the enrichment in δ13cpoc fig 2 e suggesting that the doc increase had a similar source to that of poc i e in situ production the decrease in δ14cdoc in the transition reservoir areas was also consistent with the addition of 14c depleted phytoplankton derived oc fig 2 f aquatic primary production usually yields much lower a254 and suva254 values than do higher plants liu et al 2019 which may have led to the low suva254 value in the transition and reservoir areas by mixing with riverine dom he et al 2020 also found a decrease in suva254 with increasing autochthonous dom in the three gorges reservoir nevertheless the decrease in a254 and fluorescence intensity of each component in the transition reservoir areas implied that in addition to the input from in situ production notable net removal of cdom occurred fig 2 c and d photodegradation microbial degradation and sorption by particles may all remove cdom from the water column hansen et al 2016 due to the preferential utilization of non aromatic om microbial degradation of dom normally induces an increase in suva254 hansen et al 2016 photodegradation is the likely mechanism as it preferentially removes aromatic dom which is mainly of terrestrial origin and causes a strong decrease in a254 and suva254 as previously observed he et al 2020 stubbins et al 2010 the role of dom sorption by sinking particles in the transition region remains unclear and merits further study the doc characteristics concentration carbon isotopes suva254 a254 and fluorescence intensity of each component of the outlet samples were similar to those of the river samples suggesting little transformation of the released water which is related to the layer of the outlet please refer to the discussion below 4 2 sources and transformation of organic carbon in the reservoir profile as water flows into the reservoir due to changes in the physical conditions at the different depths the biogeochemical processes may exhibit large differences down the profile especially during the summer season when notable thermal stratification occurs fig 3 a based on the physiochemical parameters the reservoir profile was divided into four layers surface layer 0 15 m subsurface layer 15 45 m intermediate layer 45 80 m and bottom layer 80 120 m in the surface layer the notably high do and poc values low dic concentration high doc level and δ13cdic enrichment all indicated substantial photosynthesis thus producing and accumulating oc in addition the lowest a254 and suva254 values and fluorescence intensity indicated the notable removal of cdom by photochemical degradation hansen et al 2016 as observed in the whole surface layer in the transition reservoir area sorption was unlikely an important process within the reservoir since most mineral particles had already settled in the transition region as indicated by the changes in tsm fig 2 b therefore this layer can be denoted as the production photodegradation dominant layer ppdl in the subsurface layer a sharp decline in do at 15 m indicated a decrease in production and an increase in oxygen consumption dic and doc at 15 m were still 2 mg l 1 lower and 0 3 mg l 1 higher respectively than those observed at the riverine site suggesting that primary production still occurred at 15 m but much lower than that in the surface layer an earlier study suggested that light still reached this layer hemsley et al 2015 hence a weaker bcp process could still occur the lowest do and ph values at 15 m suggested notable oc mineralization the sharp increases in a254 suva254 fluorescence intensity and δ13cdoc at 15 m were all consistent with microbial degradation transformation romera castillo et al 2011 the most depleted δ13cpoc at 15 m was also in consist with weak primary production that utilized the depleted δ13cdic in this layer however the poc concentration was largely decreased suggesting that even there was primary production it was very weak then the fraction of terrestrial poc could not be ignored in this layer the enrichment in δ13cpoc and depletion in δ14cpoc was also in accord with the increased fraction of terrestrial poc that were still suspended increases in the fraction of terrestrial oc could also explain the variation trend of δ13cdoc and δ14cdoc overall this layer is denoted as the biodegradation dominant layer bdl in the intermediate layer 45 80 m since no light reached this layer primary production and photodegradation were all negligible all dic and dom parameters all resembled those at the riverine sites fig 2 and fig 3 suggesting little transformation of carbon in this layer the doc characteristics of the released water were also similar to those of this layer since the water was released at a certain depth within this layer therefore the effect of the dam on water release also depended on the outlet of the reservoir the notably low poc concentration in this layer largely occurred due to the gradual removal of suspended particles during transport from the river to the reservoir the δ14cdoc and δ14cpoc continue to enrich and deplete respectively and was consisting with the increased fraction of terrestrial om hence this layer can be denoted as the river mixing dominant layer rmdl in the bottom layer 80 120 m very interestingly an obvious increase in δ13cdoc and δ13cpoc along with a new fdom component were occurred at 80 m an earlier study indicated that due to the preferential utilization of the 13c light component an enrichment in δ13cdoc could be observed during microbial degradation meckenstock et al 2004 the changes in the doc isotopes and fdom components were consistent with the microbial transformation of dom observed in various aquatic environments jiao et al 2010 an earlier study in lake overlying water also reported a similar phenomenon yang et al 2014 the slight increase in doc and a254 in the bottom layer may be derived from diffusion from sediments therefore this layer can be denoted as the anaerobic modification dominant layer amdl 4 3 quantifying the transformation of carbon among the different carbon pools and implications to quantitatively understand the transformation of carbon among the different carbon pools dic poc and doc different parameters were applied as mentioned above section 4 2 poc in the surface layer of the transition reservoir area is predominantly of an autochthonous source while the addition of doc is also derived from in situ production therefore the amount of oc contributed by in situ production ocp can be estimated as the sum of poc concentration of the samples from the transition and reservoir areas pocs and in situ production of doc in the transition and reservoir areas docp and a two end member mixing model based on δ14c was applied to quantify the docp raymond and bauer 2001a see the supplementary text for a detailed analysis and calculation method table s3 the results table s4 indicate that in the transition and reservoir areas phytoplankton contributed 50 to the total doc while this value decreased to 5 in the rmdl and amdl suggesting that either the newly produced dom was not largely transferred to the deeper layers or that the om was largely degraded in addition although the cdom experienced substantial photodegradation a254 and fluorescence intensity decreased by approximately 19 and 72 respectively only approximately 10 of the terrestrial dom was removed except at station h8 the unexpected high removal of terrestrial dom at h8 was related to the relatively depleted δ14cdoc value we speculate that if this value is true i e no point contamination it may then be related to the considerable sinking of suspended particles which absorbed the terrestrial dom the dic concentration was mainly affected by photosynthesis precipitation of carbonates and outgassing which are modulated by various physiochemical conditions jan et al 2010 here we define the difference between the sample dics and riverine dic values dicr as δdic during the photosynthetic uptake of dic by aquatic phototrophs half of the dic is bonded with ca2 to form calcium carbonate liu et al 2018 which is defined as δdicc and the other half is incorporated into the om pool which is defined as δdicp liu et al 2018 in theory δdicc δdicp in addition the molar ratio of δdicc equals the molar of reduced ca2 in bcp process by considering the loss of dic and ca2 in different processes bcp and carbonate precipitation due to changes in temperature the transfer of dic into the oc pool can be calculated see supplementary file for detailed determination method and results the results indicated that ocp was much lower than δdicp fig 6 which suggests two important facts 1 a large amount of dic was transferred to the oc pool in this karst area in summer δdicp was 3 1 to 6 3 mg l 1 15 5 31 5 mg c m 2 10 21 assuming similar carbon transfer occurred in the upper 5 m of the transition reservoir area even higher than the riverine dic concentration in non karst areas shih 2018 2 only 20 24 remained in the oc pool in the water column with 70 of the produced oc had an unknown fate in current study table s4 in most terrestrial ecosystems aquatic primary production is limited by phosphorus wang 2020 in the hjd phosphate exhibited a sharp decrease from the river to the transition area and approached 0 mg l 1 in the reservoir area table s2 suggesting that in situ production was also limited by p in our study area the amount of autochthonous oc remaining in the water column was close to the p bonded oc following the redfield ratio which ranged from approximately 1 1 3 mg l 1 supplementary table s5 the much higher δdicp value may occur because p containing om was preferentially mineralized and re entered the water column to support photosynthesis lomas et al 2010 therefore the reservoir acted as a factory that continuously converted dic into oc either preserved in sediments or emitted as co2 the oc burial efficiency is therefore key to the global carbon budget earlier studies showed a highly variable oc burial efficiency 10 to 90 in other reservoirs mendonça et al 2016 the low pco2 value in the transition and reservoir areas table s2 suggested that the oc produced through primary production may not be largely degraded however the net burial of oc in the hjd reservoir requires further research interestingly δdic exhibited a higher value in the transition area than that in the reservoir area fig 2 b table s5 similar results were observed for δdicc which together implied that a higher primary production occurred in the transition area than that in the reservoir area liu et al 2018 which could also be supported by the chl a data fig 2 a the higher values of δ13cdic do doc and poc in the transition area also revealed higher primary production and were consistent with the observations in greifen lake that δ13cdic and δ13cpoc was more enriched during higher productivity season hollander and mckenzie 1991 fig 2 a b and e we speculate that in the transition region the high primary productivity might be related to the release of nutrients from terrestrial tsm wang et al 2011 in contrast the reservoir area mainly provided nutrients for the primary production process through om degradation these results emphasize the importance of the transition area in reservoir research previously studies mainly focused on reservoir areas mendonça et al 2016 mendonca et al 2017 wang 2020 wang et al 2019 however our results reveal that transition areas are in fact hotspots for the primary production process and potential burial furthermore the results of our study also indicate that the reservoirs in karst areas exhibit a very high potential to affect the climate over non karst areas under the condition of intensified human activities since in situ production is a nutrient limited process once nutrients enter the river system the process is largely enhanced compared to non karst areas more sufficient dic sources occur in karst areas to support this process which promotes the burial of oc or degradation into co2 by a fast production degradation process fig 7 the net effect degradation vs preservation may generate a high spatiotemporal variation regulated by physical conditions not only will a large amount of terrestrial om be buried in reservoirs in the next ten to one hundred years but a considerable dic amount will also be converted into om and be buried or degraded and emitted to the atmosphere 5 conclusion karst areas are carbon rich region the effect of reservoir on carbon transport may have global significance however were not well constrained especially the oc related biogeochemical processes by applying multi tracers we found that during the transition from the river to the reservoir terrestrial poc was replaced by an autochthonous source along with the gradual removal of terrestrial doc and net addition of autochthonous doc fig 7 higher primary production was observed in the upper 5 m in the transition area 27 2 5 mg c m 2 18 2 than in the reservoir 19 3 mg c m 2 13 2 suggesting the transition area is in fact a hotspot for carbon transfer and should be given more attention in future studies however the results from current study couldn t represent the biogeochemical processes occurred throughout the year since there is only one systematic analysis in summer season the depth distribution of the doc and poc concentrations and compositions during the stratification period revealed a structured carbon cycling pattern fig 7 higher production degradation of oc occurred in the surface layer while a lower in situ production but notable remineralization was observed in the subsurface layer little oc transformation occurred in the intermediate layer and notable microbial transformation and or sediment diffusion in the bottom layer fig 7 we further estimated that the amount of dic 3 1 6 3 mg l 1 15 5 31 5 mg c m 2 10 21 that was incorporated into oc pool caused by the reservoir was equal to higher than the riverine dic concentration in non karst area suggesting that the influence of reservoir on riverine carbon transport and transformation is more significant due to nutrient limitations and large amounts of available c the reservoirs in karst regions are highly sensitive to anthropogenic activities and would have a higher potential to affect the climate over non karst areas authors contributions yuanbi yi performed all of the chemical analyses under the guidance of siliang li and hongyan bao all of the authors designed the study discussed

17138,reservoirs have been constructed as clean energy sources in recent decades with various environmental impacts karst rivers typically exhibit high dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations whether and how reservoirs affect carbon cycling especially organic carbon oc related biogeochemical processes in karst rivers are unclear to fill this knowledge gap multiple tracer methods including fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem ultraviolet uv absorption and stable carbon δ13c and radiocarbon δ14c isotopes were utilized to track composition and property changes of both particulate oc poc and dissolved oc doc along river transition reservoir transects in the southwest china karst area the changes in chemical properties indicated that from the river to the reservoir terrestrial poc is largely replaced by phytoplankton derived oc while gradual coloured dissolved organic matter cdom removal and addition of phytoplankton derived oc to the doc pool occurred as water flowed to the reservoir higher primary production in the transition area than that in the reservoir area was observed which may be caused by nutrient released from suspended particles within the reservoir the production surpassed degradation in the upper 5 m resulting in a net dic transformation into doc and poc and terrestrial dom degradation the primary production was then gradually weakened and microbial degradation became more important down the profile it is estimated that 3 1 6 3 mg l 1 15 5 31 5 mg c m 2 10 21 dic was integrated into the oc pool through the biological carbon pump bcp process in the upper 5 m in the transition and reservoir areas our results emphasize the reservoir impact on riverine oc transport and due to their characteristics karst areas exhibit a higher bcp potential which is sensitive to human activities more nutrient are provided than non karst areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reservoir biological carbon pump dissolved organic matter fluorescence radiocarbon 1 introduction rivers comprise the major link between the land and ocean transporting up to 260 tg yr 1 of dissolved organic carbon doc and approximately 200 tg yr 1 of particulate organic carbon poc to the ocean hedges 1992 raymond and spencer 2015 however due to the pressure exerted by human activities on rivers only 37 of the rivers worldwide remain free flowing rivers best 2019 grill et al 2019 approximately 60 tg of organic carbon oc is buried globally in inland reservoirs each year accounting for approximately 40 of the global oc burial mendonca et al 2017 more than 48 000 reservoirs with a depth greater than 15 m have been established globally since 1980 dams 2000 with increasing number of reservoirs the environmental problems caused by reservoirs become increasingly prominent maavara et al 2017 wang 2020 for example a reservoir may change the light conditions and hydraulic retention time of a river and may increase the retention of nutrients and the burial of sediments resulting in different degrees of change in the transport and transformation of organic matter om over natural river systems matzinger et al 2007 however systematic research on how reservoirs alter riverine oc cycling remains lacking dissolved om dom plays an important role in all biological and abiotic processes in aquatic ecosystems hansen et al 2016 yang et al 2014 dom may be affected by many processes whereby photodegradation and biodegradation are among the two main processes in inland water bodies dittmar 2015 hansen et al 2016 raymond and spencer 2015 photodegradation of dom produces active nitrogen n bushaw et al 1996 teeling et al 2012 which is beneficial to the growth of phytoplankton in the aquatic environment teeling et al 2012 moreover during biodegradation refractory dom is produced which then forms a potential carbon sink after burial in sediments jiao et al 2010 therefore it is particularly important to investigate the sources and transport and transformation processes of dom natural dom is a complex mixture composed of tens of thousands of different molecules dittmar 2015 to better understand the transport and transformation of dom in river systems multiple methods are required ultraviolet uv absorption and the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem technique are simple and efficient methods that have been widely applied to characterize and quantify the composition of dom in aquatic environments derrien et al 2019 holland et al 2018 while the stable and radioactive isotopes of oc effectively track the sources and transformations in water environments raymond and bauer 2001a therefore the combination of the optical properties and isotopic composition of om may help to explain its biogeochemical cycle qualitatively and quantitatively and may further provide a perspective from the bulk to the molecular level global karst areas account for 15 of the earth land area ipcc climate 2007 which imposes a major effect on the terrestrial c uptake and environmental quality liu et al 2018 piao et al 2010 as a carbon sink reservoirs play an important role in the global carbon cycle especially the reservoirs in karst areas beaulieu et al 2012 cole et al 2007 since karst water bodies usually contain 6 10 times higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic than do those in non karst areas due to weathering shih 2018 zhong et al 2020 they provide more favourable conditions for the biological carbon pump bcp process the bcp process is an important part of the oc cycle which often occurs on the surface of water bodies including rivers lakes reservoirs and oceans the bcp process converts inorganic carbon into oc in aquatic systems and thereby affects the carbon cycle liu et al 2018 therefore understanding the reservoir effect in karst areas is significant in a global scale in terms of carbon cycle china contains the largest karst area worldwide which is mainly found in the southwest region due to the abundant water resources and canyon shaped terrain the southwest region has become an important hydropower development area with a notable reservoir effect wang et al 2019 the hongjiadu hjd reservoir is the first reservoir with a multi year regulation function in the wujiang river basin in addition to the reservoir effect it is also possible to intuitively observe the change in oc from the river to the reservoir and exclude the influence of the cascade reservoir effect therefore the hjd reservoir is an ideal site to study oc transport and transformation in river reservoir systems our previous investigations focused on physical conditions and bulk oc properties showed that the most intense stratification and largest differences between rivers and reservoirs occurred in summer supplementary file fig s1 and s2 therefore we focused our study in the summer period due to the high dynamics of the water environment wang et al 2019 multiple techniques including optical properties and stable and radioactive isotopes were applied our objectives are 1 to characterize the changes in the sources and composition of oc in the river reservoir continuum 2 to quantify how the reservoir affects the transport and transform of oc and 3 to propose a conceptual model of the effect of the reservoir on carbon cycling our results not only reflect the important role that reservoirs play in reservoir systems but also provide a theoretical basis to analyze the transport and transformation of oc from a systematic perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the wujiang river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river in guizhou province china the wujiang river has a total length of 1037 km with a watershed area of 87 92ⅹ106 km2 the climate in the study region is classified as a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an annual rainfall and mean temperature of 1180 mm and 15 c respectively gzqx 2018 the river is located in a karst area and features notable carbonate weathering the depth of the hjd is 125 m and due to its water volume regulation function the average annual flow rate is 155 m3 s 1 the hjd reservoir exhibits the longest water retention time and highest water level in summer and the lowest values are observed in winter table s1 the site has been classified to three regions river region transition region and reservoir region according to the changes in the carbon chemistry which undergoes temporal changes throughout the year 2 2 sampling and analytical methods surface water samples 0 5 m along the river reservoir transect in tributary mainstream and a depth profile ranging from the surface 0 5 m to near the bottom 125 m were collected from the hjd reservoir in august 2018 using a niskin water sampler model

was calibrated on site the water samples were filtered through glass fiber filters whatman gf f pre combusted at 450 c for 4 h immediately after sampling the particulate matter retained on the filters were stored at 20 c until the analyze for the concentration and isotopes of poc the filtrate was acidified with phosphoric acid to ph 2 and stored at 4 c for doc analysis and were stored in high density polyethylene bottles at 4 c and tested within two days for uv and eem analysis for the dic analysis the water samples were first filtered in the field using 0 45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filters and then 2 ml samples was injected into 10 ml labco bottles under pre treatment vacuum and 1 ml phosphoric acid was added with a syringe 2 2 1 the concentration and isotope analysis of dic doc and poc the concentration of the doc was determined on an aurora 1030 total oc analyser oi analytical usa with duplicates 1 5 analytical error in regard to the elemental and carbon isotope analysis of the particulate samples the gf f filters were first acidified to remove any inorganic carbon bao et al 2014 and the concentration of poc and total nitrogen tn was tested with an elemental analyser euro vector ea3000 italy 5 analytical error the c n was then calculated as the weight ratio of poc to tn the concentration of dic was determined by titration with hcl at 0 02 mol l 1 in the field within 12 h telmer and veizer 1999 for the isotopes of doc the filtrate 5 l were first concentrated through rotary evaporation and oxidized into co2 gas in a vacuum line system via wet oxidation leonard et al 2013 the generated co2 were then divided into two parts for δ13c δ13cdoc and δ14c δ14cdoc analysis the co2 partitioned for the δ13cdoc analysis was directly tested with a 253 plus instrument thermo fisher 0 1 analytical error and was converted into graphite xu et al 2007 and tested in an accelerator mass spectrometry ams system 3 analytical error for δ14cdoc at tianjin university for δ13c of poc δ13cpoc the sample after acidification was directly tested in a flash 2000 ht device coupled with the 253 plus instrument thermo fisher 0 2 analytical error and the δ14c sample was combusted at 850 c for 2 h under vacuum and evolved co2 was transformed into graphite and tested via ams the δ14cdoc and δ14cpoc were calibrated with the δ13c value of the sample stuiver and polach 1977 the δ13c of dic δ13cdic were determined with a gas bench coupled with a delta v plus instrument thermo fisher 0 3 analytical error as previously reported zhou et al 2015 2 2 2 optical properties of dom a uv visible vis spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu was used to estimate the absorbance of the filtered water samples λ 200 750 nm various optical parameters including the absorption coefficient a λ and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 l mg 1 m 1 were calculated griffin et al 2018 helms et al 2008 eems were tested with a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan using previously reported measurement procedures mostofa et al 2019 the detailed procedure followed in applying parafac model to eem spectra and the validation of parafac model is provided in supplementary text 2 3 statistical analyses pearson s correlation between the different parameters was analysed with r 4 0 2 where the notation represents the standard deviation if not otherwise mentioned 3 results 3 1 basic physical parameters the physical conditions from the river to the reservoir area changed significantly fig 2 a along the direction of water flow the temperature 20 8 27 6

showed similar trends both first decreased from surface to 15 m and then gradually increased 3 2 the concentration of the total suspended matter tsm dic doc and poc tsm dic and poc were 1 2 48 mg l 1

while the dic concentration 28 7 mg l 1 returned to a level close to that observed at the river sites fig 2 b doc increased from the river 0 9 0 1 mg l 1 to the reservoir 1 6 0 1 mg l 1 and decreased to a concentration 1 0 mg l 1 similar to that observed at the riverine sites at the outlet the proportion of poc poc was the lowest in the river area 2 1 and the highest in the reservoir area 34 4 fig

concentrations from 60 to 80 m were close to those at the riverine sites 3 3 the optical properties of dom the a254 indicating the content of cdom and suva254 indicating the aromaticity of dom griffin et al 2018 helms et al 2008 values demonstrated similar decreasing trends along the river reservoir transect fig 2 c and were 14 34 m 1 to 12 3 m 1 and 15 34 l mg 1 m 1 to 7 59 l mg 1 m 1 respectively both parameters then increased to values similar to those observed at the riverine sites at the reservoir outlet three fluorescent dom fdom components were identified including terrestrial humic like c type substances autochthonous humic like m type substances and tryptophan like t type substances in the surface samples fig s3 peaks c m and t showed similar trends to those of a254 and suva254 and were all significantly higher in the river area h1 h4 and outflow area h15 than they were in the transition and reservoir areas h5 h14 fig 2 d in the reservoir a254 attained the highest value 14 74 m

and remained relatively constant below 60 m 16 61 0 99 l mg 1 m 1 in the reservoir profile all the fluorescent components were relatively low from 0 5 m fig 3 d peak c exhibited a slight change from 15 120 m while peak m exhibited a much smaller change than did peak c from 15 80 m and then disappeared from 100 120 m a new protein peak newly released protein like substances namely peak newly of phytoplankton origin with a strong signal 0 17 0 02 was generated from 100 120 m peak t was the highest from 100 120 m 0 093 0 005 followed by 15 45 m 0 055 0 005 and it was the lowest from 60 80 m 0 034 0 002 3 4 the stable and radioactive isotopes of dic doc and poc the δ13cdic and δ13cdoc was 9 5 to 2 6 and 28 6 to 26 8 respectively and showed similar trends with most enriched values occurring in the transition area and most depleted values occurring in the river area the δ13cpoc ranged from 29 5 to 24 7 which also exhibited the most enriched value 22 1 in the transition area and the most depleted value in the reservoir area the δ14cdoc became increasingly depleted from the river area 67 9 to the reservoir area 140 22 while δ14cpoc became increasingly enriched from the river area 495 43 to the reservoir area 186 17 in the reservoir profile δ13cdic was enriched at 0 10 m 3 1 0 1 and then remained at a relatively depleted and invariable value below 15 m 9 40 2 fig 3 e δ13cdoc was 28 5 to 27 1 and first showed an increasing trend from 0 m to 15 m followed by a decreased from 15 m to 80 m 30 1 and gradually increased to 27 7 at 120 m δ13cpoc was 32 9 to 29 5 and exhibited almost the opposite trends to those of doc the δ14cdoc andδ14cpoc also showed opposite trends in the profile fig 3 f δ14cdoc increased from 0 m 131 to 120 m 78 of which the most positive value occurred at 80 m 71 while δ14cpoc decreased from 0 m 204 to 120 m 303 with the most negative value also observed at 80 m 330 4 discussion 4 1 sources and transformation of organic carbon along the flow path a typical reservoir effect on poc is the removal of terrestrial om from the water column and the increase in phytoplankton derived om due to the decrease in flow velocity settling of suspended particles and reduction in water turbidity thus increasing primary production matzinger et al 2007 a continuous decrease in tsm was observed along the transition reservoir transect fig 2 b reflecting the effect of reservoirs in trapping terrestrial suspended particles and om phytoplankton mainly consumes water soluble co2 for photosynthesis liu et al 2018 which causes a reduction in the dic concentration and an enrichment in δ13cdic wang et al 2019 the dic concentration in the river area was approximately 30 mg l 1 which is a typical value observed in karst regions but is more than 5 times higher than that observed in non karst areas shih 2018 in the hjd reservoir the dic concentration decrease and δ13cdic enrichment along the river reservoir transect suggested an enhanced primary production due to dam construction the poc was nearly 30 which is a typical value for phytoplankton airoldi and cinelli 1997 agreed with the increased contribution of in situ production the values and ranges of δ13cpoc 30 0 to 24 7 as well as of the c n weight ratio 6 0 10 1 further revealed a gradual transition from the soil om observed in the river area to the typical phytoplankton source in the transition reservoir area fig 4 lamb et al 2006 the soil om source in the river area is likely an aged deep soil layer as reflected by the depleted δ14cpoc 550 value marwick et al 2015 the changes in δ13cpoc suggested that the newly produced poc had a more enriched δ13c in the transition region than that in the reservoir earlier study in the greifen lake found that δ13cpoc of phytoplankton derived oc was much enriched during higher productivity season and was attributed to the different carbon sources utilized co2 aq vs bicarbonate hollander and mckenzie 1991 the enriched δ13cpoc in the transition region than that in the reservoir was also in accord with the higher productivity see discussion in section 4 3 interestingly the δ14cpoc value of the surface water in the transition reservoir region was more depleted than the fresh phytoplankton signal observed in the other regions chen et al 2018 which could be caused by the depleted δ14cdic in karst areas liu et al 2017 therefore the changes in the poc properties all reflect a typical reservoir effect on the poc sources in this head reservoir doc in the river region indicated a much younger δ14c signal 67 9 than did poc fig 3 f which suggests that the contribution of the main source was derived from the surface soil fig 5 younger doc than the poc were also observed in other rivers which were attributed to the pre aging process of poc in soil and the leaching of freshly produced om raymond and bauer 2001b the suva254 15 l mg 1 m 1 values in the river area were much higher than those observed for the phytoplankton derived dom and even higher than the riverine dom ranges observed during flooding mainly soil derived om fellman et al 2013 suggesting the dominance of soil derived om consistent with the information retrieved from δ14cdoc the increase in the doc concentration fig 2 b in the transition reservoir areas suggested a net addition of doc in the water column which is unlikely caused by the input from tributaries since doc concentrations were similar between those tributaries table s2 and mainstream the slight enrichment in δ13cdoc agreed with the enrichment in δ13cpoc fig 2 e suggesting that the doc increase had a similar source to that of poc i e in situ production the decrease in δ14cdoc in the transition reservoir areas was also consistent with the addition of 14c depleted phytoplankton derived oc fig 2 f aquatic primary production usually yields much lower a254 and suva254 values than do higher plants liu et al 2019 which may have led to the low suva254 value in the transition and reservoir areas by mixing with riverine dom he et al 2020 also found a decrease in suva254 with increasing autochthonous dom in the three gorges reservoir nevertheless the decrease in a254 and fluorescence intensity of each component in the transition reservoir areas implied that in addition to the input from in situ production notable net removal of cdom occurred fig 2 c and d photodegradation microbial degradation and sorption by particles may all remove cdom from the water column hansen et al 2016 due to the preferential utilization of non aromatic om microbial degradation of dom normally induces an increase in suva254 hansen et al 2016 photodegradation is the likely mechanism as it preferentially removes aromatic dom which is mainly of terrestrial origin and causes a strong decrease in a254 and suva254 as previously observed he et al 2020 stubbins et al 2010 the role of dom sorption by sinking particles in the transition region remains unclear and merits further study the doc characteristics concentration carbon isotopes suva254 a254 and fluorescence intensity of each component of the outlet samples were similar to those of the river samples suggesting little transformation of the released water which is related to the layer of the outlet please refer to the discussion below 4 2 sources and transformation of organic carbon in the reservoir profile as water flows into the reservoir due to changes in the physical conditions at the different depths the biogeochemical processes may exhibit large differences down the profile especially during the summer season when notable thermal stratification occurs fig 3 a based on the physiochemical parameters the reservoir profile was divided into four layers surface layer 0 15 m subsurface layer 15 45 m intermediate layer 45 80 m and bottom layer 80 120 m in the surface layer the notably high do and poc values low dic concentration high doc level and δ13cdic enrichment all indicated substantial photosynthesis thus producing and accumulating oc in addition the lowest a254 and suva254 values and fluorescence intensity indicated the notable removal of cdom by photochemical degradation hansen et al 2016 as observed in the whole surface layer in the transition reservoir area sorption was unlikely an important process within the reservoir since most mineral particles had already settled in the transition region as indicated by the changes in tsm fig 2 b therefore this layer can be denoted as the production photodegradation dominant layer ppdl in the subsurface layer a sharp decline in do at 15 m indicated a decrease in production and an increase in oxygen consumption dic and doc at 15 m were still 2 mg l 1 lower and 0 3 mg l 1 higher respectively than those observed at the riverine site suggesting that primary production still occurred at 15 m but much lower than that in the surface layer an earlier study suggested that light still reached this layer hemsley et al 2015 hence a weaker bcp process could still occur the lowest do and ph values at 15 m suggested notable oc mineralization the sharp increases in a254 suva254 fluorescence intensity and δ13cdoc at 15 m were all consistent with microbial degradation transformation romera castillo et al 2011 the most depleted δ13cpoc at 15 m was also in consist with weak primary production that utilized the depleted δ13cdic in this layer however the poc concentration was largely decreased suggesting that even there was primary production it was very weak then the fraction of terrestrial poc could not be ignored in this layer the enrichment in δ13cpoc and depletion in δ14cpoc was also in accord with the increased fraction of terrestrial poc that were still suspended increases in the fraction of terrestrial oc could also explain the variation trend of δ13cdoc and δ14cdoc overall this layer is denoted as the biodegradation dominant layer bdl in the intermediate layer 45 80 m since no light reached this layer primary production and photodegradation were all negligible all dic and dom parameters all resembled those at the riverine sites fig 2 and fig 3 suggesting little transformation of carbon in this layer the doc characteristics of the released water were also similar to those of this layer since the water was released at a certain depth within this layer therefore the effect of the dam on water release also depended on the outlet of the reservoir the notably low poc concentration in this layer largely occurred due to the gradual removal of suspended particles during transport from the river to the reservoir the δ14cdoc and δ14cpoc continue to enrich and deplete respectively and was consisting with the increased fraction of terrestrial om hence this layer can be denoted as the river mixing dominant layer rmdl in the bottom layer 80 120 m very interestingly an obvious increase in δ13cdoc and δ13cpoc along with a new fdom component were occurred at 80 m an earlier study indicated that due to the preferential utilization of the 13c light component an enrichment in δ13cdoc could be observed during microbial degradation meckenstock et al 2004 the changes in the doc isotopes and fdom components were consistent with the microbial transformation of dom observed in various aquatic environments jiao et al 2010 an earlier study in lake overlying water also reported a similar phenomenon yang et al 2014 the slight increase in doc and a254 in the bottom layer may be derived from diffusion from sediments therefore this layer can be denoted as the anaerobic modification dominant layer amdl 4 3 quantifying the transformation of carbon among the different carbon pools and implications to quantitatively understand the transformation of carbon among the different carbon pools dic poc and doc different parameters were applied as mentioned above section 4 2 poc in the surface layer of the transition reservoir area is predominantly of an autochthonous source while the addition of doc is also derived from in situ production therefore the amount of oc contributed by in situ production ocp can be estimated as the sum of poc concentration of the samples from the transition and reservoir areas pocs and in situ production of doc in the transition and reservoir areas docp and a two end member mixing model based on δ14c was applied to quantify the docp raymond and bauer 2001a see the supplementary text for a detailed analysis and calculation method table s3 the results table s4 indicate that in the transition and reservoir areas phytoplankton contributed 50 to the total doc while this value decreased to 5 in the rmdl and amdl suggesting that either the newly produced dom was not largely transferred to the deeper layers or that the om was largely degraded in addition although the cdom experienced substantial photodegradation a254 and fluorescence intensity decreased by approximately 19 and 72 respectively only approximately 10 of the terrestrial dom was removed except at station h8 the unexpected high removal of terrestrial dom at h8 was related to the relatively depleted δ14cdoc value we speculate that if this value is true i e no point contamination it may then be related to the considerable sinking of suspended particles which absorbed the terrestrial dom the dic concentration was mainly affected by photosynthesis precipitation of carbonates and outgassing which are modulated by various physiochemical conditions jan et al 2010 here we define the difference between the sample dics and riverine dic values dicr as δdic during the photosynthetic uptake of dic by aquatic phototrophs half of the dic is bonded with ca2 to form calcium carbonate liu et al 2018 which is defined as δdicc and the other half is incorporated into the om pool which is defined as δdicp liu et al 2018 in theory δdicc δdicp in addition the molar ratio of δdicc equals the molar of reduced ca2 in bcp process by considering the loss of dic and ca2 in different processes bcp and carbonate precipitation due to changes in temperature the transfer of dic into the oc pool can be calculated see supplementary file for detailed determination method and results the results indicated that ocp was much lower than δdicp fig 6 which suggests two important facts 1 a large amount of dic was transferred to the oc pool in this karst area in summer δdicp was 3 1 to 6 3 mg l 1 15 5 31 5 mg c m 2 10 21 assuming similar carbon transfer occurred in the upper 5 m of the transition reservoir area even higher than the riverine dic concentration in non karst areas shih 2018 2 only 20 24 remained in the oc pool in the water column with 70 of the produced oc had an unknown fate in current study table s4 in most terrestrial ecosystems aquatic primary production is limited by phosphorus wang 2020 in the hjd phosphate exhibited a sharp decrease from the river to the transition area and approached 0 mg l 1 in the reservoir area table s2 suggesting that in situ production was also limited by p in our study area the amount of autochthonous oc remaining in the water column was close to the p bonded oc following the redfield ratio which ranged from approximately 1 1 3 mg l 1 supplementary table s5 the much higher δdicp value may occur because p containing om was preferentially mineralized and re entered the water column to support photosynthesis lomas et al 2010 therefore the reservoir acted as a factory that continuously converted dic into oc either preserved in sediments or emitted as co2 the oc burial efficiency is therefore key to the global carbon budget earlier studies showed a highly variable oc burial efficiency 10 to 90 in other reservoirs mendonça et al 2016 the low pco2 value in the transition and reservoir areas table s2 suggested that the oc produced through primary production may not be largely degraded however the net burial of oc in the hjd reservoir requires further research interestingly δdic exhibited a higher value in the transition area than that in the reservoir area fig 2 b table s5 similar results were observed for δdicc which together implied that a higher primary production occurred in the transition area than that in the reservoir area liu et al 2018 which could also be supported by the chl a data fig 2 a the higher values of δ13cdic do doc and poc in the transition area also revealed higher primary production and were consistent with the observations in greifen lake that δ13cdic and δ13cpoc was more enriched during higher productivity season hollander and mckenzie 1991 fig 2 a b and e we speculate that in the transition region the high primary productivity might be related to the release of nutrients from terrestrial tsm wang et al 2011 in contrast the reservoir area mainly provided nutrients for the primary production process through om degradation these results emphasize the importance of the transition area in reservoir research previously studies mainly focused on reservoir areas mendonça et al 2016 mendonca et al 2017 wang 2020 wang et al 2019 however our results reveal that transition areas are in fact hotspots for the primary production process and potential burial furthermore the results of our study also indicate that the reservoirs in karst areas exhibit a very high potential to affect the climate over non karst areas under the condition of intensified human activities since in situ production is a nutrient limited process once nutrients enter the river system the process is largely enhanced compared to non karst areas more sufficient dic sources occur in karst areas to support this process which promotes the burial of oc or degradation into co2 by a fast production degradation process fig 7 the net effect degradation vs preservation may generate a high spatiotemporal variation regulated by physical conditions not only will a large amount of terrestrial om be buried in reservoirs in the next ten to one hundred years but a considerable dic amount will also be converted into om and be buried or degraded and emitted to the atmosphere 5 conclusion karst areas are carbon rich region the effect of reservoir on carbon transport may have global significance however were not well constrained especially the oc related biogeochemical processes by applying multi tracers we found that during the transition from the river to the reservoir terrestrial poc was replaced by an autochthonous source along with the gradual removal of terrestrial doc and net addition of autochthonous doc fig 7 higher primary production was observed in the upper 5 m in the transition area 27 2 5 mg c m 2 18 2 than in the reservoir 19 3 mg c m 2 13 2 suggesting the transition area is in fact a hotspot for carbon transfer and should be given more attention in future studies however the results from current study couldn t represent the biogeochemical processes occurred throughout the year since there is only one systematic analysis in summer season the depth distribution of the doc and poc concentrations and compositions during the stratification period revealed a structured carbon cycling pattern fig 7 higher production degradation of oc occurred in the surface layer while a lower in situ production but notable remineralization was observed in the subsurface layer little oc transformation occurred in the intermediate layer and notable microbial transformation and or sediment diffusion in the bottom layer fig 7 we further estimated that the amount of dic 3 1 6 3 mg l 1 15 5 31 5 mg c m 2 10 21 that was incorporated into oc pool caused by the reservoir was equal to higher than the riverine dic concentration in non karst area suggesting that the influence of reservoir on riverine carbon transport and transformation is more significant due to nutrient limitations and large amounts of available c the reservoirs in karst regions are highly sensitive to anthropogenic activities and would have a higher potential to affect the climate over non karst areas authors contributions yuanbi yi performed all of the chemical analyses under the guidance of siliang li and hongyan bao all of the authors designed the study discussed

17139,some metals in oil sands process water ospw are potential threats to human health and the environment hence the removal of excess metals from ospw is of great significance in this study anaerobic sludge waste from a wastewater treatment plant was reused to prepare sludge based biochar a biochar chitosan biochar cs adsorbent with excellent removal efficiency for metals cr cu se and pb in real ospw was prepared through a facile hydrothermal method the structural properties of the synthesized biochar cs composite were characterized via x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem and brunauer emmett teller bet method this study reports for the first time the removal of metals from ospw under natural ph using biochar cs adsorbent the composite exhibited a higher removal efficiency towards cr 83 9 cu 97 5 se 87 9 and pb 94 3 when the initial concentrations of cr cu se and pb were 0 02914 0 06185 0 00800 and 0 00516 mg l respectively at a dosage of 0 5 g l compared with biochar or chitosan alone the possible adsorption mechanism was proposed and the enhanced removal ability was due to the improved specific surface area and pore volume which increased by about 20 and 14 times as compared with chitosan functional groups in the composite such as nh2 oh and some oxygen containing groups were also responsible for the enhanced removal ability which also might be the reason for the better performance of the composite than biochar alone due to the lack of functional groups on the biochar moreover the adsorption process was best modelled by the freundlich model pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models the results indicated that chemical adsorption might play the dominant role in the removal process overall the biochar cs composite would be a promising and effective adsorbent for metals removal owing to its advantages of being cost effective and environmentally friendly graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar chitosan composite oil sands process water metal ion adsorption 1 introduction the oil sands in northern alberta canada have the third largest petroleum reserves in the world after venezuela and saudi arabia alberta oil sands industry has invested approximately 201 billion in crude oil recovery arshad et al 2016 any water that has been in contact with oil sands or dewatered from tailings deposits and retained in tailings ponds is termed as oil sands process water ospw the process water may contain suspended solids inorganic and organic compounds and metals huang et al 2017 qin et al 2019 zubot et al 2012 therefore the discharge of untreated ospw into the environment can cause great harm swigert et al 2015 among all the contaminants in ospw some metals are non biodegradable and present at high concentrations which pose a threat to aquatic life and human health if they are released without any treatment aguado et al 2009 based on the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme water quality guidelines and the data from the ospw used in this work table s1 the metals in ospw such as chromium copper selenium and lead exceed the maximum acceptable concentration cr 8 9 ppb cu 2 2 86 ppb se 1 ppb pb 1 ppb hence the elimination of these metals from ospw is of great significance several treatment methods such as ion exchange membrane separation precipitation electrochemical treatment and adsorption have been employed for removing metals from wastewater bhatnagar and sillanpää 2010 peng et al 2009 among the technologies mentioned adsorption has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective and versatile methods due to its significant advantages such as easy operation high efficiency and low cost gupta et al 2009 li et al 2019 wang et al 2010 2020 recently some adsorbents have been developed to remove metals in ospw lou et al 2016 found that pine sawdust biochar pyrolyzed at 550 c exhibited superior removal property for cu from the ospw whose maximum adsorption capacity i e 2 5 mg g was 30 folds higher than that produced at 300 c lou et al 2016 zubot et al 2012 also reported a petroleum coke pc adsorbent with better removal property for calcium and magnesium from ospw when the dosage of adsorbent was 38 40 weight percent however the reported adsorbents were tested at the bench scale level far from the practical treatment of metals in ospw considering the adsorption efficiency and production cost besides another key problem is the poor functional groups on these reported adsorbents thus it is meaningful to develop a cost effective adsorbent with rich functional groups to effectively remove metals in ospw recently chitosan cs has been widely applied for the removal of metals because it is inexpensive abundant nontoxic and biodegradable vakili et al 2019 furthermore the functional groups on its surface i e amino and hydroxyl groups can interact with metal ions resulting in stable chemical adsorption fan et al 2009 tharanathan and kittur 2003 however chitosan usually has an insufficient adsorption capacity for metal ions mainly because of its low specific surface area which results in a limited number of active sites zhang et al 2019 furthermore its weak mechanical strength and other drawbacks also limit the widespread use of chitosan in wastewater treatment zhang et al 2019 fortunately these drawbacks of chitosan can be remedied by introducing a carrier based on previous reports zhang et al 2015 it has been widely accepted that biochar is a good adsorbent carrier owing to the following characteristics porous insoluble stable and low cost tan et al 2016 biochar a carbon rich solid is easy to produce at temperatures between 300 and 700 c by the pyrolysis of various solid wastes from a wide range of low cost sources such as straw rice husks sawdust sludge and kitchen waste lehmann 2007 wei et al 2010 in this work the sludge from a sewage treatment plant was utilized to prepare biochar which can not only convert waste into a useful adsorbent material but also help to reduce the disposal cost of waste sludge carrère et al 2010 moreover biochar has also been widely studied as an adsorbent to remove various contaminants from water chen et al 2013 the physical and chemical properties allow biochar to act as a great support material for an adsorbent that can be used to remove metals from wastewater chen et al 2014 jiang et al 2012 it was thought that the biochar cs composite would be a promising adsorbent in the practical application of removing metals from ospw more importantly according to the previous reports there are few studies on the adsorption of metals from real ospw in this work biochar cs composite was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method the biochar cs composite was used as an adsorbent for the removal of metals from ospw for the first time furthermore detailed experimental results regarding the adsorption process were also summarized in this manuscript the objectives of this study were to 1 synthesize and characterize an effective biochar cs adsorbent that can be used for metals removal from ospw 2 investigate the effect of the composite dose on the removal of metals cr cu se pb in ospw 3 determine the equilibrium time needed for metals cr cu se pb adsorption onto biochar cs and compare the removal efficiency of biochar cs composite with other materials 4 investigate the isotherm and kinetics in the adsorption process and 5 determine the diffusion types related to the adsorption process via the diffusion model and propose the possible adsorption mechanism s 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all of the reagents used in this work were procured from fisher scientific co canada the main information is summarized in the supporting information si 2 2 preparation of the sludge based biochar and biochar chitosan the sludge based biochar was prepared by pyrolysis under n2 environment and hydrothermal method was adopted to synthesize biochar chitosan composite the typical preparation process and the characterization details of samples by various techniques are provided in the si 2 3 batch adsorption experiments the effect of adsorbent dose on metals removal from ospw was investigated by adding a different dose of adsorbent 0 1 to 3 0 g l the optimal adsorbent dose could be obtained from experiments above the equilibrium time and kinetics experiments were conducted under a predetermined time interval using the adsorbents dose the detailed experimental methods and data analyses are summarized in the si including the adsorption isotherms and kinetic models 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbents 3 1 1 xrd analysis and surface area bet analysis the xrd patterns of biochar cs chitosan and biochar are shown in fig 1 a on the xrd pattern of chitosan the broad diffraction peak at around 2θ 11 0 to 2θ 20 0 is the typical crystal form of chitosan i and ii sajomsang et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 a smaller but still broad peak of chitosan at around 2θ 20 0 can also be seen on the xrd pattern of biochar cs the disappearance of the chitosan peak at around 2θ 11 0 and the decrease of peak intensity at around 2θ 20 0 indicate that an interaction occurred between chitosan and biochar in the composite biochar cs zhang et al 2019 besides the quartz peaks from biochar also emerge in the xrd pattern of biochar cs demonstrating the presence of biochar in the composite hence from this result it is clear that the biochar cs composite was successfully synthesized nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms and the bjh pore size distributions of samples are displayed in fig 1 b and c based on the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac type iv isotherm with h1 hysteresis loop can be seen from the adsorption and desorption isotherm of biochar cs and biochar in fig 1 b these characteristics are the main features of mesoporous materials which are beneficial to the adsorption of pollutants li et al 2016 lin et al 2015 ren et al 2007 for cs the adsorption desorption isotherm is type iii with h3 hysteresis loop kazemi and javanbakht 2020 which is the feature of a sheet structure material that is non porous or macroporous moreover the bjh pore size distribution of materials can be seen from fig 1 c biochar cs adsorbent presents a wider pore size distribution 20 to 50 nm further confirming the mesoporous characteristic wu et al 2004 it can be seen from table s2 that the surface area of biochar cs composite 34 7 m2 g was increased by 20 times as compared with cs 1 7 m2 g and the pore volume increased 14 times as compared to cs this is mainly because many small biochar particles are deposited on the surface of chitosan to form the composite which can significantly improve the surface area and pore volume of pure chitosan 3 1 2 sem and edx analyses it can be seen from fig 2 a and b that the surface of biochar is porous and rough while a smooth long and sheet structure is shown on the sem image of chitosan fig 2c and d compared with the morphology of chitosan the surface of the biochar cs composite is rougher and more heterogeneous a large number of small biochar particles are deposited on the surface of the composite fig 2e h which help to increase the surface area as well as fully exposing functional groups of the composite zhang et al 2015 it is clear from fig 2 i that biochar particles become smaller after acid alkaline hydrothermal treatment without chitosan present which further confirms that biochar is deposited on the surface of the composite material from the sem results one can see that after treatment by the method used in this work chitosan and biochar have been well combined the morphology of the composite material is significantly different to that of biochar or chitosan alone compared with the biochar chitosan composite reported in the previous literature the intact structure of chitosan was observed in our synthesized composite implying that the functional groups on chitosan surface were not destroyed during the synthesis process liu et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 elemental mapping and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx pattern of biochar cs composite are shown in fig 2 j it could be observed from element mapping that c n o and si are uniformly distributed in the biochar cs based on the signal intensities of elements which further confirmed the deposit of small biochar particles on the surface of composite the edx spectrum of biochar cs composite shows that the contents of c o and n are around 53 31 34 09 and 9 33 wt respectively the edx analysis also reveals the successful synthesis of biochar cs composite 3 2 effect of adsorbent dose fig 3 shows that higher doses of biochar cs adsorbent lead to higher metals removal the same trend can be seen from the report of zubot et al 2012 they found that higher dose of petroleum coke pc resulted in significant decrease in calcium and magnesium concentrations from ospw the removal tends to be relatively stable once the dosage is 0 5 g l or higher when the dosage is 0 5 g l the removals of cr cu se and pb are 83 9 97 5 87 9 and 94 3 respectively and the concentrations of cr cu se and pb were about 0 00467 0 00153 0 00097 and 0 00029 mg l respectively based on ospw quality and water quality guidelines from ccme cr 8 9 ppb cu 2 2 86 ppb se 1 ppb pb 1 ppb all the four metal concentrations comply with the standard after 24 h adsorption with a composite dosage of 0 5 g l considering the cost and effectiveness all further adsorption experiments used an adsorbent dose of 0 5 g l the same dose of adsorbent 0 5 g l was used by xiao et al 2019 who used chitosan combined magnetic biochar as adsorbent to remove cr and cu from wastewater the dosage of adsorbent 0 5 g l used in this study was much lower than that used in the study of zhang et al 2019 in which 3 3 g l of a poly acrylic acid chitosan biochar composite adsorbent was employed for the adsorption of metals from wastewater as well a 1 0 g l of carboxymethyl chitosan biochar was used for hg adsorption in the study of ifthikar et al 2018 compared with similar materials reported in the application of wastewater our synthesized biochar cs adsorbent has a higher removal efficiency for various metals for example hussain et al 2017 synthesized an adsorbent with plant waste based biochar modified chitosan and the maximum removal efficiencies of cu pb as and cd from industrial wastewater were only 43 3 54 3 22 3 and 8 5 respectively lv et al 2019 reported a hydrogel adsorbent to remove various trace metals and the removal ratios were around 46 8 cu 57 1 cd 26 9 cr 52 7 mn and 52 5 ni respectively zhou et al 2013 used chitosan modified biochar as an adsorbent for metal environmental remediation and the removal of cu pb and cd were only 58 45 and 50 respectively it is believable that our adsorbent would be a promising alternative for real wastewater treatment due to the superior removal efficiency for multiple metals meanwhile our adsorbent is cost effective and environment friendly resulting from the introduction of sludge a waste material based biochar 3 3 isotherm studies fig s1 in supporting information shows that the equilibrium adsorption capacity oe for biochar cs increases along with the equilibrium concentration ce increase of cr cu se and pb which is in line with the previous study results that showed that a higher adsorbent dose results in a lower adsorption capacity islam et al 2018 khan et al 2011 pourrezaei et al 2014 2011 when the dose of adsorbent is small high metal equilibrium concentration there is lower pollutant removal efficiency but the fewer number of adsorption sites will become saturated with adsorbates resulting in higher adsorption capacity xing et al 2008 when more adsorbent is added some adsorption sites are not saturated so the adsorption capacity is smaller while the removal efficiency is higher khan et al 2011 the langmuir and freundlich isotherms for metals adsorbed on biochar cs composite are displayed in fig s2 and fig s3 descriptions about the two models are summarized in the si parameters of langmuir and freundlich obtained from biochar cs adsorption experiments in ospw are listed in table s3 the coefficient of determination r2 values in freundlich model r2 0 980 0 994 are higher than those of the langmuir model r2 0 941 0 976 indicating the adsorption of metals on biochar cs is better modelled using the freundlich isotherm these results indicate that the metals adsorption on biochar cs is multilayered it can be seen from table s3 that the value of freundlich constant n is more than 1 for four metals for values in the range 1 n 10 the adsorption is favorable thanh tu et al 2018 3 4 adsorption kinetics as shown in fig 4 the metals are rapidly removed by the composite at the initial stage the removal begins to plateau around 60 min 81 5 90 min 97 2 45 min 87 5 and 30 min 90 2 for cr cu se and pb respectively in contrast with the previous reports about similar adsorbent our adsorbent presents a fast removal of these metals for example zhang et al 2019 synthesized a poly acrylic acid chitosan biochar composite adsorbent for metals treatment and the equilibrium time for cu cr and pb was about 3 h although their removal efficiency could reach 90 above ifthikar et al 2018 reported a carboxymethyl chitosan sewage sludge biochar adsorbent with good removal efficiency for pb and hg while it took 60 min to reach more than 90 removal of pb as for pb adsorption on our adsorbent it only needs 30 min the initial stage of rapid removal may be attributed to the large number of reaction sites on the surface of the biochar cs composite song et al 2019 the reason the adsorption process gradually slows down in the later period is that the adsorbates metals may be further adsorbed on the internal active sites in the mesopores of the composite material longer time is needed for this adsorption within the mesopores of the composite material to occur as compared with adsorption on the external surface active sites of the material song et al 2019 in addition the biochar cs adsorbent shows the highest equilibrium removal of metals in comparison to biochar cs and biochar cs sample this result demonstrates the crucial role of uniformly deposited small biochar particles on the composite material in increased metal removal from fig 4 it also can be seen that the equilibrium cr removal by biochar cs is approximately 2 4 1 2 and 1 7 times that of biochar chitosan and biochar cs sample respectively for cu the equilibrium removal by biochar cs is approximately 2 3 1 4 and 1 6 times that of biochar cs and biochar cs respectively for se it is 2 1 1 3 and 1 7 times respectively as for pb the corresponding data is 1 6 1 2 and 1 5 times respectively the main reason is the synergistic effect of biochar and cs in the biochar cs composite the synergistic effect is mainly derived from the following aspects 1 after the introduction of biochar into the composite using the mild hydrothermal method larger specific surface area and pore volume could be obtained which could more effectively capture the metals in the ospw and adsorb the metal ions on the surface of the composite zhang et al 2015 and 2 the existence of chitosan in the composite can make the captured metals more stable when adsorbed on the surface of the composite through its rich functional groups such as nh2 oh fan et al 2009 because of the synergistic effect the biochar cs composite synthesized by hydrothermal method can have better physical and chemical properties compared with biochar cs and physical mixture biochar cs therefore the composite can show better adsorption properties this is also explained in the surface area and sem results section 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models of metals adsorbed on biochar cs composite are presented in fig s4 and fig s5 descriptions about the two models are summarized in si the kinetic parameters of those two models are displayed in table s4 as seen from table s4 the coefficient of determination r2 values for the pseudo second order model are much higher than those of pseudo first order model which indicates that the process of adsorbing four kinds of metals on biochar cs fits well with the pseudo second order model song et al 2019 sun et al 2017 therefore this indicates that there may be chemical reactions in the adsorption process alvarez ayuso et al 2003 bayramoglu et al 2009 for biochar cs experimental qe values obtained for cr cu se and pb are 0 049 0 121 0 014 and 0 010 mg g respectively for the composite material qe values calculated from the pseudo second order model for cr cu se and pb are 0 050 0 123 0 014 and 0 010 mg g respectively one can see that the two qe values are remarkably close this is further confirmation of the applicability of the pseudo second order model on the adsorption process regarding the adsorption capacity of adsorbents when used for treating industrial wastewater sandoval et al 2018 found that the adsorption capacity of an amorphous silica for pb cr and cu in industrial wastewater was 0 07 0 08 and 0 07 mg g respectively which is similar to the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of biochar cs in our study due to the different properties of the industrial wastewater and adsorbents the adsorption capacity of adsorbent may vary between different adsorption studies through an extensive literature review we found that the kinetics and isotherms of metals in solution by adsorption materials can be influenced by the initial metal concentration and the properties of metals such as ionic radius hydrated radius softness and electronegativity as well as the properties of adsorption materials for example it has been reported that the initial solute concentration c0 can affect the k2 constant value of the pseudo second order kinetics febrianto et al 2019 plazinski et al 2009 it has been found that k2 decreases with increasing c0 values because k2 is a time scaling factor as such it would take more time for the system to reach equilibrium at higher c0 values plazinski et al 2013 zanin et al 2017 found that the adsorption of metals in a solution containing 10 mg l of each metal by clinoptilolite zeolite followed pseudo first order kinetic model for cr and cu and pseudo second order for fe the langmuir model provided the best fit of adsorption isotherms for cr and cu while freundlich model was the best for fe different outcomes were reported when a different adsorbent was used to adsorb the same metal ions i e cr and cu zhang et al 2019 reported that cr and cu were adsorbed by a poly acrylic acid grafted chitosan biochar composite and the pseudo second order model provided a better description of the adsorption process rather than the pseudo first order kinetic model therefore different kinetics and isotherms may be obtained in different studies due to variations in the initial metals concentration properties of metals and properties of adsorption materials 3 5 adsorption mechanism 3 5 1 intraparticle diffusion model the intraparticle diffusion model weber and morris is used to investigate the diffusion mechanism during the adsorption process of metals on biochar cs the detailed descriptions about this model are summarized in si as shown in fig s6 and table s5 qt vs t0 5 plots for the four metals do not pass through the origin thus the role of bulk and film diffusion must be taken into consideration fig 5 shows that the plots of cr and se are multilinear including three linear regions which indicates that three adsorption processes determine the adsorption of the two metals on biochar cs while for cu and pb there are two steps involve in their adsorption on composite the rate constants for each region from fig 5 are summarized in table s6 the three regions refer to three different types of diffusion bulk film and pore for cr and se the first area shown from the left is bulk diffusion and the highest rate constant can be seen from this area which is 0 0671 cr and 0 0226 se mg g h0 5 respectively in the second phase the increasing trend of the plot has slowed down compared to the first phase from left indicating that the diffusion rate is further limited in this step metals transferring through the film around the materials named film diffusion takes more time with respect to the far right side area pore diffusion scarce increase can be seen from the plot of se and cr which can be attributed to the adsorption equilibrium or extremely low metal concentration left in ospw wang et al 2019 fig 5 also shows that regions for cu and pb can be divided into film and pore diffusion from fig 5 one can see that it takes 15 min for cr and se to transfer through the bulk liquid as well as 45 min 90 min 30 min and 30 min for cr cu se and pb for film diffusion among all the diffusion regions pore diffusion requires the longest time and has the lowest rate constant once cr and se pass the bulk liquid it starts to slow down when it begins to travel across the film around the materials when starting to enter the pores inside the materials the travel speed of cr and se becomes the slowest in all stages the process of cu and pb traveling across the film surrounding adsorbent and the pores in adsorbent is similar to that of another two kinds of metal ions in conclusion pore diffusion is the dominate rate limiting step for the adsorption of cr cu se and pb on biochar cs while bulk diffusion for cr and se and film diffusion also have effect on the reaction rate islam et al 2018 3 5 2 xps analysis the xps survey spectra of biochar cs composite before and after adsorption of metals in ospw are displayed in fig 6 a and b c 1 s n 1 s and o 1 s peaks are seen in biochar cs composite before adsorption these peaks as well as the na kll and na 1 s peak are found on the biochar cs material post adsorption the distinct peaks of cr cu se and pd could not be detected in xps survey spectra which might be due to their extremely low content huang et al 2015 while the presence of na kll and na 1 s peak is most likely due to the salinity in ospw fig 6 c and d show the c 1 s spectra of biochar cs composite before and after adsorption of metals from ospw the c 1 s spectrum of composite could be deconvoluted into four peaks at 284 67 286 25 287 50 and 288 70 ev which are corresponding to c c c o c n and c o respectively shan et al 2009 xu et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 after adsorption in ospw the area ratio of c o shows increase while co exhibits a considerable decrease 21 74 indicating that the oxygen containing functional groups above might play a crucial role in adsorption of metals from ospw liu et al 2017 in addition metals in ospw may be adsorbed onto the above oxygen containing functional groups through π π interactions h bond and hydrophobic interaction afzal et al 2018 inyang and dickenson 2015 fig 6 e and f reveal that the n 1 s xps spectra of biochar cs composite before and after adsorption in ospw the n 1 s spectrum of composite is divided into three peaks located at 398 60 ev 399 48 ev and 400 38 ev which corresponds to nh n c o and nh2 respectively afzal et al 2018 the ratio of nh2 decreases obviously from 34 42 to 8 18 after adsorption in addition the peak intensity of nh as well as n c o have little changes which indicates that nh2 is preferential adsorption site for metal removal afzal et al 2018 it can be seen from the o 1 s spectra fig 6 g and h that there are three peaks at 531 67 532 80 and 533 72 ev before adsorption which is in accord with c o oh and co however the significant change 12 47 in the intensity of peak of oh after adsorption might be due to the interaction between oh group from biochar cs and metals in ospw liu et al 2017 based on the analysis results above such as freundlich model pseudo second order kinetic model intraparticle diffusion model and xps analysis it is clear that biochar cs composite can adsorb metals cr cu se and pb found in ospw through chemical and physical adsorption furthermore the chemical adsorption might play the dominant role in the adsorption process due to the abundant functional groups on biochar cs composite 4 conclusions in this work a biochar cs composite was successfully synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method using sludge waste material based biochar with chitosan the prepared material was utilized to remove metals from real ospw under natural ph for the first time the specific surface area and pore volume of biochar cs composite were improved by about 20 times and 14 times as compared with chitosan respectively the biochar cs composite resulted in higher removal efficiency for cr 83 9 cu 97 5 se 87 9 and pb 94 3 compared to biochar and chitosan alone after treatment with the composite the metals concentration cr cu se and pb in real ospw complied with the ccme standard the enhanced removal efficiency of the biochar cs composite material was mainly attributed to its higher specific surface area and pore volume as well as exposed functional groups in the composite after combining biochar and chitosan the adsorption process was best modelled using the freundlich isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetic model regarding the intraparticle diffusion model of cr and se using composite there were three obvious diffusion regions bulk film and pore diffusion for cu and pb the obvious diffusion regions were film and pore diffusion in addition metals cr cu se pb in ospw were removed by biochar cs through chemical and physical adsorption and the chemical adsorption might play the dominant role in the removal process due to the abundant functional groups in composite such as nh2 oh and some oxygen containing functional groups hence the biochar cs composite would be a promising efficient and cost effective adsorbent for metals removal from ospw in practical applications

might be the reason for the better performance of the composite than biochar alone due to the lack of functional groups on the biochar moreover the adsorption process was best modelled by the

qin et al 2019 zubot et al 2012 therefore the discharge of untreated ospw into the environment can cause great harm swigert et al 2015 among all the contaminants in ospw some metals are non biodegradable and present at high concentrations which pose a threat to aquatic life and human health if they are released without any treatment aguado et al 2009 based on the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme water quality guidelines and the data from the ospw used in this work table s1 the metals in ospw such as chromium copper selenium and lead exceed the maximum acceptable concentration cr 8 9 ppb cu 2 2 86 ppb se 1 ppb pb 1 ppb hence the elimination of these metals from ospw is of great significance several treatment methods such as ion exchange membrane separation precipitation electrochemical treatment and adsorption have been employed for removing metals from wastewater bhatnagar and sillanpää 2010 peng et al 2009 among the technologies mentioned adsorption has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective and versatile methods due to its significant advantages such as easy operation high efficiency and low cost gupta et al 2009 li et al 2019 wang et al 2010 2020 recently some adsorbents have been developed to remove metals in ospw lou et al 2016 found that pine sawdust biochar pyrolyzed at 550 c exhibited superior removal property for cu from the ospw whose maximum adsorption capacity i e 2 5 mg g was 30 folds higher than that produced at 300 c lou et al 2016 zubot et al 2012 also reported a petroleum coke pc adsorbent with better removal property for calcium and magnesium from ospw when the dosage of adsorbent was 38 40 weight percent however the reported adsorbents were tested at the bench scale level far from the practical treatment of metals in ospw considering the adsorption efficiency and production cost besides another key problem is the poor functional groups on these reported adsorbents thus it is meaningful to develop a cost effective adsorbent with rich functional groups to effectively remove metals in ospw recently chitosan cs has been widely applied for the removal of metals because it is inexpensive abundant nontoxic and biodegradable vakili et al 2019 furthermore the functional groups on its surface i e amino and hydroxyl groups can interact with metal ions resulting in stable chemical adsorption fan et al 2009 tharanathan and kittur 2003 however chitosan usually has an insufficient adsorption capacity for metal ions mainly because of its low specific surface area which results in a limited number of active sites zhang et al 2019 furthermore its weak mechanical strength and other drawbacks also limit the widespread use of chitosan in wastewater treatment zhang et al 2019 fortunately these drawbacks of chitosan can be remedied by introducing a carrier based on previous reports zhang et al 2015 it has been widely accepted that biochar is a good adsorbent carrier owing to the following characteristics porous insoluble stable and low cost tan et al 2016 biochar a carbon rich solid is easy to produce at temperatures between 300 and 700 c by the pyrolysis of various solid wastes from a wide range of low cost sources such as straw rice husks sawdust sludge and kitchen waste lehmann 2007 wei et al 2010 in this work the sludge from a sewage treatment plant was utilized to prepare biochar which can not only convert waste into a useful adsorbent material but also help to reduce the disposal cost of waste sludge carrère et al 2010 moreover biochar has also been widely studied as an adsorbent to remove various contaminants from water chen et al 2013 the physical and chemical properties allow biochar to act as a great support material for an adsorbent that can be used to remove metals from wastewater chen et al 2014 jiang et al 2012 it was thought that the biochar cs composite would be a promising adsorbent in the practical application of removing metals from ospw more importantly according to the previous reports there are few studies on the adsorption of metals from real ospw in this work biochar cs composite was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method the biochar cs composite was used as an adsorbent for the removal of metals from ospw for the first time furthermore detailed experimental results regarding the adsorption process were also summarized in this manuscript the objectives of this study were to 1 synthesize and characterize an effective biochar cs adsorbent that can be used for metals removal from ospw 2 investigate the effect of the composite dose on the removal of metals cr cu se pb in ospw 3 determine the equilibrium time needed for metals cr cu se pb adsorption onto biochar cs and compare the removal efficiency of biochar cs composite with other materials 4 investigate the isotherm and kinetics in the adsorption process and 5 determine the diffusion types related to the adsorption process via the diffusion model and propose the possible adsorption mechanism s 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all of the reagents used in this work were procured from fisher scientific co canada the main information is summarized in the supporting information si 2 2 preparation of the sludge based biochar and biochar chitosan the sludge based biochar was prepared by pyrolysis under n2 environment and hydrothermal method was adopted to synthesize biochar chitosan composite the typical preparation process and the characterization details of samples by various techniques are provided in the si 2 3 batch adsorption experiments the effect of adsorbent dose on metals removal from ospw was investigated by adding a different dose of adsorbent 0 1 to 3 0 g l the optimal adsorbent dose could be obtained from experiments above the equilibrium time and kinetics experiments were conducted under a predetermined time interval using the adsorbents dose the detailed experimental methods and data analyses are summarized in the si including the adsorption isotherms and kinetic models 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbents 3 1 1 xrd analysis and surface area bet analysis the xrd patterns of biochar cs chitosan and biochar are shown in fig 1 a on the xrd pattern of chitosan the broad diffraction peak at around 2θ 11 0 to 2θ 20 0 is the typical crystal form of chitosan i and ii sajomsang et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 a smaller but still broad peak of chitosan at around 2θ 20 0 can also be seen on the xrd pattern of biochar cs the disappearance of the chitosan peak at around 2θ 11 0 and the decrease of peak intensity at around 2θ 20 0 indicate that an interaction occurred between chitosan and biochar in the composite biochar cs zhang et al 2019 besides the quartz peaks from biochar also emerge in the xrd pattern of biochar cs demonstrating the presence of biochar in the composite hence from this result it is clear that the biochar cs composite was successfully synthesized nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms and the bjh pore size distributions of samples are displayed in fig 1 b and c based on the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac type iv isotherm with h1 hysteresis loop can be seen from the adsorption and desorption isotherm of biochar cs and biochar in fig 1 b these characteristics are the main features of mesoporous materials which are beneficial to the adsorption of pollutants li et al 2016 lin et al 2015 ren et al 2007 for cs the adsorption desorption isotherm is type iii with h3 hysteresis loop kazemi and javanbakht 2020 which is the feature of a sheet structure material that is non porous or macroporous moreover the bjh pore size distribution of materials can be seen from fig 1 c biochar cs adsorbent presents a wider pore size distribution 20 to 50 nm further confirming the mesoporous characteristic wu et al 2004 it can be seen from table s2 that the surface area of biochar cs composite 34 7 m2 g was increased by 20 times as compared with cs 1 7 m2 g and the pore volume increased 14 times as compared to cs this is mainly because many small biochar particles are deposited on the surface of chitosan to form the composite which can significantly improve the surface area and pore volume of pure chitosan 3 1 2 sem and edx analyses it can be seen from fig 2 a and b that the surface of biochar is porous and rough while a smooth long and sheet structure is shown on the sem image of chitosan fig 2c and d compared with the morphology of chitosan the surface of the biochar cs composite is rougher and more heterogeneous a large number of small biochar particles are deposited on the surface of the composite fig 2e h which help to increase the surface area as well as fully exposing functional groups of the composite zhang et al 2015 it is clear from fig 2 i that biochar particles become smaller after acid alkaline hydrothermal treatment without chitosan present which further confirms that biochar is deposited on the surface of the composite material from the sem results one can see that after treatment by the method used in this work chitosan and biochar have been well combined the morphology of the composite material is significantly different to that of biochar or chitosan alone compared with the biochar chitosan composite reported in the previous literature the intact structure of chitosan was observed in our synthesized composite implying that the functional groups on chitosan surface were not destroyed during the synthesis process liu et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 elemental mapping and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx pattern of biochar cs composite are shown in fig 2 j it could be observed from element mapping that c n o and si are uniformly distributed in the biochar cs based on the signal intensities of elements which further confirmed the deposit of small biochar particles on the surface of composite the edx spectrum of biochar cs composite shows that the contents of c o and n are around 53 31 34 09 and 9 33 wt respectively the edx analysis also reveals the successful synthesis of biochar cs composite 3 2 effect of adsorbent dose fig 3 shows that higher doses of biochar cs adsorbent lead to higher metals removal the same trend can be seen from the report of zubot et al 2012 they found that higher dose of petroleum coke pc resulted in significant decrease in calcium and magnesium concentrations from ospw the removal tends to be relatively stable once the dosage is 0 5 g l or higher when the dosage is 0 5 g l the removals of cr cu se and pb are 83 9 97 5 87 9 and 94 3 respectively and the concentrations of cr cu se and pb were about 0 00467 0 00153 0 00097 and 0 00029 mg l respectively based on ospw quality and water quality guidelines from ccme cr 8 9 ppb cu 2 2 86 ppb se 1 ppb pb 1 ppb all the four metal concentrations comply with the standard after 24 h adsorption with a composite dosage of 0 5 g l considering the cost and effectiveness all further adsorption experiments used an adsorbent dose of 0 5 g l the same dose of adsorbent 0 5 g l was used by xiao et al 2019 who used chitosan combined magnetic biochar as adsorbent to remove cr and cu from wastewater the dosage of adsorbent 0 5 g l used in this study was much lower than that used in the study of zhang et al 2019 in which 3 3 g l of a poly acrylic acid chitosan biochar composite adsorbent was employed for the adsorption of metals from wastewater as well a 1 0 g l of carboxymethyl chitosan biochar was used for hg adsorption in the study of ifthikar et al 2018 compared with similar materials reported in the application of wastewater our synthesized biochar cs adsorbent has a higher removal efficiency for various metals for example hussain et al 2017 synthesized an adsorbent with plant waste based biochar modified chitosan and the maximum removal efficiencies of cu pb as and cd from industrial wastewater were only 43 3 54 3 22 3 and 8 5 respectively lv et al 2019 reported a hydrogel adsorbent to remove various trace metals and the removal ratios were around 46 8 cu 57 1 cd 26 9 cr 52 7 mn and 52 5 ni respectively zhou et al 2013 used chitosan modified biochar as an adsorbent for metal environmental remediation and the removal of cu pb and cd were only 58 45 and 50 respectively it is believable that our adsorbent would be a promising alternative for real wastewater treatment due to the superior removal efficiency for multiple metals meanwhile our adsorbent is cost effective and environment friendly resulting from the introduction of sludge a waste material based biochar 3 3 isotherm studies fig s1 in supporting information shows that the equilibrium adsorption capacity oe for biochar cs increases along with the equilibrium concentration ce increase of cr cu se and pb which is in line with the previous study results that showed that a higher adsorbent dose results in a lower adsorption capacity islam et al 2018 khan et al 2011 pourrezaei et al 2014 2011 when the dose of adsorbent is small high metal equilibrium concentration there is lower pollutant removal efficiency but the fewer number of adsorption sites will become saturated with adsorbates resulting in higher adsorption capacity xing et al 2008 when more adsorbent is added some adsorption sites are not saturated so the adsorption capacity is smaller while the removal efficiency is higher khan et al 2011 the langmuir and freundlich isotherms for metals adsorbed on biochar cs composite are displayed in fig s2 and fig s3 descriptions about the two models are summarized in the si parameters of langmuir and freundlich obtained from biochar cs adsorption experiments in ospw are listed in table s3 the coefficient of determination r2 values in freundlich model r2 0 980 0 994 are higher than those of the langmuir model r2 0 941 0 976 indicating the adsorption of metals on biochar cs is better modelled using the freundlich isotherm these results indicate that the metals adsorption on biochar cs is multilayered it can be seen from table s3 that the value of freundlich constant n is more than 1 for four metals for values in the range 1 n 10 the adsorption is favorable thanh tu et al 2018 3 4 adsorption kinetics as shown in fig 4 the metals are rapidly removed by the composite at the initial stage the removal begins to plateau around 60 min 81 5 90 min 97 2 45 min 87 5 and 30 min 90 2 for cr cu se and pb respectively in contrast with the previous reports about similar adsorbent our adsorbent presents a fast removal of these metals for example zhang et al 2019 synthesized a poly acrylic acid chitosan biochar composite adsorbent for metals treatment and the equilibrium time for cu cr and pb was about 3 h although their removal efficiency could reach 90 above ifthikar et al 2018 reported a carboxymethyl chitosan sewage sludge biochar adsorbent with good removal efficiency for pb and hg while it took 60 min to reach more than 90 removal of pb as for pb adsorption on our adsorbent it only needs 30 min the initial stage of rapid removal may be attributed to the large number of reaction sites on the surface of the biochar cs composite song et al 2019 the reason the adsorption process gradually slows down in the later period is that the adsorbates metals may be further adsorbed on the internal active sites in the mesopores of the composite material longer time is needed for this adsorption within the mesopores of the composite material to occur as compared with adsorption on the external surface active sites of the material song et al 2019 in addition the biochar cs adsorbent shows the highest equilibrium removal of metals in comparison to biochar cs and biochar cs sample this result demonstrates the crucial role of uniformly deposited small biochar particles on the composite material in increased metal removal from fig 4 it also can be seen that the equilibrium cr removal by biochar cs is approximately 2 4 1 2 and 1 7 times that of biochar chitosan and biochar cs sample respectively for cu the equilibrium removal by biochar cs is approximately 2 3 1 4 and 1 6 times that of biochar cs and biochar cs respectively for se it is 2 1 1 3 and 1 7 times respectively as for pb the corresponding data is 1 6 1 2 and 1 5 times respectively the main reason is the synergistic effect of biochar and cs in the biochar cs composite the synergistic effect is mainly derived from the following aspects 1 after the introduction of biochar into the composite using the mild hydrothermal method larger specific surface area and pore volume could be obtained which could more effectively capture the metals in the ospw and adsorb the metal ions on the surface of the composite zhang et al 2015 and 2 the existence of chitosan in the composite can make the captured metals more stable when adsorbed on the surface of the composite through its rich functional groups such as nh2 oh fan et al 2009 because of the synergistic effect the biochar cs composite synthesized by hydrothermal method can have better physical and chemical properties compared with biochar cs and physical mixture biochar cs therefore the composite can show better adsorption properties this is also explained in the surface area and sem results section 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models of metals adsorbed on biochar cs composite are presented in fig s4 and fig s5 descriptions about the two models are summarized in si the kinetic parameters of those two models are displayed in table s4 as seen from table s4 the coefficient of determination r2 values for the pseudo second order model are much higher than those of pseudo first order model which indicates that the process of adsorbing four kinds of metals on biochar cs fits well with the pseudo second order model song et al 2019 sun et al 2017 therefore this indicates that there may be chemical reactions in the adsorption process alvarez ayuso et al 2003 bayramoglu et al 2009 for biochar cs experimental qe values obtained for cr cu se and pb are 0 049 0 121 0 014 and 0 010 mg g respectively for the composite material qe values calculated from the pseudo second order model for cr cu se and pb are 0 050 0 123 0 014 and 0 010 mg g respectively one can see that the two qe values are remarkably close this is further confirmation of the applicability of the pseudo second order model on the adsorption process regarding the adsorption capacity of adsorbents when used for treating industrial wastewater sandoval et al 2018 found that the adsorption capacity of an amorphous silica for pb cr and cu in industrial wastewater was 0 07 0 08 and 0 07 mg g respectively which is similar to the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of biochar cs in our study due to the different properties of the industrial wastewater and adsorbents the adsorption capacity of adsorbent may vary between different adsorption studies through an extensive literature review we found that the kinetics and isotherms of metals in solution by adsorption materials can be influenced by the initial metal concentration and the properties of metals such as ionic radius hydrated radius softness and electronegativity as well as the properties of adsorption materials for example it has been reported that the initial solute concentration c0 can affect the k2 constant value of the pseudo second order kinetics febrianto et al 2019 plazinski et al 2009 it has been found that k2 decreases with increasing c0 values because k2 is a time scaling factor as such it would take more time for the system to reach equilibrium at higher c0 values plazinski et al 2013 zanin et al 2017 found that the adsorption of metals in a solution containing 10 mg l of each metal by clinoptilolite zeolite followed pseudo first order kinetic model for cr and cu and pseudo second order for fe the langmuir model provided the best fit of adsorption isotherms for cr and cu while freundlich model was the best for fe different outcomes were reported when a different adsorbent was used to adsorb the same metal ions i e cr and cu zhang et al 2019 reported that cr and cu were adsorbed by a poly acrylic acid grafted chitosan biochar composite and the pseudo second order model provided a better description of the adsorption process rather than the pseudo first order kinetic model therefore different kinetics and isotherms may be obtained in different studies due to variations in the initial metals concentration properties of metals and properties of adsorption materials 3 5 adsorption mechanism 3 5 1 intraparticle diffusion model the intraparticle diffusion model weber and morris is used to investigate the diffusion mechanism during the adsorption process of metals on biochar cs the detailed descriptions about this model are summarized in si as shown in fig s6 and table s5 qt vs t0 5 plots for the four metals do not pass through the origin thus the role of bulk and film diffusion must be taken into consideration fig 5 shows that the plots of cr and se are multilinear including three linear regions which indicates that three adsorption processes determine the adsorption of the two metals on biochar cs while for cu and pb there are two steps involve in their adsorption on composite the rate constants for each region from fig 5 are summarized in table s6 the three regions refer to three different types of diffusion bulk film and pore for cr and se the first area shown from the left is bulk diffusion and the highest rate constant can be seen from this area which is 0 0671 cr and 0 0226 se mg g h0 5 respectively in the second phase the increasing trend of the plot has slowed down compared to the first phase from left indicating that the diffusion rate is further limited in this step metals transferring through the film around the materials named film diffusion takes more time with respect to the far right side area pore diffusion scarce increase can be seen from the plot of se and cr which can be attributed to the adsorption equilibrium or extremely low metal concentration left in ospw wang et al 2019 fig 5 also shows that regions for cu and pb can be divided into film and pore diffusion from fig 5 one can see that it takes 15 min for cr and se to transfer through the bulk liquid as well as 45 min 90 min 30 min and 30 min for cr cu se and pb for film diffusion among all the diffusion regions pore diffusion requires the longest time and has the lowest rate constant once cr and se pass the bulk liquid it starts to slow down when it begins to travel across the film around the materials when starting to enter the pores inside the materials the travel speed of cr and se becomes the slowest in all stages the process of cu and pb traveling across the film surrounding adsorbent and the pores in adsorbent is similar to that of another two kinds of metal ions in conclusion pore diffusion is the dominate rate limiting step for the adsorption of cr cu se and pb on biochar cs while bulk diffusion for cr and se and film diffusion also have effect on the reaction rate islam et al 2018 3 5 2 xps analysis the xps survey spectra of biochar cs composite before and after adsorption of metals in ospw are displayed in fig 6 a and b c 1 s n 1 s and o 1 s peaks are seen in biochar cs composite before adsorption these peaks as well as the na kll and na 1 s peak are found on the biochar cs material post adsorption the distinct peaks of cr cu se and pd could not be detected in xps survey spectra which might be due to their extremely low content huang et al 2015 while the presence of na kll and na 1 s peak is most likely due to the salinity in ospw fig 6 c and d show the c 1 s spectra of biochar cs composite before and after adsorption of metals from ospw the c 1 s spectrum of composite could be deconvoluted into four peaks at 284 67 286 25 287 50 and 288 70 ev which are corresponding to c c c o c n and c o respectively shan et al 2009 xu et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 after adsorption in ospw the area ratio of c o shows increase while co exhibits a considerable decrease 21 74 indicating that the oxygen containing functional groups above might play a crucial role in adsorption of metals from ospw liu et al 2017 in addition metals in ospw may be adsorbed onto the above oxygen containing functional groups through π π interactions h bond and hydrophobic interaction afzal et al 2018 inyang and dickenson 2015 fig 6 e and f reveal that the n 1 s xps spectra of biochar cs composite before and after adsorption in ospw the n 1 s spectrum of composite is divided into three peaks located at 398 60 ev 399 48 ev and 400 38 ev which corresponds to nh n c o and nh2 respectively afzal et al 2018 the ratio of nh2 decreases obviously from 34 42 to 8 18 after adsorption in addition the peak intensity of nh as well as n c o have little changes which indicates that nh2 is preferential adsorption site for metal removal afzal et al 2018 it can be seen from the o 1 s spectra fig 6 g and h that there are three peaks at 531 67 532 80 and 533 72 ev before adsorption which is in accord with c o oh and co however the significant change 12 47 in the intensity of peak of oh after adsorption might be due to the interaction between oh group from biochar cs and metals in ospw liu et al 2017 based on the analysis results above such as freundlich model pseudo second order kinetic model intraparticle diffusion model and xps analysis it is clear that biochar cs composite can adsorb metals cr cu se and pb found in ospw through chemical and physical adsorption furthermore the chemical adsorption might play the dominant role in the adsorption process due to the abundant functional groups on biochar cs composite 4 conclusions in this work a biochar cs composite was successfully synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method using sludge waste material based biochar with chitosan the prepared material was utilized to remove metals from real ospw under natural ph for the first time the specific surface area and pore volume of biochar cs composite were improved by about 20 times and 14 times as compared with chitosan respectively the biochar cs composite resulted in higher removal efficiency for cr 83 9 cu 97 5 se 87 9 and pb 94 3 compared to biochar and chitosan alone after treatment with the composite the metals concentration cr cu se and pb in real ospw complied with the ccme standard the enhanced removal efficiency of the biochar cs composite material was mainly attributed to its higher specific surface area and pore volume as well as exposed functional groups in the composite after combining biochar and chitosan the adsorption process was best modelled using the freundlich isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetic model regarding the intraparticle diffusion model of cr and se using composite there were three obvious diffusion regions bulk film and pore diffusion for cu and pb the obvious diffusion regions were film and pore diffusion in addition metals cr cu se pb in ospw were removed by biochar cs through chemical and physical adsorption and the chemical adsorption might play the dominant role in the removal process due to the abundant functional groups in composite such as nh2 oh and some oxygen containing functional groups hence the biochar cs composite would be a promising efficient and cost effective adsorbent for metals removal from ospw in practical applications
