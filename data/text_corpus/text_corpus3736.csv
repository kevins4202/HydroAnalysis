18680,to discover an applicable technology for urea abatement from swimming pool water spw this study compared the performances of seven ultraviolet uv based technologies on urea removal including uv alone uv coupled with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 sulfite uv na2so3 potassium persulfate uv k2s2o8 a combination of uv and vacuum uv uv vuv and uv vuv in tandem with either h2o2 vuv h2o2 or potassium persulfate vuv k2s2o8 among them uv and uv na2so3 showed little removal ability and uv h2o2 removed only 12 8 of urea within 3 h experiments while uv vuv degraded 71 7 of urea without introducing substantial total dissolved solids tds therefore uv vuv was considered as a promising technology for further exploration in comparison although uv k2s2o8 exhibited higher urea removal than uv vuv it caused dramatic increases of tds which made the regulatory threshold for the tds increment difficult to maintain within uv vuv studies some common components in spw e g cyanuric acid humic acid nitrate and bicarbonate inhibited the removal process whereas chloride and sulfate facilitated it while free chlorine at doses 3 mg cl2 l and ph levels from 6 8 to 8 0 imposed little impact on urea degradation overall uv vuv degraded 40 0 and 22 2 of urea from tap water and spw respectively both were lower than the efficiency observed in ultrapure water as for reaction byproducts urea phototransformation via uv vuv yielded nitrate and ammonia as the key products with the mass balance of nitrogen element being met however the contents of organic carbon decreased at a rate slightly lower than urea degradation suggesting that urea was mostly mineralized and slightly converted to unknown organic compounds the results hence demonstrate that uv vuv is an effective alternative for urea removal from spw graphical abstract image 1 keywords urea vacuum ultraviolet swimming pool water photolysis 185 nm 1 introduction swimming is a popular healthy activity globally to protect swimmers from pathogens swimming pool managers usually apply certain chlorine based disinfectants e g sodium hypochlorite calcium hypochlorite dichloroisocyanurate and trichloroisocyanuric acid c3o3n3cl3 to disinfect swimming pool water spw who 2006 however a common problem associated with the use of chlorine based disinfectants is that they inevitably react with dissolved organic matter dom and form undesirable byproducts such as disinfection by products dbps yang et al 2018a among dbps trichloramine has a strong odor that people can easily inhale catto et al 2012 causing respiratory symptoms or antipathy seys et al 2015 according to a literature urea h2nconh2 namely carbamide or carbonyl diamide is likely to yield more trichloramine than many other nitrogenous compounds such as formamide glycine histidine creatinine and ammonium schmalz et al 2011 therefore urea is an important trichloramine precursor in addition as a product of protein metabolism urea is abundantly present in human body fluids and is refractory to biodegradation it was reported that urea accounts for an average of 84 and 68 of nitrogenous matter in human urine and sweat respectively who 2006 the concentrations of urea in spw ranged widely in many studies from 0 07 to 18 73 mg l zhang et al 2018 0 01 4 02 mg l blatchley and cheng 2010 0 12 3 60 mg l de laat et al 2011 and 0 69 2 11 mg l schmalz et al 2011 to alleviate the risks posed by urea the chinese government has currently established a maximum contaminant limit mcl for urea in spw of 3 5 mg l cj t 244 2016 hence motives exist for exploring robust and applicable technologies to remove urea from spw before preventive measures can be taken the sources of urea must be understood although urine and sweat are two major sources of urea in spw yang et al 2018a urea containing moisturizer might serve as another source doi et al 2009 if we assume the average concentrations of urea as 10 240 mg l and 680 mg l in urine and sweat respectively who 2006 and each swimmer releases 25 30 ml who 2006 and 150 400 ml at 29 c keuten et al 2014 of urine and sweat into spw respectively each swimmer would emit 256 307 mg urea via urine and 102 272 mg urea via sweat because sweating is unavoidable in swimming activity eliminating urination and having shower prior to swimming still cannot completely avoid urea occurrence in spw therefore pool managers must take actions to prevent urea from exceeding the mcl either by diluting spw with pristine tap water tap or by reducing urea from spw with professional on site treatment facilities currently several technologies have been assessed for urea removal for example although urea was once converted into ammonia and carbon dioxide via pyrolysis at high temperature 120 c and high pressure conditions mahalik et al 2010 sahu et al 2010 pyrolysis is inappropriate for treating a large volume of water because of its high cost chlorine oxidation degraded only 10 20 and 50 of urea with 1 8 3 6 and 20 6 mg l chlorine respectively within 24 h at an initial urea concentration urea 0 of 3 mg l a ph of 7 3 and a temperature of 25 0 c de laat et al 2011 indicating low efficiency of urea treatment in addition unwanted inorganic chloramines formed during the reaction between chlorine and urea blatchley and cheng 2010 schmalz et al 2011 similarly although electrochemical oxidation might remove urea rapidly it requires a large amount of salt as the electrolyte carlesi jara et al 2008 cataldo hernández et al 2014 cho and hoffmann 2014 which can dramatically increase the quantity of total dissolved solids tds a term also regulated by governments i e ansi apsp 11 2009 in usa tds increment 1500 mg l cj t 244 2016 in china tds increment 1000 mg l regarding biodegradation earlier studies mostly targeted to removal of urea from municipal wastewater gupta and sharma 1996 because spw has markedly different water qualities from wastewater especially the presence of residual disinfectant the results of urea control in wastewater cannot be readily translated to spw therefore pyrolysis chlorine oxidation electrochemical oxidation and biodegradation all appear impracticable or inefficient for spw treatment recently some studies have demonstrated the potential of ultraviolet uv and uv derived technologies in disinfecting and degrading dbps in water hansen et al 2013 who 2006 zare afifi and blatchley 2016 suggesting that uv technology is a robust tool for micropollutant control however uv generated by medium and low pressure mercury lamps could not degrade urea rapidly zare afifi and blatchley 2016 suggesting uv alone is not cost effective in treating urea furthermore uv emitted by a 1200 w mercury vapor lamp combined with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 or persulfate uv s2o8 2 transformed 75 or 97 respectively of urea in distilled water within 24 h bronk et al 2000 thereby showing the potential of a combined use of uv and additives however these results were not verified in real spw meanwhile vacuum uv vuv irradiation is more robust than uv in degrading organic compounds kim and tanaka 2009 a vuv lamp with 3 energy emitting a 185 nm light can convert 95 100 of urea urea 0 50 mg l into nitrate no3 when vuv was combined with potassium persulfate k2s2o8 4 g l roig et al 1999 hence a comparison of uv vuv and many other uv or vuv based technologies e g vuv h2o2 vuv s2o8 2 may merit further attention and in depth exploration hence this study carried out a series of experiments to understand the potentials of different uv and vuv based technologies for urea mitigation under typical spw conditions these results are intended to 1 compare the efficiencies of uv alone uv h2o2 uv k2s2o8 uv coupled with sodium sulfite uv na2so3 vuv vuv h2o2 and vuv k2s2o8 in removing urea from ultrapure water upw 2 evaluate the impacts of typical and common water components such as ph chloride cl no3 bicarbonate hco3 sulfate so4 2 and dom on urea degradation performances by vuv and 3 identify to the maximum extent possible reaction mechanisms pathways and products of the vuv irradiation process in order to differentiate different lamps and to make the descriptions concise we herein define the experiments using the lamp with both 254 and 185 nm lights as vuv while using the lamp with 254 nm light only as uv in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and chemicals all chemicals and reagents used herein are of analytical grade and were purchased from sigma aldrich and aladdin inc the stock solutions of urea h2o2 and k2s2o8 were prepared with upw generated by a millipore water generator direct q3 millipore france the real spw samples were collected from a large public indoor swimming pool nearby the laboratory 1 5 km between 3 and 4 p m and the pool was disinfected with a typical disinfectant c3o3n3cl3 the ph tds and free chlorine of real samples were analyzed immediately after delivery to the laboratory the concentrations of urea non purgeable organic carbon npoc cl no3 and so4 2 were measured within 24 h after sampling the concentrations of urea ranged from 1 50 to 3 86 mg l in collected spw to allow experimental consistency and comparison among tests the urea 0 of all samples was adjusted to 5 mg l that is additional urea was added to spw to achieve an initial urea concentration of 5 mg l for all tests 2 2 analytical methods urea was determined colorimetrically using diacetyl monoxime according to a chinese standard analytical method gb t 18204 2 china with a method detection limit mdl of 0 1 mg l the method is based on the principle that a colored compound with a characteristic wavelength of 460 nm was formed after reaction of urea with diacetyl monoxime and antipyrine at 100 c in the presence of sulfuric and acetic acids the absorbance of the colored solution was measured with a spectrophotometer ta 98 shenzhen sinsche technology co ltd china because residual oxidants such as h2o2 and k2s2o8 can significantly interfere with the accuracy of urea measurement fig s1 na2so3 was spiked into target solutions after uv or vuv irradiation to remove remaining oxidants then sulfuric acid was added to the samples to reduce ph to 1 5 while the samples were bubbled with air to eliminate excessive na2so3 before urea determination via these efforts the accuracies of the urea measurement for samples with 5 mm of h2o2 were improved to 91 of samples without h2o2 fig s2a meaning that the influences of h2o2 on the urea measurement were eliminated however k2s2o8 is unreactive with na2so3 at room temperature therefore the interference of k2s2o8 on urea detection appeared non eliminable fig s2b in this context accurate urea detection can be achieved only with a k2s2o8 concentration of 0 1 mm this means that either the initial dosage of k2s2o8 should be 0 1 mm or it should be largely consumed by uv irradiation prior to urea measurement in this context this study evaluated only the impacts of k2s2o8 with a concentration of 0 1 mm on urea degradation fig s1b typical anions in water such as cl nitrite no2 no3 and so4 2 were analyzed by an ion chromatographer cic di120 qingdao shenghan chromatography technology co ltd china equipped with an anion exchange column shenghan sh ac 5 250 mm 4 6 mm and a conductivity detector the mobile phase was made of 20 mm potassium hydroxide koh and run at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min the mdls of these anions were 0 01 mg l h2o2 and formic acid were measured by another ion chromatographer ic 2010 tosoh inc japan equipped with not only a conductivity detector but also a uv detector spd 20a shimadzu japan which gives mdls of them as 0 01 mg l its mobile eluent was made of 20 mm koh solution and ran at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min according to an established method song et al 2017 nh4 and free chlorines were detected by a spectrophotometer using nessler s reagent colorimetric method no 8038 and dpd colorimetric method no 8021 as provided by hach co usa with their mdls as 0 02 mg n l and 0 02 mg cl2 l tds of water was determined by an electrical conductivity meter sx 713 02 shanghai san xin instrumentation inc china with a mdl of 0 1 mg l formaldehyde was detected by a gas chromatographer with an electron capture detector gc 9720 zhejiang fuli analytical instrument co ltd china according to epa method 556 with a mdl of 1 μg l npoc and total organic carbon toc in water were determined by a toc analyzer toc lcph shimadzu japan with a mdl of 0 1 mg c l the amount of toc was calculated by subtracting inorganic carbon from total carbon while npoc was measured directly after a sample acidic stripping process the ph was determined by a ph monitor phs 3e shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china for quality assurance and control the allowable relative standard deviations rsds of measured parameters were set as 10 in case it was exceeded more tests were carried out 2 3 reactor and experimental conditions the experiments were carried out in two parallel stainless column shaped sterilizers with a water thickness of 1 4 cm and a volume of 400 ml fig s3 for vuv tests a low pressure mercury lamp emitting both 254 nm and 185 nm lights 12w gph265t5vh uv tec co ltd china was placed in the middle of the reactor and the lamp was shielded by a quartz sleeve the irradiation intensity of vuv 185 nm was estimated to be 0 32 0 1 mw cm 2 according to an actinometrical method yang et al 2018b for uv tests a low pressure mercury lamp with identical power inputs 12w as vuv but emitting uv at 254 nm only gph265t5l uv tec co ltd china was used using h2o2 as the actinometer the irradiation intensity of the uv254 lamp was estimated to be 14 3 0 6 mw cm 2 aliquots were retrieved at designated time intervals blank control and duplicate experiments were conducted in all tests during experiments the initial dosages of h2o2 and na2so3 were both 1 mm while that of k2s2o8 was 0 1 mm in addition as shown in fig s4b given that h2o2 can be rapidly consumed by uv and vuv an additional 1 mm of h2o2 was added every h to supplement its loss regarding na2so3 to prevent oxygen o2 from disturbing uv na2so3 performance the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in water was adjusted to 1 7 mg l by bubbling nitrogen n2 into the water before the experiment and then do was maintained during experiments by blowing n2 on the water surface 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparison of methods of urea removal fig 1 demonstrates the removals of urea in upw by seven uv based methods in general the orders of their efficiency were ranked as vuv k2s2o8 uv k2s2o8 vuv vuv h2o2 uv h2o2 uv uv na2so3 under the experimental conditions of this study specifically uv alone removed little urea 0 7 within 3 h meaning that direct photolysis with 254 nm can hardly degrade urea which is consistent with the results reported in an earlier study zare afifi and blatchley 2016 similarly uv na2so3 as a typical advanced reduction process reduced urea by 8 0 within 3 h meaning that urea was not susceptible to reductive radicals such as hydrogen atom h hydrated electron e aq or sulfite radical so3 formed in uv na2so3 eq 1 and eq 2 although they degraded other compounds well vellanki et al 2013 in literature the rate constant of reaction between urea and h was 3 0 104 m 1s 1 schuler et al 1971 smaller than that between urea and e aq 3 0 105 m 1s 1 hart et al 1967 uv h2o2 decreased 12 8 of urea within the same time suggesting that hydroxyl radical ho generated by uv h2o2 eq 5 was weak in removing urea too in literature the rate constant of reaction between urea and ho was 7 9 105 m 1s 1 minemura et al 1980 slightly greater than those reductive radicals previously another uv h2o2 study reported much higher urea removal 75 than this study probably because it had a much higher power input 1200w a lower water volume photolyzed 20 ml a longer irradiation time 24 h and a higher dosage of h2o2 6 5 mm bronk et al 2000 than this study which featured 12w 400 ml 3 h and 3 0 mm at most in contrast uv k2s2o8 exhibited more rapid and higher urea removal 67 8 within 1 h than other uv based methods although k2s2o8 was dosed only once at 0 1 mm level in the beginning this phenomenon might partially be attributed to the strong oxidation ability of sulfate radical so4 as generated by uv k2s2o8 eq 7 moussavi et al 2014 and partially to the selective susceptibility of urea once k2s2o8 was used up i e after 1 h no further urea degradation was observed further indicating that so4 played the key role in urea degradation this finding tends to support another study that so4 e 0 so4 so42 2 5 3 1 v was stronger than ho e 0 ho h2o 1 9 2 7 v in transforming compounds with an amide group conh2 li et al 2017 1 so 3 2 uv e aq

1 7 s 2 o 8 2 uv 2so 4 compared to the uv based processes vuv and vuv based methods appeared to be more robust and efficient the removal of urea in 3 h by vuv reached 71 7 much higher than uv the dramatic difference in urea removal between uv and vuv indicates that the removal of urea was mostly attributed to 185 nm light meanwhile this finding confirms that compounds with amide group such as carbamazepine and tetracycline were more susceptible to vuv zoschke et al 2014 additionally spiking k2s2o8 at the 0 1 mm level promoted the removal of urea 95 8 suggesting that both so4 and 185 nm light had contributed to urea degradation however the removal of urea by vuv h2o2 51 2 was surprisingly lower than that by vuv the addition of h2o2 at this level 1 mm each h for 3 h was somehow detrimental to urea photodegradation the reason of this adverse effect is likely attributed to light screening or radical competition or both since h2o2 is not only a ho precursor but also a ho scavenger with very rapid reaction rate constant 2 7 107 m 1s 1 eq 8 buxton et al 1988 as shown in eq 9 and eq 10 the rate of reaction between ho and h2o2 2 7 104 ho s 1 is greater than rate of reaction between urea and ho 66 ho s 1 the inhibition of urea degradation by h2o2 was most likely due to scavenging of ho based on the water molar absorption coefficient at 185 nm εh2o 185 nm 1 0 or 1 8 m 1cm 1 duca et al 2017 weeks et al 1963 and the concentration of water 55 m the absorbance of water was calculated to be 55 or 99 cm 1 while the absorbance of h2o2 εh2o2 185 nm 293 341 m 1cm 1 duca et al 2017 weeks et al 1963 at 1 0 mm was only 0 294 0 341 cm 1 at 185 nm therefore most of 185 nm photons were absorbed by water and addition of h2o2 was less likely to compete for 185 nm light 8 h 2

effects of other mechanisms on urea removal we monitored the temperature changes along the photolysis process and evaluated the contributions of thermal hydrolysis and chemical oxidation on urea removal at an elevated temperature as shown in fig s5a the water temperature was increased to 43 c then maintained constant afterward for 3 h during the uv and vuv irradiation processes however the losses of urea were 3 in a 43 c water bather in darkness within 3 h fig s5b thus thermal hydrolysis was excluded as a major contributor to urea removal similarly h2o2 or k2s2o8 alone hardly removed any urea under 43 c in the dark fig s5b proving that chemical oxidations of urea by h2o2 or k2s2o8 were also negligible in terms of reaction mechanisms the homolysis eq 11 and ionization of water eq 12 are known vuv photolysis process gonzalez et al 2004 resulting in formation of a list of radicals such as ho h and e aq based upon the abovementioned results the photodegradation of urea by vuv based methods seems more likely to undergo two processes direct 185 nm photolysis and indirect oxidation by oxidative radicals like ho and so4 11 h 2 o vuv ho h φ ho 0 33 12 h 2 o vuv e aq ho h φ e aq 0 045 3 1 1 comparison of methods on tds increments in addition to urea removal the decision whether to use these methods should consider potential side effects fig s6 shows that the tds increments derived from uv k2s2o8 90 0 mg l and vuv k2s2o8 104 5 mg l were far greater than those of other advanced oxidation process aop methods 26 2 mg l meaning that they cannot be used more than 10 or 15 times in spw treatments to meet the regulatory thresholds in china or usa cj t 244 2016 in china tds increment 1000 mg l ansi apsp 11 2009 in usa tds increment 1500 mg l therefore they should be applied with caution although the tds increments from uv and uv h2o2 were minor they hardly degraded any urea making them inappropriate for use in comparison the tds increments introduced by vuv and vuv h2o2 fell into a lower range 26 2 mg l therefore they showed better applicability not only in alleviating urea but also in causing low tds increment in this context vuv was regarded as a preferred and promising technology for urea control in spw in addition to its capacity in disinfection and photodegradation of micropollutants zoschke et al 2014 3 2 influencing factors 3 2 1 effects of typical dom in real spw c3o3n3cl3 is often used as a disinfectant and its transformation product cyanuric acid c3h3o3n3 usually acts as a stabilizer of free chlorine their reversible reactions are presented below eq 13 c3h3o3n3 combines with free chlorine to form chlorinated isocyanurates c3h 3 x o3n3cl x x 1 2 3 when free chlorine concentration is high while c3h 3 x o3n3cl x can be transformed to free chlorine and c3h3o3n3 when free chlorine concentration is low according to the world health organization who guideline the level of c3h3o3n3 spw should be kept between 50 and 100 mg l and the mcl of cyanuric acid in china is set as 30 mg l for indoor swimming pools and 100 mg l for outdoor swimming pools cj t 244 2016 in addition according to a who survey the cyanuric acid levels were sometimes greater than 100 mg l who 2006 in addition to c3h3o3n3 dom in tap is another source of organic matter in spw therefore we evaluated c3h3o3n3 and a selected humic acid as representative doms to understand their impacts on vuv photolysis 13 c 3 h 3 o 3 n 3 x hclo c 3 h 3 x o 3 n 3 cl x x h 2 o x 1 2 3 fig 2 shows that both c3h3o3n3 and humic acid restrained the photodegradation rates of urea by vuv the inhibitory effect of c3h3o3n3 increased with concentration increases from 25 to 200 mg l because the rate constant of reaction between cyanuric acid and ho k 3 107 m 1s 1 de laat et al 1994 was higher than that of urea with ho k 7 9 105 m 1s 1 and because c3h3o3n3 level was higher than urea 5 mg l c3h3o3n3 essentially acted as a scavenger of ho and inhibited urea degradation in contrast low levels of humic acid 5 0 mg l showed little impact on urea degradation unless the contents of the humic acid became 5 0 mg l previously the impact of humic acid on photolysis appears mixing sometimes dom enhanced the photolysis effect via dom sensitization and radical formation lam et al 2003 lester et al 2013 but sometimes inhibited photodegradation due to its competition for reactive species ngouyap mouamfon et al 2011 this study seemed acknowledge the role of competition instead of facilitation from humic substance in literature the rate constants for reactions between dom isolates and ho ranged at 1 39 2 18 108 m 1s 1 westerhoff et al 2007 much greater than that between urea and ho in addition npoc decreased with elevated dosage of humic acid fig s7 supporting that dom has been degraded in the reaction 3 2 2 effects of typical anions cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 are common anions in tap and spw and based upon a preliminary survey fig s8 shows their mean concentrations as 8 6 mg l for cl 6 6 mg l for no3 and 7 2 mg l for so4 2 in tap and 56 7 mg l for cl 17 7 mg l for no3 and 20 8 mg l for so4 2 in spw therefore we examined their effects at a range of concentrations fig 3 demonstrates that increasing cl and so4 2 promoted the photodegradation of urea which was unexpected because they are both low in 185 nm light absorptivity table 1 weeks et al 1963 to confirm these phenomena we spiked cl intermittently into the irradiated sample at 30 min 3 mg l and 60 min 7 mg l and compared the impacts with a sample without cl dosing and another sample dosed with 10 mg l cl only once at the beginning immediately after spiking time we clearly observed enhancements of urea degradation fig s9a thereby confirming the facilitating role of cl in theory cl might react with ho to form chlorine radical cl within the uv h2o2 process liao et al 2001 yu and barker 2003 therefore the enhanced degradation of urea with increasing cl was likely due to the formation of cl by vuv induced ho similarly we spiked so4 2 intermittently into irradiated sample at 30 min 5 mg l and 60 min 15 mg l and observed similar enhancements of urea degradation fig s9b an earlier study found so4 formation upon the reaction of so4 2 with ho de laat and le 2005 therefore the promotion of urea removal by the addition of so4 2 was likely attributed to ho induced so4 notably since 185 nm light has a very high energy we cannot exclude the possibility that cl and so4 might also be directly formed from the vuv irradiation of cl and so4 2 14 ho cl cloh k 5 3 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 15 cloh h cl h 2 o k 6 2 6 3 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 in contrast to cl and so4 2 no3 and hco3 clearly inhibited the photodegradation of urea from the literature the molar absorption coefficients of no3 and hco3 at 185 nm were 5568 and 269 m 1cm 1 respectively which are greater than that of water 1 or 1 8 m 1cm 1 duca et al 2017 weeks et al 1963 although no3 can sometimes generate ho during photolytical process tugaoen et al 2017 its quantum yields of ho 0 09 at λ 254 nm mack and bolton 1999 were usually too low to be important therefore its prominent effect was to compete for 185 nm light with urea and resulted in lower degradation of urea as for hco3 although it is not a strong 185 nm light absorber it is a known quencher of ho k 8 5 106 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 so it was also reasonable to obtain a decreased urea removal with elevated hco3 3 2 3 effects of chlorine ph do and urea 0 according to spw rules free chlorine must be kept between 0 2 and 1 0 mg l who 2006 fig 4 a indicates that the urea removals were similar for samples dosed with free chlorine from 0 2 to 3 0 mg l the results were unexpected because uv initiated chlorine can yield clo radicals li et al 2017 a reactant likely helpful for urea degradation the urea removal efficiency discrepancy between the clo generated by cl2 and the cl generated by cl may partially be explained by their inner reactivities the concentration difference between cl 10 mg l and chlorine 3 mg l which might not yield sufficient radicals according to spw rules ph must be maintained within a range of 7 2 and 7 8 who 2006 regarding its influence increasing the ph value from 6 8 to 8 5 did not markedly alter the degradation rates of urea fig 4b although hydroxide oh can scavenge ho k 1 3 1010 m 1s 1 rapidly rabani and zehavi 1971 the concentration of oh at neutral ph was too low to play an important role on the light competition and radical scavenging effects as shown in fig 4c with the rising urea 0 from 1 mg l to 10 mg l the rate constants of urea degradation were decreased from 9 95 10 3 min 1 to 4 53 10 3 min 1 but the absolute quantity of urea removed increased from 0 8 mg l to 5 4 mg l in 3 h test this result suggests that a good practice of this technology is perhaps to turn on vuv treatment facility when the urea concentration approaches the mcl of urea e g 3 0 mg l and then turn off it when the urea level was low e g 2 0 mg l in an early exemplary study the degradation of cyanide by vuv was promoted by blowing air into the solution moussavi et al 2016 indicating that do may serve an important role in the photolysis process therefore the effect of do on urea photolysis was examined by blowing n2 or o2 in water fig 4d shows that the urea removal was remarkably decreased at a do of 1 6 0 2 mg l but remained unchanged for samples with a do of 5 or 7 mg l this positive effect is likely due to the formation of peroxyl radicals which has a very important role in the further transformation and mineralization gonzalez et al 2004 in addition the reason is also likely attributed to the presence of e aq which can consume ho rapidly k 3 0 1010 m 1s 1 in the absence of do but can be converted to superoxide anion radical o2 e 0 0 33 ev at a rate of 2 2 1010 m 1s 1 in the presence of do which has lower reactivity and kinetics k 8 0 109 than e aq in reacting with ho buxton et al 1988 gonzalez et al 2004 3 2 4 effects of real water matrix fig 5 presents the effects of real water matrix on the removals of urea in real spw and tap samples the urea removals by vuv were apparently lower in spw and tap than in upw it might be that the enhancement effects derived from cl and so4 2 were lower than the inhibition effects derived from no3 hco3 nom in tap compared to tap spw showed an even larger inhibitory effect because spw used tap as the water source and some substances intentionally added to spw e g c3h3o3n3 and accidently brought in by swimmers e g sweat might act as extra inhibitors for urea photodegradation no matter spw and tap such decreases in urea removal were strongly related to the dilution factors which are reasonable because the concentrations of all compounds in water were decreased by dilution and therefore the overall inhibitions were reduced based upon the kinetics from above results the electrical energies required for one order eeo of contaminant degradation for these methods are summarized in table s1 the eeo for vuv irradiation of urea in upw 168 5 kwh m3 was greater than other micropollutants treated by most of aop processes miklos et al 2018 meaning that urea is a very refractory compound in water all eeos of methods treating real spw were higher than those of upw meaning that more efforts should be made to enhance the efficiency of urea degradation in spw 3 3 reaction products and pathways in terms of reaction products fig 6 a shows that the concentrations of no3 and nh4 continued to increase throughout the vuv irradiation process while the concentration of no2 was almost undetectable the amount of total nitrogen tn remained unchanged implying that no other types of nitrogen containing compounds were substantially formed meanwhile fig s11 shows that vuv was unable to convert nh4 rapidly into no3 within 3 h meaning that the formation of no3 was obtained by direct oxidation of urea instead of indirect oxidation of nh4 regarding carbon containing compounds formaldehyde and formic acid were analyzed but not detected at levels above their mdls 1 μg l and 10 μg l respectively meaning that these two compounds were not the major photolysis products fig 6b shows that npoc toc and urea decreased simultaneously and the rates of npoc and toc reductions were slightly lower than that of urea decrease suggesting that urea was mostly mineralized and slightly converted to volatile nitrogen free organic matter meanwhile the study observed a continuous ph decrease throughout the vuv irradiation process fig s12 after considering all reactants products and influencing factors the following two dominant reaction pathways are proposed for the urea photolysis with vuv one forming nitrate and the other forming ammonia but both yielding carbon dioxide although formation of nh4 increases ph which does not agree with the acidification of solution formation of no3 decreased ph significantly as seen from fig 6a formation of no3 was preferred over formation of nh4 which explains why the solution ph eventually decreased in the photolysis process 16 h 2 nconh 2 4 o 2 vuv co 2 2 no 3 h 2 o 2 h 17 h 2 nconh 2 3 h 2 o vuv co 2 2 nh 4 2 oh 4 conclusions in general this study compared the efficiencies of uv uv h2o2 uv k2s2o8 uv na2so3 vuv vuv h2o2 and vuv k2s2o8 on urea degradations in upw uv k2s2o8 vuv vuv h2o2 and vuv k2s2o8 showed superior capabilities to other uv and vuv based methods although the combinations of k2s2o8 with uv or vuv were more robust than other approaches in removing urea they featured greater risks of increasing tds thus making k2s2o8 less suitable for meeting regulatory requirements in comparison vuv appears to be a more promising alternative due to its robustness in degrading urea without introducing high tds in terms of influencing factors typical components in spw such as c3h3o3n3 humic acid hco3 and no3 inhibited urea degradation in the vuv irradiation process in contrast increasing the so4 2 and cl contents enhanced the urea removal free chlorine at a dosage of 3 mg l and ph at a range of 6 8 8 5 imposed little changes while low urea 0 exhibited higher photodegradation kinetics overall the influences of the real water matrix on the urea removal were negative for the vuv process with an order of upw 83 1 tap 40 0 spw 22 2 the major vuv photolysis products of urea were found to be no3 nh4 h and co2 because the mass balance of total nitrogen was met whereas total carbon decreased vuv photolysis of urea was postulated to mainly undergo oxidative mineralization the

18680,to discover an applicable technology for urea abatement from swimming pool water spw this study compared the performances of seven ultraviolet uv based technologies on urea removal including uv alone uv coupled with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 sulfite uv na2so3 potassium persulfate uv k2s2o8 a combination of uv and vacuum uv uv vuv and uv vuv in tandem with either h2o2 vuv h2o2 or potassium persulfate vuv k2s2o8 among them uv and uv na2so3 showed little removal ability and uv h2o2 removed only 12 8 of urea within 3 h experiments while uv vuv degraded 71 7 of urea without introducing substantial total dissolved solids tds therefore uv vuv was considered as a promising technology for further exploration in comparison although uv k2s2o8 exhibited higher urea removal than uv vuv it caused dramatic increases of tds which made the regulatory threshold for the tds increment difficult to maintain within uv vuv studies some common components in spw e g cyanuric acid humic acid nitrate and bicarbonate inhibited the removal process whereas chloride and sulfate facilitated it while free chlorine at doses 3 mg cl2 l and ph levels from 6 8 to 8 0 imposed little impact on urea degradation overall uv vuv degraded 40 0 and 22 2 of urea from tap water and spw respectively both were lower than the efficiency observed in ultrapure water as for reaction byproducts urea phototransformation via uv vuv yielded nitrate and ammonia as the key products with the mass balance of nitrogen element being met however the contents of organic carbon decreased at a rate slightly lower than urea degradation suggesting that urea was mostly mineralized and slightly converted to unknown organic compounds the results hence demonstrate that uv vuv is an effective alternative for urea removal from spw graphical abstract image 1 keywords urea vacuum ultraviolet swimming pool water photolysis 185 nm 1 introduction swimming is a popular healthy activity globally to protect swimmers from pathogens swimming pool managers usually apply certain chlorine based disinfectants e g sodium hypochlorite calcium hypochlorite dichloroisocyanurate and trichloroisocyanuric acid c3o3n3cl3 to disinfect swimming pool water spw who 2006 however a common problem associated with the use of chlorine based disinfectants is that they inevitably react with dissolved organic matter dom and form undesirable byproducts such as disinfection by products dbps yang et al 2018a among dbps trichloramine has a strong odor that people can easily inhale catto et al 2012 causing respiratory symptoms or antipathy seys et al 2015 according to a literature urea h2nconh2 namely carbamide or carbonyl diamide is likely to yield more trichloramine than many other nitrogenous compounds such as formamide glycine histidine creatinine and ammonium schmalz et al 2011 therefore urea is an important trichloramine precursor in addition as a product of protein metabolism urea is abundantly present in human body fluids and is refractory to biodegradation it was reported that urea accounts for an average of 84 and 68 of nitrogenous matter in human urine and sweat respectively who 2006 the concentrations of urea in spw ranged widely in many studies from 0 07 to 18 73 mg l zhang et al 2018 0 01 4 02 mg l blatchley and cheng 2010 0 12 3 60 mg l de laat et al 2011 and 0 69 2 11 mg l schmalz et al 2011 to alleviate the risks posed by urea the chinese government has currently established a maximum contaminant limit mcl for urea in spw of 3 5 mg l cj t 244 2016 hence motives exist for exploring robust and applicable technologies to remove urea from spw before preventive measures can be taken the sources of urea must be understood although urine and sweat are two major sources of urea in spw yang et al 2018a urea containing moisturizer might serve as another source doi et al 2009 if we assume the average concentrations of urea as 10 240 mg l and 680 mg l in urine and sweat respectively who 2006 and each swimmer releases 25 30 ml who 2006 and 150 400 ml at 29 c keuten et al 2014 of urine and sweat into spw respectively each swimmer would emit 256 307 mg urea via urine and 102 272 mg urea via sweat because sweating is unavoidable in swimming activity eliminating urination and having shower prior to swimming still cannot completely avoid urea occurrence in spw therefore pool managers must take actions to prevent urea from exceeding the mcl either by diluting spw with pristine tap water tap or by reducing urea from spw with professional on site treatment facilities currently several technologies have been assessed for urea removal for example although urea was once converted into ammonia and carbon dioxide via pyrolysis at high temperature 120 c and high pressure conditions mahalik et al 2010 sahu et al 2010 pyrolysis is inappropriate for treating a large volume of water because of its high cost chlorine oxidation degraded only 10 20 and 50 of urea with 1 8 3 6 and 20 6 mg l chlorine respectively within 24 h at an initial urea concentration urea 0 of 3 mg l a ph of 7 3 and a temperature of 25 0 c de laat et al 2011 indicating low efficiency of urea treatment in addition unwanted inorganic chloramines formed during the reaction between chlorine and urea blatchley and cheng 2010 schmalz et al 2011 similarly although electrochemical oxidation might remove urea rapidly it requires a large amount of salt as the electrolyte carlesi jara et al 2008 cataldo hernández et al 2014 cho and hoffmann 2014 which can dramatically increase the quantity of total dissolved solids tds a term also regulated by governments i e ansi apsp 11 2009 in usa tds increment 1500 mg l cj t 244 2016 in china tds increment 1000 mg l regarding biodegradation earlier studies mostly targeted to removal of urea from municipal wastewater gupta and sharma 1996 because spw has markedly different water qualities from wastewater especially the presence of residual disinfectant the results of urea control in wastewater cannot be readily translated to spw therefore pyrolysis chlorine oxidation electrochemical oxidation and biodegradation all appear impracticable or inefficient for spw treatment recently some studies have demonstrated the potential of ultraviolet uv and uv derived technologies in disinfecting and degrading dbps in water hansen et al 2013 who 2006 zare afifi and blatchley 2016 suggesting that uv technology is a robust tool for micropollutant control however uv generated by medium and low pressure mercury lamps could not degrade urea rapidly zare afifi and blatchley 2016 suggesting uv alone is not cost effective in treating urea furthermore uv emitted by a 1200 w mercury vapor lamp combined with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 or persulfate uv s2o8 2 transformed 75 or 97 respectively of urea in distilled water within 24 h bronk et al 2000 thereby showing the potential of a combined use of uv and additives however these results were not verified in real spw meanwhile vacuum uv vuv irradiation is more robust than uv in degrading organic compounds kim and tanaka 2009 a vuv lamp with 3 energy emitting a 185 nm light can convert 95 100 of urea urea 0 50 mg l into nitrate no3 when vuv was combined with potassium persulfate k2s2o8 4 g l roig et al 1999 hence a comparison of uv vuv and many other uv or vuv based technologies e g vuv h2o2 vuv s2o8 2 may merit further attention and in depth exploration hence this study carried out a series of experiments to understand the potentials of different uv and vuv based technologies for urea mitigation under typical spw conditions these results are intended to 1 compare the efficiencies of uv alone uv h2o2 uv k2s2o8 uv coupled with sodium sulfite uv na2so3 vuv vuv h2o2 and vuv k2s2o8 in removing urea from ultrapure water upw 2 evaluate the impacts of typical and common water components such as ph chloride cl no3 bicarbonate hco3 sulfate so4 2 and dom on urea degradation performances by vuv and 3 identify to the maximum extent possible reaction mechanisms pathways and products of the vuv irradiation process in order to differentiate different lamps and to make the descriptions concise we herein define the experiments using the lamp with both 254 and 185 nm lights as vuv while using the lamp with 254 nm light only as uv in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and chemicals all chemicals and reagents used herein are of analytical grade and were purchased from sigma aldrich and aladdin inc the stock solutions of urea h2o2 and k2s2o8 were prepared with upw generated by a millipore water generator direct q3 millipore france the real spw samples were collected from a large public indoor swimming pool nearby the laboratory 1 5 km between 3 and 4 p m and the pool was disinfected with a typical disinfectant c3o3n3cl3 the ph tds and free chlorine of real samples were analyzed immediately after delivery to the laboratory the concentrations of urea non purgeable organic carbon npoc cl no3 and so4 2 were measured within 24 h after sampling the concentrations of urea ranged from 1 50 to 3 86 mg l in collected spw to allow experimental consistency and comparison among tests the urea 0 of all samples was adjusted to 5 mg l that is additional urea was added to spw to achieve an initial urea concentration of 5 mg l for all tests 2 2 analytical methods urea was determined colorimetrically using diacetyl monoxime according to a chinese standard analytical method gb t 18204 2 china with a method detection limit mdl of 0 1 mg l the method is based on the principle that a colored compound with a characteristic wavelength of 460 nm was formed after reaction of urea with diacetyl monoxime and antipyrine at 100 c in the presence of sulfuric and acetic acids the absorbance of the colored solution was measured with a spectrophotometer ta 98 shenzhen sinsche technology co ltd china because residual oxidants such as h2o2 and k2s2o8 can significantly interfere with the accuracy of urea measurement fig s1 na2so3 was spiked into target solutions after uv or vuv irradiation to remove remaining oxidants then sulfuric acid was added to the samples to reduce ph to 1 5 while the samples were bubbled with air to eliminate excessive na2so3 before urea determination via these efforts the accuracies of the urea measurement for samples with 5 mm of h2o2 were improved to 91 of samples without h2o2 fig s2a meaning that the influences of h2o2 on the urea measurement were eliminated however k2s2o8 is unreactive with na2so3 at room temperature therefore the interference of k2s2o8 on urea detection appeared non eliminable fig s2b in this context accurate urea detection can be achieved only with a k2s2o8 concentration of 0 1 mm this means that either the initial dosage of k2s2o8 should be 0 1 mm or it should be largely consumed by uv irradiation prior to urea measurement in this context this study evaluated only the impacts of k2s2o8 with a concentration of 0 1 mm on urea degradation fig s1b typical anions in water such as cl nitrite no2 no3 and so4 2 were analyzed by an ion chromatographer cic di120 qingdao shenghan chromatography technology co ltd china equipped with an anion exchange column shenghan sh ac 5 250 mm 4 6 mm and a conductivity detector the mobile phase was made of 20 mm potassium hydroxide koh and run at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min the mdls of these anions were 0 01 mg l h2o2 and formic acid were measured by another ion chromatographer ic 2010 tosoh inc japan equipped with not only a conductivity detector but also a uv detector spd 20a shimadzu japan which gives mdls of them as 0 01 mg l its mobile eluent was made of 20 mm koh solution and ran at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min according to an established method song et al 2017 nh4 and free chlorines were detected by a spectrophotometer using nessler s reagent colorimetric method no 8038 and dpd colorimetric method no 8021 as provided by hach co usa with their mdls as 0 02 mg n l and 0 02 mg cl2 l tds of water was determined by an electrical conductivity meter sx 713 02 shanghai san xin instrumentation inc china with a mdl of 0 1 mg l formaldehyde was detected by a gas chromatographer with an electron capture detector gc 9720 zhejiang fuli analytical instrument co ltd china according to epa method 556 with a mdl of 1 μg l npoc and total organic carbon toc in water were determined by a toc analyzer toc lcph shimadzu japan with a mdl of 0 1 mg c l the amount of toc was calculated by subtracting inorganic carbon from total carbon while npoc was measured directly after a sample acidic stripping process the ph was determined by a ph monitor phs 3e shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china for quality assurance and control the allowable relative standard deviations rsds of measured parameters were set as 10 in case it was exceeded more tests were carried out 2 3 reactor and experimental conditions the experiments were carried out in two parallel stainless column shaped sterilizers with a water thickness of 1 4 cm and a volume of 400 ml fig s3 for vuv tests a low pressure mercury lamp emitting both 254 nm and 185 nm lights 12w gph265t5vh uv tec co ltd china was placed in the middle of the reactor and the lamp was shielded by a quartz sleeve the irradiation intensity of vuv 185 nm was estimated to be 0 32 0 1 mw cm 2 according to an actinometrical method yang et al 2018b for uv tests a low pressure mercury lamp with identical power inputs 12w as vuv but emitting uv at 254 nm only gph265t5l uv tec co ltd china was used using h2o2 as the actinometer the irradiation intensity of the uv254 lamp was estimated to be 14 3 0 6 mw cm 2 aliquots were retrieved at designated time intervals blank control and duplicate experiments were conducted in all tests during experiments the initial dosages of h2o2 and na2so3 were both 1 mm while that of k2s2o8 was 0 1 mm in addition as shown in fig s4b given that h2o2 can be rapidly consumed by uv and vuv an additional 1 mm of h2o2 was added every h to supplement its loss regarding na2so3 to prevent oxygen o2 from disturbing uv na2so3 performance the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in water was adjusted to 1 7 mg l by bubbling nitrogen n2 into the water before the experiment and then do was maintained during experiments by blowing n2 on the water surface 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparison of methods of urea removal fig 1 demonstrates the removals of urea in upw by seven uv based methods in general the orders of their efficiency were ranked as vuv k2s2o8 uv k2s2o8 vuv vuv h2o2 uv h2o2 uv uv na2so3 under the experimental conditions of this study specifically uv alone removed little urea 0 7 within 3 h meaning that direct photolysis with 254 nm can hardly degrade urea which is consistent with the results reported in an earlier study zare afifi and blatchley 2016 similarly uv na2so3 as a typical advanced reduction process reduced urea by 8 0 within 3 h meaning that urea was not susceptible to reductive radicals such as hydrogen atom h hydrated electron e aq or sulfite radical so3 formed in uv na2so3 eq 1 and eq 2 although they degraded other compounds well vellanki et al 2013 in literature the rate constant of reaction between urea and h was 3 0 104 m 1s 1 schuler et al 1971 smaller than that between urea and e aq 3 0 105 m 1s 1 hart et al 1967 uv h2o2 decreased 12 8 of urea within the same time suggesting that hydroxyl radical ho generated by uv h2o2 eq 5 was weak in removing urea too in literature the rate constant of reaction between urea and ho was 7 9 105 m 1s 1 minemura et al 1980 slightly greater than those reductive radicals previously another uv h2o2 study reported much higher urea removal 75 than this study probably because it had a much higher power input 1200w a lower water volume photolyzed 20 ml a longer irradiation time 24 h and a higher dosage of h2o2 6 5 mm bronk et al 2000 than this study which featured 12w 400 ml 3 h and 3 0 mm at most in contrast uv k2s2o8 exhibited more rapid and higher urea removal 67 8 within 1 h than other uv based methods although k2s2o8 was dosed only once at 0 1 mm level in the beginning this phenomenon might partially be attributed to the strong oxidation ability of sulfate radical so4 as generated by uv k2s2o8 eq 7 moussavi et al 2014 and partially to the selective susceptibility of urea once k2s2o8 was used up i e after 1 h no further urea degradation was observed further indicating that so4 played the key role in urea degradation this finding tends to support another study that so4 e 0 so4 so42 2 5 3 1 v was stronger than ho e 0 ho h2o 1 9 2 7 v in transforming compounds with an amide group conh2 li et al 2017 1 so 3 2 uv e aq

1 7 s 2 o 8 2 uv 2so 4 compared to the uv based processes vuv and vuv based methods appeared to be more robust and efficient the removal of urea in 3 h by vuv reached 71 7 much higher than uv the dramatic difference in urea removal between uv and vuv indicates that the removal of urea was mostly attributed to 185 nm light meanwhile this finding confirms that compounds with amide group such as carbamazepine and tetracycline were more susceptible to vuv zoschke et al 2014 additionally spiking k2s2o8 at the 0 1 mm level promoted the removal of urea 95 8 suggesting that both so4 and 185 nm light had contributed to urea degradation however the removal of urea by vuv h2o2 51 2 was surprisingly lower than that by vuv the addition of h2o2 at this level 1 mm each h for 3 h was somehow detrimental to urea photodegradation the reason of this adverse effect is likely attributed to light screening or radical competition or both since h2o2 is not only a ho precursor but also a ho scavenger with very rapid reaction rate constant 2 7 107 m 1s 1 eq 8 buxton et al 1988 as shown in eq 9 and eq 10 the rate of reaction between ho and h2o2 2 7 104 ho s 1 is greater than rate of reaction between urea and ho 66 ho s 1 the inhibition of urea degradation by h2o2 was most likely due to scavenging of ho based on the water molar absorption coefficient at 185 nm εh2o 185 nm 1 0 or 1 8 m 1cm 1 duca et al 2017 weeks et al 1963 and the concentration of water 55 m the absorbance of water was calculated to be 55 or 99 cm 1 while the absorbance of h2o2 εh2o2 185 nm 293 341 m 1cm 1 duca et al 2017 weeks et al 1963 at 1 0 mm was only 0 294 0 341 cm 1 at 185 nm therefore most of 185 nm photons were absorbed by water and addition of h2o2 was less likely to compete for 185 nm light 8 h 2

effects of other mechanisms on urea removal we monitored the temperature changes along the photolysis process and evaluated the contributions of thermal hydrolysis and chemical oxidation on urea removal at an elevated temperature as shown in fig s5a the water temperature was increased to 43 c then maintained constant afterward for 3 h during the uv and vuv irradiation processes however the losses of urea were 3 in a 43 c water bather in darkness within 3 h fig s5b thus thermal hydrolysis was excluded as a major contributor to urea removal similarly h2o2 or k2s2o8 alone hardly removed any urea under 43 c in the dark fig s5b proving that chemical oxidations of urea by h2o2 or k2s2o8 were also negligible in terms of reaction mechanisms the homolysis eq 11 and ionization of water eq 12 are known vuv photolysis process gonzalez et al 2004 resulting in formation of a list of radicals such as ho h and e aq based upon the abovementioned results the photodegradation of urea by vuv based methods seems more likely to undergo two processes direct 185 nm photolysis and indirect oxidation by oxidative radicals like ho and so4 11 h 2 o vuv ho h φ ho 0 33 12 h 2 o vuv e aq ho h φ e aq 0 045 3 1 1 comparison of methods on tds increments in addition to urea removal the decision whether to use these methods should consider potential side effects fig s6 shows that the tds increments derived from uv k2s2o8 90 0 mg l and vuv k2s2o8 104 5 mg l were far greater than those of other advanced oxidation process aop methods 26 2 mg l meaning that they cannot be used more than 10 or 15 times in spw treatments to meet the regulatory thresholds in china or usa cj t 244 2016 in china tds increment 1000 mg l ansi apsp 11 2009 in usa tds increment 1500 mg l therefore they should be applied with caution although the tds increments from uv and uv h2o2 were minor they hardly degraded any urea making them inappropriate for use in comparison the tds increments introduced by vuv and vuv h2o2 fell into a lower range 26 2 mg l therefore they showed better applicability not only in alleviating urea but also in causing low tds increment in this context vuv was regarded as a preferred and promising technology for urea control in spw in addition to its capacity in disinfection and photodegradation of micropollutants zoschke et al 2014 3 2 influencing factors 3 2 1 effects of typical dom in real spw c3o3n3cl3 is often used as a disinfectant and its transformation product cyanuric acid c3h3o3n3 usually acts as a stabilizer of free chlorine their reversible reactions are presented below eq 13 c3h3o3n3 combines with free chlorine to form chlorinated isocyanurates c3h 3 x o3n3cl x x 1 2 3 when free chlorine concentration is high while c3h 3 x o3n3cl x can be transformed to free chlorine and c3h3o3n3 when free chlorine concentration is low according to the world health organization who guideline the level of c3h3o3n3 spw should be kept between 50 and 100 mg l and the mcl of cyanuric acid in china is set as 30 mg l for indoor swimming pools and 100 mg l for outdoor swimming pools cj t 244 2016 in addition according to a who survey the cyanuric acid levels were sometimes greater than 100 mg l who 2006 in addition to c3h3o3n3 dom in tap is another source of organic matter in spw therefore we evaluated c3h3o3n3 and a selected humic acid as representative doms to understand their impacts on vuv photolysis 13 c 3 h 3 o 3 n 3 x hclo c 3 h 3 x o 3 n 3 cl x x h 2 o x 1 2 3 fig 2 shows that both c3h3o3n3 and humic acid restrained the photodegradation rates of urea by vuv the inhibitory effect of c3h3o3n3 increased with concentration increases from 25 to 200 mg l because the rate constant of reaction between cyanuric acid and ho k 3 107 m 1s 1 de laat et al 1994 was higher than that of urea with ho k 7 9 105 m 1s 1 and because c3h3o3n3 level was higher than urea 5 mg l c3h3o3n3 essentially acted as a scavenger of ho and inhibited urea degradation in contrast low levels of humic acid 5 0 mg l showed little impact on urea degradation unless the contents of the humic acid became 5 0 mg l previously the impact of humic acid on photolysis appears mixing sometimes dom enhanced the photolysis effect via dom sensitization and radical formation lam et al 2003 lester et al 2013 but sometimes inhibited photodegradation due to its competition for reactive species ngouyap mouamfon et al 2011 this study seemed acknowledge the role of competition instead of facilitation from humic substance in literature the rate constants for reactions between dom isolates and ho ranged at 1 39 2 18 108 m 1s 1 westerhoff et al 2007 much greater than that between urea and ho in addition npoc decreased with elevated dosage of humic acid fig s7 supporting that dom has been degraded in the reaction 3 2 2 effects of typical anions cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 are common anions in tap and spw and based upon a preliminary survey fig s8 shows their mean concentrations as 8 6 mg l for cl 6 6 mg l for no3 and 7 2 mg l for so4 2 in tap and 56 7 mg l for cl 17 7 mg l for no3 and 20 8 mg l for so4 2 in spw therefore we examined their effects at a range of concentrations fig 3 demonstrates that increasing cl and so4 2 promoted the photodegradation of urea which was unexpected because they are both low in 185 nm light absorptivity table 1 weeks et al 1963 to confirm these phenomena we spiked cl intermittently into the irradiated sample at 30 min 3 mg l and 60 min 7 mg l and compared the impacts with a sample without cl dosing and another sample dosed with 10 mg l cl only once at the beginning immediately after spiking time we clearly observed enhancements of urea degradation fig s9a thereby confirming the facilitating role of cl in theory cl might react with ho to form chlorine radical cl within the uv h2o2 process liao et al 2001 yu and barker 2003 therefore the enhanced degradation of urea with increasing cl was likely due to the formation of cl by vuv induced ho similarly we spiked so4 2 intermittently into irradiated sample at 30 min 5 mg l and 60 min 15 mg l and observed similar enhancements of urea degradation fig s9b an earlier study found so4 formation upon the reaction of so4 2 with ho de laat and le 2005 therefore the promotion of urea removal by the addition of so4 2 was likely attributed to ho induced so4 notably since 185 nm light has a very high energy we cannot exclude the possibility that cl and so4 might also be directly formed from the vuv irradiation of cl and so4 2 14 ho cl cloh k 5 3 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 15 cloh h cl h 2 o k 6 2 6 3 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 in contrast to cl and so4 2 no3 and hco3 clearly inhibited the photodegradation of urea from the literature the molar absorption coefficients of no3 and hco3 at 185 nm were 5568 and 269 m 1cm 1 respectively which are greater than that of water 1 or 1 8 m 1cm 1 duca et al 2017 weeks et al 1963 although no3 can sometimes generate ho during photolytical process tugaoen et al 2017 its quantum yields of ho 0 09 at λ 254 nm mack and bolton 1999 were usually too low to be important therefore its prominent effect was to compete for 185 nm light with urea and resulted in lower degradation of urea as for hco3 although it is not a strong 185 nm light absorber it is a known quencher of ho k 8 5 106 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 so it was also reasonable to obtain a decreased urea removal with elevated hco3 3 2 3 effects of chlorine ph do and urea 0 according to spw rules free chlorine must be kept between 0 2 and 1 0 mg l who 2006 fig 4 a indicates that the urea removals were similar for samples dosed with free chlorine from 0 2 to 3 0 mg l the results were unexpected because uv initiated chlorine can yield clo radicals li et al 2017 a reactant likely helpful for urea degradation the urea removal efficiency discrepancy between the clo generated by cl2 and the cl generated by cl may partially be explained by their inner reactivities the concentration difference between cl 10 mg l and chlorine 3 mg l which might not yield sufficient radicals according to spw rules ph must be maintained within a range of 7 2 and 7 8 who 2006 regarding its influence increasing the ph value from 6 8 to 8 5 did not markedly alter the degradation rates of urea fig 4b although hydroxide oh can scavenge ho k 1 3 1010 m 1s 1 rapidly rabani and zehavi 1971 the concentration of oh at neutral ph was too low to play an important role on the light competition and radical scavenging effects as shown in fig 4c with the rising urea 0 from 1 mg l to 10 mg l the rate constants of urea degradation were decreased from 9 95 10 3 min 1 to 4 53 10 3 min 1 but the absolute quantity of urea removed increased from 0 8 mg l to 5 4 mg l in 3 h test this result suggests that a good practice of this technology is perhaps to turn on vuv treatment facility when the urea concentration approaches the mcl of urea e g 3 0 mg l and then turn off it when the urea level was low e g 2 0 mg l in an early exemplary study the degradation of cyanide by vuv was promoted by blowing air into the solution moussavi et al 2016 indicating that do may serve an important role in the photolysis process therefore the effect of do on urea photolysis was examined by blowing n2 or o2 in water fig 4d shows that the urea removal was remarkably decreased at a do of 1 6 0 2 mg l but remained unchanged for samples with a do of 5 or 7 mg l this positive effect is likely due to the formation of peroxyl radicals which has a very important role in the further transformation and mineralization gonzalez et al 2004 in addition the reason is also likely attributed to the presence of e aq which can consume ho rapidly k 3 0 1010 m 1s 1 in the absence of do but can be converted to superoxide anion radical o2 e 0 0 33 ev at a rate of 2 2 1010 m 1s 1 in the presence of do which has lower reactivity and kinetics k 8 0 109 than e aq in reacting with ho buxton et al 1988 gonzalez et al 2004 3 2 4 effects of real water matrix fig 5 presents the effects of real water matrix on the removals of urea in real spw and tap samples the urea removals by vuv were apparently lower in spw and tap than in upw it might be that the enhancement effects derived from cl and so4 2 were lower than the inhibition effects derived from no3 hco3 nom in tap compared to tap spw showed an even larger inhibitory effect because spw used tap as the water source and some substances intentionally added to spw e g c3h3o3n3 and accidently brought in by swimmers e g sweat might act as extra inhibitors for urea photodegradation no matter spw and tap such decreases in urea removal were strongly related to the dilution factors which are reasonable because the concentrations of all compounds in water were decreased by dilution and therefore the overall inhibitions were reduced based upon the kinetics from above results the electrical energies required for one order eeo of contaminant degradation for these methods are summarized in table s1 the eeo for vuv irradiation of urea in upw 168 5 kwh m3 was greater than other micropollutants treated by most of aop processes miklos et al 2018 meaning that urea is a very refractory compound in water all eeos of methods treating real spw were higher than those of upw meaning that more efforts should be made to enhance the efficiency of urea degradation in spw 3 3 reaction products and pathways in terms of reaction products fig 6 a shows that the concentrations of no3 and nh4 continued to increase throughout the vuv irradiation process while the concentration of no2 was almost undetectable the amount of total nitrogen tn remained unchanged implying that no other types of nitrogen containing compounds were substantially formed meanwhile fig s11 shows that vuv was unable to convert nh4 rapidly into no3 within 3 h meaning that the formation of no3 was obtained by direct oxidation of urea instead of indirect oxidation of nh4 regarding carbon containing compounds formaldehyde and formic acid were analyzed but not detected at levels above their mdls 1 μg l and 10 μg l respectively meaning that these two compounds were not the major photolysis products fig 6b shows that npoc toc and urea decreased simultaneously and the rates of npoc and toc reductions were slightly lower than that of urea decrease suggesting that urea was mostly mineralized and slightly converted to volatile nitrogen free organic matter meanwhile the study observed a continuous ph decrease throughout the vuv irradiation process fig s12 after considering all reactants products and influencing factors the following two dominant reaction pathways are proposed for the urea photolysis with vuv one forming nitrate and the other forming ammonia but both yielding carbon dioxide although formation of nh4 increases ph which does not agree with the acidification of solution formation of no3 decreased ph significantly as seen from fig 6a formation of no3 was preferred over formation of nh4 which explains why the solution ph eventually decreased in the photolysis process 16 h 2 nconh 2 4 o 2 vuv co 2 2 no 3 h 2 o 2 h 17 h 2 nconh 2 3 h 2 o vuv co 2 2 nh 4 2 oh 4 conclusions in general this study compared the efficiencies of uv uv h2o2 uv k2s2o8 uv na2so3 vuv vuv h2o2 and vuv k2s2o8 on urea degradations in upw uv k2s2o8 vuv vuv h2o2 and vuv k2s2o8 showed superior capabilities to other uv and vuv based methods although the combinations of k2s2o8 with uv or vuv were more robust than other approaches in removing urea they featured greater risks of increasing tds thus making k2s2o8 less suitable for meeting regulatory requirements in comparison vuv appears to be a more promising alternative due to its robustness in degrading urea without introducing high tds in terms of influencing factors typical components in spw such as c3h3o3n3 humic acid hco3 and no3 inhibited urea degradation in the vuv irradiation process in contrast increasing the so4 2 and cl contents enhanced the urea removal free chlorine at a dosage of 3 mg l and ph at a range of 6 8 8 5 imposed little changes while low urea 0 exhibited higher photodegradation kinetics overall the influences of the real water matrix on the urea removal were negative for the vuv process with an order of upw 83 1 tap 40 0 spw 22 2 the major vuv photolysis products of urea were found to be no3 nh4 h and co2 because the mass balance of total nitrogen was met whereas total carbon decreased vuv photolysis of urea was postulated to mainly undergo oxidative mineralization the information hence demonstrates that vuv is an effective alternative on urea treatment for spw declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18681,identifying vertical and horizontal assemblage drivers of bacterial community is important for improving the efficacies of ecological evaluation and remediation for a huge contaminated river e g black odor urban river however little is known about the effect of stochastic vs deterministic processes on the reliability of the identification processes here a comprehensive analysis was performed to reveal vertical and horizontal assemblage drivers of bacterial community in a heavily polluted urban river total area of 4 23 km2 and total length of 9 3 km considering the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes heterogeneous bacterial community assemblages were observed in both vertical and horizontal profiles and the differences in the bacterial community between depths were relatively significant at genus level the higher values for the simpson dissimilarity index horizontal βsim 0 59 0 02 vertical βsim 0 48 0 03 compared to the nestedness resultant dissimilarity index horizontal βnes 0 05 0 02 vertical βnes 0 05 0 05 showed that species replacement explained both the vertical and horizontal beta diversity patterns comparison of horizontal and vertical sørensen dissimilarity indices further indicated that the biodiversity of vertical community deserved more attention due to the shorter geographical distance with similar beta diversity patterns compared to horizontal assemblages various traditional analysis without consideration for phylogenetic turnover revealed that tn tp nh4 n do orp conductivity and codmn were all the related environmental factors that influenced bacterial community however after taking stochastic vs deterministic processes into account only nh4 n and orp were identified as the main driving forces of trends in the vertical and in the horizontal assembly of bacterial community in the polluted urban river respectively this study is helpful for improving ecological assessment methodology and remediation strategy for contaminated urban rivers graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban polluted river bacterial community vertical assemblage horizontal assemblage phylogenetic turnover 1 introduction in a river ecosystem bacterial community provide a wide variety of ecosystem services azam 1998 azam et al 1994 including organic matter processing and retention hall and meyer 1998 prosser 2012 energy flow findlay 2010 madsen 2011 and nutrient cycling besemer et al 2009 because of their mostly sedentary way of life bacterial community can be significantly affected by past and present environmental conditions and therefore can serve as potential integrative indicators of river health urban rivers represent a unique ecosystem in which pollution occurs regularly altering ecosystem function and services and potentially leading to significant biodiversity losses hooper et al 2005 rockström et al 2009 vitousek et al 1997 due to the importance of bacterial community in river ecosystems river bioremediation projects typically aim to protect the stability and integrity of the river microbial ecosystem henry et al 2002 therefore identifying the drivers of bacterial community succession is vitally important to improve the efficacy of bioremediation for a contaminated river according to the extended serial discontinuity concept river systems are interactive along three spatial dimensions the horizontal vertical and lateral dimensions ward 1995 urban rivers are spatially heterogeneous ecosystems that are mainly influenced by the surrounding terrestrial environment pollution from residential areas containing organic and inorganic matters results in horizontal gradients of physicochemical factors such as ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate no3 dissolved oxygen do and ph which can alter the bacterial community structure esteves et al 2015 read et al 2015 winter et al 2007 many studies have examined the horizontal distribution of river microbial community in surface water sediment and river banks associated with these physicochemical gradients roberto et al 2018 wang et al 2017 compared with natural rivers urban rivers are mostly slow flowing or even in a stagnant state especially in developing countries this is due to the implementation of water resource development processes associated with urbanization such as damming and water intake zhang et al 2014 heavy pollution loading together with insufficient hydrodynamics limit the processes of dispersal dilution and reoxygenation in river resulting in a lowered environmental capacity and poor self purification capacity pan et al 2016 chen et al 2018a b wu et al 2019 when do is consumed by discharged organic pollutants in these slow flowing rivers the bottom of river body develops a deficiency of oxygen diehl 2002 this layer of lowered oxygen leads to the formation of vertical gradients of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon further resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of bacterial community along the vertical direction a trend which was recently confirmed by gao et al 2017 who reported differences of bacterial communities along the vertical and horizontal directions in a eutrophic river receiving domestic wastewater therefore from the perspective of understanding the effects of pollution and determining the most appropriate strategies for the evaluation and remediation of polluted rivers it is necessary to consider both vertical and horizontal patterns of bacterial community beta diversity is the dissimilarity between species and can be used to characterize bacterial community patterns simpson 1943 according to the presence or absence of species the causality of the processes underlying beta diversity is assigned to one of two biological phenomena the first phenomenon is spatial turnover which implies the replacement of some species by others from site to site due to environmental sorting or spatial and historical constraints qian et al 2005 the other phenomenon is nestedness reflecting a non random process of species loss as the consequence of any factor that promotes the disaggregation of assemblages wright and reeves 1992 from the perspective of phylogenetic turnover within a bacterial community two types of ecological processes deterministic and stochastic stegen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 can be used to describe the assembly of a bacterial community deterministic processes comprise ecological selection imposed by abiotic and biotic factors which influence organismal fitness and thereby determine the composition and relative abundance of species chesson 2000 fargione et al 2003 stochastic processes in contrast involve random birth death and dispersal events causing patterns of species composition that are indistinguishable from those produced by random chance alone chave 2004 hubbell 2001 although both deterministic and stochastic processes act concurrently to regulate the assembly of ecological communities dini andreote et al 2015 langenheder and szekely 2011 deterministic factors could be directly manipulated to adjust bacterial succession however how to identify the environmental factors that govern deterministic processes remains a fundamental challenge an analytical framework based on the phylogenetic null model deviation the quantitative estimate of which is the β nearest taxon index βnti originally proposed by stegen et al 2013 was used to quantify phylogenetic turnover of bacterial community and to further identify deterministic or stochastic processes during bacterial succession the βnti metric can provide deep insights into the potential role of the resource environment since variation in the magnitude of βnti is driven primarily by variation in the selective environment and to a much lesser extent by organismal dispersal stegen et al 2016 most recently the framework based on βnti as a key indicator has been applied to identify the main driving force of bacterial phylogenetic assembly for example βnti values derived from pairwise comparisons were regressed against euclidean distance matrices of soil ph and the results showed that ph mediates the balance between stochastic and deterministic assembly of bacterial community stegen et al 2016 tripathi et al 2018 therefore the analytical framework maybe allow investigation of which environmental factors are the primary drivers influencing vertical and horizontal assemblages of a bacterial community in a polluted urban river however no study has yet reported application of this approach in a river therefore the aim of this study was to answer the following questions i what are vertical and horizontal distribution patterns of bacterial community in a heavily polluted urban river ii how do vertical and horizontal bacterial community assemble in the heavily polluted urban river iii what are dominant environmental factors governing vertical and horizontal assemblage of bacterial community in the heavily polluted urban river to address these questions next generation 16s rrna gene sequencing combined with various multivariate statistical methods was applied to analyse spatial both vertical and horizontal bacterial diversity both in overlying waters and sediments in a heavily polluted urban river and to explore the impact of environmental variation on the distribution patterns of communities the results from this study can help to identify the main environmental drivers and provide important support for improving ecological evaluation and remediation for a contaminated river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sample collection jinchuan river a heavily polluted urban river with total area of 4 23 km2 and total length of 9 3 km in nanjing was selected as the study area water and sediment samples of jinchuan river were collected in october 2017 when it just defined as a black odor river by the government and our previous study cai et al 2019 four sampling sites were set up along the river positioned 1 5 2 km apart from each other fig 1 three depth points were set in river water including the surface 0 1 m below the water surface middle 3 m below the water surface and bottom 0 05 m above the sediment each with sampling in triplicate water samples at the same points were collected and mixed in 4 l polyethylene bottles triplicate sediment cores were also obtained from each site using perspex tubes inner diameter 9 cm length 60 cm and a gravity corer uwitec mondsee austria immediately after retrieval the core samples were sectioned into layers using a slicing disc and 3 layers 0 5 cm 15 20 cm and 30 35 cm of each core were used for subsequent analysis after collection 2 0 l water samples were filtered through whatman gf f filters 0 22 μm pore size stored at 4 c without freezing and tested within 4 h of collection the sediment samples and filters of water samples were stored at 80 c until dna extraction 2 2 monitoring of environmental parameters environmental parameters of river water including temperature t ph conductivity cond oxidation reduction potential orp and the concentration of do were measured in situ by using a water quality checker u 10 horiba compared with biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod was selected as the parameter to quantify the organic matters in the black odor river since it is less restrictive chen et al 2018a b wu et al 2019 therefore total nitrogen tn nh4 n total phosphorus tp and codmn permanganate index of water samples were measured from the filtered water samples by methods as described in our previous study cai et al 2016 three replicates were performed for all parameters tested the ph of the sediment was measured with specific electrodes rex phb 5 inesa scientific instrument co ltd china sediment samples were dried with a laboratory freeze dryer alpha 1 2 ld martin christ instrument co germany tn tp nh4 n water content loss on ignition loi and orp of sediment samples were analyzed using standard methods as described by wu wu et al 2017 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing analysis the total dna from the water and sediment of each sample was extracted with an ezna kit omega bio tek inc usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and examined with 3 μl in 1 agarose gels by electrophoresis the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified from dna extracted using primer pairs f515 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and r806 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat directed against bacteria pcr was performed in triplicate 20 μl reactions each 20 μl pcr mixture contained 4 μl 5 fastpfu buffer 2 μl 2 5 mm dntps 0 4 μl of each primer 5 μm 0 8 μl of dna template and 0 4 μl of fastpfu polymerase the pcr protocol was 95 c for 5 min 30 cycles at 94 c for 30 s denaturation 56 c for 30 s annealing 72 c for 30 s extension and a final extension of 72 c for 10 min after pcr amplification the dna samples were then stored at 10 c and sent to hangzhou guheinfo company for illumina miseq sequencing the number of average sequences per sample was 105778 after quality checking using the mothur software the sequences were trimmed and aligned using the silva reference alignment database marti and luis balcazar 2014 the 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on a 97 similarity cut off representative sequences were defined with a commonly applied sequence and used for phylogenetic analyses the sequences were deposited in the ncbi short read archive under the accession number srp134677 for bacteria in water samples and srp134708 for bacteria in sediment samples respectively 2 4 statistical analysis the species diversity richness and coverage were calculated using spss 19 0 software functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax analysis was used to predict functional characteristics of bacterial populations between different samples louca et al 2016 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was performed to determine the unifrac distance of the bacterial community data of four different sites at three water depths and three sediment depths analysis of similarity anosim was used to test the significance of differences between sample groups based on weighted unifrac distance matrices clark 1993 the relationships between bacterial community structure and environmental factors were evaluated by canonical correspondence analysis cca in canoco version 5 0 via monte carlo permutation testing with 999 permutations a multivariate regression tree mrt analysis a constrained clustering method was performed using the mvpart package with default parameters to relate the relative abundance of lineages to the site characteristics glenn 2002 maximal information coefficient mic analysis was performed to identify possible associations between individual otus or taxa and environmental parameters reshef et al 2011 multiple site dissimilarities as proposed by baselga see supplementary material including the sørensen dissimilarity index βsor the simpson dissimilarity index βsim and the nestedness resultant dissimilarity index βnes were used to characterize the causality of the processes underlying the observed vertical and horizontal bacterial community patterns the dissimilarity indices of bacterial communities were calculated in r using the function beta multi r baselga 2010 the pairwise phylogenetic turnover between bacterial communities was calculated as the mean nearest taxon distance metric βmntd stegen et al 2012 furthermore the βnti value which is the difference between the observed βmntd and the mean of the null distribution of βmntd normalized by its standard deviation was calculated according to stegen s community assembly method using the r language stegen et al 2013 the ecological processes of drift selection and dispersal were further quantified by the framework proposed by stegen et al 2013 more specifically the percentage of pairwise βnti values that fell above 2 and below 2 indicated that observed turnover between a pair of communities is governed by variable and homogeneous selection respectively then rcbray was quantified for pairwise community comparisons that were not governed by selection βnti 2 bray curtis dissimilarity was used to quantify compositional turnover thereby generating a null distribution of bray curtis values chase et al 2011 the metric of deviation between empirically observed bray curtis was referred as rcbray the relative contribution of dispersal limitation was estimated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 whereas that of homogenizing dispersal was estimated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 the fraction of all pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 estimates the influence of drift acting alone afterwards all possible pairwise comparisons of βnti values within different samples were conducted to fully evaluate the variation in community assembly processes along vertical and horizontal gradients of relevant environmental factors the βnti values as derived from pairwise comparisons were regressed against euclidean distance matrices of the selected environmental factors the statistical significance of the resulting comparisons was determined by mantel tests with 999 permutations 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of water and sediment samples the physicochemical characteristics of the water and sediment samples were shown in table s1 and table s2 respectively from the surface water to the bottom water the concentration of tn nh4 n and tp trended to decrease the do concentrations were also found to decrease with water depth except at site c where the river area had formed an obvious anaerobic environment from the surface to the deep layer moreover it was found that there was a decrease of orp values with increased sediment depth across all four sites suggesting changes in the oxidation reduction reactions with the sediment depth gradient do and nutrient concentrations are generally considered as important parameters indicating the health status of river system in this study the do and nutrient concentrations were found to be heterogeneous in both vertical and horizontal profiles confirming the need to study both vertical and horizontal dimensions of a river system significant higher concentrations of tn 3343 01 mg kg on average tp 1474 15 mg kg and nh4 n 163 52 mg kg were observed in sediment samples compared to water samples the concentrations of tn and tp in water were found to be positively correlated with those in the sediment the results indicated that there was a dynamic equilibrium between sediment and the overlying water as a whole system which was also confirmed by previous study wang et al 2014 moreover it is interesting to notice that the percentage of nh4 n concentration as part of the tn concentration in the sediment samples 5 6 0 3 on average was much lower than that in the water samples 47 9 0 3 on average fig s1 this suggested that the biogeochemistry of sediment was different from that of water the differences of water and sediment characteristics such as pressure density and fluidity are generally accepted to be responsible for the heterogeneous biogeochemistry roberto et al 2018 and the succession in microbial community is usually considered as the drive of biogeochemistry liu et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to study the distribution and assemblage of bacterial community along the vertical direction of river 3 2 composition and spatial patterns of bacterial communities in total 30 bacterial phyla were observed in 24 samples the most dominant phylum was proteobacteria which included 53 23 of the total number of bacterial sequences fig s2 the average relative abundance of observed bacterial communities in water samples was 50 32 almost as much as the average abundance 49 68 in the sediment samples the differences in the bacterial community between depths were more significant when observed at genus level as shown in the heatmap fig 2 as expected the water and sediment parts of the polluted river differed significantly in the bacterial community structure at the genus level in water samples genera acinetobacter 5 14 showed high relative abundance whereas in sediment samples genera dechloromonas 1 32 was present at high proportions there was higher richness of bacterial genera in sediment samples compared to that in water samples although the average relative abundance of bacteria in sediment samples was lower than that of corresponding bacteria in water samples in addition water in the river was characterized by genera comprised of bacteria including acinetobacter 5 14 and novosphingobium 2 38 which have the potential to degrade aromatic compounds such as phenol aniline nitrobenzene and phenanthrene some pathogenic bacteria like arcobacter 4 43 were also present at high abundances in water the differences in the functions of bacterial communities between water and sediment samples could be observed by farotax analysis fig s4 it was found that functional groups of nitrification was present high proportions in sediment samples but nearly not found in water samples whereas human pathogens and functional groups of aromatic compound degradation were more abundant in water samples than those in sediment samples in agreement with the composition analysis of bacterial genera as mentioned above the bacterial community also differed at different sites along the river the dominant bacteria other than the common genera acinetobacter suddenly changed from arcobacter at the upstream sites site c and site d to novosphingobium at downstream sites site a and site b positioned to be possibly affected by anthropogenic activities however apart from a small distinction in the relative abundance of some genera the differences among the four sampling sites were not obvious according to the heatmap plot analysis the alpha diversity values of bacterial communities were determined and are shown in table s3 overall the coverage values ranged from 98 to 100 across samples indicating that sequences generated from these samples represented most of the bacterial community in the studied sites the average number of observed bacterial species 8410 1487 shannon 9 64 0 60 and simpson 0 99 0 01 indices in sediment samples all showed higher values than those in water samples observed bacterial species 5470 1153 shannon indices 6 94 0 80 simpson indices 0 97 0 01 however there were no significant regular gradient of change in the shannon and simpson indices between different water depths or different sites to reveal the vertical and horizontal patterns of bacterial community samples were pooled by depth and by site for dissimilarity analysis between groups the nmds plots showed marked differences of bacterial community structure with a clear separation of water samples from sediment samples fig 3 a anosim was next performed and further confirmed that the bacterial communities in the water were significantly different from those in the sediment r 0 933 p 0 001 according to nmds analysis bacterial community structures at the same site in water or sediment both showed a tendency to cluster fig 3b however anosim showed few differences in bacterial community structures at different sites moving from upstream to downstream r 0 01127 p 0 386 comparing the similarity among groups pooled by depth nmds plots revealed more similar structures for bacterial communities at all depths for both water and sediment with no depth related differences for the four sampling sites meanwhile no significant differences were detected by anosim among either the three water depths or the three sediment depths in water r 0 1481 p 0 941 in sediment r 0 03472 p 0 521 the analysis of dissimilarity revealed a clear spatial pattern in the β diversity of bacterial communities the differences between sediment and water the differences among four sites the differences among different depths in water or sediment similar results were also found in previous study focusing on vertical and horizontal distribution of bacterial communities in overlying water of a eutrophic river where bacterial communities were significantly different in horizontal but showed no significantly depth related differences gao et al 2017 this is also an explanation for why the vertical distribution of microbial communities in river was not well reported in previous studies however the vertical difference does exist and understanding the vertical assemblage of microbial communities is important for improving the efficacies of ecological evaluation and remediation for the heavily polluted rivers gao et al 2017 boeer et al 2009 3 3 causality of the processes underlying biodiversity to address this issue further we next examined the causality of the different processes underlying biodiversity by assigning the distinct beta diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena the dissimilarity indices of bacterial community grouped by different depths and different sampling sites were calculated and the results are shown in table s4 and table s5 the estimated beta diversity βsor value of bacterial community among different sites was 0 64 sd 0 03 with a strong contribution of spatial turnover βsim 0 59 0 02 and a small contribution of nestedness βnes 0 05 0 02 similarly the βsor of bacterial community among depth related groups was 0 53 sd 0 05 with a strong contribution of spatial turnover βsim 0 48 0 03 and a small contribution of nestedness βnes 0 05 0 05 this suggested that both spatial turnover and nestedness contributed to the construction of horizontal and vertical bacterial community structure whereas beta diversity patterns in rivers mainly resulted from species replacement rather than species loss to compare the beta diversity patterns of vertical and horizontal assemblages β values of horizontal assemblages were computed using a resampling procedure taking 100 random samples of 3 inventories and computing the average β to make comparable dissimilarities computed for sets with different number of sites 4 vs 3 the results of this resampling are shown in table s6 the comparison of the calculated dissimilarity indices between horizontal and vertical bacterial community structure showed higher βsim and βnes values in the horizontal assemblages β sim 0 54 0 02 β nes 0 05 0 02 than those in the vertical assemblages βsim 0 48 0 03 βnes 0 05 0 05 the estimated overall beta diversity was very similar for vertical groups βsor 0 53 0 05 and horizontal groups β sor 0 59 0 03 partitioning of this overall beta diversity into its turnover and nestedness components revealed that the spatial turnover made a larger contribution to horizontal bacterial community structures than to vertical bacterial community structures while nestedness was of almost equal importance for the vertical and horizontal groups it is generally accepted that there were significant distance decay relationships for river bacterial community composition at geographical distance liu et al 2018 chen et al 2018a b for example correlation between the bacterial community similarity matrix and mean dendritic distance suggested that dissimilarities between bacterial community increases with the increasing geographical distance along the yangtze river liu et al 2018 in this study the distance between different sites was much longer than that between sampling layers with estimated values of beta diversity in vertical and horizontal that were almost equal this suggests that biodiversity of vertical community may also deserve attention the results revealed spatial turnover as the largest contributor to beta diversity in both vertical and horizontal groups reflecting the high proportion of endemics present in different sampling points similar conclusion was obtained in a case study on beta diversity patterns of european longhorn beetles baselga 2008 differentiation between spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial to improve our understanding of central biogeographic ecological and conservation issues and to design appropriate bioremediation strategies baselga 2010 by considering phylogenetic turnover within a bacterial community the relative contribution of ecological processes including selection dispersal and drift for the community assemblage was further determined table s7 homogenizing dispersal dominated phylogenetic turnover of bacterial community contributing 51 5 and 34 8 of the total processes in water and sediment respectively selection processes including variable selection and homogeneous selection were stronger in water 45 5 than in sediment 39 4 whereas drift was the opposite 3 4 identifying environmental drivers controlling deterministic selection cca was performed to elucidate the relationship between geochemical factors and bacterial community structures based on the forward selection process and variance inflation factors ph tp tn and conductivity were selected as factors explaining the bacterial community variation in water samples fig 4 a and tn tp and nh4 n were selected for bacterial community variation in sediment samples fig 4b the selected geochemical factors could explain 75 57 and 52 39 of the total variation respectively the analysis revealed distinct dominant factors determining the bacterial community distributions in different environmental media although according to the cca plots the concentrations of tn and tp were strong predictors for bacterial community distributions in both water and sediment physical factors like conductivity and orp had higher influence on bacterial community in water samples than on sediment samples whereas nh4 n was more important for the distributions of bacterial community in sediment samples rather than those in water samples an mrt analysis was also applied as another approach to determine the influence of environmental variables on the bacterial community structures fig 4 c d the mrt constructed from data for bacteria from water samples exhibited two splits and three leaves the 12 samples were clustered into two groups by do and the group with do concentrations greater than 0 675 mg l was spilt by tp the mrt constructed from data for bacteria from sediment samples also exhibited two splits and three leaves the 12 samples were firstly clustered into two groups by tn concentrations and the group with tn concentrations lower than 4140 mg kg was spilt by tp concentration the contributions of other physicochemical parameters were too small to be recognized in the mrt analysis mic analysis which is able to detect many kinds of correlations not only unimodal was also used to identify possible associations between individual otus or taxa and environmental parameters an association was considered significant when false discovery rate fdr less than 1 and mic larger than 0 9 in our study the matrix of mic values larger than 0 9 was visualized as the network of association fig s5 combined with the results from cca and mrt analysis tn tp nh4 n orp do ph cond and codmn were finally selected as potential drivers for further identification we next examined the relationship between βnti and the potential drivers in both the vertical and horizontal direction to infer different influences of ecology processes along the vertical and horizontal changes in potential drivers nh4 n concentration was more strongly associated with the βnti value than other environmental variations between the different layers of river water whereas orp was more related to the βnti value than other environmental changes in sediment along the four sites as shown in fig 5 the βnti distribution progressively shifted with increasing difference in nh4 n concentration from primarily consistent with homogeneous selection βnti 2 to consistent with stochastic community assembly 2 βnti 2 in water samples of vertical direction and with increasing difference in orp from primarily consistent with variable selection βnti 2 to consistent with stochastic community assembly 2 βnti 2 in sediment samples of horizontal direction 3 5 implications for evaluation and remediation of a contaminated river bacterial community can serve as potential integrative indicators of river health traditional methods determining environmental drivers such as cca and mrt are carried out only based on raw data with otu abundant profile and physicochemical factors the explanation degree for the otu abundant variation induced by physicochemical factors and the relatively optimal predictors could be finally determined therefore the predictors identified from cca or mrt could be considered as apparent drivers for the bacterial community assembly however it is generally believed that the assembly of bacterial community is a combination influence of stochastic and deterministic processes dini andreote et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the βnti metric introduced in this study is the phylogenetic null model deviation which is used to quantify phylogenetic turnover of bacterial community and the relative influence of stochastic and deterministic processes deterministic drivers of bacterial community determined through the analysis of correlation between βnti and gradients of physicochemical factors could provide more accurate information for the evaluation and remediation of a contaminated river moreover nh4 n was identified as the main driver of bacterial community composition and diversity in the heavily polluted urban river which is also defined as a black odor river it is consistent with the characteristic indicators of urban black odor water pollution classification proposed in the guide for remediation of urban black odorous water bodies promulgated by ministry of housing and urban rural development mohurd of the people s republic of china in september 11 2015 according to the guide the sampling point for the monitoring nh4 n is generally set every 200 600 m along the river and be set at 0 5 m below the water surface or at half the depth of river water when the water depth less than 0 5 m in this study nh4 n was identified as the main driver mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic assembly of vertical bacterial community in the overlying water as shown in fig 5b the value of βnti increases with the increased difference in nh4 n between two sampling points suggesting the increasing dissimilarity between vertical bacterial communities according to the linear relationship deterministic processes were found to dominate microbial community assemblage in the investigated polluted river when the difference in nh4 n between two sampling points exceeded 0 262 obviously for a black odor river the difference in bacterial community along the vertical direction should be as small as possible the smaller dissimilarity between vertical microbial communities is the more difficult for stratification is therefore it is suggested that the difference in nh4 n between different water layers should be taken into account for ecological evaluation in black odorous water bodies this may provide new insight into the improvement of the sampling strategy more sampling points should be added in the vertical direction of the polluted river from the perspective of river management the obtained results could provide useful information for improving the efficacies of ecological evaluation and remediation for a contaminated river e g black odor urban river 4 conclusions in summary our study revealed heterogeneous physicochemical characteristics in a polluted river in both vertical and horizontal profiles under the influence of physicochemical characteristics specific vertical and horizontal bacterial assemblage patterns were established in a polluted urban river bacterial community composition and structure were most different between the overlying water and the sediment this difference was relatively small for vertical stratification in the same medium from the perspective of microbial community ecology the beta diversity patterns in rivers mainly resulted from spatial turnover implying the replacement of some species by others as a consequence of environmental sorting or spatial constraints the comparison of dissimilarity indices between horizontal and vertical bacterial community structures showed obvious biodiversity of vertical community that deserves attention considering stochastic vs deterministic processes nh4 n and orp were identified based on phylogenetic null model deviation as the main drivers to determine vertical and horizontal bacterial community assemblages in the heavily polluted urban river respectively our study offers important insight into the improvement of the sampling strategy for the evaluation of heavily polluted rivers e g black odor urban rivers due to the limitation of the case study the effects of spatio temporal changes on the obtained conclusions were not taken into full consideration however the established comprehensive approach for determining the vertical and horizontal assemblage drivers of bacterial community could be applied to other urban river systems and the obtained results could provide theoretical guidance to

18681,identifying vertical and horizontal assemblage drivers of bacterial community is important for improving the efficacies of ecological evaluation and remediation for a huge contaminated river e g black odor urban river however little is known about the effect of stochastic vs deterministic processes on the reliability of the identification processes here a comprehensive analysis was performed to reveal vertical and horizontal assemblage drivers of bacterial community in a heavily polluted urban river total area of 4 23 km2 and total length of 9 3 km considering the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes heterogeneous bacterial community assemblages were observed in both vertical and horizontal profiles and the differences in the bacterial community between depths were relatively significant at genus level the higher values for the simpson dissimilarity index horizontal βsim 0 59 0 02 vertical βsim 0 48 0 03 compared to the nestedness resultant dissimilarity index horizontal βnes 0 05 0 02 vertical βnes 0 05 0 05 showed that species replacement explained both the vertical and horizontal beta diversity patterns comparison of horizontal and vertical sørensen dissimilarity indices further indicated that the biodiversity of vertical community deserved more attention due to the shorter geographical distance with similar beta diversity patterns compared to horizontal assemblages various traditional analysis without consideration for phylogenetic turnover revealed that tn tp nh4 n do orp conductivity and codmn were all the related environmental factors that influenced bacterial community however after taking stochastic vs deterministic processes into account only nh4 n and orp were identified as the main driving forces of trends in the vertical and in the horizontal assembly of bacterial community in the polluted urban river respectively this study is helpful for improving ecological assessment methodology and remediation strategy for contaminated urban rivers graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban polluted river bacterial community vertical assemblage horizontal assemblage phylogenetic turnover 1 introduction in a river ecosystem bacterial community provide a wide variety of ecosystem services azam 1998 azam et al 1994 including organic matter processing and retention hall and meyer 1998 prosser 2012 energy flow findlay 2010 madsen 2011 and nutrient cycling besemer et al 2009 because of their mostly sedentary way of life bacterial community can be significantly affected by past and present environmental conditions and therefore can serve as potential integrative indicators of river health urban rivers represent a unique ecosystem in which pollution occurs regularly altering ecosystem function and services and potentially leading to significant biodiversity losses hooper et al 2005 rockström et al 2009 vitousek et al 1997 due to the importance of bacterial community in river ecosystems river bioremediation projects typically aim to protect the stability and integrity of the river microbial ecosystem henry et al 2002 therefore identifying the drivers of bacterial community succession is vitally important to improve the efficacy of bioremediation for a contaminated river according to the extended serial discontinuity concept river systems are interactive along three spatial dimensions the horizontal vertical and lateral dimensions ward 1995 urban rivers are spatially heterogeneous ecosystems that are mainly influenced by the surrounding terrestrial environment pollution from residential areas containing organic and inorganic matters results in horizontal gradients of physicochemical factors such as ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate no3 dissolved oxygen do and ph which can alter the bacterial community structure esteves et al 2015 read et al 2015 winter et al 2007 many studies have examined the horizontal distribution of river microbial community in surface water sediment and river banks associated with these physicochemical gradients roberto et al 2018 wang et al 2017 compared with natural rivers urban rivers are mostly slow flowing or even in a stagnant state especially in developing countries this is due to the implementation of water resource development processes associated with urbanization such as damming and water intake zhang et al 2014 heavy pollution loading together with insufficient hydrodynamics limit the processes of dispersal dilution and reoxygenation in river resulting in a lowered environmental capacity and poor self purification capacity pan et al 2016 chen et al 2018a b wu et al 2019 when do is consumed by discharged organic pollutants in these slow flowing rivers the bottom of river body develops a deficiency of oxygen diehl 2002 this layer of lowered oxygen leads to the formation of vertical gradients of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon further resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of bacterial community along the vertical direction a trend which was recently confirmed by gao et al 2017 who reported differences of bacterial communities along the vertical and horizontal directions in a eutrophic river receiving domestic wastewater therefore from the perspective of understanding the effects of pollution and determining the most appropriate strategies for the evaluation and remediation of polluted rivers it is necessary to consider both vertical and horizontal patterns of bacterial community beta diversity is the dissimilarity between species and can be used to characterize bacterial community patterns simpson 1943 according to the presence or absence of species the causality of the processes underlying beta diversity is assigned to one of two biological phenomena the first phenomenon is spatial turnover which implies the replacement of some species by others from site to site due to environmental sorting or spatial and historical constraints qian et al 2005 the other phenomenon is nestedness reflecting a non random process of species loss as the consequence of any factor that promotes the disaggregation of assemblages wright and reeves 1992 from the perspective of phylogenetic turnover within a bacterial community two types of ecological processes deterministic and stochastic stegen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 can be used to describe the assembly of a bacterial community deterministic processes comprise ecological selection imposed by abiotic and biotic factors which influence organismal fitness and thereby determine the composition and relative abundance of species chesson 2000 fargione et al 2003 stochastic processes in contrast involve random birth death and dispersal events causing patterns of species composition that are indistinguishable from those produced by random chance alone chave 2004 hubbell 2001 although both deterministic and stochastic processes act concurrently to regulate the assembly of ecological communities dini andreote et al 2015 langenheder and szekely 2011 deterministic factors could be directly manipulated to adjust bacterial succession however how to identify the environmental factors that govern deterministic processes remains a fundamental challenge an analytical framework based on the phylogenetic null model deviation the quantitative estimate of which is the β nearest taxon index βnti originally proposed by stegen et al 2013 was used to quantify phylogenetic turnover of bacterial community and to further identify deterministic or stochastic processes during bacterial succession the βnti metric can provide deep insights into the potential role of the resource environment since variation in the magnitude of βnti is driven primarily by variation in the selective environment and to a much lesser extent by organismal dispersal stegen et al 2016 most recently the framework based on βnti as a key indicator has been applied to identify the main driving force of bacterial phylogenetic assembly for example βnti values derived from pairwise comparisons were regressed against euclidean distance matrices of soil ph and the results showed that ph mediates the balance between stochastic and deterministic assembly of bacterial community stegen et al 2016 tripathi et al 2018 therefore the analytical framework maybe allow investigation of which environmental factors are the primary drivers influencing vertical and horizontal assemblages of a bacterial community in a polluted urban river however no study has yet reported application of this approach in a river therefore the aim of this study was to answer the following questions i what are vertical and horizontal distribution patterns of bacterial community in a heavily polluted urban river ii how do vertical and horizontal bacterial community assemble in the heavily polluted urban river iii what are dominant environmental factors governing vertical and horizontal assemblage of bacterial community in the heavily polluted urban river to address these questions next generation 16s rrna gene sequencing combined with various multivariate statistical methods was applied to analyse spatial both vertical and horizontal bacterial diversity both in overlying waters and sediments in a heavily polluted urban river and to explore the impact of environmental variation on the distribution patterns of communities the results from this study can help to identify the main environmental drivers and provide important support for improving ecological evaluation and remediation for a contaminated river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sample collection jinchuan river a heavily polluted urban river with total area of 4 23 km2 and total length of 9 3 km in nanjing was selected as the study area water and sediment samples of jinchuan river were collected in october 2017 when it just defined as a black odor river by the government and our previous study cai et al 2019 four sampling sites were set up along the river positioned 1 5 2 km apart from each other fig 1 three depth points were set in river water including the surface 0 1 m below the water surface middle 3 m below the water surface and bottom 0 05 m above the sediment each with sampling in triplicate water samples at the same points were collected and mixed in 4 l polyethylene bottles triplicate sediment cores were also obtained from each site using perspex tubes inner diameter 9 cm length 60 cm and a gravity corer uwitec mondsee austria immediately after retrieval the core samples were sectioned into layers using a slicing disc and 3 layers 0 5 cm 15 20 cm and 30 35 cm of each core were used for subsequent analysis after collection 2 0 l water samples were filtered through whatman gf f filters 0 22 μm

quality checker u 10 horiba compared with biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod was selected as the parameter to quantify the organic matters in the black odor river since it is

methods as described in our previous study cai et al 2016 three replicates were performed for all parameters tested the ph of the sediment was measured with specific electrodes rex phb 5 inesa scientific instrument co ltd china sediment samples were dried with a laboratory freeze dryer alpha 1 2 ld martin christ instrument co germany tn tp nh4 n water content loss on ignition loi and orp of sediment samples were analyzed using standard methods as described by wu wu et al 2017 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing analysis the total dna from the water and sediment of each sample was extracted with an ezna kit omega bio tek inc usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and examined with 3 μl in 1 agarose gels by electrophoresis the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified from dna extracted using primer pairs f515 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and r806 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat directed against bacteria pcr was performed in triplicate 20 μl reactions each 20 μl pcr mixture contained 4 μl 5 fastpfu buffer 2 μl 2 5 mm dntps 0 4 μl of each primer 5 μm 0 8 μl of dna template and 0 4 μl of fastpfu polymerase the pcr protocol was 95 c for 5 min 30 cycles at 94 c for

guheinfo company for illumina miseq sequencing the number of average sequences per sample was 105778 after quality checking using the mothur software the sequences were trimmed and aligned using the silva reference alignment database marti and luis balcazar 2014 the 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on a 97 similarity cut off representative sequences were defined with a commonly applied sequence and used for phylogenetic analyses the sequences were deposited in the ncbi short read archive under the accession number srp134677 for bacteria in water samples and srp134708 for bacteria in sediment samples respectively 2 4 statistical analysis the species diversity richness and coverage were calculated using spss 19 0 software functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax analysis was used to predict functional characteristics of bacterial populations between different samples louca et al 2016 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was performed to determine the unifrac distance of the bacterial community data of four different sites at three water depths and three sediment depths analysis of similarity anosim was used to test the significance of differences between sample groups based on weighted unifrac distance matrices clark 1993 the relationships between bacterial community structure and environmental factors were evaluated by canonical correspondence analysis cca in canoco version 5 0 via monte carlo permutation testing with 999 permutations a multivariate regression tree mrt analysis a constrained clustering method was performed using the mvpart package with default parameters to relate the relative abundance of lineages to the site characteristics glenn 2002 maximal information coefficient mic analysis was performed to identify possible associations between individual otus or taxa and environmental parameters reshef et al 2011 multiple site dissimilarities as proposed by baselga see supplementary material including the sørensen dissimilarity index βsor the simpson dissimilarity index βsim and the nestedness resultant dissimilarity index βnes were used to characterize the causality of the processes underlying the observed vertical and horizontal bacterial community patterns the dissimilarity indices of bacterial communities were calculated in r using the function beta multi r baselga 2010 the pairwise phylogenetic turnover between bacterial communities was calculated as the mean nearest taxon distance metric βmntd stegen et al 2012 furthermore the βnti value which is the difference between the observed βmntd and the mean of the null distribution of βmntd normalized by its standard deviation was calculated according to stegen s community assembly method using the r language stegen et al 2013 the ecological processes of drift selection and dispersal were further quantified by the framework proposed by stegen et al 2013 more specifically the percentage of pairwise βnti values that fell above 2 and below 2 indicated that observed turnover between a pair of communities is governed by variable and homogeneous selection respectively then rcbray was quantified for pairwise community comparisons that were not governed by selection βnti 2 bray curtis dissimilarity was used to quantify compositional turnover thereby generating a null distribution of bray curtis values chase et al 2011 the metric of deviation between empirically observed bray curtis was referred as rcbray the relative contribution of dispersal limitation was estimated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 whereas that of homogenizing dispersal was estimated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 the fraction of all pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 estimates the influence of drift acting alone afterwards all possible pairwise comparisons of βnti values within different samples were conducted to fully evaluate the variation in community assembly processes along vertical and horizontal gradients of relevant environmental factors the βnti values as derived from pairwise comparisons were regressed against euclidean distance matrices of the selected environmental factors the statistical significance of the resulting comparisons was determined by mantel tests with 999 permutations 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of water and sediment samples the physicochemical characteristics of the water and sediment samples were shown in table s1 and table s2 respectively from the surface water to the bottom water the concentration of tn nh4 n and tp trended to decrease the do concentrations were also found to decrease with water depth except at site c where the river area had formed an obvious anaerobic environment from the surface to the deep layer moreover it was found that there was a decrease of orp values with increased sediment depth across all four sites suggesting changes in the oxidation reduction reactions with the sediment depth gradient do and nutrient concentrations are generally considered as important parameters indicating the health status of river system in this study the do and nutrient concentrations were found to be heterogeneous in both vertical and horizontal profiles confirming the need to study both vertical and horizontal dimensions of a river system significant higher concentrations of tn 3343 01 mg kg on average tp 1474 15 mg kg and nh4 n 163 52 mg kg were observed in sediment samples compared to water samples the concentrations of tn and tp in water were found to be positively correlated with those in the sediment the results indicated that there was a dynamic equilibrium between sediment and the overlying water as a whole system which was also confirmed by previous study wang et al 2014 moreover it is interesting to notice that the percentage of nh4 n concentration as part of the tn concentration in the sediment samples 5 6 0 3 on average was much lower than that in the water samples 47 9 0 3 on average fig s1 this suggested that the biogeochemistry of sediment was different from that of water the differences of water and sediment characteristics such as pressure density and fluidity are generally accepted to be responsible for the heterogeneous biogeochemistry roberto et al 2018 and the succession in microbial community is usually considered as the drive of biogeochemistry liu et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to study the distribution and assemblage of bacterial community along the vertical direction of river 3 2 composition and spatial patterns of bacterial communities in total 30 bacterial phyla were observed in 24 samples the most dominant phylum was proteobacteria which included 53 23 of the total number of bacterial sequences fig s2 the average relative abundance of observed bacterial communities in water samples was 50 32 almost as much as the average abundance 49 68 in the sediment samples the differences in the bacterial community between depths were more significant when observed at genus level as shown in the heatmap fig 2 as expected the water and sediment parts of the polluted river differed significantly in the bacterial community structure at the genus level in water samples genera acinetobacter 5 14 showed high relative abundance whereas in sediment samples genera dechloromonas 1 32 was present at high proportions there was higher richness of bacterial genera in sediment samples compared to that in water samples although the average relative abundance of bacteria in sediment samples was lower than that of corresponding bacteria in water samples in addition water in the river was characterized by genera comprised of bacteria including acinetobacter 5 14 and novosphingobium 2 38 which have the potential to degrade aromatic compounds such as phenol aniline nitrobenzene and phenanthrene some pathogenic bacteria like arcobacter 4 43 were also present at high abundances in water the differences in the functions of bacterial communities between water and sediment samples could be observed by farotax analysis fig s4 it was found that functional groups of nitrification was present high proportions in sediment samples but nearly not found in water samples whereas human pathogens and functional groups of aromatic compound degradation were more abundant in water samples than those in sediment samples in agreement with the composition analysis of bacterial genera as mentioned above the bacterial community also differed at different sites along the river the dominant bacteria other than the common genera acinetobacter suddenly changed from arcobacter at the upstream sites site c and site d to novosphingobium at downstream sites site a and site b positioned to be possibly affected by anthropogenic activities however apart from a small distinction in the relative abundance of some genera the differences among the four sampling sites were not obvious according to the heatmap plot analysis the alpha diversity values of bacterial communities were determined and are shown in table s3 overall the coverage values ranged from 98 to 100 across samples indicating that sequences generated from these samples represented most of the bacterial community in the studied sites the average number of observed bacterial species 8410 1487 shannon 9 64 0 60 and simpson 0 99 0 01 indices in sediment samples all showed higher values than those in water samples observed bacterial species 5470 1153 shannon indices 6 94 0 80 simpson indices 0 97 0 01 however there were no significant regular gradient of change in the shannon and simpson indices between different water depths or different sites to reveal the vertical and horizontal patterns of bacterial community samples were pooled by depth and by site for dissimilarity analysis between groups the nmds plots showed marked differences of bacterial community structure with a clear separation of water samples from sediment samples fig 3 a anosim was next performed and further confirmed that the bacterial communities in the water were significantly different from those in the sediment r 0 933 p 0 001 according to nmds analysis bacterial community structures at the same site in water or sediment both showed a tendency to cluster fig 3b however anosim showed few differences in bacterial community structures at different sites moving from upstream to downstream r 0 01127 p 0 386 comparing the similarity among groups pooled by depth nmds plots revealed more similar structures for bacterial communities at all depths for both water and sediment with no depth related differences for the four sampling sites meanwhile no significant differences were detected by anosim among either the three water depths or the three sediment depths in water r 0 1481 p 0 941 in sediment r 0 03472 p 0 521 the analysis of dissimilarity revealed a clear spatial pattern in the β diversity of bacterial communities the differences between sediment and water the differences among four sites the differences among different depths in water or sediment similar results were also found in previous study focusing on vertical and horizontal distribution of bacterial communities in overlying water of a eutrophic river where bacterial communities were significantly different in horizontal but showed no significantly depth related differences gao et al 2017 this is also an explanation for why the vertical distribution of microbial communities in river was not well reported in previous studies however the vertical difference does exist and understanding the vertical assemblage of microbial communities is important for improving the efficacies of ecological evaluation and remediation for the heavily polluted rivers gao et al 2017 boeer et al 2009 3 3 causality of the processes underlying biodiversity to address this issue further we next examined the causality of the different processes underlying biodiversity by assigning the distinct beta diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena the dissimilarity indices of bacterial community grouped by different depths and different sampling sites were calculated and the results are shown in table s4 and table s5 the estimated beta diversity βsor value of bacterial community among different sites was 0 64 sd 0 03 with a strong contribution of spatial turnover βsim 0 59 0 02 and a small contribution of nestedness βnes 0 05 0 02 similarly the βsor of bacterial community among depth related groups was 0 53 sd 0 05 with a strong contribution of spatial turnover βsim 0 48 0 03 and a small contribution of nestedness βnes 0 05 0 05 this suggested that both spatial turnover and nestedness contributed to the construction of horizontal and vertical bacterial community structure whereas beta diversity patterns in rivers mainly resulted from species replacement rather than species loss to compare the beta diversity patterns of vertical and horizontal assemblages β values of horizontal assemblages were computed using a resampling procedure taking 100 random samples of 3 inventories and computing the average β to make comparable dissimilarities computed for sets with different number of sites 4 vs 3 the results of this resampling are shown in table s6 the comparison of the calculated dissimilarity indices between horizontal and vertical bacterial community structure showed higher βsim and βnes values in the horizontal assemblages β sim 0 54 0 02 β nes 0 05 0 02 than those in the vertical assemblages βsim 0 48 0 03 βnes 0 05 0 05 the estimated overall beta diversity was very similar for vertical groups βsor 0 53 0 05 and horizontal groups β sor 0 59 0 03 partitioning of this overall beta diversity into its turnover and nestedness components revealed that the spatial turnover made a larger contribution to horizontal bacterial community structures than to vertical bacterial community structures while nestedness was of almost equal importance for the vertical and horizontal groups it is generally accepted that there were significant distance decay relationships for river bacterial community composition at geographical distance liu et al 2018 chen et al 2018a b for example correlation between the bacterial community similarity matrix and mean dendritic distance suggested that dissimilarities between bacterial community increases with the increasing geographical distance along the yangtze river liu et al 2018 in this study the distance between different sites was much longer than that between sampling layers with estimated values of beta diversity in vertical and horizontal that were almost equal this suggests that biodiversity of vertical community may also deserve attention the results revealed spatial turnover as the largest contributor to beta diversity in both vertical and horizontal groups reflecting the high proportion of endemics present in different sampling points similar conclusion was obtained in a case study on beta diversity patterns of european longhorn beetles baselga 2008 differentiation between spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial to improve our understanding of central biogeographic ecological and conservation issues and to design appropriate bioremediation strategies baselga 2010 by considering phylogenetic turnover within a bacterial community the relative contribution of ecological processes including selection dispersal and drift for the community assemblage was further determined table s7 homogenizing dispersal dominated phylogenetic turnover of bacterial community contributing 51 5 and 34 8 of the total processes in water and sediment respectively selection processes including variable selection and homogeneous selection were stronger in water 45 5 than in sediment 39 4 whereas drift was the opposite 3 4 identifying environmental drivers controlling deterministic selection cca was performed to elucidate the relationship between geochemical factors and bacterial community structures based on the forward selection process and variance inflation factors ph tp tn and conductivity were selected as factors explaining the bacterial community variation in water samples fig 4 a and tn tp and nh4 n were selected for bacterial community variation in sediment samples fig 4b the selected geochemical factors could explain 75 57 and 52 39 of the total variation respectively the analysis revealed distinct dominant factors determining the bacterial community distributions in different environmental media although according to the cca plots the concentrations of tn and tp were strong predictors for bacterial community distributions in both water and sediment physical factors like conductivity and orp had higher influence on bacterial community in water samples than on sediment samples whereas nh4 n was more important for the distributions of bacterial community in sediment samples rather than those in water samples an mrt analysis was also applied as another approach to determine the influence of environmental variables on the bacterial community structures fig 4 c d the mrt constructed from data for bacteria from water samples exhibited two splits and three leaves the 12 samples were clustered into two groups by do and the group with do concentrations greater than 0 675 mg l was spilt by tp the mrt constructed from data for bacteria from sediment samples also exhibited two splits and three leaves the 12 samples were firstly clustered into two groups by tn concentrations and the group with tn concentrations lower than 4140 mg kg was spilt by tp concentration the contributions of other physicochemical parameters were too small to be recognized in the mrt analysis mic analysis which is able to detect many kinds of correlations not only unimodal was also used to identify possible associations between individual otus or taxa and environmental parameters an association was considered significant when false discovery rate fdr less than 1 and mic larger than 0 9 in our study the matrix of mic values larger than 0 9 was visualized as the network of association fig s5 combined with the results from cca and mrt analysis tn tp nh4 n orp do ph cond and codmn were finally selected as potential drivers for further identification we next examined the relationship between βnti and the potential drivers in both the vertical and horizontal direction to infer different influences of ecology processes along the vertical and horizontal changes in potential drivers nh4 n concentration was more strongly associated with the βnti value than other environmental variations between the different layers of river water whereas orp was more related to the βnti value than other environmental changes in sediment along the four sites as shown in fig 5 the βnti distribution progressively shifted with increasing difference in nh4 n concentration from primarily consistent with homogeneous selection βnti 2 to consistent with stochastic community assembly 2 βnti 2 in water samples of vertical direction and with increasing difference in orp from primarily consistent with variable selection βnti 2 to consistent with stochastic community assembly 2 βnti 2 in sediment samples of horizontal direction 3 5 implications for evaluation and remediation of a contaminated river bacterial community can serve as potential integrative indicators of river health traditional methods determining environmental drivers such as cca and mrt are carried out only based on raw data with otu abundant profile and physicochemical factors the explanation degree for the otu abundant variation induced by physicochemical factors and the relatively optimal predictors could be finally determined therefore the predictors identified from cca or mrt could be considered as apparent drivers for the bacterial community assembly however it is generally believed that the assembly of bacterial community is a combination influence of stochastic and deterministic processes dini andreote et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the βnti metric introduced in this study is the phylogenetic null model deviation which is used to quantify phylogenetic turnover of bacterial community and the relative influence of stochastic and deterministic processes deterministic drivers of bacterial community determined through the analysis of correlation between βnti and gradients of physicochemical factors could provide more accurate information for the evaluation and remediation of a contaminated river moreover nh4 n was identified as the main driver of bacterial community composition and diversity in the heavily polluted urban river which is also defined as a black odor river it is consistent with the characteristic indicators of urban black odor water pollution classification proposed in the guide for remediation of urban black odorous water bodies promulgated by ministry of housing and urban rural development mohurd of the people s republic of china in september 11 2015 according to the guide the sampling point for the monitoring nh4 n is generally set every 200 600 m along the river and be set at 0 5 m below the water surface or at half the depth of river water when the water depth less than 0 5 m in this study nh4 n was identified as the main driver mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic assembly of vertical bacterial community in the overlying water as shown in fig 5b the value of βnti increases with the increased difference in nh4 n between two sampling points suggesting the increasing dissimilarity between vertical bacterial communities according to the linear relationship deterministic processes were found to dominate microbial community assemblage in the investigated polluted river when the difference in nh4 n between two sampling points exceeded 0 262 obviously for a black odor river the difference in bacterial community along the vertical direction should be as small as possible the smaller dissimilarity between vertical microbial communities is the more difficult for stratification is therefore it is suggested that the difference in nh4 n between different water layers should be taken into account for ecological evaluation in black odorous water bodies this may provide new insight into the improvement of the sampling strategy more sampling points should be added in the vertical direction of the polluted river from the perspective of river management the obtained results could provide useful information for improving the efficacies of ecological evaluation and remediation for a contaminated river e g black odor urban river 4 conclusions in summary our study revealed heterogeneous physicochemical characteristics in a polluted river in both vertical and horizontal profiles under the influence of physicochemical characteristics specific vertical and horizontal bacterial assemblage patterns were established in a polluted urban river bacterial community composition and structure were most different between the overlying water and the sediment this difference was relatively small for vertical stratification in the same medium from the perspective of microbial community ecology the beta diversity patterns in rivers mainly resulted from spatial turnover implying the replacement of some species by others as a consequence of environmental sorting or spatial constraints the comparison of dissimilarity indices between horizontal and vertical bacterial community structures showed obvious biodiversity of vertical community that deserves attention considering stochastic vs deterministic processes nh4 n and orp were identified based on phylogenetic null model deviation as the main drivers to determine vertical and horizontal bacterial community assemblages in the heavily polluted urban river respectively our study offers important insight into the improvement of the sampling strategy for the evaluation of heavily polluted rivers e g black odor urban rivers due to the limitation of the case study the effects of spatio temporal changes on the obtained conclusions were not taken into full consideration however the established comprehensive approach for determining the vertical and horizontal assemblage drivers of bacterial community could be applied to other urban river systems and the obtained results could provide theoretical guidance to evaluate and remediate polluted urban rivers acknowledgments the study was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51879079 the fundamental research funds for the

18682,sequestration of anthropogenic antibiotics by biochars from waters may be a promising strategy to minimize environmental and human health risks of antibiotic resistance this study investigated the long term sequestration of lincomycin by 17 slow pyrolysis biochars using batch sorption experiments during 365 days sorption kinetics were well fitted to the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model for all tested biochars with the intraparticle diffusion rate constant k id of 25 3 166 μg g 1 day 0 5 and intercept constant c id of 39 0 339 μg g 1 suggesting that the sorption kinetics were controlled by fast initial sorption and slow pore diffusion the quasi equilibrium sorption isotherms became more nonlinear with increasing equilibration time at 1 7 30 and 365 days likely due to increasing abundance of heterogeneous sorption sites in biochars over time intriguingly low temperature 300 c and high temperature 600 c biochars had faster sorption kinetics than intermediate temperature 400 500 c biochars at the long term which was attributed to greater specific surface area and pore volume of high temperature biochars and the substantial and continuous release of dissolved organic carbon doc from low temperature biochars respectively doc release enhanced lincomycin sorption by decreasing biochar particle size and or increasing the accessibility of sorption sites and pores initially blocked by doc additionally a large fraction 75 of sorbed lincomycin in biochars after a 240 day equilibration could not be extracted by the acetonitrile methanol extractant the strong sorption and low extraction recovery demonstrated the great potential of biochars as soil amendments for long term sequestration of antibiotics in situ graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar antibiotics lincomycin sorption pore diffusion dissolved organic carbon 1 introduction antibiotics are used extensively in livestock industry for therapeutic preventative and growth promotion purposes kumar et al 2005 martinez 2009 sarmah et al 2006 the use of antibiotics in animal feeding operations was 14 622 tons in the united states in 2012 and 84 240 tons in china in 2013 i e the two largest users of antibiotics zhang et al 2015 globally the total consumption of antibiotics in livestock industry was about 131 109 tons in 2013 and was projected to increase to 200 235 tons in 2030 van boeckel et al 2017 because the administered antibiotics are often poorly metabolized within animals a large portion of antibiotics are excreted into manure as parent compounds and metabolites and released into agricultural soils and waterbodies through manure land applications kuchta and cessna 2009 kummerer 2009 zhu et al 2013 the widespread and repeated manure application has increased environmental concentrations of anthropogenic antibiotics thus raising serious concerns about the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and associated food safety and human health impacts chee sanford et al 2009 heuer et al 2011 martinez 2009 rivera utrilla et al 2013 mitigation strategies to reduce the release transport and bioavailability of manure borne antibiotics in soils are urgently needed to minimize their environmental risks enhancing sequestration of antibiotics from waters in soils by biochar amendment may be a promising strategy for this purpose biochars are carbonaceous porous materials produced from the pyrolysis of biomass under oxygen limited conditions at a typical temperature range of 300 700 c lehmann and joseph 2015 biochars have been promoted as sorbents and soil amendments for agronomical and environmental applications such as increasing soil carbon storage improving soil structure and quality and immobilizing environmental contaminants beesley et al 2011 lehmann 2007 lehmann and joseph 2015 sorption plays an important role in controlling the fate transport and bioavailability of antibiotics in soils and the porous nature and heterogeneous surfaces of biochars lead to an excellent sorption ability for antibiotics ahmed et al 2015 kah et al 2017 peiris et al 2017 the interactions between antibiotics and biochars may be controlled by hydrophobic partitioning van der waals forces hydrogen h bonding charge assisted h bonding cahb π π electron donor acceptor eda interaction electrostatic interaction and pore filling ahmed et al 2015 kah et al 2017 peiris et al 2017 the relative contribution of each sorption mechanism is collectively determined by physicochemical properties of antibiotics e g hydrophobicity polarity ionization and molecular structure and biochars e g surface area surface charge surface functionalization and pore structure as well as environmental factors e g ph ionic strength and co solutes kah et al 2017 peiris et al 2017 thus studies on contaminant sorption to biochars have recently focused on clarifying the complexity in sorption processes and controlling factors pyrolysis temperature is one of the key factors determining physicochemical and sorption properties of biochars ahmad et al 2014 beesley et al 2011 lian and xing 2017 tan et al 2015 with increasing pyrolysis temperature surface area and pore volume of biochars increase but densities of oxygen containing e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and aliphatic e g methyl group functional groups decrease with a concomitant increase in aromaticity chen et al 2012 keiluweit et al 2010 lian and xing 2017 due to larger surface area and porosity of high temperature biochars they often had stronger sorption affinity to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin shang et al 2016 norfloxacin feng et al 2015 tetracycline huang et al 2017 wang et al 2017b and sulfamethoxazole pan et al 2012 wu et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 than lower temperature biochars however a number of studies reported the absence or opposite of such trend with regard to pyrolysis temperature for the sorption of ofloxacin wu et al 2013 norfloxacin wu et al 2013 and sulfamethoxazole lian et al 2014 to biochars clearly the effect of pyrolysis temperature on physicochemical properties of biochars and sorption of antibiotics to biochars has yet to be fully understood additionally considering the heterogeneous nature of biochar pore structures sorption of antibiotics may need a longer time to reach a true equilibrium kasozi et al 2010 reported that the sorption kinetics of catechol on biochars reached equilibrium after 14 days chen et al 2012 found that the sorption of naphthalene to biochars could take up to 36 days to reach equilibrium depending on pyrolysis temperature of biochars our previous study showed that lincomycin sorption to biochars quickly reached a quasi equilibrium in about 2 days but did not reach the true equilibrium even after 180 days liu et al 2016 for most antibiotics that have been studied the reported sorption equilibration time with biochars was generally varied from several hours to a few days feng et al 2015 huang et al 2017 lian et al 2014 pan et al 2012 shang et al 2016 wang et al 2017b wu et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 thus some of those sorption experiments may have only reached a quasi equilibrium during such an equilibration time that may be too short for certain antibiotics considering their ongoing sorption over the long term consequently the contribution of pore diffusion to the overall sorption may be underestimated due to short equilibration times furthermore biochars could release a substantial amount of dissolved organic carbon doc including truly dissolved and colloidal doc upon exposure to water lin et al 2012 mukherjee and zimmerman 2013 qu et al 2016 smith et al 2016 zimmerman and gao 2013 which may change the biochar surface and pore structure for example these water soluble organic compounds i e doc may initially fill up the biochar pores during pyrolysis or adsorb on the biochar surface thus blocking the sorptive sites for organic contaminants wang et al 2017a the released doc from biochars hereafter denoted as biochar doc may enhance the sorption of antibiotics to biochars however the effect of long term doc release from biochars on their sorption capacity for antibiotics has not been well studied therefore this study aimed to examine 1 the long term sequestration of antibiotics by biochars and 2 the effect of the long term biochar doc release on the sorption of antibiotics to biochars lincomycin was selected in this study because it is one of the most widely used antibiotics in food animal production and is also medically important in human therapy van epps and blaney 2016 zhang et al 2015 lincomycin is relatively resistant to environmental degradation andreozzi et al 2006 loftin et al 2008 and has been frequently detected in soil and water kolpin et al 2002 watanabe et al 2010 the long term sorption kinetics and isotherms of lincomycin by 17 slow pyrolysis biochars prepared from 7 manure feedstocks at 300 600 c and one wood feedstock at 500 c were evaluated to elucidate the underlying sorption mechanisms along with the release of biochar doc the applied initial concentrations of lincomycin were in the range of 100 1000 μg l 1 which have been detected in livestock wastewaters sim et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 in addition a commercial graphite powder was selected to represent the sorption of lincomycin on nonporous carbonaceous sorbents as compared to porous biochars 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals lincomycin hydrochloride 90 and sodium azide nan3 99 5 were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and sodium chloride nacl sodium bicarbonate nahco3 sodium carbonate naco3 and sodium hydroxide naoh from j t baker phillipsburg nj usa selected physicochemical properties of lincomycin are provided in table s1 of supplementary material all chemical reagents used were of analytical grade deionized di water from a milli q water system millipore burlington ma usa was used for preparing all aqueous solutions 2 2 sorbents sixteen manure based biochars and one wood based biochar were produced by best energies inc daisy reactor cashton wi usa the feedstocks and production conditions of these biochars have been described in detail elsewhere enders et al 2012 rajkovich et al 2011 briefly the feedstocks were bull manure with sawdust bedding bm dairy manure with rice hull bedding dm poultry manure with sawdust bedding pm raw dairy manure rdm digested dairy manure ddm composted digested dairy manure cdm composted digested dairy manure mixed with woodchip waste in a 1 1 ratio cdmw and woodchip waste ww the same source of dairy manure was used to produce rdm ddm cdm and cdmw with different pretreatments before pyrolysis in a daisy reactor at best energies inc the feedstocks were slowly pyrolyzed in a n2 atmosphere at 300 400 500 or 600 c with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 and a retention time of 15 20 min the produced biochars were ground and sieved to obtain particles in the 75 150 μm size fraction and then stored in glass vials prior to use the fine particle size fraction of biochars was selected because biochars had a wide particle size distribution ranging from submicrons to centimeters ibi 2019 lehmann and joseph 2015 and finer biochar particles have greater potential to sequester antibiotics in the environment liu et al 2016 these biochars were hereafter labeled using feedstock abbreviation and pyrolysis temperature e g bm300 for bull manure with sawdust bedding pyrolyzed at 300 c nonporous graphite powder 150 μm 99 9 c was purchased from sigma

biochars have been performed and reported previously enders et al 2012 rajkovich et al 2011 specific surface area ssa and micropore volume v mic of the biochars were measured by co2 adsorption by a tristar ii 3020 analyzer micromeritics norcross ga usa at pacific surface science inc oxnard ca usa detailed pore size distribution was not determined in this study because the porosity of biochars can be changed during degassing sigmund et al 2017 especially for poorly carbonized biochars see supplementary material s1 for detail zeta potential of the biochar particles was determined by a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments malvern worcestershire uk for biochar suspensions prepared according to the procedure described in supplementary material s1 additionally bm300 and bm600 were selected as model biochars representing poorly and highly carbonized biochars respectively for further studying the characteristics of biochar particles after water exposure the shape and surface morphology of bm300 and bm600 particles before and after 1 d and 365 d kinetic sorption experiments described later and 1 d exposure to 0 1 m naoh solution as described in supplementary material s1 were investigated with a jsm 7500 f scanning electron microscope sem jeol akishima tokyo japan the particle size distribution of bm300 and bm600 particles in suspensions was determined by dynamic light scattering method using the zetasizer 2 4 sorption experiments batch sorption experiments were conducted in amber borosilicate glass vials with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe lined screw caps kimble vineland nj usa all vials were covered with aluminum foils to prevent any potential photodegradation of lincomycin the lincomycin solutions were freshly prepared in di water with ionic strength of 0 02 m and ph of 10 using background electrolytes of 6 7 mm nacl 2 5 mm na2co3 and 2 5 mm nahco3 a biocide nan3 of 200 mg l 1 was included to prevent any biodegradation of lincomycin during the long term sorption experiments as nonelectrostatic sorption free of solution ph and ionic strength effect is more useful for estimating lincomycin sequestration capacity of biochars this study used solution ph of 10 at which lincomycin is neutral and mainly reacts with biochar surfaces via nonelectrostatic interactions liu et al 2016 all sorption experiments were performed in duplicate at room temperature 23 1 c and a sorbent water ratio of 1 g l 1 the above experimental condition and setup for the batch sorption studies were followed unless noted otherwise for the kinetic sorption experiments 8 mg of each sorbent were mixed with 8 ml of 1000 μg l 1 lincomycin in 8 ml vials and then agitated on an end over end shaker glas col terre haute in usa at 30 rpm in dark for the duration of 1 365 days at pre determined time intervals two vials for each sorbent were retrieved from the shaker the vials were centrifuged at 2430 g for 20 min at room temperature and the top 2 ml of supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose esters syringe filter millipore burlington ma usa the first 1 ml filtrate was discarded and the following 1 ml filtrate was collected to minimize the potential loss of lincomycin sorbed by the filter the concentrations of lincomycin in the filtrate was determined by a shimadzu prominence high performance liquid chromatograph columbia md usa coupled to an applied biosystems sciex 3200 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer foster city ca usa lc ms ms chuang et al 2015 in agreement with our previous study liu et al 2016 the sorbent free control experiments showed a negligible loss of lincomycin during the experiments fig s1 and there were no degradation products calza et al 2012 detected in the filtrates of sorbent free control experiments bm300 and bm600 at day 365 using precursor ion scan mode by the tandem mass spectrometry therefore the difference between the initial and final solution concentrations was used to calculate the sorbed lincomycin concentration in the sorbents in addition the doc in the filtrate is operationally defined as biochar doc in this study because the filtrate volume was small and if diluted the biochar doc concentration could be below the detection limit of total organic carbon analyzer the concentration of biochar doc in the filtrate was determined by ultraviolet uv absorption at 254 nm and e 2 e 3 ratio the ratio of absorbance at 254 nm over absorbance at 365 nm on a varian cary 50 bio uv visible spectrophotometer varian palo alto ca usa using our recently developed method liu et al 2019 details of the lc ms ms and uv analytical protocols are provided in supplementary material the solution ph generally remained unchanged i e ph 10 0 1 during the long term sorption experiments for biochars however in the experiments with bm300 dm300 pm00 and ddm500 solution ph decreased to 9 1 0 3 after 365 days presumably due to the greater amount of biochar doc released into solution this study at ph of 10 is considered relevant to field soils because it may simulate the magnitude of doc release from biochars over a long period years thus allowing for assessing sorption properties of aged biochars in alkaline soils to conduct the quasi equilibrium sorption isotherms 8 mg of each sorbent were mixed with 8 ml lincomycin solutions with a series of initial concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 μg l 1 the suspensions were shaken end over end at 30 rpm in dark at 1 day 1 week 7 days 1 month 30 days and 1 year 365 days the vials were retrieved centrifuged filtered and determined for the lincomycin concentration by the lc ms ms as described previously 2 5 effects of biochar doc on lincomycin sorption to further elucidate the role of biochar doc on the sorption of lincomycin to biochars three additional experiments were performed as detailed in supplementary material s1 first the freely dissolved lincomycin and doc bound lincomycin in solutions were determined using the solid phase extraction method ding et al 2013 this experiment was performed for the doc concentration of 186 93 8 97 4 and 89 6 mg c l 1 extracted from bm300 dm300 pm300 and ddm500 respectively its results could allow us to evaluate the contribution of lincomycin bound with biochar doc to total lincomycin sorption and determine if the enhanced lincomycin sorption over time was due to the binding of lincomycin with biochar doc second the lincomycin sorption to a wood biochar ww500 was measured in the absence and the presence of biochar doc at 17 2 7 94 11 1 and 10 9 mg c l 1 extracted from bm300 dm300 pm300 and ddm500 respectively the control experiments without ww500 were also performed and the lincomycin concentrations in solution had no significant difference regardless of the presence of biochar doc during 60 days data not shown this experiment allowed us to evaluate the effect of free biochar doc in solution on lincomycin sorption to biochars finally to evaluate the change in the lincomycin sorption to biochars after the doc release each bm300 dm300 pm300 ddm500 and bm600 biochar was mixed with di water for 40 days or with 0 1 m naoh for 1 day only for bm300 bm600 and dm300 respectively the washed biochars were then separated from the washing solutions further rinsed with di water to remove any remaining doc and salts and freeze dried before being used in the kinetic sorption experiments as described earlier washing with di water removed 20 7 10 4 10 8 9 92 and 0 18 mg c g biochar of doc from bm300 dm300 pm300 ddm500 and bm600 biochars whereas 105 75 2 and 3 37 mg c g biochar of doc were removed from bm300 dm300 and bm600 biochars by 0 1 m naoh respectively 2 6 extraction of sorbed lincomycin from biochars single point batch extraction experiments were performed to test the extraction recovery of sorbed lincomycin on the biochars the sorbed lincomycin on the biochars after 240 day sorption equilibration was extracted using the ultrasonic assisted solvent extraction with an acetonitrile methanol mixture 8 2 by volume as described in supplementary material s1 2 7 mathematical modeling the experimental sorption kinetics were fitted to the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 wu et al 2009 1 q t k id t 0 5 c id where q t μg g 1 is the sorbed lincomycin concentration in the solid phase at time t k id μg g 1 day 0 5 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant t day is the reaction time and c id μg g 1 is the intercept constant that reflects the contribution from the rapid initial sorption wu et al 2009 at the final stage of several kinetic sorption experiments lincomycin concentrations in solution became either minimal or non detectable resulting in decreased intraparticle diffusion rate wu et al 2001 and inaccurate sorption measurement respectively thus the sorption data collected during those periods were excluded from the fitting according to wu et al 2009 the relative importance of intraparticle diffusion and initial sorption could be further analyzed based on following equations 2 q t q ref 1 r id 1 t t ref 0 5 3 r id k id t ref 0 5 q ref where t ref day is the longest time used when fitting the intraparticle diffusion model q ref μg g 1 is the sorbed lincomycin concentration in the solid phase at time t ref and r id is the intraparticle

xing and pignatello 1996 4 q t k f c t n where q t μg g 1 is the sorbed lincomycin concentration in the solid phase at time t c t μg l 1 is the lincomycin concentration in the solution at time t k f μg1 n g 1 ln is the freundlich sorption coefficient and n dimensionless is the freundlich nonlinearity factor assuming multiple sorption sites on sorbent surface mathematically it has been proven that decreasing in n value suggests an increase in sorption site heterogeneity sposito 1980 because k f values could not be compared directly unless n is the same sorption distribution coefficient was calculated for comparison of lincomycin sorption by biochars 5 k d q c w k f c w n 1 where k d l g 1 is the sorption distribution coefficient q μg g 1 is the sorbed lincomycin concentration in the

natick ma usa and ibm spss statistics 25 armonk ny usa respectively the goodness of fit was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r 2 and the root mean squared error rmse significant differences between experimental treatments were analyzed using one way anova with post hoc tukey test p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biochars the selected physicochemical properties of 17 tested slow pyrolysis biochars are shown in table s2 in supplementary material the effect of pyrolysis temperature on physicochemical properties of tested biochars was generally consistent with previous findings chen et al 2008 keiluweit et al 2010 except for pm biochars due to their higher ash content table s2 and fig s2 volatile matter content 25 7 55 5 decreased whereas fixed carbon content 0 62 1 and ash content 7 7 58 5 increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature due to increased carbonization of biomass at higher pyrolysis temperature antal and gronli 2003 keiluweit et al 2010 the volatile matter and fixed carbon contents could approximate the easily mineralizable and persistent fractions of biochars respectively keiluweit et al 2010 in addition the biochars produced from pm cdm and cdmw had a greater ash content 32 0 55 8 than that from bm dm ddm and ww 7 70 18 8 which was attributed to mineral content in their feedstock bernal et al 2009 for biochars from the same feedstocks total c content 27 8 85 9 increased while total o 11 6 26 6 h 0 4 4 9 and n 0 4 2 6 contents decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature accordingly atomic ratios of h c 0 17 0 97 and o n c 0 13 0 52 decreased at higher pyrolysis temperature suggesting that high temperature biochars had more condensed aromatic structures and less polar functional groups chen et al 2008 chun et al 2004 keiluweit et al 2010 ssa 45 0 271 m2 g 1 and v mic 0 02 0 12 cm3 g 1 of the tested biochars generally increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature sem images of bm300 and bm600 revealed that biochar pores were irregular in shape and heterogeneous in pore size from nanometers to micrometers fig s3 finally zeta potential of tested biochars ranged from 64 to 43 mv at solution ph of 10 and ionic strength of 0 02 m table s2 indicating that the biochars carried net negative surface charge under the experimental conditions 3 2 long term sorption kinetics as shown in fig 1 and fig s1 lincomycin sorption onto the biochars occurred rapidly in the initial sorption phase within the first day followed by a slower sorption over the long term up to 365 days for all biochars the long term lincomycin sorption did not fully occupy all the sorption sites in the biochars i e reaching sorption saturation and continuously increased towards a point when dissolved lincomycin concentration in solution became minimal or non detectable defined as apparent sorption equilibrium here the lincomycin sorption kinetics approached an apparent sorption equilibrium within 365 days for most biochars except for bm500 pm400 pm500 and cdm500 approximately 7 34 of initially applied lincomycin was removed by the biochars after 1 day whereas up to 83 100 of that was removed by 365 days except for pm400 54 considering the porous nature of biochars the fast initial sorption was primarily attributed to the instantaneous or very rapid sorption on the external surface of biochars that provides readily accessible sorption sites for lincomycin the subsequent long term slow sorption was mainly caused by the relatively slower intraparticle diffusion into the internal biochar pore structures that provide abundant sorption sites but require longer time for lincomycin to access as lincomycin is relatively bulky non aromatic and flexible in its molecular structure table s1 its diffusion into the irregularly shaped biochar pores might be prolonged as a comparison the sorption of lincomycin onto the nonporous graphite reached a sorption equilibrium within 1 day and remained unchanged for 30 days due to the lack of pore structures fig s4 the significant difference in the sorption behaviors between the porous biochars and the nonporous graphite further supported that the sorption of lincomycin to the biochars was controlled by fast surface sorption in the short term and slow intraparticle diffusion in the long term the tested biochars had different sorption kinetics depending on the pyrolysis temperature and feedstock presumably due to the heterogeneity in their pore structures and surface chemistries overall the sorption kinetics decreased in the order bm300 bm400 bm600 bm500 fig 1a dm300 dm600 dm400 fig 1b and pm600 pm300 pm500 pm400 fig 1c and ddm500 ddm600 rdw500 ww500 cdmw500 cdm500 fig 1d specifically the biochars produced at the lowest and highest pyrolysis temperature i e 300 and 600 c generally had faster sorption kinetics and reached the apparent equilibrium more quickly than the biochars produced at intermediate pyrolysis temperature i e 400 500 c the sorption kinetics prior to the apparent sorption equilibrium were well fitted by the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model for all tested biochars table s3 the k id and c id values were in the range of 25 3 166 μg g 1 day 0 5 and 39 0 339 μg g 1 respectively interestingly the c id values showed a positive linear relationship fig 2 b while the k id values exhibited a u shaped relationship with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 600 c fig 2a for example the average c id values increased monotonically from 70 9 18 7 μg g 1 107 59 μg g 1 and 164 37 μg g 1 to 247 71 μg g 1 whereas the k id values followed the order of 300 c 110 56 μg g 1 day 0 5 600 c 59 5 19 8 μg g 1 day 0 5 500 c 48 8 10 3 μg g 1 day 0 5 400 c 45 8 18 6 μg g 1 day 0 5 for the biochars produced at 300 400 500 600 c respectively as the c id values represent the initial surface sorption this positive linear trend was expected because of the greater external surface area of higher temperature biochars than that of lower temperature biochars furthermore the observed u shaped relationship between k id and pyrolysis temperature was unique which cannot be explained by any measured physicochemical properties of biochars the greater k id of the higher temperature biochars might result from their greater ssa and v mic table s2 however the greater k id for the lower temperature 300 c biochars may be controlled by different mechanisms as elucidated later the r id values reflect the relative contribution of initial sorption and intraparticle diffusion to the total sorption wu et al 2009 the r id values closer to one indicate a dominant contribution from the intraparticle diffusion whereas the r id values closer to zero imply a primary contribution of initial sorption according to wu et al 2009 the lincomycin sorption kinetics of bm300 dm300 pm300 and pm400 can be classified as a weak initial sorption and strong intraparticle diffusion 1 0 r id 0 9 for the rest of the biochars produced at 400 500 and 600 c the lincomycin sorption kinetics can be classified as intermediate initial sorption and intraparticle diffusion 0 9 r id 0 5 the r id of all tested biochars ranged from 0 625 to 0 946 showing a negative correlation with pyrolysis temperature fig 2c thus the relative contribution of initial sorption was more pronounced for the high temperature biochars presumably due to their greater ssa table s2 as lincomycin exists as neutral species 100 pka 7 6 in aqueous solution under experimental ph of 10 is very hydrophilic and lacks π electron donor or acceptor moieties table s1 lincomycin sorption to biochars was unlikely due to hydrophobic partition electrostatic and π π eda interactions liu et al 2016 therefore h bonding van der waals forces and pore diffusion could reasonably be considered as possible mechanisms contributing to lincomycin sorption on biochars liu et al 2016 because lower temperature biochars contained more oxygen containing functional groups and lower ssa and micropore volume than higher temperature biochars the contribution of h bonding may be more important for lincomycin sorption to the low temperature biochars whereas the van der waals interaction may be more important for the high temperature biochars however the different relative contribution of h bonding and van der waals interactions in lincomycin sorption still cannot explain why the greater k id values were observed for the low temperature biochars than for the intermediate temperature biochars to further examine possible mechanisms for the above observation we hypothesized that the release of doc from biochars may play an important role in lincomycin sorption by biochars the long term release kinetics of doc from the tested biochars showed that the lower temperature biochars 300 400 c generally had greater release of doc than the higher temperature biochars 500 600 c except for ddm500 and ddm600 fig s5 the leachable biochar doc concentrations increased with decreasing pyrolysis temperature due to the greater labile carbon fraction in the lower temperature biochars fig s6a in addition the released doc from the lower temperature biochars generally had higher molecular weight as indicated by lower e 2 e 3 ratios de haan and de boer 1987 uyguner and bekbolet 2005 than higher temperature biochars fig s6b thus the continual and significant release of doc from lower temperature biochars probably enhanced their lincomycin sorption during the long term sorption to further investigate the observed enhancement of lincomycin sorption to the biochars of higher doc concentration more experiments were performed as discussed later 3 3 long term sorption isotherms the quasi equilibrium isotherms of lincomycin to the 17 biochars with contact time of 1 7 30 and 365 days were all nonlinear and exhibited a concave downward shape fig 3 and fig s7 all quasi equilibrium isotherm data could be fitted reasonably well to the freundlich model r 2 0 791 0 978 and rmse 6 21 92 6 μg g 1 table s4 the k d values were then calculated from the fitted freundlich parameters at c w 1 μg l 1 table s4 as expected for all biochars the k d values increased but the n values decreased with increasing equilibration time for example the n values decreased from 0 727 after 1 day to 0 424 after 30 days for bm300 and from 0 510 after 1 day to 0 325 after 365 days for bm600 fig 3a and d the lower n values i e more nonlinear observed at the longer equilibration time might suggest a more heterogeneous energy distribution of the sorption sites in the biochars sposito 1980 which could be explained by the greater contribution of intraparticle pore diffusion allowing lincomycin molecules to interact with more heterogeneous pore space and sorptive sites pignatello 2013 it should be noted that this interpretation was based on mathematical fitting of the sorption isotherms and more direct evidence on lincomycin interaction with surface sorption sites is needed in the future as a comparison the sorption isotherms of lincomycin for the nonporous graphite after 1 day and 30 days were almost identical with similar k d and n values due to the absence of intraparticle diffusion fig s4b this result further confirmed that the observed time dependent lincomycin sorption isotherms were caused by increasing contribution of intraparticle diffusion similar to the kinetic sorption data there was an equilibration time dependent relationship between k d or n values and pyrolysis temperature table s4 and fig s8 the k d values exhibited a positive linear relationship with pyrolysis temperature increasing from 300 to 600 c for the equilibration time after 1 day but gradually became the u shaped relationship as the equilibration time extended to 7 and 30 days fig s8a the n values exhibited a negative linear relationship with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 600 c for the equilibration time after 1 day but again gradually became an inverted u shaped relationship as the equilibration time increased to 7 and 30 days fig s8b the positive and negative linear relationship for k d and n with pyrolysis temperature after 1 day suggests that the lincomycin sorption to biochars became greater and more nonlinear at higher pyrolysis temperature presumably due to greater ssa and wider sorption site energy distribution on highly carbonized carbon domain for higher temperature i e 600 c biochar zhang et al 2011 interestingly at the longer equilibration time the lower temperature i e 300 c biochar had greater sorption affinity and nonlinearity likely resulting from enhanced intraparticle pore diffusion facilitated by the increasing release of biochar doc 3 4 effects of biochar doc on sorption we first hypothesized that lincomycin might bind with the biochar doc in solution if so lincomycin sorption to biochars could be overestimated when the doc bound lincomycin was included into the lincomycin sorption to biochars at the initial lincomycin concentration of 1000 μg l 1 15 6 0 5 8 and 3 0 of initially applied lincomycin was bound to doc bm300 doc dm300 doc pm300 and doc ddm500 of 186 93 8 97 4 and 89 6 mg c l 1 respectively the distribution coefficients of lincomycin to doc bm300 doc dm300 doc pm300 and doc ddm500 were 955 686 631 and 348 l kg c 1 respectively based on the biochar doc release kinetics fig s5 the biochar doc concentrations from day 1 to day 365 in the kinetic sorption experiments were 10 5 84 1 6 35 51 9 17 2 41 6 and 10 0 54 9 mg c l 1 for bm300 dm300 pm300 and ddm500 respectively even assuming all released biochar doc could bind with lincomycin in solution the fraction of the doc bound lincomycin was only 0 9 6 8 0 4 3 3 1 0 2 5 and 0 3 1 9 of the initially applied amount for doc bm300 doc dm300 doc pm300 and doc ddm500 respectively therefore the contribution of lincomycin sorption to biochar doc in solution could not explain the enhanced lincomycin sorption to biochars over time secondly we hypothesized that the biochar doc as co solute in solution might facilitate the lincomycin sorption to biochars however the presence of biochar doc as co solute inhibited the lincomycin sorption onto ww500 fig s9 compared with lincomycin sorption kinetics without biochar doc the fitted k id value decreased from 55 2 to 13 3 29 1 μg g 1 day 0 5 and the fitted c id value decreased from 178 to 70 5 85 6 μg g 1 in the presence of doc table s5 the extent of sorption suppression followed the order of doc bm300 doc pm300 doc dm300 doc ddm500 which generally but not completely agreed with the doc concentration trend doc bm300 doc dm300 doc ddm500 doc pm300 thus the inhibitory effect of biochar doc in solution depends on not only the concentration but also the chemical composition of biochar doc the observed slower diffusion rate and lower initial sorption confirmed that the biochar doc could not enhance the lincomycin sorption by itself on the contrary the biochar doc in solution strongly suppressed the lincomycin sorption by blocking the pore entrances i e decreased k id and or by competing for the external surface sorption sites i e decreased c id in biochars we finally tested the hypothesis that the long term release of biochar doc might gradually increase the accessibility of sorption sites on the external surface and in the biochar pore structure thus enhancing their sorption for lincomycin therefore the sorption kinetics of lincomycin by raw di washed and naoh washed biochars selected bm300 dm300 pm300 ddm500 bm600 were analyzed fig 4 fig s10 and table s6 apparently the removal of doc from the biochars bm300 dm300 pm300 and ddm500 substantially enhanced the lincomycin sorption kinetics fig 4 and fig s10 and the doc removal with naoh solution was more effective than that with di water for the enhancement of sorption kinetics for bm300 and dm300 because a greater amount of doc was removed fig 4a and b in addition the fitted k id and c id values both increased after the doc removal for these tested biochars table s6 for example the k id values were 160 166 and 176 μg g 1 day 0 5 and the c id values were 87 9 285 and 527 μg g 1 for bm300 raw bm300 di and bm300 naoh biochars respectively in contrast the enhancement of lincomycin sorption kinetics by the doc removal was very limited for bm600 due to its low doc content fig 4c the above observations confirmed that the long term release of doc from biochars could increase their sorption ability for lincomycin presumably because of increased accessibility to surface adsorption sites and pores initially blocked by biochar doc wang et al 2017a furthermore a close examination of sem images revealed that the biochar particles of low temperature biochars e g bm300 were disintegrated and the biochar particle size appeared to decrease after aging in 0 02 m background solution for 365 d and in 0 1 m naoh solution for 1 d presumably because of the doc release from the biochars fig s11 we further compared the size of biochar colloids by aging bm300 and bm600 biochars in either 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m nacl solution fig s12 the size of biochar colloids was much smaller in 0 1 m naoh than in 0 1 m nacl for bm300 whereas no obvious difference was observed for bm600 the decrease in particle size of bm300 after the doc removal suggested that the surface sorption sites and pores initially located in deeper biochar pores could become accessible for lincomycin sorption after the breakdown of biochar particles and thus further facilitated the sorption kinetics considering that bm600 was highly carbonized and had a relatively low doc content and rigid pore structure the doc removal would not substantially alter the surface sorption sites and pore structure of bm600 resulting in minimal enhancement of the sorption kinetics in summary these results supported the interpretation that the substantial release of biochar doc enhanced the long term lincomycin sorption on biochars through increasing accessibility of sorption sites initially blocked by doc as well as decreasing biochar particle sizes 3 5 extraction of sorbed lincomycin from biochars as shown in fig 5 a the extraction recoveries of lincomycin for all tested biochars were generally low and ranged from the lowest of 0 02 for bm300 to the highest of 24 7 for pm500 thus the long term sorbed lincomycin on the biochars could be highly resistant to desorption in addition the extraction recoveries exhibited a negative logarithmic correlation with the k id r 2 0 721 fig 5b implying that faster pore diffusion would cause lower extraction recoveries furthermore the results from an additional sorption extraction experiment for dm600 biochar described in supplementary material revealed that the extraction recoveries decreased from 62 4 6 3 28 4 5 9 to 8 75 0 47 as sorption equilibration time increased from 1 4 to 30 days fig s13 these observations were presumably because lincomycin may diffuse deeper into the biochar pores and become trapped in the narrower pores by either faster diffusion rate or longer diffusion time resulting in a lower extraction recovery from the standpoint of soil biochar amendment for contaminant immobilization the observed strong sorption and low extraction recovery for lincomycin may be desirable because the sorbed lincomycin would tend to remain within the biochars over the long term thus reducing the mobility and bioavailability of lincomycin in soils 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the slow pyrolysis biochars produced at 300 600 c could strongly sequester lincomycin from water over the long term the long term lincomycin sorption kinetics on the biochars were governed by fast surface sorption and slow intraparticle pore diffusion specially the biochars produced at 300 and 600 c generally exhibited faster lincomycin sorption kinetics than the biochars produced at 400 500 c the faster sorption kinetics for the biochars produced at 600 c could be attributed to their greater specific surface area and pore volume whereas for the biochars produced at 300 c it was due to the long term release of biochar doc the substantial and continuous release of doc from biochars could enhance the lincomycin sorption because of increased accessibility of sorption sites initially blocked by doc on the external surface and in pore structure as well as decreased biochar particle sizes the quasi equilibrium sorption isotherms were more nonlinear for high temperature biochars due to the wider energy distribution of sorption sites on their surfaces the sorption isotherms also became increasingly nonlinear with increasing equilibration time likely resulting from the release of biochar doc in addition lincomycin sequestered in the biochars had a low extraction recovery presumably because lincomycin was strongly trapped within biochar pores we have previously proposed that sequestering antibiotics by biochars produced from animal manure may be a novel strategy for managing animal manures and manure borne antibiotics liu et al 2016 using manure as feedstock to produce biochars could destroy any microbial pathogen and antibiotics via pyrolysis i e 300 600 c the produced biochars could be applied in soils to reduce the mobility and bioavailability of anthropogenic antibiotics in water flows under the same tested concentration range 0 1000 μg l 1 the observed k d values of lincomycin i e c w 1 μg l 1 on tested biochars after either 1 day 0 827 15 4 l g 1 or 365 days 20 5 454 l g 1 were greater than the previously reported k d values for whole soils 0 00 0 476 l g 1 wang et al 2012 it should be noted that this study was limited to alkaline condition ph 10 and is thus most relevant for alkaline soils the release of doc from biochars in alkaline soils via aging could further enhance the sorption of antibiotics coupled with the strong irreversible sorption biochars are a promising soil amendment for enhancing both short and long term sequestration of antibiotics and reducing the mobility and bioavailability of antibiotics in soils future studies should investigate contaminant sorption properties of biochars that are aged in a variety of soils of different ph declaration of interests the authors declare that

18682,sequestration of anthropogenic antibiotics by biochars from waters may be a promising strategy to minimize environmental and human health risks of antibiotic resistance this study investigated the long term sequestration of lincomycin by 17 slow pyrolysis biochars using batch sorption experiments during 365 days sorption kinetics were well fitted to the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model for all tested biochars with the intraparticle diffusion rate constant k id of 25 3 166 μg g 1 day 0 5 and intercept constant c id of 39 0 339 μg g 1 suggesting that the sorption kinetics were controlled by fast initial sorption and slow pore diffusion the quasi equilibrium sorption isotherms became more nonlinear with increasing equilibration time at 1 7 30 and 365 days likely due to increasing abundance of heterogeneous sorption sites in biochars over time intriguingly low temperature 300 c and high temperature 600 c biochars had faster sorption kinetics than intermediate temperature 400 500 c biochars at the long term which was attributed to greater specific surface area and pore volume of high temperature biochars and the substantial and continuous release of dissolved organic carbon doc from low temperature biochars respectively doc release enhanced lincomycin sorption by decreasing biochar particle size and or increasing the accessibility of sorption sites and pores initially blocked by doc additionally a large fraction 75 of sorbed lincomycin in biochars after a 240 day equilibration could not be extracted by the acetonitrile methanol extractant the strong sorption and low extraction recovery demonstrated the great potential of biochars as soil amendments for long term sequestration of antibiotics in situ graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar antibiotics lincomycin sorption pore diffusion dissolved organic carbon 1 introduction antibiotics are used extensively in livestock industry for therapeutic preventative and growth promotion purposes kumar et al 2005 martinez 2009 sarmah et al 2006 the use of antibiotics in animal feeding operations was 14 622 tons in the united states in 2012 and 84 240 tons in china in 2013 i e the two largest users of antibiotics zhang et al 2015 globally the total consumption of antibiotics in livestock industry was about 131 109 tons in 2013 and was projected to increase to 200 235 tons in 2030 van boeckel et al 2017 because the administered antibiotics are often poorly metabolized within animals a large portion of antibiotics are excreted into manure as parent compounds and metabolites and released into agricultural soils and waterbodies through manure land applications kuchta and cessna 2009 kummerer 2009 zhu et al 2013 the widespread and repeated manure application has increased environmental concentrations of anthropogenic antibiotics thus raising serious concerns about the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and associated food safety and human health impacts chee sanford et al 2009 heuer et al 2011 martinez 2009 rivera utrilla et al 2013 mitigation strategies to reduce the release transport and bioavailability of manure borne antibiotics in soils are urgently needed to minimize their environmental risks enhancing sequestration of antibiotics from waters in soils by biochar amendment may be a promising strategy for this purpose biochars are carbonaceous porous materials produced from the pyrolysis of biomass under oxygen limited conditions at a typical temperature range of 300 700 c lehmann and joseph 2015 biochars have been promoted as sorbents and soil amendments for agronomical and environmental applications such as increasing soil carbon storage improving soil structure and quality and immobilizing environmental contaminants beesley et al 2011 lehmann 2007 lehmann and joseph 2015 sorption plays an important role in controlling the fate transport and bioavailability of antibiotics in soils and the porous nature and heterogeneous surfaces of biochars lead to an excellent sorption ability for antibiotics ahmed et al 2015 kah et al 2017 peiris et al 2017 the interactions between antibiotics and biochars may be

temperature is one of the key factors determining physicochemical and sorption properties of biochars ahmad et al 2014 beesley et al 2011 lian and xing 2017 tan et al 2015 with increasing pyrolysis temperature surface area and pore volume of biochars increase but densities of oxygen containing e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and aliphatic e g methyl group functional groups decrease with a concomitant increase in aromaticity chen et al 2012 keiluweit et al 2010 lian and xing 2017 due to larger surface area and porosity of high temperature biochars they often had stronger sorption affinity to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin shang et al 2016 norfloxacin feng et al 2015 tetracycline huang et al 2017 wang et al 2017b and sulfamethoxazole pan et al 2012 wu et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 than lower temperature biochars however a number of studies reported the absence or opposite of such trend with regard to pyrolysis temperature for the sorption of ofloxacin wu et al 2013 norfloxacin wu et al 2013 and sulfamethoxazole lian et al 2014 to biochars clearly the effect of pyrolysis temperature on physicochemical properties of biochars and sorption of antibiotics to biochars has yet to be fully understood additionally considering the heterogeneous nature of biochar pore structures sorption of antibiotics may need a longer time to reach a true equilibrium kasozi et al 2010 reported that the sorption kinetics of catechol on biochars reached equilibrium after 14 days chen et al 2012 found that the sorption of naphthalene to biochars could take up to 36 days to reach equilibrium depending on pyrolysis temperature of biochars our previous study showed that lincomycin sorption to biochars quickly reached a quasi equilibrium in about 2 days but did not reach the true equilibrium even after 180 days liu et al 2016 for most antibiotics that have been studied the reported sorption equilibration time with biochars was generally varied from several hours to a few days feng et al 2015 huang et al 2017 lian et al 2014 pan et al 2012 shang et al 2016 wang et al 2017b wu et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 thus some of those sorption experiments may have only reached a quasi equilibrium during such an equilibration time that may be too short for certain antibiotics considering their ongoing sorption over the long term consequently the contribution of pore diffusion to the overall sorption may be underestimated due to short equilibration times furthermore biochars could release a substantial amount of dissolved organic carbon doc including truly dissolved and colloidal doc upon exposure to water lin et al 2012 mukherjee and zimmerman 2013 qu et al 2016 smith et al 2016 zimmerman and gao 2013 which may change the biochar surface and pore structure for example these water soluble organic compounds i e doc may initially fill up the biochar pores during pyrolysis or adsorb on the biochar surface thus blocking the sorptive sites for organic contaminants wang et al 2017a the released doc from biochars hereafter denoted as biochar doc may enhance the sorption of antibiotics to biochars however the effect of long term doc release from biochars on their sorption capacity for antibiotics has not been well studied therefore this study aimed to examine 1 the long term sequestration of antibiotics by biochars and 2 the effect of the long term biochar doc release on the sorption of antibiotics to biochars lincomycin was selected in this study because it is one of the most widely used antibiotics in food animal production and is also medically important in human therapy van epps and blaney 2016 zhang et al 2015 lincomycin is relatively resistant to environmental degradation andreozzi et al 2006 loftin et al 2008 and has been frequently detected in soil and water kolpin et al 2002 watanabe et al 2010 the long term sorption kinetics and isotherms of lincomycin by 17 slow pyrolysis biochars prepared from 7 manure feedstocks at 300 600 c and one wood feedstock at 500 c were evaluated to elucidate the underlying sorption mechanisms along with the release of biochar doc the applied initial concentrations of lincomycin were in the range of 100 1000 μg l 1 which have been detected in livestock wastewaters sim et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 in addition a commercial graphite powder was selected to represent the sorption of lincomycin on nonporous carbonaceous sorbents as compared to porous biochars 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals lincomycin hydrochloride 90 and sodium azide nan3 99 5 were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and

slowly pyrolyzed in a n2 atmosphere at 300 400 500 or 600 c with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 and a retention time of 15 20 min the produced biochars were ground and sieved to obtain particles in the 75 150 μm size fraction and then stored in glass vials prior to use the fine particle size fraction of biochars was selected because biochars had a wide particle size distribution ranging from

selected as model biochars representing poorly and highly carbonized biochars respectively for further studying the characteristics of biochar particles after water exposure the shape and surface morphology of bm300 and bm600 particles before and after 1 d and 365 d kinetic sorption experiments described later and 1 d exposure to 0 1 m naoh solution as described in supplementary material s1 were investigated with a jsm 7500 f scanning electron microscope sem jeol akishima tokyo japan the particle size distribution of bm300 and bm600 particles in suspensions was determined by dynamic light scattering method using the zetasizer 2 4 sorption experiments batch sorption experiments were conducted in amber borosilicate glass vials with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe lined screw caps kimble vineland nj usa all vials were covered with aluminum foils to prevent any potential photodegradation of lincomycin the lincomycin solutions were freshly prepared in di water with ionic strength of 0 02 m and ph of 10 using background electrolytes of 6 7 mm nacl 2 5 mm na2co3 and 2 5 mm nahco3 a biocide nan3 of 200 mg l 1 was included to prevent any biodegradation of lincomycin during the long term sorption experiments as nonelectrostatic sorption free of solution ph and ionic strength effect is more useful for estimating lincomycin sequestration capacity of biochars this study used solution ph of 10 at which lincomycin is neutral and mainly reacts with biochar surfaces via nonelectrostatic interactions liu et al 2016 all sorption experiments were performed in duplicate at room temperature 23 1 c and a sorbent water ratio of 1 g l 1 the above experimental condition and setup for the batch sorption studies were followed unless noted otherwise for the kinetic sorption experiments 8 mg of each sorbent were mixed with 8 ml of 1000 μg l 1 lincomycin in 8 ml vials and then agitated on an end over end shaker glas col terre haute in usa at 30 rpm in dark for the duration of 1 365 days at pre determined time intervals two vials for each sorbent were retrieved from the shaker the vials were centrifuged at 2430 g for 20 min at room temperature and the top 2 ml of supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose esters syringe filter millipore burlington ma usa the first 1 ml filtrate was discarded and the following 1 ml filtrate was collected to minimize the potential loss of lincomycin sorbed by the filter the concentrations of lincomycin in the filtrate was determined by a shimadzu prominence high performance liquid chromatograph columbia md usa coupled to an applied biosystems sciex 3200 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer foster city ca usa lc ms ms chuang et al 2015 in agreement with our previous study liu et al 2016 the sorbent free control experiments showed a negligible loss of lincomycin during the experiments fig s1 and there were no degradation products calza et al 2012 detected in the filtrates of sorbent free control experiments bm300 and bm600 at day 365 using precursor ion scan mode by the tandem mass spectrometry therefore the difference between the initial and final solution concentrations was used to calculate the sorbed lincomycin concentration in the sorbents in addition the doc in the filtrate is operationally defined as biochar doc in this study because the filtrate volume was small and if diluted the biochar doc concentration could be below the detection limit of total organic carbon analyzer the concentration of biochar doc in the filtrate was determined by ultraviolet uv absorption at 254 nm and e 2 e 3 ratio the ratio of absorbance at 254 nm over absorbance at 365 nm on a varian cary 50 bio uv visible spectrophotometer varian palo alto ca usa using our recently developed method liu et al 2019 details of the lc ms ms and uv analytical protocols are provided in supplementary material the solution ph generally remained unchanged i e ph 10 0 1 during the long term sorption experiments for biochars however in the experiments with bm300 dm300 pm00 and ddm500 solution ph decreased to 9 1 0 3 after 365 days presumably due to the greater amount of biochar doc released into solution this study at ph of 10 is considered relevant to field soils because it may simulate the magnitude of doc release from biochars over a long period years thus allowing for assessing sorption properties of aged biochars in alkaline soils to conduct the quasi equilibrium sorption isotherms 8 mg of each sorbent were mixed with 8 ml lincomycin solutions with a series of initial concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 μg l 1 the suspensions were shaken end over end at 30 rpm in dark at 1 day 1 week 7 days 1 month 30 days and 1 year 365 days the vials were retrieved centrifuged filtered and determined for the lincomycin concentration by the lc ms ms as described previously 2 5 effects of biochar doc on lincomycin sorption to further elucidate the role of biochar doc on the sorption of lincomycin to biochars three additional experiments were performed as detailed in supplementary material s1 first the freely dissolved lincomycin and doc bound lincomycin in solutions were determined using the solid phase extraction method ding et al 2013 this experiment was performed for the doc concentration of 186 93 8 97 4 and 89 6 mg c l 1 extracted from bm300 dm300 pm300 and ddm500 respectively its results could allow us to evaluate the contribution of lincomycin bound with biochar doc to total lincomycin sorption and determine if the enhanced lincomycin sorption over time was due to the binding of lincomycin with biochar doc second the lincomycin sorption to a wood biochar ww500 was measured in the absence and the presence of biochar doc at 17 2 7 94 11 1 and 10 9 mg c l 1 extracted from bm300 dm300 pm300 and ddm500 respectively the control experiments without ww500 were also performed and the lincomycin concentrations in solution had no significant difference regardless of the presence of biochar doc during 60 days data not shown this experiment allowed us to evaluate the effect of free biochar doc in solution on lincomycin sorption to biochars finally to evaluate the change in the lincomycin sorption to biochars after the doc release each bm300 dm300 pm300 ddm500 and bm600 biochar was mixed with di water for 40 days or with 0 1 m naoh for 1 day only for bm300 bm600 and dm300 respectively the washed biochars were then separated from the washing solutions further rinsed with di water to remove any remaining doc and salts and freeze dried before being used in the kinetic sorption experiments as described earlier washing with di water removed 20 7 10 4 10 8 9 92 and 0 18 mg c g biochar of doc from bm300 dm300 pm300 ddm500 and bm600 biochars whereas 105 75 2 and 3 37 mg c g biochar of doc were removed from bm300 dm300 and bm600 biochars by 0 1 m naoh respectively 2 6 extraction of sorbed lincomycin from biochars single point batch extraction experiments were performed to test the extraction recovery of sorbed lincomycin on the biochars the sorbed lincomycin on the biochars after 240 day sorption equilibration was extracted using the ultrasonic assisted solvent extraction with an acetonitrile methanol mixture 8 2 by volume as described in supplementary material s1 2 7 mathematical modeling the experimental

rapid initial sorption wu et al 2009 at the final stage of several kinetic sorption experiments lincomycin concentrations in solution became either minimal or non detectable resulting in decreased

differences between experimental treatments were analyzed using one way anova with post hoc tukey test p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biochars the selected physicochemical properties of 17 tested slow pyrolysis biochars are shown in table s2 in supplementary material the effect of pyrolysis temperature on physicochemical properties of tested biochars was generally consistent with previous findings chen et al 2008 keiluweit et al 2010 except for pm biochars due to their higher ash content table s2 and fig s2 volatile matter content 25 7 55 5 decreased whereas fixed carbon content 0 62 1 and ash content 7 7 58 5 increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature due to increased carbonization of biomass at higher pyrolysis temperature antal and gronli 2003 keiluweit et al 2010 the volatile matter and fixed carbon contents could approximate the easily mineralizable and persistent fractions of biochars respectively keiluweit et al 2010 in addition the biochars produced from pm cdm and cdmw had a greater ash content 32 0 55 8 than that from bm dm ddm and ww 7 70 18 8 which was attributed to mineral content in their feedstock bernal et al 2009 for biochars from the same feedstocks total c content 27 8 85 9 increased while total o 11 6 26 6 h 0 4 4 9 and n 0 4 2 6 contents decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature accordingly atomic ratios of h c 0 17 0 97 and o n c 0 13 0 52 decreased at higher pyrolysis temperature suggesting that high temperature biochars had more condensed aromatic structures and less polar functional groups chen et al 2008 chun et al 2004 keiluweit et al 2010 ssa 45 0 271 m2 g 1 and v mic 0 02 0 12 cm3 g 1 of the tested biochars generally increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature sem images of bm300 and bm600 revealed that biochar pores were irregular in shape and heterogeneous in pore size from nanometers to micrometers fig s3 finally zeta potential of tested biochars ranged from 64 to 43 mv at solution ph of 10 and ionic strength of 0 02 m table s2 indicating that the biochars carried net negative surface charge under the experimental conditions 3 2 long term sorption kinetics as shown in fig 1 and fig s1 lincomycin sorption onto the biochars occurred rapidly in the initial sorption phase within the first day followed by a slower sorption over the long term up to 365 days for all biochars the long term lincomycin sorption did not fully occupy all the sorption sites in the biochars i e reaching sorption saturation and continuously increased towards a point when dissolved lincomycin concentration in solution became minimal or non detectable defined as apparent sorption equilibrium here the lincomycin sorption kinetics approached an apparent sorption equilibrium within 365 days for most biochars except for bm500 pm400 pm500 and cdm500 approximately 7 34 of initially applied lincomycin was removed by the biochars after 1 day whereas up to 83 100 of that was removed by 365 days except for pm400 54 considering the porous nature of biochars the fast initial sorption was primarily attributed to the instantaneous or very rapid sorption on the external surface of biochars that provides readily accessible sorption sites for lincomycin the subsequent long term slow sorption was mainly caused by the relatively slower intraparticle diffusion into the internal biochar pore structures that provide abundant sorption sites but require longer time for lincomycin to access as lincomycin is relatively bulky non aromatic and flexible in its molecular structure table s1 its diffusion into the irregularly shaped biochar pores might be prolonged as a comparison the sorption of lincomycin onto the nonporous graphite reached a sorption equilibrium within 1 day and remained unchanged for 30 days due to the lack of pore structures fig s4 the significant difference in the sorption behaviors between the porous biochars and the nonporous graphite further supported that the sorption of lincomycin to the biochars was controlled by fast surface sorption in the short term and slow intraparticle diffusion in the long term the tested biochars had different sorption kinetics depending on the pyrolysis temperature and feedstock presumably due to the heterogeneity in their pore structures and surface chemistries overall the sorption kinetics decreased in the order bm300 bm400 bm600 bm500 fig 1a dm300 dm600 dm400 fig 1b and pm600 pm300 pm500 pm400 fig 1c and ddm500 ddm600 rdw500 ww500 cdmw500 cdm500 fig 1d specifically the biochars produced at the lowest and highest pyrolysis temperature i e 300 and 600 c generally had faster sorption kinetics and reached the apparent equilibrium more quickly than the biochars produced at intermediate pyrolysis temperature i e 400 500 c the sorption kinetics prior to the apparent sorption equilibrium were well fitted by the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model for all tested biochars table s3 the k id and c id values were in the range of 25 3 166 μg g 1 day 0 5 and 39 0 339 μg g 1 respectively interestingly the c id values showed a positive linear relationship fig 2 b while the k id values exhibited a u shaped relationship with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 600 c fig 2a for example the average c id values increased monotonically from 70 9 18 7 μg g 1 107 59 μg g 1 and 164 37 μg g 1 to 247 71 μg g 1 whereas the k id values followed the order of 300 c 110 56 μg g 1 day 0 5 600 c 59 5 19 8 μg g 1 day 0 5 500 c 48 8 10 3 μg g 1 day 0 5 400 c 45 8 18 6 μg g 1 day 0 5 for the biochars produced at 300 400 500 600 c respectively as the c id values represent the initial surface sorption this positive linear trend was expected because of the greater external surface area of higher temperature biochars than that of lower temperature biochars furthermore the observed u shaped relationship between k id and pyrolysis temperature was unique which cannot be explained by any measured physicochemical properties of biochars the greater k id of the higher temperature biochars might result from their greater ssa and v mic table s2 however the greater k id for the lower temperature 300 c biochars may be controlled by different mechanisms as elucidated later the r id values reflect the relative contribution of initial sorption and intraparticle diffusion to the total sorption wu et al 2009 the r id values closer to one indicate a dominant contribution from the intraparticle diffusion whereas the r id values closer to zero imply a primary contribution of initial sorption according to wu et al 2009 the lincomycin sorption kinetics of bm300 dm300 pm300 and pm400 can be classified as a weak initial sorption and strong intraparticle diffusion 1 0 r id 0 9 for the rest of the biochars produced at 400 500 and 600 c the lincomycin sorption kinetics can be classified as intermediate initial sorption and intraparticle diffusion 0 9 r id 0 5 the r id of all tested biochars ranged from 0 625 to 0 946 showing a negative correlation with pyrolysis temperature fig 2c thus the relative contribution of initial sorption was more pronounced for the high temperature biochars presumably due to their greater ssa table s2 as lincomycin exists as neutral species 100 pka 7 6 in aqueous solution under experimental ph of 10 is very hydrophilic and lacks π electron donor or acceptor moieties table s1 lincomycin sorption to biochars was unlikely due to hydrophobic partition electrostatic and π π eda interactions liu et al 2016 therefore h bonding van der waals forces and pore diffusion could reasonably be considered as possible mechanisms contributing to lincomycin sorption on biochars liu et al 2016 because lower temperature biochars contained more oxygen containing functional groups and lower ssa and micropore volume than higher temperature biochars the contribution of h bonding may be more important for lincomycin sorption to the low temperature biochars whereas the van der waals interaction may be more important for the high temperature biochars however the different relative contribution of h bonding and van der waals interactions in lincomycin sorption still cannot explain why the greater k id values were observed for the low temperature biochars than for the intermediate temperature biochars to further examine possible mechanisms for the above observation we hypothesized that the release of doc from biochars may play an important role in lincomycin sorption by biochars the long term release kinetics of doc from the tested biochars showed that the lower temperature biochars 300 400 c generally had greater release of doc than the higher temperature biochars 500 600 c except for ddm500 and ddm600 fig s5 the leachable biochar doc concentrations increased with decreasing pyrolysis temperature due to the greater labile carbon fraction in the lower temperature biochars fig s6a in addition the released doc from the lower temperature biochars generally had higher molecular weight as indicated by lower e 2 e 3 ratios de haan and de boer 1987 uyguner and bekbolet 2005 than higher temperature biochars fig s6b thus the continual and significant release of doc from lower temperature biochars probably enhanced their lincomycin sorption during the long term sorption to further investigate the observed enhancement of lincomycin sorption to the biochars of higher doc concentration more experiments were performed as discussed later 3 3 long term sorption isotherms the quasi equilibrium isotherms of lincomycin to the 17 biochars with contact time of 1 7 30 and 365 days were all nonlinear and exhibited a concave downward shape fig 3 and fig s7 all quasi equilibrium isotherm data could be fitted reasonably well to the freundlich model r 2 0 791 0 978 and rmse 6 21 92 6 μg g 1 table s4 the k d values were then calculated from the fitted freundlich parameters at c w 1 μg l 1 table s4 as expected for all biochars the k d values increased but the n values decreased with increasing equilibration time for example the n values decreased from 0 727 after 1 day to 0 424 after 30 days for bm300 and from 0 510 after 1 day to 0 325 after 365 days for bm600 fig 3a and d the lower n values i e more nonlinear observed at the longer equilibration time might suggest a more heterogeneous energy distribution of the sorption sites in the biochars sposito 1980 which could be explained by the greater contribution of intraparticle pore diffusion allowing lincomycin molecules to interact with more heterogeneous pore space and sorptive sites pignatello 2013 it should be noted that this interpretation was based on mathematical fitting of the sorption isotherms and more direct evidence on lincomycin interaction with surface sorption sites is needed in the future as a comparison the sorption isotherms of lincomycin for the nonporous graphite after 1 day and 30 days were almost identical with similar k d and n values due to the absence of intraparticle diffusion fig s4b this result further confirmed that the observed time dependent lincomycin sorption isotherms were caused by increasing contribution of intraparticle diffusion similar to the kinetic sorption data there was an equilibration time dependent relationship between k d or n values and pyrolysis temperature table s4 and fig s8 the k d values exhibited a positive linear relationship with pyrolysis temperature increasing from 300 to 600 c for the equilibration time after 1 day but gradually became the u shaped relationship as the equilibration time extended to 7 and 30 days fig s8a the n values exhibited a negative linear relationship with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 600 c for the equilibration time after 1 day but again gradually became an inverted u shaped relationship as the equilibration time increased to 7 and 30 days fig s8b the positive and negative linear relationship for k d and n with pyrolysis temperature after 1 day suggests that the lincomycin sorption to biochars became greater and more nonlinear at higher pyrolysis temperature presumably due to greater ssa and wider sorption site energy distribution on highly carbonized carbon domain for higher temperature i e 600 c biochar zhang et al 2011 interestingly at the longer equilibration time the lower temperature i e 300 c biochar had greater sorption affinity and nonlinearity likely resulting from enhanced intraparticle pore diffusion facilitated by the increasing release of biochar doc 3 4 effects of biochar doc on sorption we first hypothesized that lincomycin might bind with the biochar doc in solution if so lincomycin sorption to biochars could be overestimated when the doc bound lincomycin was included into the lincomycin sorption to biochars at the initial lincomycin concentration of 1000 μg l 1 15 6 0 5 8 and 3 0 of initially applied lincomycin was bound to doc bm300 doc dm300 doc pm300 and doc ddm500 of 186 93 8 97 4 and 89 6 mg c l 1 respectively the distribution coefficients of lincomycin to doc bm300 doc dm300 doc pm300 and doc ddm500 were 955 686 631 and 348 l kg c 1 respectively based on the biochar doc release kinetics fig s5 the biochar doc concentrations from day 1 to day 365 in the kinetic sorption experiments were 10 5 84 1 6 35 51 9 17 2 41 6 and 10 0 54 9 mg c l 1 for bm300 dm300 pm300 and ddm500 respectively even assuming all released biochar doc could bind with lincomycin in solution the fraction of the doc bound lincomycin was only 0 9 6 8 0 4 3 3 1 0 2 5 and 0 3 1 9 of the initially applied amount for doc bm300 doc dm300 doc pm300 and doc ddm500 respectively therefore the contribution of lincomycin sorption to biochar doc in solution could not explain the enhanced lincomycin sorption to biochars over time secondly we hypothesized that the biochar doc as co solute in solution might facilitate the lincomycin sorption to biochars however the presence of biochar doc as co solute inhibited the lincomycin sorption onto ww500 fig s9 compared with lincomycin sorption kinetics without biochar doc the fitted k id value decreased from 55 2 to 13 3 29 1 μg g 1 day 0 5 and the fitted c id value decreased from 178 to 70 5 85 6 μg g 1 in the presence of doc table s5 the extent of sorption suppression followed the order of doc bm300 doc pm300 doc dm300 doc ddm500 which generally but not completely agreed with the doc concentration trend doc bm300 doc dm300 doc ddm500 doc pm300 thus the inhibitory effect of biochar doc in solution depends on not only the concentration but also the chemical composition of biochar doc the observed slower diffusion rate and lower initial sorption confirmed that the biochar doc could not enhance the lincomycin sorption by itself on the contrary the biochar doc in solution strongly suppressed the lincomycin sorption by blocking the pore entrances i e decreased k id and or by competing for the external surface sorption sites i e decreased c id in biochars we finally tested the hypothesis that the long term release of biochar doc might gradually increase the accessibility of sorption sites on the external surface and in the biochar pore structure thus enhancing their sorption for lincomycin therefore the sorption kinetics of lincomycin by raw di washed and naoh washed biochars selected bm300 dm300 pm300 ddm500 bm600 were analyzed fig 4 fig s10 and table s6 apparently the removal of doc from the biochars bm300 dm300 pm300 and ddm500 substantially enhanced the lincomycin sorption kinetics fig 4 and fig s10 and the doc removal with naoh solution was more effective than that with di water for the enhancement of sorption kinetics for bm300 and dm300 because a greater amount of doc was removed fig 4a and b in addition the fitted k id and c id values both increased after the doc removal for these tested biochars table s6 for example the k id values were 160 166 and 176 μg g 1 day 0 5 and the c id values were 87 9 285 and 527 μg g 1 for bm300 raw bm300 di and bm300 naoh biochars respectively in contrast the enhancement of lincomycin sorption kinetics by the doc removal was very limited for bm600 due to its low doc content fig 4c the above observations confirmed that the long term release of doc from biochars could increase their sorption ability for lincomycin presumably because of increased accessibility to surface adsorption sites and pores initially blocked by biochar doc wang et al 2017a furthermore a close examination of sem images revealed that the biochar particles of low temperature biochars e g bm300 were disintegrated and the biochar particle size appeared to decrease after aging in 0 02 m background solution for 365 d and in 0 1 m naoh solution for 1 d presumably because of the doc release from the biochars fig s11 we further compared the size of biochar colloids by aging bm300 and bm600 biochars in either 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m nacl solution fig s12 the size of biochar colloids was much smaller in 0 1 m naoh than in 0 1 m nacl for bm300 whereas no obvious difference was observed for bm600 the decrease in particle size of bm300 after the doc removal suggested that the surface sorption sites and pores initially located in deeper biochar pores could become accessible for lincomycin sorption after the breakdown of biochar particles and thus further facilitated the sorption kinetics considering that bm600 was highly carbonized and had a relatively low doc content and rigid pore structure the doc removal would not substantially alter the surface sorption sites and pore structure of bm600 resulting in minimal enhancement of the sorption kinetics in summary these results supported the interpretation that the substantial release of biochar doc enhanced the long term lincomycin sorption on biochars through increasing accessibility of sorption sites initially blocked by doc as well as decreasing biochar particle sizes 3 5 extraction of sorbed lincomycin from biochars as shown in fig 5 a the extraction recoveries of lincomycin for all tested biochars were generally low and ranged from the lowest of 0 02 for bm300 to the highest of 24 7 for pm500 thus the long term sorbed lincomycin on the biochars could be highly resistant to desorption in addition the extraction recoveries exhibited a negative logarithmic correlation with the k id r 2 0 721 fig 5b implying that faster pore diffusion would cause lower extraction recoveries furthermore the results from an additional sorption extraction experiment for dm600 biochar described in supplementary material revealed that the extraction recoveries decreased from 62 4 6 3 28 4 5 9 to 8 75 0 47 as sorption equilibration time increased from 1 4 to 30 days fig s13 these observations were presumably because lincomycin may diffuse deeper into the biochar pores and become trapped in the narrower pores by either faster diffusion rate or longer diffusion time resulting in a lower extraction recovery from the standpoint of soil biochar amendment for contaminant immobilization the observed strong sorption and low extraction recovery for lincomycin may be desirable because the sorbed lincomycin would tend to remain within the biochars over the long term thus reducing the mobility and bioavailability of lincomycin in soils 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the slow pyrolysis biochars produced at 300 600 c could strongly sequester lincomycin from water over the long term the long term lincomycin sorption kinetics on the biochars were governed by fast surface sorption and slow intraparticle pore diffusion specially the biochars produced at 300 and 600 c generally exhibited faster lincomycin sorption kinetics than the biochars produced at 400 500 c the faster sorption kinetics for the biochars produced at 600 c could be attributed to their greater specific surface area and pore volume whereas for the biochars produced at 300 c it was due to the long term release of biochar doc the substantial and continuous release of doc from biochars could enhance the lincomycin sorption because of increased accessibility of sorption sites initially blocked by doc on the external surface and in pore structure as well as decreased biochar particle sizes the quasi equilibrium sorption isotherms were more nonlinear for high temperature biochars due to the wider energy distribution of sorption sites on their surfaces the sorption isotherms also became increasingly nonlinear with increasing equilibration time likely resulting from the release of biochar doc in addition lincomycin sequestered in the biochars had a low extraction recovery presumably because lincomycin was strongly trapped within biochar pores we have previously proposed that sequestering antibiotics by biochars produced from animal manure may be a novel strategy for managing animal manures and manure borne antibiotics liu et al 2016 using manure as feedstock to produce biochars could destroy any microbial pathogen and antibiotics via pyrolysis i e 300 600 c the produced biochars could be applied in soils to reduce the mobility and bioavailability of anthropogenic antibiotics in water flows under the same tested concentration range 0 1000 μg l 1 the observed k d values of lincomycin i e c w 1 μg l 1 on tested biochars after either 1 day 0 827 15 4 l g 1 or 365 days 20 5 454 l g 1 were greater than the previously reported k d values for whole soils 0 00 0 476 l g 1 wang et al 2012 it should be noted that this study was limited to alkaline condition ph 10 and is thus most relevant for alkaline soils the release of doc from biochars in alkaline soils via aging could further enhance the sorption of antibiotics coupled with the strong irreversible sorption biochars are a promising soil amendment for enhancing both short and long term sequestration of antibiotics and reducing the mobility and bioavailability of antibiotics in soils future studies should investigate contaminant sorption properties of biochars that are aged in a variety of soils of different ph declaration of interests the authors declare that

18683,today two types of lamp systems dominate the uv disinfection industry low pressure lp uv lamps and medium pressure mp polychromatic lamps both lamp types have their advantages and disadvantages in microorganism inactivation with lp lamps being cheaper having longer life and working at lower temperature hence reducing fouling and mp lamps showing better inactivation per germicidal dose for certain microorganisms bacterium based biosensors were used to compare lp and mp irradiation these biosensors were escherichia coli bacteria carrying the lux operon genes under the control of different stress responding promoters where activation of the specific promoter is manifested as bioluminescence mp irradiation considerably more than lp irradiation resulted in activation of the superoxide dismutase expression indicating the formation of superoxide radicals inside the cells accordingly pre exposure immunization of the bacteria to an activator that produces superoxide radicals resulted in lower inactivation and increased resistance to mp irradiation but not to lp irradiation this study shows that the difference in germicidal efficiency may result from the production of intracellular superoxide radicals by mp irradiation at wavelengths other than 254 nm as emitted by lp lamps graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv disinfection superoxide radical bacteria mechanism bioreporter 1 introduction ultraviolet uv irradiation is a well established technology for disinfecting water contaminated with pathogens malayeri et al 2006 two lamp types are routinely used for this purpose i low pressure lp lamps including lp high output lpho lamps hereafter termed lp emitting nearly monochromatic light at 254 nm and ii medium pressure mp polychromatic lamps emitting light with peaks at multiple wavelengths among them 254 nm each lamp type has advantages and disadvantages mp systems require fewer lamps for the same photon flux whereas lp reactors are cheaper require shorter warm up time operate at lower temperatures 150 200 c for lp vs 600 950 c for mp resulting in less fouling require less frequent expensive sleeve cleaning and have a longer lamp life up to 16 000 h for lp vs 8000 for mp cotton and bolton 2008 in addition lp lamps display better conversion of energy to uvc photons 30 35 for lp vs 12 16 for mp as lp lamps emit photons almost exclusively in the uvc range whereas mp lamps emit photons at multiple non germicidal wavelengths chen et al 2009 mamane gravetz et al 2005 both lp and mp irradiation results in dna damage including the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers mainly thymine dimers and pyrimidine pyrimidone 6 4 photoproducts friedberg et al 1995 mitchell and nairn 1989 even though the lp irradiation peak shows better overlap with the maximum absorbance spectrum of nucleic acids i e dna and rna dna has an absorbance peak in the range of 250 262 nm and lp has an emission peak at 254 nm mp lamps have been shown to exert higher inactivation with less subsequent photorecovery for many microorganisms chen et al 2015 eischeid et al 2009 gayán et al 2014 quek and hu 2008 zimmer and slawson 2002 zimmer thomas et al 2007 microorganisms live in a constantly changing environment and have evolved diverse stress response mechanisms storz and hengge 2011 many of these mechanisms are based on the elevation of specific genes expression gene expression is the production of the protein enzyme encoded by these genes and is driven by the activation of regulatory dna elements preceding these genes i e promoters a region of dna responsible for transcribing a specific gene or gene group activation of the promoter induces the transcription of this gene into messenger rna followed by translation of the latter into a protein whose function is expected to counteract the deleterious effects of the inducing stress aharoni et al 2018 boor 2006 this process may be easily monitored by connecting the dna region of the promoters to a reporter gene a gene or set of genes that codes for a protein that harbors an activity that can be easily quantified e g luminescence reporter genes inserting this promoter reporter gene fusion

contain the luxcdabe operon dna segment the reporter gene fused to a different stress response promoter activation of the specific promoter by stress is manifested by luminescence the result of the luxcdabe proteins the cells were exposed to sublethal mp or lp irradiation and the level of activation of the specific promoter was quantified the activation of the specific promoter allows elucidating the existence of the specific stress and therefore the intracellular mechanism underlying the effects of the lamp type from the bacteria point of view 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the reporter gene approach was used to test for activation of stress responsive genes by exposure to lp and or mp uv lamps and thus examine the difference between these two light sources from a bacterial point of view non preinduced and preinduced e coli were exposed to the two uv light sources where the preinduced e coli were subjected to a chemical activator prior to uv irradiation the layout for the experimental design is presented in fig 1 unless otherwise noted all experiments were done in triplicates and data presented as average sd 2 2 measurements of uv lamp irradiation spectrum and average incident irradiance uv exposure experiments were carried out using a bench scale uv collimated beam apparatus cba the uv irradiation fluence rate was directed through a circular opening collimated tube to provide incident radiation normal to the surface of the tested water suspension the lp and mp experiments were carried out using a 43 w lp lamp trojan

placed in the same x y position as the center of the crystallization dish and at the surface of the liquid suspension integrated average incident germicidal irradiance for the lp and mp lamp was calculated according to bolton and linden 2003 using the spectral incident irradiance obtained by the spectroradiometer for the 250 262 and 220 300 nm range a neutral density nd filter ofr nj usa with

then divided into two identical batches 70 ml each the appropriate activator for each biosensor activator type and concentration for each biosensor as listed in table 1 was added to one sample while 1

bacterial pellet was washed two times using 1 dpbs 10 and resuspended in the same buffer to working bacterial solutions of 108 cfu ml irradiation with lp or mp cba was done as in section 2 7 i e 30 ml

results and discussion 3 1 the irradiation source and biosensor system fig 3 illustrates the spectral incident irradiance for the lp and mp lamps showing the nearly monochromatic output of the lp lamp single peak at 254 nm in contrast to the polychromatic output of the mp lamp e coli based biosensors carrying a plasmid containing the luxcdabe operon as the reporter gene fused to different stress response promoters were used to identify the type of stress exerted on the bacterial cells exposed to sublethal mp or lp irradiation and quantify its intensity 3 2 inactivation of e coli by lp and mp irradiation fig 4 illustrates the inactivation of e coli by lp and mp lamps irradiation by the mp lamp resulted in higher inactivation of e coli per germicidal dose these results are in good agreement with the results of zimmer and slawson 2002 and hu et al 2005 for e coli improved inactivation by mp has also been shown previously for enterococcus faecalis chen et al 2015 mycobacterium terrae when colony forming ability was used bohrerova and linden 2006 and even for cryptosporidium parvum zimmer et al 2003 and for some viruses calicivirus bovine ms2 phage hijne et al 2006 our results are in apparent divergence from the results of guo et al 2009 and oguma et al 2002 but irradiation doses used in those experiments were based on bio dosimetry i e adjusted to achieve similar inactivation making comparison difficult 3 3 activation of the preca psoda and pkatg promoters by lp and mp irradiation for physiological studies it is essential to work with uv doses that result in no more than 1 log inactivation yet can affect gene induction in accordance with fig 4 to achieve such conditions subsequent experiments were conducted with a germicidal uv dose of 2 and 4 mj cm2 for mp and lp lamps respectively fig 5 a shows the normalized luminescence of the reca based bioreporter after irradiation by mp lamp for different uv doses as a function of post exposure time it is evident that under sublethal conditions as the uv dose accumulates luminescence intensity increases leveling off at around 3 2 mj cm2 the mp uv dose that results in 1 7 log inactivation fig 4 it is also worth noting that the onset of luminescence increase and the time to reach maximum luminescence are longer at higher irradiation intensities fig 5a suggesting more intensive dna damage causing a delayed response as well as longer activation of the preca promoter causing prolonged expression of reca in good agreement with the reca enzyme involvement in correcting dna damage after uv damage michel and sandler 2017 fig 5b shows activation of the preca promoter as fold increase relative to the non uv irradiated sample preca activation was similar for both lamp types fig 5b indicating that both lamp types induce dna damage in contrast activation of the psoda promoter responsible for the expression of the superoxide dismutase enzyme and removal of superoxide radicals was considerably higher following mp irradiation indicating the more intensive formation of intracellular superoxide radicals by this lamp fig 5c in contrast to preca and psoda the pkatg promoter responsible for the expression of the catalase katg and removal of h2o2 was induced only slightly by mp irradiation suggesting that h2o2 does not accumulate under these conditions fig 5d as a control addition of 5 ppm h2o2 caused significant induction suggesting that low promoter activity is not the reason for the low irradiation effect the pronounced activation of psoda by mp irradiation fig 5c suggested the formation of superoxide radicals to validate this hypothesis the bacteria were immunized to superoxide radicals by pre incubation with low levels of methyl viologen mv 0 3 ppm prior to uv irradiation mv induces superoxide formation in the cells nanni et al 1981 table 1 leading to expression of the sod enzyme without inactivating the cells data not shown when the immunized cells were tested for activation of the psoda promoter by either mp irradiation or addition of 10 ppm mv lower activation was evident fig 6 a as a result of pre expression of the sod enzyme induced by the presence of superoxide radicals due to the mv addition when the inactivation of immunized cells by mp fig 6b or lp fig 6c irradiation was examined preinduction resulted in significantly lower inactivation by mp irradiation but not by lp irradiation which yielded similar or higher inactivation the formation of a low level of superoxide radicals in the cells and the resulting activation of the sod defense system apparently protect the cells from mp but not lp irradiation interestingly although preinduction of the rfm443 preca bioreporter with nalidixic acid did result in lower activation of the reca promoter evident of successful preinduction no immunization to mp or lp irradiation was observed data not shown 3 4 direct validation of superoxide formation by lp mp irradiation to confirm the results of the p soda activation a direct chemical assay was used to detect the formation of superoxide radicals inside the cells cellrox green reagent a fluorogenic probe designed to measure oxidative stress in liv cell was used this cell permeable dye is weakly fluorescent while in a reduced state and upon oxidation by ros exhibits strong fluorogenic signal and subsequent binding to dna previously mcbee et al 2017 it was demonstrated to react with superoxide but not with hydrogen peroxide making this dye specific both to in cell radicals due to the need for dna binding and to superoxide compared to the non irradiated cells the fluorescence has increased by 12 after lp irradiation and by 111 after mp irradiation both 38 mj cm2 demonstrating that indeed mp irradiation produces much more superoxide radicals inside the cells 4 conclusions and recommendations uv irradiation is frequently used to disinfect water contaminated with pathogens the common dogma assumes that inactivation by uv irradiation is affected by direct dna damage i e thymine dimers and other pyrimidine dimers however this does not explain the frequently demonstrated differences in germicidal efficiency of lp and mp uv lamps the germicidal efficiency at different wavelengths both for e coli and other microorganisms was demonstrated between 220 and 270 nm bolton 2019 wang et al 2005 with dna damage predominant at wavelengths below 300 nm besaratiniain et al 2011 furthermore this dogma does not consider the effect of irradiation at different wavelengths on proteins as demonstrated by beck et al 2018 or the apparent conflict in the results presented by bohrerova and linden 2006 where higher inactivation by mp was observed when colony forming units where used but no difference was noted for endonuclease sensitive site assay the present study shows a significant induction of the psoda promoter and intracellular superoxide radical formation by exposure to mp but much less by lp irradiation most probably by wavelength s other than 254 nm the data suggest that superoxide radicals are formed inside the bacterial cells as these radicals are short living 0 6 s korshunov and imlay 2006 and cannot pass biological membranes at ph 7 korshunov and imlay 2002 this is supported by the cellrox results as this reagent fluoresce only after binding to dna the origin of these radicals is probably due to the interaction of irradiation with cytoplasmic proteins production of superoxide radicals by uv irradiation of amino acids and especially tryptophan has been previously demonstrated on both single amino acids mccormick and thomason 1978 and proteins dreaden et al 2011 as proteins are a key component in all cells 16 of wet weight in e coli milo et al 2010 and as tryptophan is abundant in e coli proteins its oxidation by mp irradiation could result in the formation of abundant superoxide radicals once formed these radicals can affect many cellular components other than nucleic acids e g proteins cell membranes and small molecules that are essential for many cell activities indeed preinduction of low levels of superoxide radicals by short exposure of the bacteria to a low level of mv resulted in enhanced resistance to mp but not lp irradiation supporting the hypothesis that mp irradiation produces superoxide radicals this effect of pre exposure can explain the enhanced resistance of legionella pneumophila oguma et al 2004 and mycobacterium terrae bohrerova and linden 2006 to mp irradiation as both these bacterial species are naturally associated with amoeba living inside its digestive organ the phagosome an environment rich with superoxide amer and swanson 2002 salah et al 2009 given this habitat it is likely that these bacteria have evolved effective mechanisms for removal of such radicals although data on the endogenous radicals in these bacteria is lacking furthermore the results presented here suggest that other pre exposure to superoxide producing processes such as exposure to solar irradiation cunningham et al 1985 e g in open water ponds could result in the development of bacteria that are more resistant to uv thus requiring higher uv doses for inactivation these processes can explain the reported increased uv resistance of environmental bacteria compared to lab grown strains hijnen et al 2006 declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known financial competing interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was supported by a

18683,today two types of lamp systems dominate the uv disinfection industry low pressure lp uv lamps and medium pressure mp polychromatic lamps both lamp types have their advantages and disadvantages in microorganism inactivation with lp lamps being cheaper having longer life and working at lower temperature hence reducing fouling and mp lamps showing better inactivation per germicidal dose for certain microorganisms bacterium based biosensors were used to compare lp and mp irradiation these biosensors were escherichia coli bacteria carrying the lux operon genes under the control of different stress responding promoters where activation of the specific promoter is manifested as bioluminescence mp irradiation considerably more than lp irradiation resulted in activation of the superoxide dismutase expression indicating the formation of superoxide radicals inside the cells accordingly pre exposure immunization of the bacteria to an activator that produces superoxide radicals resulted in lower inactivation and increased resistance to mp irradiation but not to lp irradiation this study shows that the difference in germicidal efficiency may result from the production of intracellular superoxide radicals by mp irradiation at wavelengths other than 254 nm as emitted by lp lamps graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv disinfection superoxide radical bacteria mechanism bioreporter 1 introduction ultraviolet uv irradiation is a well established technology for disinfecting water contaminated with pathogens malayeri et al 2006 two lamp types are routinely used for this purpose i low pressure lp lamps including lp high output lpho lamps hereafter termed lp emitting nearly monochromatic light at 254 nm and ii medium pressure mp polychromatic lamps emitting light with peaks at multiple wavelengths among them 254 nm each lamp type has advantages and disadvantages mp systems require fewer lamps for the same photon flux whereas lp reactors are cheaper require shorter warm up time operate at lower temperatures 150 200 c for lp vs 600 950 c for mp resulting in less fouling require less frequent expensive sleeve cleaning and have a longer lamp life up to 16 000 h for lp vs 8000 for mp cotton and bolton 2008 in addition lp lamps display better conversion of energy to uvc photons 30 35 for lp vs 12 16 for mp as lp lamps emit photons almost exclusively in the uvc range whereas mp lamps emit photons at multiple non germicidal wavelengths chen et al 2009 mamane gravetz et al 2005 both lp and mp irradiation results in dna damage including the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers mainly thymine dimers and pyrimidine pyrimidone 6 4 photoproducts friedberg et al 1995 mitchell and nairn 1989 even though the lp irradiation peak shows better overlap with the maximum absorbance spectrum of nucleic acids i e dna and rna dna has an absorbance peak in the range of 250 262 nm and lp has an emission peak at 254 nm mp lamps have been shown to exert higher inactivation with less subsequent photorecovery for many microorganisms chen et al 2015 eischeid et al 2009 gayán et al 2014 quek and hu 2008 zimmer and slawson 2002 zimmer thomas et al 2007 microorganisms live in a constantly changing environment and have evolved diverse stress response mechanisms storz and hengge 2011 many of these mechanisms are based on the elevation of specific genes expression gene expression is the production of the protein enzyme encoded by these genes and is driven by the activation of regulatory dna elements preceding these genes i e promoters a region of dna responsible for transcribing a specific gene or gene group activation of the promoter induces the transcription of this gene into messenger rna followed by translation of the latter into a protein whose function is expected to counteract the deleterious effects of the inducing stress aharoni et al 2018 boor 2006 this process may be easily monitored by connecting the dna region of the promoters to a reporter gene a gene or set of genes that codes for a protein that harbors an activity that can be easily quantified e g luminescence reporter genes inserting this promoter reporter gene fusion dna to a bacteria results in a bio engineered bacterial bioreporter that emits light once the bioreporter organism is subjected to the specific stress due to the expression of the defense mechanism allard and kopish 2008 jiang et al 2008 van der meer and belkin 2010 elad and belkin 2017 uv irradiation results in direct dna damage and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are the principal dna lesions besaratiniain et al 2011 in addition uv irradiation is involved in uvb damage to the skin via production of reactive oxygen species heck et al 2003 and very high doses of uva were shown to effect electron transport chains bosshard et al 2010a b in this study escherichia coli based bioreporters were used each such bioreporter is composed of e coli cells carrying a plasmid a mini chromosome that contain the luxcdabe operon dna segment the reporter gene fused to a different stress response promoter activation of the specific promoter by stress is manifested by luminescence the result of the luxcdabe proteins the cells were exposed to sublethal mp or lp irradiation and the level of activation of the specific promoter was quantified the activation of the specific promoter allows elucidating the existence of the specific stress and therefore the intracellular mechanism underlying the effects of the lamp type from the bacteria point of view 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the reporter gene approach was used to test for activation of stress responsive genes by exposure to lp and or mp uv lamps and thus examine the difference between these two light sources from a bacterial point of view non preinduced and preinduced e coli were exposed to the two uv light sources where the preinduced e coli were subjected to a chemical activator prior to uv irradiation the layout for the experimental design is presented in fig 1 unless otherwise noted all experiments were done in triplicates and data presented as average sd 2 2 measurements of uv lamp irradiation spectrum and average incident irradiance uv exposure experiments were carried out using a bench scale uv collimated beam apparatus cba the uv irradiation fluence rate was directed through

placed in the same x y position as the center of the crystallization dish and at the surface of the liquid suspension integrated average incident germicidal irradiance for the lp and mp lamp was calculated according to bolton and linden 2003 using the spectral incident irradiance obtained by the spectroradiometer for the 250 262 and 220 300 nm range a neutral density nd filter ofr nj usa with 1 transmission cat fdu 2 0 was placed in the lp and mp light paths to reduce the incident irradiance thereby enabling sublethal inactivation i e less than 1 log inactivation the transmission curve for the nd filter was measured with the same spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment diffuse reflectance accessory dra ca 3330 labsphere to ensure no change in spectrum the incidence irradiances with the nd filter were 0 0045 and 0 004 mw cm2 for lp and mp respectively at 250 262 nm and 0 0045 and 0 018 mw cm2 for lp and mp respectively at 220 300 nm the average incidence irradiance was calculated using trapezoidal integration taking into account the water factors i e spectral absorbance of the tested water suspension reflectance factor 0 975 and petri factor 0 94 for mp and 0 97 for lp the spectral absorbance of the tested water suspension was obtained via a uv vis spectrophotometer cary bio100 varian inc germicidal average incidence irradiance was calculated by multiplying the average incidence irradiance by the relative dna absorbance to obtain the average germicidal irradiance with nd filter fdu 2 0 0 003 and 0 0025 mw cm2 for lp and mp respectively at 250 262 nm and 0 003 and 0 006 mw cm2 for lp and mp respectively at 220 300 nm which can then be multiplied by exposure time to obtain germicidal dose fluence dna absorbance is commonly used to obtain germicidal effectiveness 2 3 bioreporters and growth conditions the bioreporters in this study were e coli strains each carrying a plasmid in which the photorhabdus luminescens

respectively fig 5 a shows the normalized luminescence of the reca based bioreporter after irradiation by mp lamp for different uv doses as a function of post exposure time it is evident that under sublethal conditions as the uv dose accumulates luminescence intensity increases leveling off at around 3 2 mj cm2 the mp uv dose that results in 1 7 log inactivation fig 4 it is also worth noting that the onset of luminescence increase and the time to reach maximum luminescence are longer at higher irradiation intensities fig 5a suggesting more intensive dna damage causing a delayed response as well as longer activation of the preca promoter causing prolonged expression of reca in good agreement with the reca enzyme involvement in correcting dna damage after uv damage michel and sandler 2017 fig 5b shows activation of the preca promoter as fold increase relative to the non uv irradiated sample preca activation was similar for both lamp types fig 5b indicating that both lamp types induce dna damage in contrast activation of the psoda promoter responsible for the expression of the superoxide dismutase enzyme and removal of superoxide radicals was considerably higher following mp irradiation indicating the more intensive formation of intracellular superoxide radicals by this lamp fig 5c in contrast to preca and psoda the pkatg promoter responsible for the expression of the catalase katg and removal of h2o2 was induced only slightly by mp irradiation suggesting that h2o2 does not accumulate under these conditions fig 5d as a control addition of 5 ppm h2o2 caused significant induction suggesting that low promoter activity is not the reason for the low irradiation effect the pronounced activation of psoda by mp irradiation fig 5c suggested the formation of superoxide radicals to validate this hypothesis the bacteria were immunized to superoxide radicals by pre incubation with low levels of methyl viologen mv 0 3 ppm prior to uv irradiation mv induces superoxide formation in the cells nanni et al 1981 table 1 leading to expression of the sod enzyme without inactivating the cells data not shown when the immunized cells were tested for activation of the psoda promoter by either mp irradiation or addition of 10 ppm mv lower activation was evident fig 6 a as a result of pre expression of the sod enzyme induced by the presence of superoxide radicals due to the mv addition when the inactivation of immunized cells by mp fig 6b or lp fig 6c irradiation was examined preinduction resulted in significantly lower inactivation by mp irradiation but not by lp irradiation which yielded similar or higher inactivation the formation of a low level of superoxide radicals in the cells and the resulting activation of the sod defense system apparently protect the cells from mp but not lp irradiation interestingly although preinduction of the rfm443 preca bioreporter with nalidixic acid did result in lower activation of the reca promoter evident of successful preinduction no immunization to mp or lp irradiation was observed data not shown 3 4 direct validation of superoxide formation by lp mp irradiation to confirm the results of the p soda activation a direct chemical assay was used to detect the formation of superoxide radicals inside the cells cellrox green reagent a fluorogenic probe designed to measure oxidative stress in liv cell was used this cell permeable dye is weakly fluorescent while in a reduced state and upon oxidation by ros exhibits strong fluorogenic signal and subsequent binding to dna previously mcbee et al 2017 it was demonstrated to react with superoxide but not with hydrogen peroxide making this dye specific both to in cell radicals due to the need for dna binding and to superoxide compared to the non irradiated cells the fluorescence has increased by 12 after lp irradiation and by 111 after mp irradiation both 38 mj cm2 demonstrating that indeed mp irradiation produces much more superoxide radicals inside the cells 4 conclusions and recommendations uv irradiation is frequently used to disinfect water contaminated with pathogens the common dogma assumes that inactivation by uv irradiation is affected by direct dna damage i e thymine dimers and other pyrimidine dimers however this does not explain the frequently demonstrated differences in germicidal efficiency of lp and mp uv lamps the germicidal efficiency at different wavelengths both for e coli and other microorganisms was demonstrated between 220 and 270 nm bolton 2019 wang et al 2005 with dna damage predominant at wavelengths below 300 nm besaratiniain et al 2011 furthermore this dogma does not consider the effect of irradiation at different wavelengths on proteins as demonstrated by beck et al 2018 or the apparent conflict in the results presented by bohrerova and linden 2006 where higher inactivation by mp was observed when colony forming units where used but no difference was noted for endonuclease sensitive site assay the present study shows a significant induction of the psoda promoter and intracellular superoxide radical formation by exposure to mp but much less by lp irradiation most probably by wavelength s other than 254 nm the data suggest that superoxide radicals are formed inside the bacterial cells as these radicals are short living 0 6 s korshunov and imlay 2006 and cannot pass biological membranes at ph 7 korshunov and imlay 2002 this is supported by the cellrox results as this reagent fluoresce only after binding to dna the origin of these radicals is probably due to the interaction of irradiation with cytoplasmic proteins production of superoxide radicals by uv irradiation of amino acids and especially tryptophan has been previously demonstrated on both single amino acids mccormick and thomason 1978 and proteins dreaden et al 2011 as proteins are a key component in all cells 16 of wet weight in e coli milo et al 2010 and as tryptophan is abundant in e coli proteins its oxidation by mp irradiation could result in the formation of abundant superoxide radicals once formed these radicals can affect many cellular components other than nucleic acids e g proteins cell membranes and small molecules that are essential for many cell activities indeed preinduction of low levels of superoxide radicals by short exposure of the bacteria to a low level of mv resulted in enhanced resistance to mp but not lp irradiation supporting the hypothesis that mp irradiation produces superoxide radicals this effect of pre exposure can explain the enhanced resistance of legionella pneumophila oguma et al 2004 and mycobacterium terrae bohrerova and linden 2006 to mp irradiation as both these bacterial species are naturally associated with amoeba living inside its digestive organ the phagosome an environment rich with superoxide amer and swanson 2002 salah et al 2009 given this habitat it is likely that these bacteria have evolved effective mechanisms for removal of such radicals although data on the endogenous radicals in these bacteria is lacking furthermore the results presented here suggest that other pre exposure to superoxide producing processes such as exposure to solar irradiation cunningham et al 1985 e g in open water ponds could result in the development of bacteria that are more resistant to uv thus requiring higher uv doses for inactivation these processes can explain the reported increased uv resistance of environmental bacteria compared to lab grown strains hijnen et al 2006 declaration of interests the authors declare

18684,the development of a new class of carbon electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction reaction nrr that have high activity and durability is extremely important as currently reported metallic electrocatalysts show a main drawback of low stability owing to leaching and oxidation herein we demonstrate that a unique n doped graphitic carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles can be utilized as a promising nrr electrocatalyst the resulting fe 20 n c achieves a better nitrate removal proportion of 83 0 attained in the first running cycle compared to the efficiencies of other reference catalysts including those with lower entrapped fe content the nitrogen selectivity is 25 0 in the absence of cl and increases to 100 when supplemented with 1 0 g l 1 nacl more importantly there is no statistically significant difference at a 95 confidence interval regarding the removal percentage recorded over 20 cycles for the fe 20 n c cathode we propose that the iron nanoparticles could attenuate the work function on the neighboring carbon atoms which are the reactive sites for nrr and that the graphitic shells hinder the access of the electrolyte thus protecting the iron particles from dissolution and oxidation testing with the real industrial wastewater further demonstrates the superiority of fe 20 n c cathode towards nrr as evidenced by efficient removal of nitrate available in the biological effluent from a local coking wastewater treatment plant graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrochemical nitrate reduction porous carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles nitrogen selectivity industrial wastewater treatment coking wastewater 1 introduction the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers and increased nitrogen discharge from agricultural and industrial sources have caused severe water pollution with nitrogen in china this is evident in a recent report yu et al 2019 that rapidly increased nitrogen levels are monitored in many water bodies including surface water and groundwater since the 1990s nitrate is the most oxidized form of nitrogen it represents the main nitrogen containing pollutant found in groundwater and specific types of industrial wastewater e g the effluent of nitrogen laden coking wastewater pretreated by aerobic oxidation xie et al 2014 there is widespread concern about the accumulation of nitrate in water due to the fact that nitrite as a product of its reduction is a carcinogen and causes methaemoglobinemia martinez et al 2017 several emerging technologies capable of reducing nitrate to nitrogen have been proposed duca et al 2012a biological denitrification is a technologically mature and cost effective technique but requires a high carbon to nitrogen ratio and suitable ph and temperature for successful enrichment of denitrifying bacteria clauwaert et al 2007 thus it is poorly applicable to groundwater and industrial wastewater in which biodegradable organics are limited chemically catalyzed nitrate reduction proceeds at a high rate and without the need for organic carbon but it relies on the extensive use of hydrogen as a reductant that induces safety hazards in storage transportation and utilization and on precious metal catalysts that are expensive and non environmentally friendly guo et al 2018 hamid et al 2016 jung et al 2014 shuai et al 2012 ye et al 2017 therefore an electrochemical approach to nitrate reduction with the ability to exactly tune the desired potential current is fundamentally desired because it offers the advantages of not requiring external chemical amendments while having high treatment efficiency and relatively low investment costs however the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction nrr is complex and can lead to various products garcia segura et al 2018 nitrate removal at a high rate and with good selectivity is desirable in terms of cleaning of groundwater or wastewater traditional electrocatalysts for nrr are monometallic catalysts such as cu badea 2009 and fe li et al 2010 teng et al 2018 and bimetallic catalysts such as cuzn li et al 2009a 2009b cusn polatides and kyriacou 2005 cuni mattarozzi et al 2013 pdcu gayen et al 2018 su et al 2016 zhang et al 2018c and ptsn yang et al 2013 which show improved activity and nitrogen selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts nevertheless the main drawbacks of the metallic electrocatalysts are the leaching oxidation and aggregation of metal particles during the electrocatalytic process in addition their poor durability makes them unsuitable for practical application development of highly active and durable electrocatalysts is the principle challenge to be resolved for nrr to be a competitive approach in the past few years nano carbon based materials have received extensive interest for versatile application as electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction reactions orr han et al 2018a b hydrogen evolution reactions her zheng et al 2014 and oxygen evolution reactions oer zhang et al 2015 because of their low cost high surface area excellent electrical conductivity good corrosion resistance and excellent thermal and chemical stability which can overcome the shortcomings of metal based electrocatalysts herein for the first time we report the use of carbonaceous materials for catalyzing nrr with high activity and durability to enhance the adsorption of nitrate onto pristine c atoms an essential prerequisite for electrocatalytic nrr it is necessary to reduce the local work function of carbon by increasing the electron density of the c atoms this can be achieved by designing a catalyst structure with iron nanoparticles encapsulated in a graphitized carbon shell since charge transfer from the fe cluster to the adjacent c atoms can easily take place deng et al 2012 kim et al 2018 tavakkoli et al 2015 in addition this structure enables high stability because the encapsulating carbon shell hinders the access of the electrolyte and protects the iron particles from dissolution and oxidation tavakkoli et al 2015 the aim of this study is thus to demonstrate the feasibility of nrr via an electrocatalyst consisting of iron nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic carbon the electrocatalytic activity and long term operational stability of the carbon electrocatalyst for nrr were evaluated additionally the impact of the precursor and the amount of iron in the catalyst on its electrocatalytic performance was examined the influences of several operating parameters such as the applied potential the presence of chloride and its concentration and the initial concentration of nitrate were also investigated then the mechanism for nrr on the resulting carbon electrocatalyst was proposed lastly the performance of the resulting electrocatalyst for removing nitrate in the real coking wastewater was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of carbon encapsulated ion nanoparticle catalyst the carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile thermal treatment using ammonium ferric citrate afc c6h11feno7 99 5 sigma aldrich st louis mo and dicyandiamide dcda c2h4n4 99 5 sigma aldrich as the precursors according to a modified method wang et al 2015 typically the solution containing a certain amount of afc 5 10 or 15 g l 1 and 80 g l 1 dcda was continuously stirred and dried at 80 c the mixture was annealed at 700 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 under ar and kept at the target temperature for 2 h then cooled to room temperature subsequently the obtained product was thoroughly washed with acid and deionized water to leach away unreacted species and impurities followed by drying at 80 c for 12 h the iron content inside the carbons varied depending on the initial concentration of afc and was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700ce santa clara ca the resulting materials were thus denoted as fe n c with x representing the proportion of iron three kinds of catalysts labeled fe 10 n c fe 20 n c and fe 15 n c were prepared associated respectively with afc concentrations of 5 10 and 15 g l 1 for comparison two reference carbon samples prepared from afc only in the absence of dcda and dcda only in the absence of afc were obtained under the same protocols and denoted as fe n c and n c respectively 2 2 preparation of cathode equipped with fe n c and electrochemical nrr tests nickel ni foam 3 cm 3 cm was selected as the substrate of the working electrode i e cathode a mixture of the as obtained catalyst 60 mg acetylene black 10 mg and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe 5 wt 200 mg was first formed in ethanol under ultrasonic mixing for 60 min then the solution was partially dried to form a plasticine like substance which was coated on the ni foam via a roller press and dried at 60 c for 4 h and subsequently at 120 c for 12 h under vacuum the nrr tests were performed in an undivided cell 100 ml filled with 50 mg l 1 nano3 n and 50 mm na2so4 as the supporting electrolyte in the presence and absence of chloride ions a three electrode mode was adopted for the tests with the loaded ni foam with catalysts platinum mesh 2 cm 2 cm and saturated calomel electrodes sce as the working counter and reference electrodes respectively which were connected with a chi 760e electrochemical potentiostat all the potentials reported throughout the text are referred to sce for the electrolysis tests a poised potential of 1 3 v was applied to drive the nrr at fixed time intervals two milliliters of solution was withdrawn to analyze the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n for comparison additional experiments were performed with different operating conditions by varying the applied potential 1 1 to 1 4 v the concentration of nacl added to the electrolyte 0 2 g l 1 and the initial concentration of nano3 n 25 200 mg l 1 all the electrolysis experiments were performed in triplicate electrochemical characterizations including cyclic voltammetry cv and linear sweep voltammetry lsv were conducted in n2 saturated 50 mm na2so4 solution with or without 50 mg l 1 nano3 n at a scan rate of 5 mv s 1 for comparisons the electrolysis experiments were also performed with the cu plate and cuzn cathodes both have the same size of 3 cm 3 cm under the same conditions to demonstrate the feasibility of using the resulting fe n c electrocatalyst for electrochemical reduction of nitrate in the real wastewater the electrolysis experiment was conducted with the biological effluent from a local coking wastewater treatment plant shaogang guangdong province of china upon aerobic treatment that enables mineralization of biodegradable organics and transformation of ammonium to nitrate the coking wastewater effluent contains 232 2 mg l 1 cod and 72 7 mg l 1 no3 n 2 3

waltham ma 2 4 analytical methods for n concentration determination and data analysis the concentrations of no3 n and no2 n were determined by suppressed conductivity ionic chromatography using a dionex ics 1000 system dionex sunnyvale ca fitted with a dionex ionpac as20 analytical column 4 mm 250 mm and an ag20 guard column 4 mm 40 mm the concentration of nh4 n was measured using the nessler s reagent spectrophotometry method to determine the concentration of n2o the gaseous samples withdrawn from the headspace of the electrochemical cell were analyzed using a 7890a gas chromatograph agilent technologies inc santa clara ca the percentage of nitrate removal nr was calculated according to the equation 1 n r c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 mg l 1 and c t mg l 1 are the initial no3 n concentration and its concentration at time t respectively negligible n2o was found as n2o continues to be reduced to n2 under the conditions of sufficient electrolysis time in a sealed batch reactor chaplin et al 2009 heck et al 2019 the n2 selectivity s was calculated by the equation 2 s δc n o 3 δc n o 2 δc n h 4 δc n o 3 100 where δc no3 n δc no2 n and δc nh4 n are the absolute difference of nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentration before and after reaction respectively the coulombic efficiency ce of the cathodic nitrate reduction was defined and calculated according to the following equations 3 c e n f v δ c e x p q 100 4 q d i d t where δ c e x p mol l 1 is the concentration change of no3 n at a given time f 96485 c mol 1 is the faraday constant n is the electron transfer number

which is the integral of the cathodic current i a with respect to the operation time t s 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical characterizations as illustrated in the sem images fig 1 a and figs s1a 1d all the fe x n c samples displayed a porous carbon structure decorated with nanosized particles which were distinctly different from the cracked structure of the fe n c sample this structure should guarantee good electrochemical activity owing to its increased number of reactive sites and fast adsorption and diffusion of reactants han et al 2018a b huang et al 2012 mahmood et al 2018 fig 1b and figs s2a 2d show and compare the tem images confirming that nanoparticles with an average size of about 9 nm were well dispersed and encapsulated within carbon shells in the fe x n c samples it is noticeable that particle density increased as the ratio of iron increased fig s2 moreover the hrtem measurement of fe 20 n c fig 1c shows that these nanoparticles are well wrapped with a few graphene layers with a lattice distance of 0 34 nm which matches well with the 002 plane of graphite carbon and that the nanoparticle has an interplanar spacing of 0 20 nm which corresponds to the 110 plane of fe the elemental mapping images fig 1d i clearly identify the presence of c fe and n in the fe 20 n c sample and confirm that the nanoparticles definitely contain fe fig 1j shows the xrd patterns of the samples derived from different precursors a peak at about 26 1 assigned to the 002 plane of the hexagonal structure of carbon is observed in all the samples except for the n c sample which exclusively exhibits the strong peak at 27 8 indexed to the c3n4 yan et al 2010 the fe 10 n c fe 15 n c and fe 20 n c samples have similar patterns with a remarkable peak appearing at 44 5 corresponding to body centered cubic α fe jcpds 06 0696 the fe n c sample however contains xrd peaks referring to fe3o4 jcpds no 75 0449 indicating that high valence iron in the afc cannot be converted to metallic iron in the absence of dcda the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of all the samples fig 1k exhibit a type iv hysteresis loop suggesting the presence of mesopores huang et al 2012 except for fe n c which delivers a relatively higher bet surface area of 898 1 m2 g 1 the surface area increases with increasing ratio of iron via the following trend n c 32 9 m2 g 1 fe 10 n c 268 7 m2 g 1 fe 15 n c 415 9 m2 g 1 fe 20 n c 470 8 m2 g 1 this finding should be attributed to the fact that the iron precursor can function as the activation agent and graphitization catalyst for a mesoporous carbon structure during carbonization lei et al 2017 and that the iron particles connected with the carbon sheets can prevent the aggregation and collapse of carbon mesopores han et al 2018b the pore size distribution of fe 20 n c fig s3 was around 3 16 nm calculated via the barret joyner halenda model the xps characterization of fe 20 n c also indicates the presence of c fe and n as shown in the survey spectra fig s4a it should be noted that the fe content in the fe 20 n c surface is low 1 9 wt as quantified by the xps result further indicating that the majority of fe particles are entrapped within the graphitic shells considering that xps is a surface analysis technique li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the presence of fe nanoparticles was evidenced by the fe 2p spectrum fig 1l which showed two distinct peaks at binding energies of around 707 1 and 720 3 ev corresponding to the peaks of metallic fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively and weak peaks at a binding energy of around 710 2 and 722 5 ev ascribed to fe n species zhang et al 2018b which is present in low quantities consistent with the hrtem results the deconvolution of the n 1s spectrum fig s4b yields four peaks at 398 6 399 6 400 9 and 402 0 ev which are indexed to pyridinic n fe n pyrrolic n and graphitic n respectively it is well known that the abundant pyridinic n sites are important for enhancing the diffusion of reactants ions meanwhile the plentiful graphitic n sites play a role in increasing electrical conductivity and facilitate electron tunneling in diverse electrocatalytic fields liu et al 2018 3 2 nrr activity and catalyst durability of fe x n c lsv and electrolysis tests were conducted to examine the electrocatalytic activity of the carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticle catalysts towards nrr fig 2 a and fig s5 show the lsv curves of the fe 20 n c fe 15 n c fe 10 n c fe n c and n c cathodes in the presence or absence of no3 in agreement with previous studies concerning nrr on metal based cathodes pérez gallent et al 2017 su et al 2017 the addition of no3 yielded an increase in the cathodic current in all cases which was attributed to nitrate reduction as illustrated in fig 2a the larger increase in the current was observed on the fe 20 n c cathode compared to the fe n c cathode under identical operating conditions additionally the more positive shift for the potential at which the current begins to drop sharply was visible on the fe 20 n c cathode indicating that it exhibits the better activity towards nrr fig 2b shows the time courses of the no3 n concentrations for all cathodes during the electrolysis experiments the concentration data were fitted with the pseudo first order reaction kinetics equation the apparent rate constants k app for the fe 20 n c fe 15 n c fe 10 n c fe n c and n c cathodes were calculated to be 1 51 10 5 6 52 10 6 5 08 10 6 4 92 10 6 and 2 78 10 7 s 1 respectively in accordance with the lsv results the fe 20 n c cathode delivered a substantially higher reaction rate than the other cathodes fig 2c compares the percentage of nitrate removal for all the cathodes when the electrolysis test is run over 24 h without cl the experiment undertaken with the bare electrode suggests that the nickel foam cannot catalyze nrr and the experiment performed with the fe 20 n c coated nickel foam under the open circuit condition indicates that adsorption contributes little to nitrate removal both evident as insignificant variations in nitrate concentration throughout the tests fig s6 the removal proportion is sensitive to the amount of fe inside the encapsulated carbon catalysts as indicated by the increasing trend fe 10 n c 32 1 fe 15 n c 54 9 fe 20 n c 76 3 despite the fact that fe n c has a higher content of iron species 24 3 and a larger surface area compared to fe 20 n c a much lower nitrate removal percentage of 30 9 was obtained for fe n c this may be explained by the presence of fe3o4 in the fe n c catalyst as indicated by the xrd characterizations which might result in the catalyst s poor conductivity and is kinetically unfavorable for nrr gabe et al 2017 teng et al 2018 both metallic cu and cuzn cathodes have been used for electrochemical nitrate reduction in the literature badea 2009 li et al 2009a 2009b mácová et al 2005 we attempted to compare the performance of our new catalyst with that of cuzn and cu plates all the experiments were conducted under identical conditions as shown in fig s6 the cu plate cathode allowed 28 2 of nitrate removal after 24 h of operation this value increased to 35 9 when the cuzn cathode was applied which is in accordance with the previous finding that the binary cuzn cathode shows better electrochemical activity for nitrate reduction than the monometallic cathode shows due to the synergistic effect li et al 2009a 2009b mácová et al 2005 it is apparent that the fe 20 n c cathode outperformed the metallic cu and cuzn cathodes in terms of substantially larger removal percentages fig 2d demonstrates that the fe 20 n c cathode achieved the highest nitrogen selectivity 25 0 although this value is not relatively high it is larger than those obtained for the cu 7 5 and cuzn 8 8 plate cathodes possibly owing to the decrease in the energy barrier for n2 generation on the carbon sites activated by the encapsulated iron particles fig 3 a illustrates the effect of available cl on the electrocatalytic performance the addition of cl resulted in a slight increase in the nitrate removal proportion and a dramatic increase in the selectivity for nitrogen from 25 0 to 100 this is due to the formation of active chlorine species resulting from chloride oxidation at the pt anode mostafa et al 2018 and the subsequent breakpoint chlorination reactions yang and hoffmann 2016 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a represented by equations 5 9 the increased percentage of nitrate removal can be explained by the stripping of nh4 which induces the re exposure of the catalytic sites to the reactants such increases are highly dependent on the concentration of cl too much cl available in the solution causes a small decrease in the nitrate removal proportion this phenomenon has also been reported with other metallic electrodes and may possibly be due to the excessive clo reacting with no2 equation 10 su et al 2017 and the occupation of the catalytic sites by the superfluous cl the obtained nitrogen selectivity of 100 was appreciably larger than the nzvi omc nanoscale zero valent iron supported on ordered mesoporous carbon cathode teng et al 2018 this should be due to the fact that the encapsulating carbon structure synthesized in this study offers better transport and diffusion of intermediate products i e nh4 5 2 c l c l 2 2 e 6 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o c l h 7 h c l o c l o h 8 3 h c l o 2 n h 4 n 2 3 c l 5 h 3 h 2 o 9 3 c l o 2 n h 4 n 2 3 c l 2 h 2 h 2 o 10 n o 2 h cl o n o 3 c l h the more negative potentials applied to the cathode reflect the larger force driving nrr thus leading to increased nitrate removal as evident in fig 3b decreasing the potential from 1 1 to 1 3 v resulted in an increase in the nitrate removal proportion from 32 7 to 83 1 a further decrease to 1 4 v however yielded a substantial drop in the value 31 4 the exception with more cathodic potential should be due to the hydrogen evolution reaction competing for the electrons and the generation of bubbles impeding ion transport jiang et al 2017 similar inhibition effects were reported in previous studies li et al 2012 mao et al 2018 about electrochemical dechlorination on the pd based electrocatalysts it has been concluded that the excessive hydrogen evolution restricts the access of reactants to the active sites li et al 2012 mao et al 2018 fig s7 shows and compares the coulombic efficiency of cathodic nitrate reductions resulting from different applied potentials when the cathodic potentials changed from 1 1 to 1 3 v the coulombic efficiency increased from 4 6 to 10 7 which is a consequence of favorable kinetics for nitrate reduction at lower potentials the coulombic efficiency at 1 4 v substantially dropped to 3 9 due to the extensive water electrolysis to hydrogen it should be noted that the highest value 10 7 achieved at 1 3 v for nrr on the fe 20 n c catalyst is comparable to that obtained for electrochemical nitrite reduction on an oxo molybdenum sulfide electrocatalyst under neutral conditions he et al 2018 the effect of the initial nitrate concentration from 25 to 200 mg l 1 no3 n on the removal proportion and nitrogen selectivity was also evaluated and the results are shown in fig 3c the increasing nitrate concentration led to a slight decrease in the percentage of nitrate removal and selectivity for nitrogen particularly regarding concentrations above 150 mg l 1 nevertheless the absolute amounts of no3 n removed after 24 h of operation were 107 46 79 5 70 51 and 36 5 mg l 1 for 200 150 100 and 50 mg l 1 of no3 n respectively due to the enhanced mass transfer in the high initial concentration in addition to the activity the long term durability of the catalyst is also critical in evaluation of the nrr electrocatalysts repeatable electrolysis batch experiments under optimized conditions were undertaken to test the durability of fe 20 n c fig 4 a shows the percentage of nitrate removal recorded over 20 cycles each cycle lasting 24 h notably the values ranged from 76 4 to 78 6 at a 95 confidence interval demonstrating the outstanding stability of the electrocatalyst the selectivity for n2 in the presence of cl was 100 in each cycle a consequence of the electrochemical nrr combined with electrochlorination reactions equations 5 9 stability tests were also performed with the cu and cuzn plate cathodes for comparison fig s8 shows that the four cycle operation resulted in a significant decay in the nitrate removal percentage from 31 2 to 9 4 and from 38 3 to 18 3 for the cu and cuzn catalysts respectively the microstructure of the cycled fe 20 n c was also characterized as illustrated in fig 4b the remarkable preservation of the encapsulation structure is clearly visible the fe nanoparticle is still tightly encapsulated by the graphitic carbon shell comparison of the xrd patterns before and after 20 cycles fig 4c also demonstrated its stability as no significant differences were observed in the peaks of c and fe this was also confirmed by comparing the lsv curves recorded on the fe 20 n c cathode operated over 5000 cycles from 0 to 1 4 v which showed only small changes fig 4c this conclusion was further supported by the chemical analysis data which showed that the concentration of dissolved iron ions in the electrolyte was negligible after 20 cycles all these observations provide compelling evidence that the unique encapsulation structure of the fe 20 n c electrocatalyst and the resulting electrocatalytic activity towards nrr are retained over long term operation 3 3 proposed mechanism for nrr on fe n c based on the above information a mechanism for the nrr process on the fe n c electrocatalyst is proposed fig 5 in which surface adsorption of nitrate occurs prior to its stepwise reduction to the final product n2 or nh4 gayen et al 2018 teng et al 2018 zhang et al 2018c the fact that the encapsulated fe nanoparticles are not in direct contact with the electrolyte suggests that the iron surfaces should not be the electrocatalytic centers nevertheless the iron nanoparticle should still play a pivotal role in the catalysis previously performed density functional theory dft calculations deng et al 2012 hu et al 2014 kim et al 2018 tavakkoli et al 2015 have indicated that in the encapsulation structure charges transfer from the fe particles to the carbon exterior leading to a decreased local work function on the carbon surface due to the increased charge density and formation of a local dipole doping with n in the carbon can further decrease the work function deng et al 2012 this result should be conducive to electrostatic and covalent bonding between the oxygen atom in the nitrate and the carbon atom thus facilitating nitrate adsorption according to the nitrate transformation scheme reported in the literature de vooys et al 2001 duca et al 2012b rima et al 2010 yoshioka et al 2016 the surface bound no3 is converted to surface bound no2 equation 11 which is further reduced to surface bound no equation 12 or diffuses into the bulk electrolyte the existence of aqueous no2 in the electrolyte is evidenced in the nrr process with no added cl fig s9 three possible pathways exist starting from the surface bound no2 and ending in different products n2 or nh4 i the aqueous no2 released from the surface is sequentially reduced to nh4 equation 13 this is indeed analogous to the case in which nh4 is the predominant product of nrr on nonprecious metal catalysts because most of the no2 species generated are weakly adsorbed on the nonprecious metal surfaces mattarozzi et al 2013 polatides and kyriacou 2005 ii the moderately surface bonded no can react with the aqueous no leading to the formation of surface bound n2o which is further transformed into n2 according to the eley rideal reaction scheme equations 14 and 15 clayborne et al 2015 yoshioka et al 2016 iii the strongly surface bonded no is also prone to transformation into nh4 with regard to equation 16 de vooys et al 2001 duca et al 2012b rima et al 2010 yoshioka et al 2016 in this study the selectivity for nitrogen for the nrr 25 0 on fe 20 n c is substantially higher than that on cu and cuzn it can be deduced that there may be certain amounts of no adsorbed on the carbon surface which are transformed to the surface bound n2o and to the desired final product n2 the remaining nh4 can be converted into n2 upon addition of a dose of cl in the electrolyte owing to the break point oxidation of ammonia with chlorine produced from anodic oxidation equations 5 9 11 n o 3 a b s h 2 o 2 e n o 2 a b s 2 o h 12 n o 2 a b s h 2 o e n o a b s 2 o h 13 n o 2 s o l 6 h 2 o 6 e

the coking wastewater the performance of fe n c for nrr was tested with real nitrate laden coking wastewater biological effluent from a coking wastewater treatment plant table 1 lists the variations in the wastewater characteristics percentage of nitrogen removal and selectivity for nitrogen as a result of the electrolysis experiments with respect to different cathodes and operational conditions only 20 2 of no3 n from 72 7 to 57 4 mg l 1 in the coking wastewater was removed in the electrochemical system with the carbon electrocatalyst the removal proportion significantly increased to 55 7 from 73 2 to 32 4 mg l 1 when the raw wastewater was subjected to pretreatment by electrochemical oxidation that allowed significant reduction in the cod concentration from 232 1 to 25 3 mg l 1 and the toc concentration from 64 5 to 9 3 mg l 1 this result indicates that the biorefractory compounds i e cod contributors inhibits nitrate removal this inhibitory effect is possibly due to the adsorption of impurities that occupy the readily available active sites for nitrate adsorption and subsequent reactions the nitrogen selectivity was 45 8 larger than 25 0 achieved with the artificial wastewater presumably due to the presence of cl in the real wastewater the concentration of cl in the initial wastewater was 761 5 mg l 1 which dropped to 384 7 mg l 1 after the electrooxidation treatment because of its transformation to gas chlorine the supplement of additional cl to 1 1 g l 1 further improved the nitrogen selectivity to 100 according to equations 5 9 the performance of fe n c electrocatalyst was superior to the commonly used cuzn electrocatalyst in terms of considerably larger percentage of nitrate removal 63 3 vs 21 5 the long term operation over ten cycles resulted in an insignificant reduction in the nitrate removal proportion indicating good stability of the cathode for removal of nitrate in the real wastewater it should be noted that the electrolysis tests led to an increase in electrolyte ph due to the nrrs equations 11 16 these findings imply that the fe n c electrocatalyst developed in this study is efficient and stable in transforming nitrate to nitrogen from the coking wastewater given that cl is available this paves the way to further application of the fe n c electrocatalyst as the cathode material for treating a variety of wastewaters and groundwater that are laden with nitrate and chloride and lack of biodegradable organics 4 conclusions we show that the carbon with encapsulated iron nanoparticles described herein exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and long term durability towards nrr the electrochemical performance can be tuned in response to the content of iron in the electrocatalyst which relies on the concentration of the precursor used we propose that the iron nanoparticles stabilized by the protective graphitic shells could attenuate the work function of the neighboring carbon atoms which likely act as reactive centers to facilitate nrr these findings open a new avenue for utilizing carbon based electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction the electrochemical approach to nitrate removal offers potential environmental benefits first nrr on the carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles is achieved under conditions of insufficient carbon sources and neutral ph it is demonstrated that the resulting catalyst exhibits good performance for removal of nitrate in the biological effluent of the coking wastewater in which biodegradable organics are limited compared with other metallic electrocatalysts that commonly require an acid environment to ensure activity excessive use of acids to adjust ph is unnecessary for the carbon electrocatalysts more importantly the carbon electrocatalysts toward nrr exhibit substantial long term stability differing significantly from the metallic electrocatalysts which are easily dissolved and aggregated upon multiple cycling operations this circumvents the problem of secondary pollution and catalyst deactivation before their practical application in nitrate control in the industrial wastewater groundwater treatment further efforts should be made to enhance their activity and selectivity for nitrogen in the absence of cl and to develop strategies for scaling up synthesis declaration of interests the authors

18684,the development of a new class of carbon electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction reaction nrr that have high activity and durability is extremely important as currently reported metallic electrocatalysts show a main drawback of low stability owing to leaching and oxidation herein we demonstrate that a unique n doped graphitic carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles can be utilized as a promising nrr electrocatalyst the resulting fe 20 n c achieves a better nitrate removal proportion of 83 0 attained in the first running cycle compared to the efficiencies of other reference catalysts including those with lower entrapped fe content the nitrogen selectivity is 25 0 in the absence of cl and increases to 100 when supplemented with 1 0 g l 1 nacl more importantly there is no statistically significant difference at a 95 confidence interval regarding the removal percentage recorded over 20 cycles for the fe 20 n c cathode we propose that the iron nanoparticles could attenuate the work function on the neighboring carbon atoms which are the reactive sites for nrr and that the graphitic shells hinder the access of the electrolyte thus protecting the iron particles from dissolution and oxidation testing with the real industrial wastewater further demonstrates the superiority of fe 20 n c cathode towards nrr as evidenced by efficient removal of nitrate available in the biological effluent from a local coking wastewater treatment plant graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrochemical nitrate reduction porous carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles nitrogen selectivity industrial wastewater treatment coking wastewater 1 introduction the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers and increased nitrogen discharge from agricultural and industrial sources have caused severe water pollution with nitrogen in china this is evident in a recent report yu et al 2019 that rapidly increased nitrogen levels are monitored in many water bodies including surface water and groundwater since the 1990s nitrate is the most oxidized form of nitrogen it represents the main nitrogen containing pollutant found in groundwater and specific types of industrial wastewater e g the effluent of nitrogen laden coking wastewater pretreated by aerobic oxidation xie et al 2014 there is widespread concern about the accumulation of nitrate in water due to the fact that nitrite as a product of its reduction is a carcinogen and causes methaemoglobinemia martinez et al 2017 several emerging technologies capable of reducing nitrate to nitrogen have been proposed duca et al 2012a biological denitrification is a technologically mature and cost effective technique but requires a high carbon to nitrogen ratio and suitable ph and temperature for successful enrichment of denitrifying bacteria clauwaert et al 2007 thus it is poorly applicable to groundwater and industrial wastewater in which biodegradable organics are limited chemically catalyzed nitrate reduction proceeds at a high rate and without the need for organic carbon but it relies on the extensive use of hydrogen as a reductant that induces safety hazards in storage transportation and utilization and on precious metal catalysts that are expensive and non environmentally friendly guo et al 2018 hamid et al 2016 jung et al 2014 shuai et al 2012 ye et al 2017 therefore an electrochemical approach to nitrate reduction with the ability to exactly tune the desired potential current is fundamentally desired because it offers the advantages of not requiring external chemical amendments while having high treatment efficiency and relatively low investment costs however the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction nrr is complex and can lead to various products garcia segura et al 2018 nitrate removal at a high rate and with good selectivity is desirable in terms of cleaning of groundwater or wastewater traditional electrocatalysts for nrr are monometallic catalysts such as cu badea 2009 and fe li et al 2010 teng et al 2018 and bimetallic catalysts such as cuzn li et al 2009a 2009b cusn polatides and kyriacou 2005 cuni mattarozzi et al 2013 pdcu gayen et al 2018 su et al 2016 zhang et al 2018c and ptsn yang et al 2013 which show improved activity and nitrogen selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts nevertheless the main drawbacks of the metallic electrocatalysts are the leaching oxidation and aggregation of metal particles during the electrocatalytic process in addition their poor durability makes them unsuitable for practical application development of highly active and durable electrocatalysts is the principle challenge to be resolved for nrr to be a competitive approach in the past few years nano carbon based materials have received extensive interest for versatile application as electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction reactions orr han et al 2018a b hydrogen evolution reactions her zheng et al 2014 and oxygen evolution reactions oer zhang et al 2015 because of their low cost high surface area excellent electrical conductivity good corrosion resistance and excellent thermal and chemical stability which can overcome the shortcomings of metal based electrocatalysts herein for the first time we report the use of carbonaceous materials for catalyzing nrr with high activity and durability to enhance the adsorption of nitrate onto pristine c atoms an essential prerequisite for electrocatalytic nrr it is necessary to reduce the local work function of carbon by increasing the electron density of the c atoms this can be achieved by designing a catalyst structure with iron nanoparticles encapsulated in a graphitized carbon shell since charge transfer from the fe cluster to the adjacent c atoms can easily take place deng et al 2012 kim et al 2018 tavakkoli et al 2015 in addition this structure enables high stability because the encapsulating carbon shell hinders the access of the electrolyte and protects the iron particles from dissolution and oxidation tavakkoli et al 2015 the aim of this study is thus to demonstrate the feasibility of nrr via an electrocatalyst consisting of iron nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic carbon the electrocatalytic activity and long term operational stability of the carbon electrocatalyst for nrr were evaluated additionally the impact of the precursor and the amount of iron in the catalyst on its electrocatalytic performance was examined the influences of several operating parameters such as the applied potential the presence of chloride and its concentration and the initial concentration of nitrate were also investigated then the mechanism for nrr on the resulting carbon electrocatalyst was proposed lastly the performance of the resulting electrocatalyst for removing nitrate in the real coking wastewater was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of carbon encapsulated ion nanoparticle catalyst the carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile thermal treatment using ammonium ferric citrate afc c6h11feno7 99 5 sigma aldrich st louis mo and dicyandiamide dcda c2h4n4 99 5 sigma aldrich as the precursors according to a modified method wang et al 2015 typically the solution containing a certain amount of afc 5 10 or 15 g l 1 and 80 g l 1 dcda was continuously stirred and dried at 80 c the mixture was annealed at 700 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 under ar and kept at the target temperature for 2 h then cooled to room temperature subsequently the obtained product was thoroughly washed with acid and deionized water to leach away unreacted species and impurities followed by drying at 80 c for 12 h the iron content inside the carbons varied depending on the initial concentration of afc and was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700ce santa clara ca the resulting materials were thus denoted as fe n c with x representing the proportion of iron three kinds of catalysts labeled fe 10 n c fe 20 n c and fe 15 n c were prepared associated respectively with afc concentrations of 5 10 and 15 g l 1 for comparison two reference carbon samples prepared from afc only in the absence of dcda and dcda only in the absence of afc were obtained under the same protocols and denoted as fe n c and n c respectively 2 2 preparation of cathode equipped with fe n c and electrochemical nrr tests nickel ni foam 3 cm 3 cm was selected as the substrate of the working electrode i e cathode a mixture of the as obtained catalyst 60 mg acetylene black 10 mg and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe 5 wt 200 mg was first formed in ethanol under ultrasonic mixing for 60 min then the solution was partially dried to form a plasticine like substance which was coated on the ni foam via a roller press and dried at 60 c for 4 h and subsequently at 120 c for 12 h under vacuum the nrr tests were performed in an undivided cell 100 ml filled with 50 mg l 1 nano3 n and 50 mm na2so4 as the supporting electrolyte in the presence and absence of chloride ions a three electrode mode was adopted for the tests with the loaded ni foam with catalysts platinum mesh 2 cm 2 cm and saturated calomel electrodes sce as the working counter and reference electrodes respectively which were connected with a chi 760e electrochemical potentiostat all the potentials reported throughout the text are referred to sce for the electrolysis tests a poised potential of 1 3 v was applied to drive the nrr at fixed time intervals two milliliters of solution was withdrawn to analyze the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n for comparison additional experiments were performed with different operating conditions by varying the applied potential 1 1 to 1 4 v the concentration of nacl added to the electrolyte 0 2 g l 1 and the initial concentration of nano3 n 25 200 mg l 1 all the electrolysis experiments were performed in triplicate electrochemical characterizations including cyclic voltammetry cv and linear sweep voltammetry lsv were conducted in n2 saturated 50 mm na2so4 solution with or without 50 mg l 1 nano3 n at a scan rate of 5 mv s 1 for comparisons the electrolysis experiments were also performed with the cu plate and cuzn cathodes both have the same size of 3 cm 3 cm under the same conditions to demonstrate the feasibility of using the resulting fe n c electrocatalyst for electrochemical reduction of nitrate in the real wastewater the electrolysis experiment was conducted with the biological effluent from a local coking wastewater treatment plant shaogang guangdong province of china upon aerobic treatment that enables mineralization of biodegradable organics and transformation of ammonium to nitrate the coking wastewater effluent contains 232 2 mg l 1 cod and 72 7 mg l 1 no3 n 2 3

dionex ics 1000 system dionex sunnyvale ca fitted with a dionex ionpac as20 analytical column 4 mm 250 mm and an ag20 guard column 4 mm 40 mm the concentration of nh4 n was measured using the nessler s reagent spectrophotometry method to determine the concentration of n2o the gaseous samples withdrawn from the headspace of the electrochemical cell were analyzed using a 7890a gas chromatograph agilent technologies inc santa clara ca the percentage of nitrate removal nr was calculated according to the equation 1 n r c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 mg l 1 and c t mg l 1 are the initial no3 n concentration and its concentration at time t respectively negligible n2o was found as n2o continues to be reduced to n2 under the conditions of sufficient electrolysis time in a sealed batch reactor chaplin et al 2009 heck et al 2019 the n2 selectivity s was calculated by the equation 2 s δc n o 3 δc n o 2 δc n h 4 δc n o 3 100 where δc no3 n δc no2 n and δc nh4 n are the absolute difference of

equations 3 c e n f v δ c e x p q 100 4 q d i d t where δ c e x p mol l 1 is the concentration change of no3 n at a given time f 96485 c mol 1 is the faraday constant n is the electron transfer number

which is the integral of the cathodic current i a with respect to the operation time t s 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical characterizations as illustrated in the sem images fig 1 a and figs s1a 1d all the fe x n c samples displayed a porous carbon structure decorated with nanosized particles which were distinctly different from the cracked structure of the fe n c sample this structure should guarantee good electrochemical activity owing to its increased number of reactive sites and fast adsorption and diffusion of reactants han et al 2018a b huang et al 2012 mahmood et al 2018 fig 1b and figs s2a 2d show and compare the tem images confirming that nanoparticles with an average size of about 9 nm were well dispersed and encapsulated within carbon shells in the fe x n c samples it is noticeable that particle density increased as the ratio of iron increased fig s2 moreover the hrtem measurement of fe 20 n c fig 1c shows that these nanoparticles are well wrapped with a few graphene layers with a lattice distance of 0 34 nm which matches well with the 002 plane of graphite carbon and that the nanoparticle has an interplanar spacing of 0 20 nm which corresponds to the 110 plane of fe the elemental mapping images fig 1d i clearly identify the presence of c fe and n in the fe 20 n c sample and confirm that the nanoparticles definitely contain fe fig 1j shows the xrd patterns of the samples derived from different precursors a peak at about 26 1 assigned to the 002 plane of the hexagonal structure of carbon is observed in all the samples except for the n c sample which exclusively exhibits the strong peak at 27 8 indexed to the c3n4 yan et al 2010 the fe 10 n c fe 15 n c and fe 20 n c samples have similar patterns with a remarkable peak appearing at 44 5 corresponding to body centered cubic α fe jcpds 06 0696 the fe n c sample however contains xrd peaks referring to fe3o4 jcpds no 75 0449 indicating that high valence iron in the afc cannot be converted to metallic iron in the absence of dcda the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of all the samples fig 1k exhibit a type iv hysteresis loop suggesting the presence of mesopores huang et al 2012 except for fe n c which delivers a relatively higher bet surface area of 898 1 m2 g 1 the surface area increases with increasing ratio of iron via the following trend n c 32 9 m2 g 1 fe 10 n c 268 7 m2 g 1 fe 15 n c 415 9 m2 g 1 fe 20 n c 470 8 m2 g 1 this finding should be attributed to the fact that the iron precursor can function as the activation agent and graphitization catalyst for a mesoporous carbon structure during carbonization lei et al 2017 and that the iron particles connected with the carbon sheets can prevent the aggregation and collapse of carbon mesopores han et al 2018b the pore size distribution of fe 20 n c fig s3 was around 3 16 nm calculated via the barret joyner halenda model the xps characterization of fe 20 n c also indicates the presence of c fe and n as shown in the survey spectra fig s4a it should be noted that the fe content in the fe 20 n c surface is low 1 9 wt as quantified by the xps result further indicating that the majority of fe particles are entrapped within the graphitic shells considering that xps is a surface analysis technique li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the presence of fe nanoparticles was evidenced by the fe 2p spectrum fig 1l which showed two distinct peaks at binding energies of around 707 1 and 720 3 ev corresponding to the peaks of metallic fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively and weak peaks at a binding energy of around 710 2 and 722 5 ev ascribed to fe n species zhang et al 2018b which is present in low quantities consistent with the hrtem results the deconvolution of the n 1s spectrum fig s4b yields four peaks at 398 6 399 6 400 9 and 402 0 ev which are indexed to pyridinic n fe n pyrrolic n and graphitic n respectively it is well known that the abundant pyridinic n sites are important for enhancing the diffusion of reactants ions meanwhile the plentiful graphitic n sites play a role in increasing electrical conductivity and facilitate electron tunneling in diverse electrocatalytic fields liu et al 2018 3 2 nrr activity and catalyst durability of fe x n c lsv and electrolysis tests were conducted to examine the electrocatalytic activity of the carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticle catalysts towards nrr fig 2 a and fig s5 show the lsv curves of the fe 20 n c fe 15 n c fe 10 n c fe n c and n c cathodes in the presence or absence of no3 in agreement with previous studies concerning nrr on metal based cathodes pérez gallent et al 2017 su et al 2017 the addition of no3 yielded an increase in the cathodic current in all cases which was attributed to nitrate reduction as illustrated in fig 2a the larger increase in the current was observed on the fe 20 n c cathode compared to the fe n c cathode under identical operating conditions additionally the more positive shift for the potential at which the current begins to drop sharply was visible on the fe 20 n c cathode indicating that it exhibits the better activity towards nrr fig 2b shows the time courses of the no3 n concentrations for all cathodes during the electrolysis experiments the concentration data were fitted with the pseudo first order reaction kinetics equation the apparent rate constants k app for the fe 20 n c fe 15 n c fe 10 n c fe n c and n c cathodes were calculated to be 1 51 10 5 6 52 10 6 5 08 10 6 4 92 10 6 and 2 78 10 7 s 1 respectively in accordance with the lsv results the fe 20 n c cathode delivered a substantially higher reaction rate than the other cathodes fig 2c compares the percentage of nitrate removal for all the cathodes when the electrolysis test is run over 24 h without cl the experiment undertaken with the bare electrode suggests that the nickel foam cannot catalyze nrr and the experiment performed with the fe 20 n c coated nickel foam under the open circuit condition indicates that adsorption contributes little to nitrate removal both evident as insignificant variations in nitrate concentration throughout the tests fig s6 the removal proportion is sensitive to the amount of fe inside the encapsulated carbon catalysts as indicated by the increasing trend fe 10 n c 32 1 fe 15 n c 54 9 fe 20 n c 76 3 despite the fact that fe n c has a higher content of iron species 24 3 and a larger surface area compared to fe 20 n c a much lower nitrate removal percentage of 30 9 was obtained for fe n c this may be explained by the presence of fe3o4 in the fe n c catalyst as indicated by the xrd characterizations which might result in the catalyst s poor conductivity and is kinetically unfavorable for nrr gabe et al 2017 teng et al 2018 both metallic cu and cuzn cathodes have been used for electrochemical nitrate reduction in the literature badea 2009 li et al 2009a 2009b mácová et al 2005 we attempted to compare the performance of our new catalyst with that of cuzn and cu plates all the experiments were conducted under identical conditions as shown in fig s6 the cu plate cathode allowed 28 2 of nitrate removal after 24 h of operation this value increased to 35 9 when the cuzn cathode was applied which is in accordance with the previous finding that the binary cuzn cathode shows better electrochemical activity for nitrate reduction than the monometallic cathode shows due to the synergistic effect li et al 2009a 2009b mácová et al 2005 it is apparent that the fe 20 n c cathode outperformed the metallic cu and cuzn cathodes in terms of substantially larger removal percentages fig 2d demonstrates that the fe 20 n c cathode achieved the highest nitrogen selectivity 25 0 although this value is not relatively high it is larger than those obtained for the cu 7 5 and cuzn 8 8 plate cathodes possibly owing to the decrease in the energy barrier for n2 generation on the carbon sites activated by the encapsulated iron particles fig 3 a illustrates the effect of available cl on the electrocatalytic performance the addition of cl resulted in a slight increase in the nitrate removal proportion and a dramatic increase in the selectivity for nitrogen from 25 0 to 100 this is due to the formation of active chlorine species resulting from chloride oxidation at the pt anode mostafa et al 2018 and the subsequent breakpoint chlorination reactions yang and hoffmann 2016 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a represented by equations 5 9 the increased percentage of nitrate removal can be explained by the stripping of nh4 which induces the re exposure of the catalytic sites to the reactants such increases are highly dependent on the concentration of cl too much cl available in the solution causes a small decrease in the nitrate removal proportion this phenomenon has also been reported with other metallic electrodes and may possibly be due to the excessive clo reacting with no2 equation 10 su et al 2017 and the occupation of the catalytic sites by the superfluous cl the obtained nitrogen selectivity of 100 was appreciably larger than the nzvi omc nanoscale zero valent iron supported on ordered mesoporous carbon cathode teng et al 2018 this should be due to the fact that the encapsulating carbon structure synthesized in this study offers better transport and diffusion of intermediate products i e nh4 5 2 c l c l 2 2 e 6 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o c l h 7 h c l o c l o h 8 3 h c l o 2 n h 4 n 2 3 c l 5 h 3 h 2 o 9 3 c l o 2 n h 4 n 2 3 c l 2 h 2 h 2 o 10 n o 2 h cl o n o 3 c l h the more negative potentials applied to the cathode reflect the larger force driving nrr thus leading to increased nitrate removal as evident in fig 3b decreasing the potential from 1 1 to 1 3 v resulted in an increase in the nitrate removal proportion from 32 7 to 83 1 a further decrease to 1 4 v however yielded a substantial drop in the value 31 4 the exception with more cathodic potential should be due to the hydrogen evolution reaction competing for the electrons and the generation of bubbles impeding ion transport jiang et al 2017 similar inhibition effects were reported in previous studies li et al 2012 mao et al 2018 about electrochemical dechlorination on the pd based electrocatalysts it has been concluded that the excessive hydrogen evolution restricts the access of reactants to the active sites li et al 2012 mao et al 2018 fig s7 shows and compares the coulombic efficiency of cathodic nitrate reductions resulting from different applied potentials when the cathodic potentials changed from 1 1 to 1 3 v the coulombic efficiency increased from 4 6 to 10 7 which is a consequence of favorable kinetics for nitrate reduction at lower potentials the coulombic efficiency at 1 4 v substantially dropped to 3 9 due to the extensive water electrolysis to hydrogen it should be noted that the highest value 10 7 achieved at 1 3 v for nrr on the fe 20 n c catalyst is comparable to that obtained for electrochemical nitrite reduction on an oxo molybdenum sulfide electrocatalyst under neutral conditions he et al 2018 the effect of the initial nitrate concentration from 25 to 200 mg l 1 no3 n on the removal proportion and nitrogen selectivity was also evaluated and the results are shown in fig 3c the increasing nitrate concentration led to a slight decrease in the percentage of nitrate removal and selectivity for nitrogen particularly regarding concentrations above 150 mg l 1 nevertheless the absolute amounts of no3 n removed after 24 h of operation were 107 46 79 5 70 51 and 36 5 mg l 1 for 200 150 100 and 50 mg l 1 of no3 n respectively due to the enhanced mass transfer in the high initial concentration in addition to the activity the long term durability of the catalyst is also critical in evaluation of the nrr electrocatalysts repeatable electrolysis batch experiments under optimized conditions were undertaken to test the durability of fe 20 n c fig 4 a shows the percentage of nitrate removal recorded over 20 cycles each cycle lasting 24 h notably the values ranged from 76 4 to 78 6 at a 95 confidence interval demonstrating the outstanding stability of the electrocatalyst the selectivity for n2 in the presence of cl was 100 in each cycle a consequence of the electrochemical nrr combined with electrochlorination reactions equations 5 9 stability tests were also performed with the cu and cuzn plate cathodes for comparison fig s8 shows that the four cycle operation resulted in a significant decay in the nitrate removal percentage from 31 2 to 9 4 and from 38 3 to 18 3 for the cu and cuzn catalysts respectively the microstructure of the cycled fe 20 n c was also characterized as illustrated in fig 4b the remarkable preservation of the encapsulation structure is clearly visible the fe nanoparticle is still tightly encapsulated by the graphitic carbon shell comparison of the xrd patterns before and after 20 cycles fig 4c also demonstrated its stability as no significant differences were observed in the peaks of c and fe this was also confirmed by comparing the lsv curves recorded on the fe 20 n c cathode operated over 5000 cycles from 0 to 1 4 v which showed only small changes fig 4c this conclusion was further supported by the chemical analysis data which showed that the concentration of dissolved iron ions in the electrolyte was negligible after 20 cycles all these observations provide compelling evidence that the unique encapsulation structure of the fe 20 n c electrocatalyst and the resulting electrocatalytic activity towards nrr are retained over long term operation 3 3 proposed mechanism for nrr on fe n c based on the above information a mechanism for the nrr process on the fe n c electrocatalyst is proposed fig 5 in which surface adsorption of nitrate occurs prior to its stepwise reduction to the final product n2 or nh4 gayen et al 2018 teng et al 2018 zhang et al 2018c the fact that the encapsulated fe nanoparticles are not in direct contact with the electrolyte suggests that the iron surfaces should not be the electrocatalytic centers nevertheless the iron nanoparticle should still play a pivotal role in the catalysis previously performed density functional theory dft calculations deng et al 2012 hu et al 2014 kim et al 2018 tavakkoli et al 2015 have indicated that in the encapsulation structure charges transfer from the fe particles to the carbon exterior leading to a decreased local work function on the carbon surface due to the increased charge density and formation of a local dipole doping with n in the carbon can further decrease the work function deng et al 2012 this result should be conducive to electrostatic and covalent bonding between the oxygen atom in the nitrate and the carbon atom thus facilitating nitrate adsorption according to the nitrate transformation scheme reported in the literature de vooys et al 2001 duca et al 2012b rima et al 2010 yoshioka et al 2016 the surface bound no3 is converted to surface bound no2 equation 11 which is further reduced to surface bound no equation 12 or diffuses into the bulk electrolyte the existence of aqueous no2 in the electrolyte is evidenced in the nrr process with no added cl fig s9 three possible pathways exist starting from the surface bound no2 and ending in different products n2 or nh4 i the aqueous no2 released from the surface is sequentially reduced to nh4 equation 13 this is indeed analogous to the case in which nh4 is the predominant product of nrr on nonprecious metal catalysts because most of the no2 species generated are weakly adsorbed on the nonprecious metal surfaces mattarozzi et al 2013 polatides and kyriacou 2005 ii the moderately surface bonded no can react with the aqueous no leading to the formation of surface bound n2o which is further transformed into n2 according to the eley rideal reaction scheme equations 14 and 15 clayborne et al 2015 yoshioka et al 2016 iii the strongly surface bonded no is also prone to transformation into nh4 with regard to equation 16 de vooys et al 2001 duca et al 2012b rima et al 2010 yoshioka et al 2016 in this study the selectivity for nitrogen for the nrr 25 0 on fe 20 n c is substantially higher than that on cu and cuzn it can be deduced that there may be certain amounts of no adsorbed on the carbon surface which are transformed to the surface bound n2o and to the desired final product n2 the remaining nh4 can be converted into n2 upon addition of a dose of cl in the electrolyte owing to the break point oxidation of ammonia with chlorine produced from anodic oxidation equations 5 9 11 n o 3 a b s h 2 o 2 e n o 2 a b s 2 o h 12 n o 2 a b s h 2 o e n o a b s 2 o h 13 n o 2 s o l 6 h 2 o 6 e

the coking wastewater the performance of fe n c for nrr was tested with real nitrate laden coking wastewater biological effluent from a coking wastewater treatment plant table 1 lists the variations in the wastewater characteristics percentage of nitrogen removal and selectivity for nitrogen as a result of the electrolysis experiments with respect to different cathodes and operational conditions only 20 2 of no3 n from 72 7 to 57 4 mg l 1 in the coking wastewater was removed in the electrochemical system with the carbon electrocatalyst the removal proportion significantly increased to 55 7 from 73 2 to 32 4 mg l 1 when the raw wastewater was subjected to pretreatment by electrochemical oxidation that allowed significant reduction in the cod concentration from 232 1 to 25 3 mg l 1 and the toc concentration from 64 5 to 9 3 mg l 1 this result indicates that the biorefractory compounds i e cod contributors inhibits nitrate removal this inhibitory effect is possibly due to the adsorption of impurities that occupy the readily available active sites for nitrate adsorption and subsequent reactions the nitrogen selectivity was 45 8 larger than 25 0 achieved with the artificial wastewater presumably due to the presence of cl in the real wastewater the concentration of cl in the initial wastewater was 761 5 mg l 1 which dropped to 384 7 mg l 1 after the electrooxidation treatment because of its transformation to gas chlorine the supplement of additional cl to 1 1 g l 1 further improved the nitrogen selectivity to 100 according to equations 5 9 the performance of fe n c electrocatalyst was superior to the commonly used cuzn electrocatalyst in terms of considerably larger percentage of nitrate removal 63 3 vs 21 5 the long term operation over ten cycles resulted in an insignificant reduction in the nitrate removal proportion indicating good stability of the cathode for removal of nitrate in the real wastewater it should be noted that the electrolysis tests led to an increase in electrolyte ph due to the nrrs equations 11 16 these findings imply that the fe n c electrocatalyst developed in this study is efficient and stable in transforming nitrate to nitrogen from the coking wastewater given that cl is available this paves the way to further application of the fe n c electrocatalyst as the cathode material for treating a variety of wastewaters and groundwater that are laden with nitrate and chloride and lack of biodegradable organics 4 conclusions we show that the carbon with encapsulated iron nanoparticles described herein exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and long term durability towards nrr the electrochemical performance can be tuned in response to the content of iron in the electrocatalyst which relies on the concentration of the precursor used we propose that the iron nanoparticles stabilized by the protective graphitic shells could attenuate the work function of the neighboring carbon atoms which likely act as reactive centers to facilitate nrr these findings open a new avenue for utilizing carbon based electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction the electrochemical approach to nitrate removal offers potential environmental benefits first nrr on the carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles is achieved under conditions of insufficient carbon sources and neutral ph it is demonstrated that the resulting catalyst exhibits good performance for removal of nitrate in the biological effluent of the coking wastewater in which biodegradable organics are limited compared with other metallic electrocatalysts that commonly require an acid environment to ensure activity excessive use of acids to adjust ph is unnecessary for the carbon electrocatalysts more importantly the carbon electrocatalysts toward nrr exhibit substantial long term stability differing significantly from the metallic electrocatalysts which are easily dissolved and aggregated upon multiple cycling operations this circumvents the problem of secondary pollution and catalyst deactivation before their practical application in nitrate control in the industrial wastewater groundwater treatment further efforts should be made to enhance their activity and selectivity for nitrogen in the absence of cl and to develop strategies for scaling up synthesis declaration of interests the authors
