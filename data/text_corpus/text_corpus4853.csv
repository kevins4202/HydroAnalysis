24265,the landscape of disgust framework emphasizes the trade off of satisfying critical needs against environmental cues of putative disease risk for animals that revisit areas repeated exposures to infectious disease through self fouling are a potential threat that can be averted through the mechanism of fecal avoidance motivated by disgust here we present an agent based spatially explicit network model where simulated animal groups move along edges connecting network nodes representing waterholes these water resources dynamically shift via evaporation drinking and rainfall we parameterize our model with the case study of buffalo and their intestinal parasites buffaloes defecate near and are then motivated to avoid waterholes and we simulate parasite aggregation as a measure of contamination and potential disease risk though disgust intolerance of fecal contamination reduced maximum environmental parasite density at waterholes strong disgust resulted in a marked increase of traveling incurring energetic or other costs we calculated an optimum trade off in which fecal avoidance provides a reduction in expected environmental parasite density but travel to obtain new water resources was not markedly increased we recalculated this optimum varying assumptions of water influx and prioritization biases given the necessity of water even when contaminated it is theoretically justified that disgust would have some temporal and spatial variability via habituation thus we included a cumulative modifier to disgust based on local conditions and travel burden we observed pronounced habituation during periods of higher water availability and groups acclimated to conditions before low water availability we present this model to encourage similar expansive approaches using a network based model and to stimulate discussion modeling and experimental approaches which continue to develop the landscape of disgust keywords landscape of disgust trade offs self fouling disease risk climate variability data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction disgust can be viewed as a neurological system that prevents infection risk by relying on environmental cues of putative infection risk curtis 2014 while disgust has received increasing attention as a motivator of fecal avoidance and such a trade off is intrinsic to the landscape of disgust framework weinstein et al 2018 how disgust operates in a cost benefit framework is less developed the landscape of disgust extends from the landscape of fear framework bleicher 2017 brown et al 1999 which is understood as the way the animal perceives its environment based on the cost benefit analysis of the trade off of food or other critical needs such as hydration or sleep anderson 1998 rosinger and brewis 2020 and safety associated with foraging in specific areas of the habitat available to it bleicher 2017 2 as implied by the change in terminology disgust replaces fear as a primary motivator and instead of assessing predation risk extends towards environmental cues of potential disease risk e g dung bacterial slime weinstein et al 2018 for a social animal larger aggregate resource utilization as well as increased potential disease exposure and transmission kappeler et al 2015 are often inevitable consequences of group living that must be balanced against the fitness gains of sociality self fouling also can have dramatic consequences for group living organisms work on hippos suggests that self fouling contamination can be so extreme as to cause aquatic hypoxia dutton et al 2018 for group living animals aggregate self fouling may be beyond a single individual s direct control but individuals can often exert some control over consensus decision making and group movement bonnell et al 2017 stephen et al 2011 strandburg peshkin et al 2017 to avoid fecal contamination of food or water sources many animals may rely on the cue of disgust or an analogous motivational system that promotes fecal avoidance but disgust cannot overly impinge upon other necessary life functions we explore how disgust balances infection risk with resource requirements how helpful can disgust be when constrained against the opportunity costs in critical resource acquisition to understand this trade off we present a spatially explicit pseudo gravity network model using an agent based approach in which nodes represent potential sites prone to self fouling in a strict classical economic gravity model the movement of products towards regional demand would be predicted as a function of distance to that region anderson 2011 in this present model design we instead rely only on whether or not a waterhole is sufficing and then agents select the nearest waterhole hence the psuedo distinguisher while we focus on waterholes nodes in our model could instead represent feeding patches with concentrated resources interconnected sections of a burrow or sleep sites individuals or groups travel along network edges and various assumptions can be included about the perils of a journey in our model we designated edge weight as an inverse of distance such that stronger edges represent the shortest paths alternative model designs however could use edge weights to represent potential perceivable risk or energetic usage gallagher et al 2017 for simplicity we only focused on distance to waterholes and did not explicitly include the current or anticipated water volume as a point of consideration in decision making but this dynamic could be implemented in future adaptations of similar models importantly this approach mitigates the conflation of the landscape framework with habitat selection by shifting the focus to critical factors whereby each node represents a critical need bleicher 2017 that is activity data on habitat use can conflate a variety of contrasting stimuli balancing food availability versus predator risk simplifying a complex system via a network representation can reduce noise and isolate expectations regarding critical needs to nodes or edges but also facilitates a multiplex approach that accommodates contrasting stimuli 1 1 an example system of motivating disgust to demonstrate the potential contributions of this modeling approach we used a relatively well described system of parasites in wild african buffalo ezenwa 2003 budischak et al 2012 ezenwa and jolles 2008 and focus on their use of waterholes buffalo provide a natural study system to consider as an example because there is a relatively robust literature of bovid fecal avoidance from captive cattle willms et al 2002 schütz et al 2019 verwer et al 2016 dohi et al 1991 they occupy a system with variable access to clumped resources via water holes prone to variation during seasonal and drought periods kogo et al 2021 ogutu et al 2016 siderius et al 2021 nguvava et al 2019 and they have large group sizes korte 2008 grazers often aggregate near water sources titcomb et al 2021a and buffaloes are a relatively water dependent large bodied species redfern et al 2003 with each individual estimated to require around 3 42 liters day kihwele et al 2020 water availability is a key component influencing population dynamics in east africa shaping migration wolanski and gereta 2000 home range size and daily buffalo movement roug et al 2020 thus water is a necessity with the inherent potential for self fouling i e contamination of the waterhole by a host organism s biological waste and any associated pathogens especially as waterholes shrink due to evaporation seepage or human animal intake fecal contamination is problematic as high rates of self fouling increase the potential for higher environmental parasite density for group members previous studies have shown an 85 prevalence of nematode infections in wild buffalo populations ezenwa 2003 and nematodes have an appreciable physiological and health burden at high abundances budischak et al 2012 that can scale to induce potential fitness costs ezenwa and jolles 2008 many nematodes are transmitted via the environment often migrating to the tips of grass blades to be consumed by hosts animals before producing eggs which are later defecated by the hosts chubb et al 2020 nematodes have been shown to continue to persist near waterholes relative to nearby grazing zones even despite unfavorable environmental conditions ng ang a et al 2004 nematodes transmitted via ingestion from the environment have a latency between hatching and infectivity posited as an evolved counterstrategy to ungulate fecal avoidance behavior chubb et al 2020 as such the presence of dung is partially decoupled temporally from infective parasite peaks numerous ungulate species including bovines have a strong aversion to fecal depositions dohi et al 1991 fankhauser et al 2008 hutchings et al 1998 schütz et al 2021 smith et al 2009 verwer et al 2016 ezenwa 2004 bovines prefer uncontaminated water troughs schütz et al 2019 and evidence suggests that detection of fecal contamination is primarily olfactory verwer et al 2016 contamination can be detected for at least 35 days after deposition dohi et al 1991 and can occur with fecal concentrations as low as 0 05 mg of feces 1 g of water schütz et al 2019 willms et al 2002 while this threshold indicates a high sensitivity for detecting fecal contamination it does not necessarily translate to behavioral avoidance of or relocation from a valuable resource avoidance of fecal contamination has been posited as a greater priority than consumption of forage coulson et al 2018 when their only water source is contaminated bovines initially decrease water intake but resume normal intake after several days schütz et al 2021 thus although fecal avoidance is relatively powerful bovines can habituate to fecal contamination of their water sources at least in a closed system this habituation is compelling because it can biologically reduce the burden of avoidance e g travel dehydration but exposes the host to increased health risks reduced buffalo defecation near waterholes as a method of reducing potential contamination has not been documented instead evidence suggests the inverse that fecal deposition is greater near waterholes relative to random sampling from grazing plots titcomb et al 2021b and grazing has been observed at higher intensities near waterholes hagwet et al 2014 thus given the strength of fecal avoidance via disgust and the potential dangers of a heightened parasitic burden it seems logical that buffalo would avoid severely contaminated waterholes however such avoidance must logically be balanced against the high water dependency especially in large groups furthermore given the evidence that bovine may initially decrease water intake when their water source is contaminated only to later increase their intake to normal habituation must be included as a relevant variable of interest that can reconcile why defecation is not reduced near a waterhole 2 methods as a concrete system to explore with our general model we chose parameters to approximate the area buffalo density buffalo behavior and hydrological dynamics of laikipia kenya modeling was coded and executed using r version 4 1 1 r core team 2021 code is available on github at https github com pritchardajp self fouling broadly we established a fully connected network graph of waterholes of varying sizes which buffalo moved between along edges each of the scenarios were projected for a simulated 3 years 1095 daily time steps with 10 realizations see fig 1 for model flowchart to determine the suitability of 10 realizations we examined the resulting coefficients of variation for several important output measures across 2 10 realizations appendix s1 1 subsequent realizations did not alter our coefficients beyond an a priori set threshold of 0 05 that is new runs did not contribute novel variance for the variables of interest the relative pattern of the variables of interest did not markedly change across the three years appendix s1 2 if water availability was exhausted during a run then that run was reset with the same parameters but a new stochastic seed this occurrence was uncommon with our parameter values but increased if water availability was lower however buffalo would not remain resident if water was regionally unavailable and thus fecal avoidance would not be a determining factor in the system of the input parameters we varied tolerance of disgust habituation to contamination and water catchment size see table 1 for the parameter values of the 1080 realizations disgust tolerance represented the baseline values for how tolerant buffalo groups are of fecal contamination at a given waterhole mass of dung per m2 around the present waterhole because animals may face conditions of high contamination during periods of low water availability we also included a habituation parameter that modified tolerance habituation was included by having tolerance of contamination change over time e g if animals are given limited access to clean water schütz et al 2021 habituation was quantified as a cumulative modifier added to tolerance which was increased by the habituation value table 1 for every day in transit and also if a subsequent waterhole had a higher concentration of dung relative to the most recently departed waterhole if the subsequent waterhole however was cleaner than the most recently departed waterhole then the cumulative modifier was decreased by the value of habituation all groups shared the same habituation and tolerance values within a run but the resulting modifiers via habituation ultimately would vary by group experience throughout each run we did not model variation or plasticity of individual group members our model output consisted of four data frames to record changes in waterholes buffalo movement dung abundance and parasite population dynamics 2 1 waterholes to estimate usable water sources we first acquired data on the total area of permanent and seasonal water sources in laikipia kenya united nations environment programme 2022 we used a published dataset of permanent waterhole sizes from a ranch in laikipia kenya ngigi et al 2005 to estimate a log distribution of waterholes sizes from which we drew randomly to attain a total constant waterhole distribution that was equivalent to the total area of permanent water sources seasonal waterholes were estimated to be smaller than the permanent waterholes and were randomly drawn from a normal distribution until the total seasonal waterhole distribution was equivalent to the total reported area we then converted waterholes surface areas to volume using the overall scaling relationship in cael et al 2017 but without an error term as this would have been consistent across scenarios and thus would not have impacted our comparative results evaporation was included as a constant rate of 0 065 mm per m2 of a waterholes current surface area at each time step ngigi et al 2005 we simulated daily rainfall with a markov chain model using vfs package s wth param and rainfall functions goslee et al 2018 drawing upon 10 years of data from a nearby weather station in el doret kenya menne et al 2012a menne et al 2012b water availability for the buffalo however required pooling in the waterholes which was mediated by catchment size as a multiplier of the surface area for each waterhole that is a catchment of 16 would mean that a waterhole of 10 m surface area can receive water from a 160 m area from published values thome 2005 we estimated that catchment sizes in laikipia are 70 140x the surface area of waterholes our system however was closed and we included a single species that consumes water as opposed to a real world system where water usage occurs from a large variety of species as such we set catchment size at the lower end of the estimate 64 furthermore to explore how multi annual droughts might alter the system we also included lower values 16 32 resulting in lower water availability we include simulated drought conditions to interrogate how the increasing frequency or magnitude of droughts might impact this system nguvava et al 2019 2 2 buffalo buffalo densities were estimated in each run using published densities from laikipia kenya with group sizes that were randomly drawn from a log normal distribution with a mean of 350 korte 2008 we assumed that buffalo would leave their current waterhole if it was unable to sustain the present group s water requirements i e the product of the individuals in the group and a daily drinking volume 3 42 liters additionally if dung concentrations exceeded a current tolerance threshold as currently modified by habituation then the buffalo moved to the nearest water sufficing waterhole without knowledge of the contamination in the subsequent waterhole as such our model assumes that buffalo can retain knowledge of water presence in the surrounding holes but not retain knowledge of current fecal mass at the water holes this is because assuming temporally stable hydrology and geology the location of waterholes are recurrent and predictable and can thus be retained in long term memory furthermore fecal avoidance however has not been posited as a cognitively processed cue rather a mechanistic deterrent whether buffalo engage in the cognitive calculations necessary to account for fecal mass decay and parasite presence is not necessarily known traveling buffalo were not present at any waterhole and therefore neither drank from nor defecated at a waterhole additionally we assumed that traveling buffalo were able meet their water needs or fast from water for simplicity upon arriving at a waterhole the buffalo would then resume drinking and defecating as usual upon the time step in which they arrive at the new waterhole travel distance achieved by each traveling group was randomly drawn in each time step from a distribution that matched published daily travel distances roug et al 2020 2 3 dung dung was deposited at a site under the assumption that each individual buffalo defecated 20 kg per day a conservative value given beef cattle produce 27 34 kg per day herbert et al 2020 we assumed that groups spend 10 min in the area within 5 m of the total circumference of a waterhole per daily visit dung was therefore calculated as the average mass deposited by the total number of buffalo in a group over 10 min then normalized by the area within 5 m of the total current circumference of a waterhole kg m2 we assumed dung would act as a deterrent up to 35 days because volatile chemicals extracted from dung deterred feeding even up to 35 days post excretion dung older than 35 days was no longer assumed to influence fecal avoidance dohi et al 1991 2 4 parasites we assumed as a constant throughout the model that 85 of buffalo were infected with nematodes ezenwa 2003 and used the total dung deposited around a waterhole to generate parasite egg abundances per m2 parasites were given a random hatch date using a random normal distribution of documented days until hatching mean 10 5 sd 1 2 removing values that exceeded the bounds of observed hatching durations of 7 14 days fiel et al 2012 hatched parasites died per time step as a constant proportion of individuals over a six week decay calculated using the last peak population size infectious larval stages can survive on the semi arid kenyan landscape from 3 to 15 weeks but waterholes provide a moisture reserve that facilitates the persistence of egg hatchings year round ng ang a et al 2004 2 5 analyses environmental parasite density was our primary variable of interest as a measure of self fouling as such we focused on the maximum environmental parasite density per run as an indication of highest incidence self fouling in a waterhole this is because dung was the mechanistic cue that buffalo used to avoid disease risk but the actual risk is environmental parasite density which is temporally asynchronous from fecal deposition due to egg hatching times to explore the waterhole node usage we extracted three measures maximum aggregate time at any node longest continuous residence at any node and total nodes visited per run measures of interest were extracted at the end of each time point such that there were 1095 data frames with output for each time step relevant to parasites water dung and buffalo dynamics 3 results the number of buffalo groups relative to waterholes was very low consequently contaminated nodes were not particularly influential on the mean environmental parasite density of each run this is evident in that mean parasite densities were generally similar across runs with distinct tolerance and habituation values but were slightly elevated with low tolerance and habituation values fig 2 appendix s1 3 given the lower sd of environmental parasite density across nodes in these runs appendix s1 4 we attribute this to more non zero values across waterhole nodes generally lower values of tolerance high fecal avoidance resulted in lower maximum parasite densities across nodes within each run fig 2 appendix s1 5 signifying reduced contamination of particular waterholes increasing the values of habituation resulted in similar maximum parasite densities across tolerance values negating the influence of low tolerance for low and low intermediate tolerance values tolerance 4 reduced maximum parasite density was associated with a dramatic increase in total time spent traveling fig 3 total travel for tolerance 4 was 263 79 mean 188 72 sd versus 73 05 mean 23 50 sd for tolerance 4 intermediate tolerance values 7 10 did not have higher total travel relative to higher values of tolerance 25 but attained similar maximum parasite density to runs with respectively lower tolerance runs with lower total water availability modified via catchment might be expected to travel more to find waterholes but suffer more from contaminated waterholes as the total surface area of waterholes would be reduced this effect was observable albeit not pronounced but only for runs with intermediate or higher tolerance tolerance 7 we then calculated a tolerance optimum that simultaneously reduced disease risk maximum parasite density a near sigmoidal function and travel risk total travel a near exponential decay by finding the lowest point for both variables to calculate this optimum we first partitioned the results by catchment then rescaled each variable of interest via min max normalization before plotting a smoothed line using geom smooth with a generalized additive method with k 9 for each normalized variable and tolerance fig 4 we extracted the smoothed fit as 10 000 data points and then calculated the tolerance value that resulted in the lowest combined value for the normalized variables of interest while this is a simplistic approach that can only approximate the true quantitative optimum we emphasize that it qualitatively illustrates the relative importance of the contributions of each of the considered factors towards an optimal trade off future implementations seeking true optima would benefit from for example a multi objective optimization using a genetic algorithm e g konak et al 2006 in systems with exact functional forms and parameters reflecting the specific epidemiological and climatological landscape across catchment values the mean tolerance optimum was 8 20 0 08sd we also recomputed this optimum with the assumption that prioritization biases might exist whereby parasites or travel might be assumed to be more costly as such we calculated the optimum with a weighting 2x on either variable tolerance for the lowest catchment 16x was slightly more sensitive to prioritization bias but comparable to the optimum tolerance thresholds in higher catchments fig 4 we explored whether gross patterns of waterhole usage would covary with tolerance consistent patterns between tolerance and metrics of node use were not readily discernable aggregate time at particular waterholes appendix s1 6a s1 7a continuous residence at a particular waterhole appendix s1 6b 1 7b patterns of distributed visitation across waterholes appendix s1 6c 1 7c intermediate values of tolerance 7 0 had higher aggregate and continuous residence at waterholes relative to low values of tolerance but not markedly lower than higher values of tolerance habituation had stronger effects on the disgust modifier when tolerance values were initially low 4 compared to when tolerance was high 4 fig 5 appendix s1 8 steeper initial slopes were observed at earlier time steps for lower habituation modifiers 1 coupled with lower tolerance values 4 we also examined whether habituation was more accelerated during drier periods through visualization of the incremental increase of the disgust modifier by the proportion of total water remaining in the system per time step buffalo groups underwent more intense habituation during periods of high water availability current availability 0 75 of total potential availability as opposed to low water availability fig 5 appendix s1 8 to further examine the influence of shifting water availability on the system dynamics we separated each realization into its constituent time steps grouped according to high and low water availability relative to the mean water availability for each realization when tolerance was low high water availability resulted in more travel than during periods of low water availability this difference was not present once tolerance approached intermediate values 7 0 when tolerance was high however the opposite pattern emerged such that travel increased during periods of low water availability relative to periods of high water availability fig 6 interestingly maximum parasite density did not markedly differ between periods of high and low water availability appendix s1 9 4 discussion we implemented a pseudo gravity network model to explore how disgust operates in a cost benefit framework reliant on environmental cues of potential disease risk i e dung we used a concrete case study to explore with our general model in order to consider a set of parameters that approximate a realistic system using real world geographic area buffalo density buffalo behavior parasite deposition and longevity and hydrological dynamics while fecal avoidance controlled via the tolerance parameter reduced environmental parasite density it also increased travel we found that there was an attainable maximal trade off which was more prone to prioritization biases in water poor realizations controlled via the catchment parameter habituation did erode tolerance as would be expected but this occurred more rapidly during water rich time steps within each realization low tolerance values had heightened travel during periods of relatively high water availability but as tolerance increased travel was instead heightened during periods of relatively low water availability together these findings emphasize the complexity of fecal avoidance whereby hyper sensitivity can result in an unintended burden promoting increased travel we ascribe this to fecal avoidance being the dominating driver for movement rather than waterholes when tolerance is low while high tolerance shifts the importance to finding abundant water sources irrespective of fouling habituation can be an important mechanism to fine tune fecal avoidance but such changes might occur prior to challenging environmental conditions when water availability is high and parasite dynamics are more likely to be driving the system thus individuals could be habituated to self fouling during drought conditions where self fouling might be more difficult to avoid in our model low tolerance of dung contamination did result in reduced maximum environmental parasite density within the system inversely high tolerance facilitated higher concentrations of parasite density intermediate values however performed similarly to low tolerance values reducing maximum parasite density to values of near equivalence when the simulated buffalo herds were given very low tolerance for contamination then at any given time more waterholes were seeded with parasites this dynamic was evidenced by higher mean parasite density across nodes in the low tolerance runs relative to higher tolerance runs higher tolerance runs however had a higher sd of parasite density relative to low tolerance runs this distinction likely reflects the more disparately distributed contamination in higher tolerance runs there were more nodes with either an absence of parasites or high maximum parasite densities thus in low tolerance runs more of the environment is contaminated overall but with lower local contamination while high tolerance runs had higher localized contamination this is challenging to contextualize without larger scale data on parasite abundance across seasons and drought periods titcomb et al 2021b reported heightened parasite densities near waterholes experiencing dry spells relative to nearby sites without water but this result could reflect either increase local contamination or increase mean contamination as all waterholes would have to be sampled in a region over time we found a point of maximal efficiency in the level of disgust that reduced both parasite density and time spent foraging for water we might assume that unnecessary increases in travel are intrinsically costly due to increased energy and water expenditure as well as uncertainty via lack of information of reliable water access local forage conditions or predator risk if this assumption is upheld then the benefits of high fecal avoidance might be greatly outweighed by the costs of increased traveling indeed these findings parallel waterhole usage in red fronted lemurs eulemur rufifrons that avoided natural waterholes contaminated with feces and delayed to return to contaminated holes but distance from sleep site was a more significant determining variable of waterhole usage amoroso et al 2019 thus future applications could include other critical factors that might intervene in animal movement there is substantial evidence for individual fecal avoidance in ungulates dohi et al 1991 fankhauser et al 2008 hutchings et al 1998 schütz et al 2021 smith et al 2009 verwer et al 2016 ezenwa 2004 if and how such information scales to inform major collective decisions is to our knowledge not yet understood additionally olfactory detection of fecal contamination is very sensitive in bovines dohi et al 1991 schütz et al 2019 willms et al 2002 but we also know that despite a tendency for fecal avoidance in systems with access to clean water schütz et al 2019 there exists the potential for habituation if high levels of contamination are present schütz et al 2021 we emphasize that in our system habituation eroded the effectiveness of disgust in reducing maximum environmental parasite density dishabituation only occurred via encounters with more contaminated nodes as such the aggregate modifier resulting from habituation continued to increase relatively unchecked over time paramount for future research would be isolating the mechanisms e g trigger cues temporospatial endurance temporal couplings as well as upper and lower thresholds of habituation in wild systems especially in environments facing rapid climatic change we would emphasize that we use habituation broadly to also include circumstances where individuals do not necessarily perceive fecal contamination as innocuous rather they do not physiologically respond to it cyr and romero 2009 alternatively habituation may erode perceptions of infection risk via environmental cues though in turn time decay or mitigating cues might erode habituation effects finally it could be argued that habitation might result in an irreversible desensitization though this seems unlikely given the potential fitness costs of high parasite load budischak et al 2012 ezenwa and jolles 2008 given the necessity of water it seems probable that disgust would have some temporal and spatial variability via habituation interestingly the action of habituation need not be temporally coupled with current water availability more pronounced habituation occurred during periods of higher seasonal water availability compared to low water availability in line with this high disgust resulted in higher travel during periods of high water availability versus low availability but this difference decreased as the sensitivity of disgust was reduced once disgust was minimal travel was higher during periods of low water availability this shift suggests that high levels of disgust drive movement dynamics but as disgust decreases water availability was more influential on movement dynamics we also found that in water poor systems i e low catchment values prioritization biases were more influential suggestive of a greater ecological challenge to balance travel and parasite risks in consistently water poor environments 4 1 future directions climatic shifts and increased variability in local conditions have been observed across east africa kogo et al 2021 ogutu et al 2016 siderius et al 2021 with projections suggesting increased drought conditions both in magnitude and abundance nguvava et al 2019 such drought conditions are concerning given recent evidence that parasite risks were increased around water sources in drier areas titcomb et al 2021b given shifting climatic conditions how might animals alter their behavior in response to dynamic shifts in local trade offs our model indicates that behavioral shifts i e habituation might precede periods of climatic drying even in dramatically different scenarios of total water availability controlled via catchment understanding these shifts becomes more critical given unpredictable and changing climatic conditions we acknowledge that we made several simplifying assumptions that could be explored to provide further insight on this or similar systems first we did not limit buffalo to home ranges nor include specific long distance movement though we modeled a total area 8696 1 km2 that encapsulates even the largest observed home ranges bennitt et al 2016 roug et al 2020 even so it is worth emphasizing that buffaloes would have local ranges that are not just linked to a need to suffice water requirements but also vary in travel distances to meet all biological requirements bennitt et al 2016 roug et al 2020 inclusion of a forage layer reproductive competition or compartmental models for infection could provide insight into other trade offs beyond those we have discussed here we chose to model fecal parasite deposition solely as a phenomena tied to waterholes but other areas of concentrated aggregation such as verdant glades could be included in a similar way and coupled with the rainfall dynamics explicit inclusion of infection dynamics however should also take into account differences in host immunity ezenwa and jolles 2011 parasite dynamics could also be linked to climatic conditions as water availability can influence survivability ng ang a et al 2004 finally we focused this initial presentation of our model on nematodes in part because they can infect other host species presenting an interesting natural next set of immediate questions considering implications for multi host transmission networks walker and morgan 2014 5 conclusions we present a general modeling approach that can be applied to investigate a variety of systems to better understand and apply landscape of disgust fear peril frameworks importantly this approach redresses a highlighted challenge with these frameworks that is the conflation of the landscape framework with habitat selection bleicher 2017 we present this model to encourage similar expansive approaches using a pseudo gravity network graph based model and to stimulate discussion modeling and experimental approaches which continue to develop the landscape of disgust our approach could be implemented with multiple layers to include multiple environmental cues or needs using abstract costs along edges which need not be representative of physical space or using agents representative of multiple species roaming concurrently we emphasize the need to examine how evolved strategies such as fecal avoidance may invoke added costs or fail to protect against parasitic counter strategies such as decoupled hatching and infectivity chubb et al 2020 furthermore given the complexity of such dynamics models such as presented here can be used to interrogate the actual trade offs that animals must make in a wild system while offering utility towards examining predictions of when evolved traits might be disadvantageous in the face of new disease threats or major climatic perturbations credit authorship contribution statement alexander j pritchard

24265,the landscape of disgust framework emphasizes the trade off of satisfying critical needs against environmental cues of putative disease risk for animals that revisit areas repeated exposures to infectious disease through self fouling are a potential threat that can be averted through the mechanism of fecal avoidance motivated by disgust here we present an agent based spatially explicit network model where simulated animal groups move along edges connecting network nodes representing waterholes these water resources dynamically shift via evaporation drinking and rainfall we parameterize our model with the case study of buffalo and their intestinal parasites buffaloes defecate near and are then motivated to avoid waterholes and we simulate parasite aggregation as a measure of contamination and potential disease risk though disgust intolerance of fecal contamination reduced maximum environmental parasite density at waterholes strong disgust resulted in a marked increase of traveling incurring energetic or other costs we calculated an optimum trade off in which fecal avoidance provides a reduction in expected environmental parasite density but travel to obtain new water resources was not markedly increased we recalculated this optimum varying assumptions of water influx and prioritization biases given the necessity of water even when contaminated it is theoretically justified that disgust would have some temporal and spatial variability via habituation thus we included a cumulative modifier to disgust based on local conditions and travel burden we observed pronounced habituation during periods of higher water availability and groups acclimated to conditions before low water availability we present this model to encourage similar expansive approaches using a network based model and to stimulate discussion modeling and experimental approaches which continue to develop the landscape of disgust keywords landscape of disgust trade offs self fouling disease risk climate variability data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction disgust can be viewed as a neurological system that prevents

to cause aquatic hypoxia dutton et al 2018 for group living animals aggregate self fouling may be beyond a single individual s direct control but individuals can often exert some control over

of disgust or an analogous motivational system that promotes fecal avoidance but disgust cannot overly impinge upon other necessary life functions we explore how disgust balances infection risk with resource requirements how helpful can disgust be when constrained against the opportunity costs in critical resource acquisition to understand this trade off we present a spatially explicit pseudo gravity network model using an agent based approach in which nodes represent potential sites prone to self fouling in a strict classical economic gravity model the movement of products towards regional demand would be predicted as a function of distance to that region anderson 2011 in this present model design we instead rely only on whether or not a waterhole is sufficing and then agents select the nearest waterhole hence the psuedo distinguisher while we focus on waterholes nodes in our model could instead represent feeding patches with concentrated resources interconnected sections of a burrow or sleep sites individuals or groups travel along network edges and various assumptions can be included about the perils of a journey in our model we designated edge weight as an inverse of distance such that stronger edges represent the shortest paths alternative model designs however could use edge weights to represent potential perceivable risk or energetic usage gallagher et al 2017 for simplicity we only focused on distance to waterholes and did not explicitly include the current or anticipated water volume as a point of consideration in decision making but this dynamic could be implemented in future adaptations of similar models importantly this approach mitigates the conflation of the landscape framework with habitat selection by shifting the focus to critical factors whereby each node represents a critical need bleicher 2017 that is activity data on habitat use can conflate a variety of contrasting stimuli balancing food availability versus predator risk simplifying a complex system via a network representation can reduce noise and isolate expectations regarding critical needs to nodes or edges but also facilitates a multiplex approach that accommodates contrasting stimuli 1 1 an example system of motivating disgust to demonstrate the potential contributions of this modeling approach we used a relatively well described system of parasites in wild african buffalo ezenwa 2003 budischak et al 2012 ezenwa and jolles 2008 and focus on their use of waterholes buffalo provide a natural study system to consider as an example because there is a relatively robust literature of bovid fecal avoidance from captive cattle willms et al 2002 schütz et al 2019 verwer et al 2016 dohi et al 1991 they occupy a system with variable access to clumped resources via water holes prone to variation during seasonal and drought periods kogo et al 2021 ogutu et al 2016 siderius et al 2021 nguvava et al 2019 and they have large group sizes korte 2008 grazers often aggregate near water sources titcomb et al 2021a and buffaloes are a relatively water dependent large bodied species redfern et al 2003 with each individual estimated to require around 3 42 liters day kihwele et al 2020 water availability is a key component influencing population dynamics in east africa shaping migration wolanski and gereta 2000 home range size and daily buffalo movement roug et al 2020 thus water is a necessity with the inherent potential for self fouling i e contamination of the waterhole by a host organism s biological waste and any associated pathogens especially as waterholes shrink due to evaporation seepage or human animal intake fecal contamination is problematic as high rates of self fouling increase the potential for higher environmental parasite density for group members previous studies have shown an 85 prevalence of nematode infections in wild buffalo populations ezenwa 2003 and nematodes have an appreciable physiological and health burden at high abundances budischak et al 2012 that can scale to induce potential fitness costs ezenwa and jolles 2008 many nematodes are transmitted via the environment often migrating to the tips of grass blades to be consumed by hosts animals before producing eggs which are later defecated by the hosts chubb et al 2020 nematodes have been shown to continue to persist near waterholes relative to nearby grazing zones even despite unfavorable environmental conditions ng ang a et al 2004 nematodes transmitted via ingestion from the environment have a latency between hatching and infectivity posited as an evolved counterstrategy to ungulate fecal avoidance behavior chubb et al 2020 as such the presence of dung is partially decoupled temporally from infective parasite peaks numerous ungulate species including bovines have a strong aversion to fecal depositions dohi et al 1991 fankhauser et al 2008 hutchings et al 1998 schütz et al 2021 smith et al 2009 verwer et al 2016 ezenwa 2004 bovines prefer uncontaminated water troughs schütz et al 2019 and evidence suggests that detection of fecal contamination is primarily olfactory verwer et al 2016 contamination can be detected for at least 35 days after deposition dohi et al 1991 and can occur with fecal concentrations as low as 0 05 mg of feces 1 g of water schütz et al 2019 willms et al 2002 while this threshold indicates a high sensitivity for detecting fecal contamination it does not necessarily translate to behavioral avoidance of or relocation from a valuable resource avoidance of fecal contamination has been posited as a greater priority than consumption of forage coulson et al 2018 when their only water source is contaminated bovines initially decrease water intake but resume normal intake after several days schütz et al 2021 thus although fecal avoidance is relatively powerful bovines can habituate to fecal contamination of their water sources at least in a closed system this habituation is compelling because it can biologically reduce the burden of avoidance e g travel dehydration but exposes the host to increased health risks reduced buffalo defecation near waterholes as a method of reducing potential contamination has not been documented instead evidence suggests the inverse that fecal deposition is greater near waterholes relative to random sampling from grazing plots titcomb et al 2021b and grazing has been observed at higher intensities near waterholes hagwet et al 2014 thus given the strength of fecal avoidance via disgust and the potential dangers of a heightened parasitic burden it seems logical that buffalo would avoid severely contaminated waterholes however such avoidance must logically be balanced against the high water dependency especially in large groups furthermore given the evidence that bovine may initially decrease water intake when their water source is contaminated only to later increase their intake to normal habituation must be included as a relevant variable of interest that can reconcile why defecation is not reduced near a waterhole 2 methods as a concrete system to explore with our general model we chose parameters to approximate the area buffalo density buffalo behavior and hydrological dynamics of laikipia kenya modeling was coded and executed using r version 4 1 1 r core team 2021 code is available on github at https github com pritchardajp self fouling broadly we established a fully connected network graph of waterholes of varying sizes which buffalo moved between along edges each of the scenarios were projected for a simulated 3 years 1095 daily time steps with 10 realizations see fig 1 for model flowchart to determine the suitability of 10 realizations we examined the resulting coefficients of variation for several important output measures across 2 10 realizations appendix s1 1 subsequent realizations did not alter our coefficients beyond an a priori set threshold of 0 05 that is new runs did not contribute novel variance for the variables of interest the relative pattern of the variables of interest did not markedly change across the three years appendix s1 2 if water availability was exhausted during a run then that run was reset with the same parameters but a new stochastic seed this occurrence was uncommon with our parameter values but increased if water availability was lower however buffalo would not remain resident if water was regionally unavailable and thus fecal avoidance would not be a determining factor in the system of the input parameters we varied tolerance of disgust habituation to contamination and water catchment size see table 1 for the parameter values of the 1080 realizations disgust tolerance represented the baseline values for how tolerant buffalo groups are of fecal contamination at a given waterhole mass of dung per m2 around the present waterhole because animals may face conditions of high contamination during periods of low water availability we also included a habituation parameter that modified tolerance habituation was included by having tolerance of contamination change over time e g if animals are given limited access to clean water schütz et al 2021 habituation was quantified as a cumulative modifier added to tolerance which was increased by the habituation value table 1 for every day in transit and also if a subsequent waterhole had a higher concentration of dung relative to the most recently departed waterhole if the subsequent waterhole however was cleaner than the most recently departed waterhole then the cumulative modifier was decreased by the value of habituation all groups shared the same habituation and tolerance values within a run but the resulting modifiers via habituation ultimately would vary by group experience throughout each run we did not model variation or plasticity of individual group members our model output consisted of four data frames to record changes in waterholes buffalo movement dung abundance and parasite population dynamics 2 1 waterholes to estimate usable water sources we first acquired data on the total area of permanent and seasonal water sources in laikipia kenya united nations environment programme 2022 we used a published dataset of permanent waterhole sizes from a ranch in laikipia kenya ngigi et al 2005 to estimate a log distribution of waterholes sizes from which we drew randomly to attain a total constant waterhole distribution that was equivalent to the total area of permanent water sources seasonal waterholes were estimated to be smaller than the permanent waterholes and were randomly drawn from a normal distribution until the total seasonal waterhole distribution was equivalent to the total reported area we then converted waterholes surface areas to volume using the overall scaling relationship in cael et al 2017 but without an error term as this would have been consistent across scenarios and thus would not have impacted our comparative results evaporation was included as a constant rate of 0 065 mm per m2 of a waterholes current surface area at each time step ngigi et al 2005 we simulated daily rainfall with a markov chain model using vfs package s wth param and rainfall functions goslee et al 2018 drawing upon 10 years of data from a nearby weather station in el doret kenya menne et al 2012a menne et al 2012b water availability for the buffalo however required pooling in the waterholes which was mediated by catchment size as a multiplier of the surface area for each waterhole that is a catchment of 16 would mean that a waterhole of 10 m surface area can receive water from a 160 m area from published values thome 2005 we estimated that catchment sizes in laikipia are 70 140x the surface area of waterholes our system however was closed and we included a single species that consumes water as opposed to a real world system where water usage occurs from a large variety of species as such we set catchment size at the lower end of the estimate 64 furthermore to explore how multi annual droughts might alter the system we also included lower values 16 32 resulting in lower water availability we include simulated drought conditions to interrogate how the increasing frequency or magnitude of droughts might impact this system nguvava et al 2019 2 2 buffalo buffalo densities were estimated in each run using published densities from laikipia kenya with group sizes that were randomly drawn from a log normal distribution with a mean of 350 korte 2008 we assumed that buffalo would leave their current waterhole if it was unable to sustain the present group s water requirements i e the product of the individuals in the group and a daily drinking volume 3 42 liters additionally if dung concentrations exceeded a current tolerance threshold as currently modified by habituation then the buffalo moved to the nearest water sufficing waterhole without knowledge of the contamination in the subsequent waterhole as such our model assumes that buffalo can retain knowledge of water presence in the surrounding holes but not retain knowledge of current fecal mass at the water holes this is because assuming temporally stable hydrology and geology the location of waterholes are recurrent and predictable and can thus be retained in long term memory furthermore fecal avoidance however has not been posited as a cognitively processed cue rather a mechanistic deterrent whether buffalo engage in the cognitive calculations necessary to account for fecal mass decay and parasite presence is not necessarily known traveling buffalo were not present at any waterhole and therefore neither drank from nor defecated at a waterhole additionally we assumed that traveling buffalo were able meet their water needs or fast from water for simplicity upon arriving at a waterhole the buffalo would then resume drinking and defecating as usual upon the time step in which they arrive at the new waterhole travel distance achieved by each traveling group was randomly drawn in each time step from a distribution that matched published daily travel distances roug et al 2020 2 3 dung dung was deposited at a site under the assumption that each individual buffalo defecated 20 kg per day a conservative value given beef cattle produce 27 34 kg per day herbert et al 2020 we assumed that groups spend 10 min in the area within 5 m of the total circumference of a waterhole per daily visit dung was therefore calculated as the average mass deposited by the total number of buffalo in a group over 10 min then normalized by the area within 5 m of the total current circumference of a waterhole kg m2 we assumed dung would act as a deterrent up to 35 days because volatile chemicals extracted from dung deterred feeding even up to 35 days post excretion dung older than 35 days was no longer assumed to influence fecal avoidance dohi et al 1991 2 4 parasites we assumed as a constant throughout the model that 85 of buffalo were infected with nematodes ezenwa 2003 and used the total dung deposited around a waterhole to generate parasite egg abundances per m2 parasites were given a random hatch date using a random normal distribution of documented days until hatching mean 10 5 sd 1 2 removing values that exceeded the bounds of observed hatching durations of 7 14 days fiel et al 2012 hatched parasites died per time step as a constant proportion of individuals over a six week decay calculated using the last peak population size infectious larval stages can survive on the semi arid kenyan landscape from 3 to 15 weeks but waterholes provide a moisture reserve that facilitates the persistence of egg hatchings year round ng ang a et al 2004 2 5 analyses environmental parasite density was our primary variable of interest as a measure of self fouling as such we focused on the maximum environmental parasite density per run as an indication of highest incidence self fouling in a waterhole this is because dung was the mechanistic cue that buffalo used to avoid disease risk but the actual risk is environmental parasite density which is temporally asynchronous from fecal deposition due to egg hatching times to explore the waterhole node usage we extracted three measures maximum aggregate time at any node longest continuous residence at any node and total nodes visited per run measures of interest were extracted at the end of each time point such that there were 1095 data frames with output for each time step relevant to parasites water dung and buffalo dynamics 3 results the number of buffalo groups relative to waterholes was very low consequently contaminated nodes were not particularly influential on the mean environmental parasite density of each run this is evident in that mean parasite densities were generally similar across runs with distinct tolerance and habituation values but were slightly elevated with low tolerance and habituation values fig 2 appendix s1 3 given the lower sd of environmental parasite density across nodes in these runs appendix s1 4 we attribute this to more non zero values across waterhole nodes generally lower values of tolerance high fecal avoidance resulted in lower maximum parasite densities across nodes within each run fig 2 appendix s1 5 signifying reduced contamination of particular waterholes increasing the values of habituation resulted in similar maximum parasite densities across tolerance values negating the influence of low tolerance for low and low intermediate tolerance values tolerance 4 reduced maximum parasite density was associated with a dramatic increase in total time spent traveling fig 3 total travel for tolerance 4 was 263 79 mean 188 72 sd versus 73 05 mean 23 50 sd for tolerance 4 intermediate tolerance values 7 10 did not have higher total travel relative to higher values of tolerance 25 but attained similar maximum parasite density to runs with respectively lower tolerance runs with lower total water availability modified via catchment might be expected to travel more to find waterholes but suffer more from contaminated waterholes as the total surface area of waterholes would be reduced this effect was observable albeit not pronounced but only for runs with intermediate or higher tolerance tolerance 7 we then calculated a tolerance optimum that simultaneously reduced disease risk maximum parasite density a near sigmoidal function and travel risk total travel a near exponential decay by finding the lowest point for both variables to calculate this optimum we first partitioned the results by catchment then rescaled each variable of interest via min max normalization before plotting a smoothed line using geom smooth with a generalized additive method with k 9 for each normalized variable and tolerance fig 4 we extracted the smoothed fit as 10 000 data points and then calculated the tolerance value that resulted in the lowest combined value for the normalized variables of interest while this is a simplistic approach that can only approximate the true quantitative optimum we emphasize that it qualitatively illustrates the relative importance of the contributions of each of the considered factors towards an optimal trade off future implementations seeking true optima would benefit from for example a multi objective optimization using a genetic algorithm e g konak et al 2006 in systems with exact functional forms and parameters reflecting the specific epidemiological and climatological landscape across catchment values the mean tolerance optimum was 8 20 0 08sd we also recomputed this optimum with the assumption that prioritization biases might exist whereby parasites or travel might be assumed to be more costly as such we calculated the optimum with a weighting 2x on either variable tolerance for the lowest catchment 16x was slightly more sensitive to prioritization bias but comparable to the optimum tolerance thresholds in higher catchments fig 4 we explored whether gross patterns of waterhole usage would covary with tolerance consistent patterns between tolerance and metrics of node use were not readily discernable aggregate time at particular waterholes appendix s1 6a s1 7a continuous residence at a particular waterhole appendix s1 6b 1 7b patterns of distributed visitation across waterholes appendix s1 6c 1 7c intermediate values of tolerance 7 0 had higher aggregate and continuous residence at waterholes relative to low values of tolerance but not markedly lower than higher values of tolerance habituation had stronger effects on the disgust modifier when tolerance values were initially low 4 compared to when tolerance was high 4 fig 5 appendix s1 8 steeper initial slopes were observed at earlier time steps for lower habituation modifiers 1 coupled with lower tolerance values 4 we also examined whether habituation was more accelerated during drier periods through visualization of the incremental increase of the disgust modifier by the proportion of total water remaining in the system per time step buffalo groups underwent more intense habituation during periods of high water availability current availability 0 75 of total potential availability as opposed to low water availability fig 5 appendix s1 8 to further examine the influence of shifting water availability on the system dynamics we separated each realization into its constituent time steps grouped according to high and low water availability relative to the mean water availability for each realization when tolerance was low high water availability resulted in more travel than during periods of low water availability this difference was not present once tolerance approached intermediate values 7 0 when tolerance was high however the opposite pattern emerged such that travel increased during periods of low water availability relative to periods of high water availability fig 6 interestingly maximum parasite density did not markedly differ between periods of high and low water availability appendix s1 9 4 discussion we implemented a pseudo gravity network model to explore how disgust operates in a cost benefit framework reliant on environmental cues of potential disease risk i e dung we used a concrete case study to explore with our general model in order to consider a set of parameters that approximate a realistic system using real world geographic area buffalo density buffalo behavior parasite deposition and longevity and hydrological dynamics while fecal avoidance controlled via the tolerance parameter reduced environmental parasite density it also increased travel we found that there was an attainable maximal trade off which was more prone to prioritization biases in water poor realizations controlled via the catchment parameter habituation did erode tolerance as would be expected but this occurred more rapidly during water rich time steps within each realization low tolerance values had heightened travel during periods of relatively high water availability but as tolerance increased travel was instead heightened during periods of relatively low water availability together these findings emphasize the complexity of fecal avoidance whereby hyper sensitivity can result in an unintended burden promoting increased travel we ascribe this to fecal avoidance being the dominating driver for movement rather than waterholes when tolerance is low while high tolerance shifts the importance to finding abundant water sources irrespective of fouling habituation can be an important mechanism to fine tune fecal avoidance but such changes might occur prior to challenging environmental conditions when water availability is high and parasite dynamics are more likely to be driving the system thus individuals could be habituated to self fouling during drought conditions where self fouling might be more difficult to avoid in our model low tolerance of dung contamination did result in reduced maximum environmental parasite density within the system inversely high tolerance facilitated higher concentrations of parasite density intermediate values however performed similarly to low tolerance values reducing maximum parasite density to values of near equivalence when the simulated buffalo herds were given very low tolerance for contamination then at any given time more waterholes were seeded with parasites this dynamic was evidenced by higher mean parasite density across nodes in the low tolerance runs relative to higher tolerance runs higher tolerance runs however had a higher sd of parasite density relative to low tolerance runs this distinction likely reflects the more disparately distributed contamination in higher tolerance runs there were more nodes with either an absence of parasites or high maximum parasite densities thus in low tolerance runs more of the environment is contaminated overall but with lower local contamination while high tolerance runs had higher localized contamination this is challenging to contextualize without larger scale data on parasite abundance across seasons and drought periods titcomb et al 2021b reported heightened parasite densities near waterholes experiencing dry spells relative to nearby sites without water but this result could reflect either increase local contamination or increase mean contamination as all waterholes would have to be sampled in a region over time we found a point of maximal efficiency in the level of disgust that reduced both parasite density and time spent foraging for water we might assume that unnecessary increases in travel are intrinsically costly due to increased energy and water expenditure as well as uncertainty via lack of information of reliable water access local forage conditions or predator risk if this assumption is upheld then the benefits of high fecal avoidance might be greatly outweighed by the costs of increased traveling indeed these findings parallel waterhole usage in red fronted lemurs eulemur rufifrons that avoided natural waterholes contaminated with feces and delayed to return to contaminated holes but distance from sleep site was a more significant determining variable of waterhole usage amoroso et al 2019 thus future applications could include other critical factors that might intervene in animal movement there is substantial evidence for individual fecal avoidance in ungulates dohi et al 1991 fankhauser et al 2008 hutchings et al 1998 schütz et al 2021 smith et al 2009 verwer et al 2016 ezenwa 2004 if and how such information scales to inform major collective decisions is to our knowledge not yet understood additionally olfactory detection of fecal contamination is very sensitive in bovines dohi et al 1991 schütz et al 2019 willms et al 2002 but we also know that despite a tendency for fecal avoidance in systems with access to clean water schütz et al 2019 there exists the potential for habituation if high levels of contamination are present schütz et al 2021 we emphasize that in our system habituation eroded the effectiveness of disgust in reducing maximum environmental parasite density dishabituation only occurred via encounters with more contaminated nodes as such the aggregate modifier resulting from habituation continued to increase relatively unchecked over time paramount for future research would be isolating the mechanisms e g trigger cues temporospatial endurance temporal couplings as well as upper and lower thresholds of habituation in wild systems especially in environments facing rapid climatic change we would emphasize that we use habituation broadly to also include circumstances where individuals do not necessarily perceive fecal contamination as innocuous rather they do not physiologically respond to it cyr and romero 2009 alternatively habituation may erode perceptions of infection risk via environmental cues though in turn time decay or mitigating cues might erode habituation effects finally it could be argued that habitation might result in an irreversible desensitization though this seems unlikely given the potential fitness costs of high parasite load budischak et al 2012 ezenwa and jolles 2008 given the necessity of water it seems probable that disgust would have some temporal and spatial variability via habituation interestingly the action of habituation need not be temporally coupled with current water availability more pronounced habituation occurred during periods of higher seasonal water availability compared to low water availability in line with this high disgust resulted in higher travel during periods of high water availability versus low availability but this difference decreased as the sensitivity of disgust was reduced once disgust was minimal travel was higher during periods of low water availability this shift suggests that high levels of disgust drive movement dynamics but as disgust decreases water availability was more influential on movement dynamics we also found that in water poor systems i e low catchment values prioritization biases were more influential suggestive of a greater ecological challenge to balance travel and parasite risks in consistently water poor environments 4 1 future directions climatic shifts and increased variability in local conditions have been observed across east africa kogo et al 2021 ogutu et al 2016 siderius et al 2021 with projections suggesting increased drought conditions both in magnitude and abundance nguvava et al 2019 such drought conditions are concerning given recent evidence that parasite risks were increased around water sources in drier areas titcomb et al 2021b given shifting climatic conditions how might animals alter their behavior in response to dynamic shifts in local trade offs our model indicates that behavioral shifts i e habituation might precede periods of climatic drying even in dramatically different scenarios of total water availability controlled via catchment understanding these shifts becomes more critical given unpredictable and changing climatic conditions we acknowledge that we made several simplifying assumptions that could be explored to provide further insight on this or similar systems first we did not limit buffalo to home ranges nor include specific long distance movement though we modeled a total area 8696 1 km2 that encapsulates even the largest observed home ranges bennitt et al 2016 roug et al 2020 even so it is worth emphasizing that buffaloes would have local ranges that are not just linked to a need to suffice water requirements but also vary in travel distances to meet all biological requirements bennitt et al 2016 roug et al 2020 inclusion of a forage layer reproductive competition or compartmental models for infection could provide insight into other trade offs beyond those we have discussed here we chose to model fecal parasite deposition solely as a phenomena tied to waterholes but other areas of concentrated aggregation such as verdant glades could be included in a similar way and coupled with the rainfall dynamics explicit inclusion of infection dynamics however should also take into account differences in host immunity ezenwa and jolles 2011 parasite dynamics could also be linked to climatic conditions as water availability can influence survivability ng ang a et al 2004 finally we focused this initial presentation of our model on nematodes in part because they can infect other host species presenting an interesting natural next set of immediate questions considering implications for multi host transmission networks walker and morgan 2014 5 conclusions we present a general modeling approach that can be applied to investigate a variety of systems to better understand and apply landscape of disgust fear peril frameworks importantly this approach redresses a highlighted challenge with these frameworks that is the conflation of the landscape framework with habitat selection bleicher 2017 we present this model to encourage similar expansive approaches using a pseudo gravity network graph based model and to stimulate discussion modeling and experimental approaches which continue to develop the landscape of disgust our approach could be implemented with multiple layers to include multiple environmental cues or needs using abstract costs along edges which need not be representative of physical space or using agents representative of multiple species roaming concurrently we emphasize the need to examine how evolved strategies such as fecal avoidance may invoke added costs or fail to protect against parasitic counter strategies such as decoupled hatching and infectivity chubb et al 2020 furthermore given the complexity of such dynamics models such as presented here can be used to interrogate the actual trade offs that animals must make in a wild system while offering utility towards examining predictions of when evolved traits might be disadvantageous in the face of new disease threats or major climatic perturbations credit authorship contribution statement alexander j pritchard

24266,process based ecological models have been used to study freshwater ecosystems and water quality on a broad scale however it is also of pivotal importance to incorporate watershed dynamics and nutrient releases in the downstream freshwaters integrated modeling approaches have been used to understand the combined effect of climate warming and land use and land cover lulc changes in lake ecosystems moreover most basin scale water quality models require many datasets and parameters to perform reliable simulations which contributes to reduce studies in poorly monitored basins most of them located in the global south in this study we developed a coupled hydrological biogeochemical ecological modeling framework forced by two regionalized climate models and three lulc change scenarios to forecast trophic state changes in a subtropical multipurpose reservoir for the decade 2050 2060 the projections indicated an average air temperature increase between 2 c and 3 c and a downward trend of the average rainfall and longwave radiation for the 2050s in comparison to the last decade we found a pattern of 28 increase in total phosphorus tp and total chlorophyll a tchla concentrations in the reservoir compared with the historical baseline the climate warming projections along the 2059 projected lulc and basin s increased economic development scenarios have predicted trophic state index tsi shifts between mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions 53 3 tsi 57 7 on the other hand one of the climate projections along the reduced deforestation scenario indicated a trend towards oligotrophication between 2054 and 2056 however higher phosphorus availability 60µg l 1 tp 100µg l 1 and phytoplankton biomass 50µg l 1 tchla 97µg l 1 would be expected for the entire decade

quality control of some catchments fu et al 2021 the inference whether climate change or lulc changes are the most important drivers in water quality deterioration is not so straightforward in this regard integrated modeling approaches are important to advance our comprehension of how aquatic biogeochemical dynamics respond to meteorological conditions curtareli et al 2015 human pressures munar et al 2018 2019 liu et al 2015 and changing climate zhang et al 2019 integrating geography information system gis technologies also have been giving insightful qualitative answers for water resource management studies liu et al 2018 however less than 5 of the modeling studies have tested coupled models to represent climate catchment lakes processes and only 6 have been conducted in central south america soares and calijuri 2021 in the present study we aimed to develop a coupled modeling framework based on open source deterministic models and gis tools to predict trophic state changes in a subtropical reservoir for the 2050s we investigated how downscaled climate projections based on two regional climate models rcm along with three lulc change scenarios can facilitates our understanding of the combined effect of climate warming and landscape dynamics on the productivity of an aquatic ecosystem following this we draw conclusions on the performance and potentialities of the models and also the implications of trends in water level and water quality for reservoir operation to prevent eutrophication and not impair the drinking water supply the proposed integrated modeling approach facilitates our current comprehension of water quality management to incorporate climate change mitigation strategies to prevent the water crisis and control water quality and catchment zoning to protect threatened landscapes 2 methods 2 1 study site itupararanga reservoir is a large lake built in 1914 in the southeast of brazil in the alto sorocaba basin to support multiple uses mainly hydropower generation and drinking water supply for almost 1 million people the reservoir surface area is 29 9 km² and a water depth range of 14 5 23 m barbosa et al 2021 the climate is of the cwa

fetch is 3 1 km the original vegetation is the semi deciduous forest which is predominant in brazil s atlantic forest in the alto sorocaba basin there is a preservation area called apa of itupararanga which was created by são paulo state law n 10 100 1998 and altered by law n 11 579 2003 the apa of itupararanga has contributed to maintaining almost 41 of the forest formation in the basin land uses

the lack of land use zoning that disciplines the form of disorderly occupation manfredini 2018 another source of pollution in the itupararanga reservoir is sewage discharge due to poor treatment

company that operates the dam and previous studies table s1 a first study simulated the thermal dynamics and water level changes in itupararanga reservoir based on meteorological forcings inflow and outflow and water temperature time series barbosa et al 2021 those initial and boundary conditions were assumed to be exactly the same however the water quality time series of the tributaries and the reservoir were incorporated in the present study details on the water quality data processing and all the assumptions made are given below using data from previous studies cunha 2012 rôdas 2013 garcia 2013 it was possible to calculate that the dissolved oxygen do loads in the sorocaba river upstream of the reservoir were statistically coincident linear adjustment r2 0 85 n 20 with the sum of the flows and do loads of the sorocabuçu and sorocamirim rivers measured 3 km from the head of the sorocaba river although upstream sorocaba river receives effluents from the ete ibiúna this has not sufficiently caused water quality deterioration due to the low flow we used flow data along the sorocabuçu and sorocamirim streams adopting studies carried out by rôdas 2013 and garcia 2013 from july 2011 to april 2012 to support the flow calculation per km in the streams through the equations of two exponential functions adjustment r2 0 91 dry season and r2 0 88 wet season after calculating the correlation we calculate an approximation factor to determine the flow values at the same point of the water quality gauge stations in each stream we also filled in the gaps in the flow data through linear correlation between the available data and the affluent flow of the reservoir calculated by the water balance r2 0 82 daily flows measured in the streams were also made available between december 2013 and december 2017 by two fluviometric monitoring stations operated by the brazilian national water agency ana located in the sorocabuçu and sorocamirim streams 62472800 62473200 the available water quality time series was measured by the environmental company of the state of são paulo cetesb in the sorocabuçu sorocamirim and una streams every two months since 2005 sobu02800 somi02850 buna02900 the location of the sampling sites and the monitoring stations are given in fig 1 the three monitoring stations are located at the correspond sub basins outlets where the main loads are released to the reservoir we used 13 years of water quality data to estimate the long term monthly geometric mean of concentrations based on a recent approach suggested by isles 2020 we calculated a mass balance to determine the reservoir input concentrations c i n f l o w using eq 1 1 q u ç u x c u ç u q m i r i m x c m i r i m q i n f l o w x c i n f l o w where q u ç u sorocabuçu stream flow c u ç u sorocabuçu stream concentrations q m i r i m sorocamirim stream flow c m i r i m sorocamirim stream concentrations q i n f l o w reservoir input concentrations c i n f l o w reservoir input concentrations as the water quality time series by the cetesb did not have available data for particulate organic carbon poc organic nitrogen and all phosphorus and nitrogen pools we estimated the required input data from the available biogeochemical time series we applied specific ratios to individual phosphorus forms based on garcia 2013 and rôdas 2013 measurements of the sorocamirim and sorocabuçu streams organic nitrogen was calculated as the difference between the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and ammonium nh4 concentrations we considered that the organic nitrogen concentrations would be higher in the particulate organic nitrogen 70 than in the dissolved organic nitrogen 30 based on the stream s features the filterable reactive phosphorus frp adsorbed soluble reactive phosphate asrp dissolved organic phosphorus dop and particulate organic phosphorus pop were estimated as proportions of total phosphorus tp we also considered dop as the difference between the dissolved total phosphorus dtp and frp concentrations the input total chlorophyll a tchla concentrations followed the same mass balance equation using a conversion factor of 50mgc mgchl a 1 the median values of reservoir input concentrations are in error 2 3 climate projections we have chosen two global climate models gcms regionalized for south america by the eta model chou et al 2014 to compare the future climate projections and their impacts on the water quality of the itupararanga reservoir the first gcm used in the present study was the model for interdisciplinary research on climate version 5 miroc5 the miroc5 is a japanese coupled ocean atmosphere model of resolution of about 150 km in horizontal and 40 levels in vertical the other gcm chosen was the hadley centre global environmental model hadgem2 es a british gcm with 60 levels of vertical resolution both rcms have 20 km of resolution and cover south america central america and caribbean the eta hadgem2 es and the eta miroc5 have similar model components e g atmosphere aerosol land surface flato et al 2013 however the first one has already proved to be more sensitive to greenhouse gas ghg emissions than the eta nested in miroc5 chou et al 2014 the radiative forcing scenarios rcp chosen was 8 5 w m ² rcp 8 5 our choice was based on rcp 8 5 to be the best match out to mid century greenhouse gases emissions and stated environmental policies as reported by schwalm et al 2020 the time series of climate projections were bias corrected to adjust historical data and correct the future projections using 1 decade data as control period 2009 2018 details of the bias correction procedure are given in barbosa et al 2021 2 4 hydrological modeling the soil moisture accounting procedure smap was used to simulate the future inflow in the itupararanga reservoir the smap model is based on a simple structure of reservoirs to represent the basin storage and water flow and uses the soil conservation service scs 1964 method to predict runoff lopes and braga 1982 the model input data are the total precipitation and evaporation heights on a daily time step the drainage area and the initial conditions of the basin we used 1000 days june 23 2010 june 23 2013 for the calibration and 700 days june 29 2016 sept 07 2018 for the validation of the model the statistics metrics used to assess the model performance were the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 which measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observation and the pearson correlation coefficient r we stopped the calibration efforts when the model was able to achieve a range of pbias considered satisfactory 15 pbias 25 according to moriasi et al 2007 and we were able to identify good agreement between simulated and observed discharge by visual inspection after the calibration and validation of the smap model we have estimated future daily discharges from january 2050 to december 2059 using the eta hadgem2 es and eta miro c5 projections for air temperature and evaporation model outputs were used as input to the distributed load basin model and the lake ecosystem model 2 5 water temperature prediction using air2stream the air2stream is a model to predict stream water temperature as a function of daily air temperature and flow discharge time series toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 the model is based on a lumped heat budget that considers an unknown volume of the river reach its tributaries considering both surface and subsurface water fluxes and the heat exchange with the atmosphere toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 the model calibration consists of identifying the set of parameters that solve an optimization problem to reduce the error between simulated and observed water temperatures the calculation is a monte carlo based optimization procedure the particle swarm optimization pso was our chosen optimization algorithm which is implemented in the code with 500 iterations using the crank nicolson method to solve the model equation after manually testing each version of the model and quantifying the minimum value for the objective function based on rmse metric we have chosen the 5 parameter version as the best option for our calibration we have calibrated the air2stream model using the daily air temperature the reservoir daily inflow and the water temperature time series from 2009 to 2013 and we have validated from 2014 to 2019 the mean absolute error mae and r were calculated to assess the model performance to fit observation and simulation we have implemented the open source code in r environment to run the model and visualize outputs thus using the calibrated and validated model we made predictions of future water temperatures upstream of the itupararanga reservoir using air temperature projections from eta hadgem2 es and eta miroc5 climate models and also future flow discharges using the calibrated and validated smap model 2 6 prediction of tn and tp upstream loads we adopted the methodology developed by anjinho et al 2021 based on the export coefficient modelling approach johnes 1996 implemented in gis to quantify tn and tp loads and concentrations in the tributaries of the itupararanga reservoir this method combines nutrient export coefficients and a simple flow model to quantify tn and tp annual mean concentrations the focus of the basin distributed load simulation was to estimate the annual released load of tn and tp in the itupararanga reservoir considering the nutrients load generated by different types of land use and land cover the digital elevation model of the alto sorocaba basin was used in qgis 3 4 software to generate flow direction and surface runoff accumulated per pixel we adopted 13 5 m³ s 1 as the long term mean daily inflow in the reservoir barbosa et al 2021 to simulate the accumulated long term mean annual flow per pixel for each upstream we used the regionalization method based on a basin yield that assumes the existence of a proportional linear relationship between drainage area and streamflow to simulate distributed flow in the basin thus we divided the long term mean daily inflow by the total number of pixels in the basin m³ s 1 p i x e l 1 and the flow accumulation algorithm was used to determine the model of mean annual accumulated inflow the mean annual tn and tp loads were simulated based on the export coefficients established in the mathematical model of correlation between land use and water quality mqual v 1 5 sma 2010 that were developed for the guarapiranga basin located also in são paulo state and presenting a similar lulc to the alto sorocaba basin table s3 we used the lulc geotiff data published by the mapbiomas project mapbiomas 2020 to determine the specific areas of the basin km² covered by each lulc to calculate the nutrient export coefficient regarding each of them load values were converted from kg km 2 y 1 to kg pixel 1 y 1 and then the flow accumulation algorithm was used to generate the accumulated nutrient load model the average annual nutrient concentration upstream of the itupararanga reservoir was calculated by combining the results of the calculations above according to the following equation 2 c a l a q a 10 3 where ca average annual tn and tp concentration mg l 1 la accumulated tn and tp load kg y e a r 1 qa mean annual flow m³ y e a r 1 in order to assess the model performance we performed a double validation approach which consisted of using the long term historical time series of flows q tp and tn in the first step validation 1 for the three streams monitoring stations 12 years for the sorocamirim stream 8 years for the sorocabuçu stream and 13 years for the una stream and the second step validation 2 was to validate it considering eight monitoring stations in the sorocamirim and sorocabuçu streams from 2011 to 2012 garcia 2012 rôdas 2012 aiming to evaluate the model performance at the spatial scale thus we used the pearson r and spearman r2 correlation and the percent bias pbias metrics to evaluate the validation analysis 2 7 catchment transition potential modeling and land use changes scenarios for the 2050s we used lulc maps for 1999 and 2009 mapbiomas 2020 to calculate the transition matrix between 1999 and 2019 we performed a cellular automata simulation using artificial neural networks ann to predict the alto sorocaba basin lulc for 2019 using the module for land use scenarios plugin molusce in qgis 2 18 sherman et al 2016 the flow chart for the molusce methodology is shown in fig 2 the module can use ann multi criteria evaluation mce weights of evidence woe and logistic regression lr methods to model lulc transition potential the ann method is a learning algorithm which analyzes the accuracy on training and validation sets of samples based on neighbor pixels and three learning parameters the module analyzes the transitional potential to predict lulc patterns in the future using the cellular automaton model burnham 1973 the model integrates the spatial rules of cellular automaton with the transition of the markov chain ca markov to simulate maps based on two images from different dates the ca markov is a stochastic model that reproduces changes in lulc by transition and information matrix based on the current state the model performance was calculated to validate the simulated lulc compared to the observed lulc for 2019 mapbiomas 2020 thus the r and r2 coefficients and the kappa overall coefficient k were used to measure the agreement between the observed and predicted lulc the k statistics represent the total accuracy of the number pixel that was correctly classified between the reference map and the simulated map and the accuracy of the classification landis and koch 1977 mienmany 2018 when the model was able to generate the acceptable validation result we re ran the ca markov model considering the step size as 20 years with 2 iterations to perform a lulc projection for 2059 molusce scenario the molusce scenario was used as a first scenario for future modification actions in the basin other two scenarios were formulated based on the simulated lulc for 2059 considering the increase in preservation areas focusing on the restoration of permanent preservation areas and reducing agricultural uses green scenario and increased economic development of the basin focusing on agriculture pasture soy and urbanization ed scenario table 1 the three lulc scenarios were considered to evaluate likely future impacts on the upstream nutrient s concentrations in the itupararanga reservoir the inflow mean tp and tn concentrations were accounted for in each scenario and those concentrations were compared to the baseline period 2009 2011 and 2017 2019 thus we altered the n o 3 inflow and frp concentrations by the increased or decreased proportions based on the baseline values in the biogeochemical model thus this modeling approach was used to simulate future nutrients loads in the reservoir based on the three lulc future scenarios and the future daily discharges from the two climate models we have calculated the long term average discharge of the eta hadgem2 es and eta miroc5 projections for 2050s to use in the estimation of tp and tn loads in the same future period we have performed the estimation using each lulc area and its respective export coefficient divided for the two future long term average discharge to find the average annual nutrient concentrations upstream of the reservoir 2 8 lake ecosystem modeling the vertical one dimensional model glm aed2 which couples hydrodynamic biogeochemical and ecological processes in lakes was used to simulate tn tp and tchla in the itupararanga reservoir the tn and tp concentrations are based on the sum of nitrogen and phosphorus pools considering dissolved particulate organic and inorganic forms as well as internal nitrogen and phosphorus stores in phytoplankton community eq 3 and 4 the tchla concentrations are calculated as an indicator of phytoplankton abundance equation 5 using a carbon mass balance equation based on processes of uptake excretion mortality respiration and vertical movement in the water column equation 6 grazing was not taken into account in the model equations as we did not have available zooplankton data 3 t

firstly the water level and water temperature were previously calibrated as described in barbosa et al 2021 and then the parameters regarding the concentrations of tp tn and tchla we performed 3 months jan 2009 to march 2009 to spin up the model 936 days april 2009 to dec 2011 for the calibration and 784 days jan 2017 to feb 2019 for the validation a global sensitivity analysis based on the morris method morris 1991 was performed to identify the most sensitive parameters for the predictions of tp tn and tchla after that an automatic calibration was performed using the derivative free optimization algorithm cma es hansen 2016 with 100 iterations aiming to reduce the root mean square error rmse followed by a manual calibration to ensure that the model was not reproducing unreal biogeochemical parameter combinations this sensitivity analysis and calibration followed the same approach described in ladwig et al 2020 the model parameters were manually changed aiming to sequentially optimize goodness of fit gof metrics focusing on reproducing those concentrations of the dry and wet periods as the observed tp tn and tchla concentrations in the reservoir did not show a significant temporal fluctuation pattern during the calibration and validation periods we focused on representing mainly the long term median concentration as the purpose of this study was to simulate future scenarios and represent the likely alterations and quantify them based on a historical baseline scenario we did not focus on capturing peaks during the calibration process we calculated five gof metrics the mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the kling gupta efficiency kge r and rmse to compare model outputs regarding the tp and tn surface epilimnion and hypolimnion concentrations and measured data using the hydrogof package for r zambrano bigiarini 2017 we have calibrated and validated the tchla concentrations for the surface and epilimnion layers the target of the calibration was to represent the median values in order to simulate their future trends and be able to calculate the trophic state changes over the years when the ecosystem model was able to capture the median maximum and minimum concentrations of tp tn and tchla we performed simulation of future scenarios using the output of the hydrological model and the distributed basin load model and also took into account the future prediction of two climate projections and three lulc scenarios 2 9 coupled hydrological hydrodynamic ecological models we performed simulation of future scenarios using the output of the hydrological model and the distributed basin load model and also took into account the future prediction of two climate projections and three lulc scenarios we used a coupled modeling framework to assess a total combination of six scenarios fig 3 table 2 the previously presented calibrated and validated models were used to perform analysis of water quality and water level in the itupararanga reservoir based on future projections of climate data and lulc for 2050s we have used observed time series of water level and tp and tchla concentrations as baselines to compare likely changes based on the proposed scenarios to assess the future consequences on the water quality of itupararanga reservoir we have also calculated the trophic state index for tropical subtropical reservoirs ts i tsr proposed by cunha et al 2013 the ts i tsr takes in account the annual geometric mean concentrations of tp and tchla eqs 7 9 7 t s i t s

calibrated parameters are shown in table s4 in the supplementary material the hydrological model reasonably represented seasonality differences and captured flow peaks from the daily observed rainfall and evaporation data fig 4 the pbias metric was 19 and r 0 52 in the calibration period and pbias 4 and r 0 69 in the validation one the air2stream model was used to simulate the daily temperatures of the headwater of the itupararanga reservoir as shown in fig 5 simulated water temperatures were similar to observed water temperatures in the calibration mae 0 039 r 0 88 rmse 1 11 c and validation mae 0 011 r 0 95 rmse 0 89 c periods the distributed load modeling was able to represent the q and concentrations of tp and tn along the itupararanga headwaters compared with the reference values from moriasi et al 2007 highlighted in table 3 validation 1 represented the model performance at temporal scale considering the long term historical time series of q tp and tn and validation 2 considered mainly the spatial scale using the time series from rôdas 2012 and garcia 2012 although the tp simulations in validation 02 showed an unsatisfactory fit compared to the observed data these measurements only performed between 2011 and 2012 may not be representative of the long term average pattern of tp concentrations observed and validated in the first stage of the experiment validation 01 the validation results of the transition potential for the alto sorocaba basin in 2019 using 1999 and 2009 data according to each lulc are presented in table s5 in relation to the total area km² of the alto sorocaba basin overall the model had a satisfactory performance r 0 99 r2 0 99 k 0 73 to represent the lulc evolution in the basin fig s1 despite underestimating forest plantation urban soybean and other temporary crops areas the built scenarios related to the 2019 baseline are shown in figure 6 an automatic and manual calibration was performed to identify suitable values of the most sensitive parameters for the predictions of tp tn and tchla in the glm aed2 thirty seven parameters were identified through the sensitivity analysis they are related to oxygen and carbon mineralization dynamics nitrification and denitrification processes phosphate and dop fluxes and growth light respiration nitrogen and phosphorus of the phytoplankton a list of the sensitive parameters and a comparison between the calibrated values and the literature range values is shown in table s6 in the supplementary material the glm aed2 was able to simulate median and mean values of tp tn and tchla concentrations in the reservoir gof metrics in table s7 the simulated tp and tn concentrations were better represented in the epilimnion tp 5µg l 1 rmse 9µg l 1 tn 110 mg l 1 rmse 170mg l 1 compared to the hypolimnion tp rmse 9 µg l 1 tn rmse 250µg l 1 on the other hand the simulated median of the tchla concentrations was slightly overestimated as well as the simulated maximum and minimum concentrations fig 7 our calibration approach aimed to reproduce essential patterns instead of seemingly exact numerical values as suggested by jachner et al 2007 for ecological simulations 3 2 climate projections and water level trends the meteorological forcing data projected for 2050 2059 by two rcms have shown significant differences for longwave radiation air temperature and rainfall in comparison with the historical baseline period table 4 although both models taken in account the 8 5 w m ² radiative forcing scenario the eta miroc5 model has indicated to be less sensitive to ghg emissions compared with the eta hadgem2 es projections the british model predicts increase of 4 of shortwave radiation and 9 of wind speed and decrease of 2 6 of air relative humidity for the 2050s we have used the smap model with the calibrated parameters to predict future daily flows upstream from the itupararanga reservoir based on the two rcms projections mainly due to the downward trend in both rainfall projections in comparison to the long term annual flow 13 53 m³ s 1 the flows would decrease 18 11 06 m³ s 1 in the eta miroc5 projections and 57 5 86 m³ s 1 in the eta hadgem2 es climate projections fig s2 such a reduction in inflows and the air temperature increase would directly influence the water table in itupararanga reservoir leading to a water level decrease for the 2050s the median water level of the eta hadgem2 es and eta miroc5 projections are going to be 18m and 13 8m which means a reduction of 10 and 31 compared to the median water level observed between 2009 and 2018 20m 3 3 trophic state changes for the 2050s the trends in the tp and tchla concentrations for each simulated scenario are shown in fig s3 overall there is a pattern of increase in such concentrations in 28 compared with the baseline the trophic state index tsi was calculated for each year in the 2050s considering all the six simulated scenarios fig 8 table s8 as noted earlier the eta hadgem2 es climate projections tend to be more significant and have direct consequences on reservoir productivity the simulated tsi values showed shifts from mesotrophic to eutrophic state 53 6 tsi 57 7 and from oligotrophic to eutrophic state 52 4 tsi 57 7 respectively for eta hadgem2 es and eta miroc5 along lulc change scenarios the eta miroc5 projections along the green scenario which considers a reduction in deforestation predicted decrease of the tp and tchla median concentrations between 2054 and 2056 towards an oligotrophication trend 52 4 tsi 52 8 however higher phosphorus availability 60 µg l 1 tp 100 µg l 1 and phytoplankton biomass 50µg l 1 tchla 97 µg l 1 are expected for the 2050s in comparison to recent years on the other hand the main consequences of the eta hadgem2 es projections along economic development scenario were the trophic state increase in the reservoir 55 8 tsi 57 7 remaining eutrophic from 2050 to 2059 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of model s performance and reproducibility the simulated daily upstream flows were considered satisfactory for calibration and in very good agreement for validation according with moriasi et al 2007 likewise the predictions of stream water temperature by air2stream are in the range found in previous studies using the model 0 86 c rmse 1 52 c fenocchi et al 2017 toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 the simulated upstream tp and tn concentrations showed good fit criteria compared with the reference values from moriasi et al 2007 another recent study applied a catchment scale nutrient model with a similar modeling fit compared to this study messina et al 2020 the validations of tn and tp distributed modeling along the alto sorocaba basin based on the nutrient loads exported from the catchment johnes 1996 can highlight the potentialities of this gis approach to assess the lulc impacts on the streams and the itupararanga reservoir despite the good results generated by this modeling approach in the present and previous studies anjinho et al 2021 lima et al 2016 it represents the dynamics of nutrients in rural basins more effectively than in urban ones due to a poor performance in the simulation of nutrient concentrations from point source pollution since the alto sorocaba basin has less than 10 of the urban area in the total catchment area we did not consider point sources as sewage treatment plants in the basin for our simulations another limitation of this approach is considering only the conservative nutrient transport that does not take into account the temporal and spatial transformations of tn and tp concentrations in watercourses lima et al 2016 the results of the basin transition potential simulation have shown satisfactory performance based on r and r2 values 0 9 and very good agreement k 0 73 between the reference map and the simulated map according to landis and koch 1977 since the tn tp and chla concentrations of the itupararanga reservoir did not show any clear seasonal pattern the simulation efforts focused to represent the median values for the calibration and validation periods a similar approach was taken by ward et al 2020 the hydrodynamic ecological model was able to represent the median concentrations on the itupararanga reservoir the pbias values for the tp tn and tchla simulations were considered good and very good pbias 40 according to the classification given by darko et al 2019 and moriasi et al 2007 a recent study found a similar range and the same trend for the tp and tn simulations using the glm aed2 farrell et al 2020 4 2 trophic state changes for the 2050s under climate change and lulc scenarios we have analyzed lulc changes in the alto sorocaba basin comparing the last two decades 1999 and 2019 based on data from the mapbiomas project 2020 it can be observed that the pasture areas reduced 50 of their area in that period but the agricultural areas increased significantly focusing on sugarcane which grew three times and soybeans which grew five times its area in addition to forest plantation areas which grew four times their previous percentage of area the observed lulc changes were similar to the spatial pattern already highlighted for brazil in the past decades miccolis et al 2014 the potential lulc conditions in 2059 were projected based on catchment changes over 20 years highlighting the increase in agricultural areas and the decrease in pasture areas in line with the changing trends of lulc observed in previous decades this open source gis technique has been widely used to assess and predict lulc changes from small satya et al 2020 to large areas fernandes et al 2020 as expected the eta hadgem2 es projections has shown intensified climate trends compared to the eta miroc5 however both rcms predicted climate warming and rainfall decrease during the 2050s the eta hadgem2 es predicted fall of 43 of the average precipitation compared to the measurements gauged from 2009 to 2018 likewise sarmento et al 2013 have predicted rainfall decrease for the tropical south america based on the ipcc projections for this century those trends of rainfall decrease have also impacted the reservoir volume the downward trend of the water level in the itupararanga reservoir have also found in barbosa et al 2021 for the last years of this decade some studies have been highlighted the consequences of previous drought periods in the water quality of tropical and subtropical lakes and reservoirs brasil et al 2016 da costa et al 2016 tundisi et al 2015 the temporal fluctuation of nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass in tropical and subtropical lakes is mainly driven by hydrological patterns especially at the beginning of the wet season when more nutrients loads are released to the water bodies biotic and abiotic alterations in those ecosystems are stronger than in temperate regions lewis 1978 although a previous study has indicated that n is not a limiting factor for the phytoplankton development in itupararanga reservoir cunha et al 2017 we recognize that a more extensive dataset would be necessary to reveal further differences in the potential shifts in nutrient limitation total phosphorus has been well established as a predictor of phytoplankton in lakes especially in the itupararanga reservoir beghelli et al 2016 melo et al 2019 recently it has been reported that tp have nearly equal importance to that of climate in predicting water quality in lakes on a global scale shuvo et al 2021 itupararanga reservoir has already been reported as nutrients sink cunha 2012 and also it has shown to have high sedimentation rate which contribute to release in the outflow a higher quality of the water melo et al 2019 recent studies have compared the effects of climate change and lulc in watersheds and lake ecosystems bucak et al 2018 comte et al 2021 messina et al 2020 motew et al 2019 zipper et al 2018 pace et al 2021 climate have shown a stronger influence in surface water quality of yahara watershed usa than land use on three water quality indicators motew et al 2019 the authors have also highlighted that the land use effects were significant and local management plays a key role in future outcomes independent from the role of climate despite the previous identified lack of a relationship between tchla and tp concentrations beghelli et al 2016 itupararanga reservoir has been classified with mesotrophic conditions in the lacustrine zone cunha 20120 for the 2050s the simulated scenarios showed shifts from mesotrophic to eutrophic state and from oligotrophic to eutrophic state as expected there was an increase in the trophic state in the ed scenario along climate projections such high productivity is related to the increase in the impervious areas in the watershed and greater release of external loads in the reservoir compared to the current lulc previous studies have identified increase in the tsi values in dry periods in the itupararanga reservoir mainly due to the land use in the alto sorocaba basin cunha et al 2017 pedrazzi et al 2013 likewise itupararanga reservoir has been identified as having external nutrient loads more significant than internal turnover cunha 2012 cunha et al 2017 sarmento et al 2013 considering climate change consequences in large tropical lakes mainly driven by internal loads indicates oligotrophication rather than eutrophication as a result of the increased water column stability management strategies and catchment scale ecological restoration are needed to mitigate the climate change impacts in the water quality of itupararanga reservoir in a eutrophication scenario advanced water treatment may be necessary as suggested by beghelli et al 2016 however water resources management efforts must be done to control agricultural lands without environmental protection actions in the alto sorocaba basin and also change the reservoir operation to save water for drinking water supply and protection of the aquatic ecosystem investments in source control e g biogas digester fermentation bed rural population benefited by sewage treatment facilities have shown stronger impact on water quality in rivers of china than investments in restoring sinks e g ecological forest surface flow wetlands dredging of contaminated sediment fu et al 2021 4 3 framework based on coupled open source models the proposed modeling framework aimed at coupling simple process based models and gis techniques to assess impacts of the catchment lulc and climate change on the itupararanga reservoir this approach is suitable for poorly monitored basins which have a few available water quality data and can be used to analyze overall responses of water quality to changes in external nutrient loads and climate given a historical baseline the results of coupling hydrological models and aquatic ecosystems such as hydrodynamic models have highlighted their potential as management tools to understand and predict actions that cause future impacts on aquatic ecosystems munar et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2019 remote sensing techniques applied to limnology studies have also been expanded to simulate watershed features and likely lulc changes over the years curtarelli et al 2015 lins et al 2018 ma et al 2016 we highlighted the uncertainty in the model s processes and compared the prediction outputs with the historical tp tn and tchla measurements in the itupararanga reservoir to give insights to the water quality management our coupled modeling approach are not suitable for short term forecasting purposes due to the lulc changes scenarios take into account only historical trends beside dynamic land processes or human interventions it is also important to perform forecasts using several meteorological driver data quantifying the contribution of different sources of uncertainty in the model prediction is crucial for ecological forecasting several studies have proposed novel uncertainty quantification processes thomas et al 2020 khatami et al 2019 huang 2015 however less than 50 of recent papers have included uncertainty in their forecast outputs lewis et al 2022 5 conclusion the current study developed an integrated modeling approach forced by two regionalized climate models and lulc change scenarios to perform forecasting of trophic state in a subtropical reservoir for the 2050s and to compare the outputs with the historical observations we have chosen open source tools implemented in r and gis to foster the reproducibility of the modeling approach the contribution of uncertainties in the models processes was also taken into account in the modeling framework we also proceed to data processing and gap filling to reduce the uncertainty of driver data and initial conditions however we did not perform uncertainty quantification from different sources in each model our main goal was to simulate trophic state predictions and compare those results with historical observations to provide insights for water management the two rcms forced by the greenhouse gases representative concentration pathway of 8 5 w m ² showed rainfall and longwave radiation decrease and air temperature increase in the studied basin overall the outcomes of the climate model projections along the lulc change scenarios suggest water quality deterioration due to increase of tp and tchla concentrations and shifts of the reservoir trophic state from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic state due to climate and lulc changes trends we suggest installation of advanced water treatment plants and management efforts to control agricultural lands without environmental protection actions in the basin in the near future the proposed modeling framework can be a valuable tool to guide water resources management in poorly monitored basins considering climate warming and future pressures on freshwater due to population growth and intensive

24266,process based ecological models have been used to study freshwater ecosystems and water quality on a broad scale however it is also of pivotal importance to incorporate watershed dynamics and nutrient releases in the downstream freshwaters integrated modeling approaches have been used to understand the combined effect of climate warming and land use and land cover lulc changes in lake ecosystems moreover most basin scale water quality models require many datasets and parameters to perform reliable simulations which contributes to reduce studies in poorly monitored basins most of them located in the global south in this study we developed a coupled hydrological biogeochemical ecological modeling framework forced by two regionalized climate models and three lulc change scenarios to forecast trophic state changes in a subtropical multipurpose reservoir for the decade 2050 2060 the projections indicated an average air temperature increase between 2 c and 3 c and a downward trend of the average rainfall and longwave radiation for the 2050s in comparison to the last decade we found a pattern of 28 increase in total phosphorus tp and total chlorophyll a tchla concentrations in the reservoir compared with the historical baseline the climate warming projections along the 2059 projected lulc and basin s increased economic development scenarios have predicted trophic state index tsi shifts between mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions 53 3 tsi 57 7 on the other hand one of the climate projections along the reduced deforestation scenario indicated a trend towards oligotrophication between 2054 and 2056 however higher phosphorus availability 60µg l 1 tp 100µg l 1 and phytoplankton biomass 50µg l 1 tchla 97µg l 1 would be expected for the entire decade compared to recent years the proposed coupled modeling framework demonstrated the potential of open source tools in water quality management studies especially for poorly monitored basins based on climate change trends and human pressure graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords climate change land use and land cover changes glm aed2 water quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the deterioration of water quality in freshwater ecosystems worldwide has been driven by several factors mainly due to water level changes and inflow nutrient loadings gilboa et al 2014 it is important to identify and quantify the drivers and pressures related to water pollution teurlincx et al 2019 taken in account the main ongoing problems downing 2014 e g eutrophication liu et al 2021 agriculture impacts lopes et al 2020 overexploitation simonovic and arunkumar 2016 water withdrawal feldbauer et al 2020 and climate change o reilly et al 2015 woolway et al 2020 climate change impacts on lakes and reservoirs have been extensively studied in the last years ladwig et al 2018 magee and wu 2017 jeppesen et al 2017 sahoo et al 2016 the increase in water temperatures modification of stratification patterns and thermal regime are some of the consequences already observed paerl and huisman 2008 moe et al 2016 changes in rainfall and climate patterns have been generating immediate responses in the biogeochemical and ecological dynamics of watersheds and lakes adrian et al 2009 disruption of biogeochemical cycles may impact the loading of dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the lake and affect the magnitude variability and balance of in lake metabolic processes brighenti et al 2018 and increase eutrophication sinha et al 2017 thus it has also driven the development proliferation and maintenance of cyanobacteria blooms wells et al 2015 land use and land cover lulc changes have also driven eutrophication and have been investigated in order to improve water quality on the other hand even with the expected intensification of urbanization rate for the next decades restoration efforts have shown to have effectiveness in the water quality control of some catchments fu et al 2021 the inference whether climate change or lulc changes are the most important drivers in water quality deterioration is not so straightforward in this regard integrated modeling approaches are important to advance our comprehension of how aquatic biogeochemical dynamics respond to meteorological conditions curtareli et al 2015 human pressures munar et al 2018 2019 liu et al 2015 and changing climate zhang et al 2019 integrating geography information system gis technologies also have been giving insightful qualitative answers for water resource management studies liu et al 2018 however less than 5 of the modeling studies have tested coupled models to represent climate catchment lakes processes and only 6 have been conducted in central south america soares and calijuri 2021 in the present study we aimed to develop a coupled modeling framework based on open source deterministic models and gis tools to predict trophic state changes in a subtropical reservoir for the 2050s we investigated how downscaled climate projections based on two regional climate models rcm along with three lulc change scenarios can facilitates our understanding of the combined effect of climate warming and landscape dynamics on the productivity of an aquatic ecosystem following this we draw conclusions on the performance and potentialities of the models and also the implications of trends in water level and water quality for reservoir operation to prevent eutrophication and not impair the drinking water supply the proposed integrated modeling approach facilitates our current comprehension of water quality management to incorporate climate change mitigation strategies to prevent the water crisis and control water quality and catchment zoning to protect threatened landscapes 2 methods 2 1 study site itupararanga reservoir is a large lake built in 1914 in the southeast of brazil in the alto sorocaba basin to support multiple uses mainly hydropower generation and drinking water supply for almost 1 million people the reservoir surface area is 29 9 km² and a water depth range of 14 5 23 m barbosa et al 2021 the climate is of the cwa type characterized by winter precipitation of less than one tenth of the amount in mid summer and air temperatures above 22 c during the summer according to the köppen geiger classification the wind fetch is 3 1 km the original vegetation is the semi deciduous forest which is predominant in brazil s atlantic forest in the alto sorocaba basin there is a preservation area called apa of itupararanga which was created by são paulo state law n 10 100 1998 and altered by law n 11 579 2003 the apa of itupararanga has contributed to maintaining almost 41 of the forest formation in the basin land uses in 2019 according to lulc data made available by mapbiomas v5 0 mapbiomas 2020 on the other hand agriculture is in second place with 40 occupation in the basin pasture 12 and urban areas 3 followed them the main human activities that have compromised the reservoir s water quality are the construction of subdivisions such as farms and summer houses intensive use of irrigation and pesticides and the lack of land use zoning that disciplines the form of disorderly occupation manfredini 2018 another source of pollution in the itupararanga reservoir is sewage discharge due to poor treatment mainly in ibiúna a small city located near the reservoir headwater that releases half of the sewage effluents without any treatment fabh smt 2018 in the tributary streams 2 2 driver historical dataset and data processing the input data and the dataset required by calibration and validation of the coupled models were collected from several different sources including government agencies the private company that operates the dam and previous studies table s1 a first study simulated the thermal dynamics and water level changes in itupararanga reservoir based on meteorological forcings inflow and outflow and water temperature time series barbosa et al 2021 those initial and boundary conditions were assumed to be exactly the same however the water quality time series of the tributaries and the reservoir were incorporated in the present study details on the water quality data processing and all the assumptions made are given below using data from previous studies cunha 2012 rôdas 2013 garcia 2013 it was possible to calculate that the dissolved oxygen do loads in the sorocaba river upstream of the reservoir were statistically coincident linear adjustment r2 0 85 n 20 with the sum of the flows and do loads of the sorocabuçu and sorocamirim rivers measured 3 km from the head of the sorocaba river although upstream sorocaba river receives effluents from the ete ibiúna this has not sufficiently caused water quality deterioration due to the low flow we used flow data along the sorocabuçu and sorocamirim streams adopting studies carried out by rôdas 2013 and garcia 2013 from july 2011 to april 2012 to support the flow calculation per km in the streams through the equations of two exponential functions adjustment r2 0 91 dry season and r2 0 88 wet season after calculating the correlation we calculate an approximation factor to determine the flow values at the same point of the water quality gauge stations in each stream we also filled in the gaps in the flow data through linear correlation between the available data and the affluent flow of the reservoir calculated by the water balance r2 0 82 daily flows measured in the streams were also made available between december 2013 and december 2017 by two fluviometric monitoring stations operated by the brazilian national water agency ana located in the sorocabuçu and sorocamirim streams 62472800 62473200 the available water quality time series was measured by the environmental company of the state of são paulo cetesb in the sorocabuçu sorocamirim and una streams every two months since 2005 sobu02800 somi02850 buna02900 the location of the sampling sites and the monitoring stations are given in fig 1 the three monitoring stations are located at the correspond sub basins outlets where the main loads are released to the reservoir we used 13 years of water quality data to estimate the long term monthly geometric mean of concentrations based on a recent approach suggested by isles 2020 we calculated a mass balance to determine the reservoir input concentrations c i n f l o w using eq 1 1 q u ç u x c u ç u q m i r i m x c m i r i m q i n f l o w x c i n f l o w where q u ç u sorocabuçu stream flow c u ç u sorocabuçu stream concentrations q m i r i m sorocamirim stream flow c m i r i m sorocamirim stream concentrations q i n f l o w reservoir input concentrations c i n f l o w reservoir input concentrations as the water quality time series by the cetesb did not have available data for particulate organic carbon poc organic nitrogen and all phosphorus and nitrogen pools we estimated the required input data from the available biogeochemical time series we applied specific ratios to individual phosphorus forms based on garcia 2013 and rôdas 2013 measurements of the sorocamirim and sorocabuçu streams organic nitrogen was calculated as the difference between the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and ammonium nh4 concentrations we considered that the organic nitrogen concentrations would be higher in the particulate organic nitrogen 70 than in the dissolved organic nitrogen 30 based on the stream s features the filterable reactive phosphorus frp adsorbed soluble reactive phosphate asrp dissolved organic phosphorus dop and particulate organic phosphorus pop were estimated as proportions of total phosphorus tp we also considered dop as the difference between the dissolved total phosphorus dtp and frp concentrations the input total chlorophyll a tchla concentrations followed the same mass balance equation using a conversion factor of 50mgc mgchl a 1 the median values of reservoir input concentrations are in error 2 3 climate projections we have chosen two global climate models gcms regionalized for south america by the eta model chou et al 2014 to compare the future climate projections and their impacts on the water quality of the itupararanga reservoir the first gcm used in the present study was the model for interdisciplinary research on climate version 5 miroc5 the miroc5 is a japanese coupled ocean atmosphere model of resolution of about 150 km in horizontal and 40 levels in vertical the other gcm chosen was the hadley centre global environmental model hadgem2 es a british gcm with 60 levels of vertical resolution both rcms have 20 km of resolution and cover south america central america and caribbean the eta hadgem2 es and the eta miroc5 have similar model components e g atmosphere aerosol land surface flato et al 2013 however the first one has already proved to be more sensitive to greenhouse gas ghg emissions than the eta nested in miroc5 chou et al 2014 the radiative forcing scenarios rcp chosen was 8 5 w m ² rcp 8 5 our choice was based on rcp 8 5 to be the best match out to mid century greenhouse gases emissions and stated environmental policies as reported by schwalm et al 2020 the time series of climate projections were bias corrected to adjust historical data and correct the future projections using 1 decade data as control period 2009 2018 details of the bias correction procedure are given in barbosa et al 2021 2 4 hydrological modeling the soil moisture accounting procedure smap was used to simulate the future inflow in the itupararanga reservoir the smap model is based on a simple structure of reservoirs to represent the basin storage and water flow and uses the soil conservation service scs 1964 method to predict runoff lopes and braga 1982 the model input data are the total precipitation and evaporation heights on a daily time step the drainage area and the initial conditions of the basin we used 1000 days june 23 2010 june 23 2013 for the calibration and 700 days june 29 2016 sept 07 2018 for the validation of the model the statistics metrics used to assess the model performance were the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 which measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observation and the pearson correlation coefficient r we stopped the calibration efforts when the model was able to achieve a range of pbias considered satisfactory 15 pbias 25 according to moriasi et al 2007 and we were able to identify good agreement between simulated and observed discharge by visual inspection after the calibration and validation of the smap model we have estimated future daily discharges from january 2050 to december 2059 using the eta hadgem2 es and eta miro c5 projections for air temperature and evaporation model outputs were used as input to the distributed load basin model and the lake ecosystem model 2 5 water temperature prediction using air2stream the air2stream is a model to predict stream water temperature as a function of daily air temperature and flow discharge time series toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 the model is based on a lumped heat budget that considers an unknown volume of the river reach its tributaries considering both surface and subsurface water fluxes and the heat exchange with the atmosphere toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 the model calibration consists of identifying the set of parameters that solve an optimization problem to reduce the error between simulated and observed water temperatures the calculation is a monte carlo based optimization procedure the particle swarm optimization pso was our chosen optimization algorithm which is implemented in the code with 500 iterations using the crank nicolson method to solve the model equation after manually testing each version of the model and quantifying the minimum value for the objective function based on rmse metric we have chosen the 5 parameter version as the best option for our calibration we have calibrated the air2stream model using the daily air temperature the reservoir daily inflow and the water temperature time series from 2009 to 2013 and we have validated from 2014 to 2019 the mean absolute error mae and r were calculated to assess the model performance to fit observation and simulation we have implemented the open source code in r environment to run the model and visualize outputs thus using the calibrated and validated model we made predictions of future water temperatures upstream of the itupararanga reservoir using air temperature projections from eta hadgem2 es and eta miroc5 climate models and also future flow discharges using the calibrated and validated smap model 2 6 prediction of tn and tp upstream loads we adopted the methodology developed by anjinho et al 2021 based on the export coefficient modelling approach johnes 1996 implemented in gis to quantify tn and tp loads and concentrations in the tributaries of the itupararanga reservoir this method combines nutrient export coefficients and a simple flow model to quantify tn and tp annual mean concentrations the focus of the basin distributed load simulation was to estimate the annual released load of tn and tp in the itupararanga reservoir considering the nutrients load generated by different types of land use and land cover the digital elevation model of the alto sorocaba basin was used in qgis 3 4 software to generate flow direction and surface runoff accumulated per pixel we adopted 13 5 m³ s 1 as the long term mean daily inflow in the reservoir barbosa et al 2021 to simulate the accumulated long term mean annual flow per pixel for each upstream we used the regionalization method based on a basin yield that assumes the existence of a proportional linear relationship between drainage area and streamflow to simulate distributed flow in the basin thus we divided the long term mean daily inflow by the total number of pixels in the basin m³ s 1 p i x e l 1 and the flow accumulation algorithm was used to determine the model of mean annual accumulated inflow the mean annual tn and tp loads were simulated based on the export coefficients established in the mathematical model of correlation between land use and water quality mqual v 1 5 sma 2010 that were developed for the guarapiranga basin located also in são paulo state and presenting a similar lulc to the alto sorocaba basin table s3 we used the lulc geotiff data published by the mapbiomas project mapbiomas 2020 to determine the specific areas of the basin km² covered by each lulc to calculate the nutrient export coefficient regarding each of them load values were converted from kg km 2 y 1 to kg pixel 1 y 1 and then the flow accumulation algorithm was used to generate the accumulated nutrient load model the average annual nutrient concentration upstream of the itupararanga reservoir was calculated by combining the results of the calculations above according to the following equation 2 c a l a q a 10 3 where ca average annual tn and tp concentration mg l 1 la accumulated tn and tp load kg y e a r 1 qa mean annual flow m³ y e a r 1 in order to assess the model performance we performed a double validation approach which consisted of using the long term historical time series of flows q tp and tn in the first step validation 1 for the three streams monitoring stations 12 years for the sorocamirim stream 8 years for the sorocabuçu stream and 13 years for the una stream and the second step validation 2 was to validate it considering eight monitoring stations in the sorocamirim and sorocabuçu streams from 2011 to 2012 garcia 2012 rôdas 2012 aiming to evaluate the model performance at the spatial scale thus we used the pearson r and spearman r2 correlation and the percent bias pbias metrics to evaluate the validation analysis 2 7 catchment transition potential modeling and land use changes scenarios for the 2050s we used lulc maps for 1999 and 2009 mapbiomas 2020 to calculate the transition matrix between 1999 and 2019 we performed a cellular automata simulation using artificial neural networks ann to predict the alto sorocaba basin lulc for 2019 using the module for land use scenarios plugin molusce in qgis 2 18 sherman et al 2016 the flow chart for the molusce methodology is shown in fig 2 the module can use ann multi criteria evaluation mce weights of evidence woe and logistic regression lr methods to model lulc transition potential the ann method is a learning algorithm which analyzes the accuracy on training and validation sets of samples based on neighbor pixels and three learning parameters the module analyzes the transitional potential to predict lulc patterns in the future using the cellular automaton model burnham 1973 the model integrates the spatial rules of cellular automaton with the transition of the markov chain ca markov to simulate maps based on two images from different dates the ca markov is a stochastic model that reproduces changes in lulc by transition and information matrix based on the current state the model performance was calculated to validate the simulated lulc compared to the observed lulc for 2019 mapbiomas 2020 thus the r and r2 coefficients and the kappa overall coefficient k were used to measure the agreement between the observed and predicted lulc the k statistics represent the total accuracy of the number pixel that was correctly classified between the reference map and the simulated map and the accuracy of the classification landis and koch 1977 mienmany 2018 when the model was able to generate the acceptable validation result we re ran the ca markov model considering the step size as 20 years with 2 iterations to perform a lulc projection for 2059 molusce scenario the molusce scenario was used as a first scenario for future modification actions in the basin other two scenarios were formulated based on the simulated lulc for 2059 considering the increase in preservation areas focusing on the restoration of permanent preservation areas and reducing agricultural uses green scenario and increased economic development of the basin focusing on agriculture pasture soy and urbanization ed scenario table 1 the three lulc scenarios were considered to evaluate likely future impacts on the upstream nutrient s concentrations in the itupararanga reservoir the inflow mean tp and tn concentrations were accounted for in each scenario and those concentrations were compared to the baseline period 2009 2011 and 2017 2019 thus we altered the n o 3 inflow and frp concentrations by the increased or decreased proportions based on the baseline values in the biogeochemical model thus this modeling approach was used to simulate future nutrients loads in the reservoir based on the three lulc future scenarios and the future daily discharges from the two climate models we have calculated the long term average discharge of the eta hadgem2 es and eta miroc5 projections for 2050s to use in the estimation of tp and tn loads in the same future period we have performed the estimation using each lulc area and its respective export coefficient divided for the two future long term average discharge to find the average annual nutrient concentrations upstream of the reservoir 2 8 lake ecosystem modeling the vertical one dimensional model glm aed2 which couples hydrodynamic biogeochemical and ecological processes in lakes was used to simulate tn tp and tchla in the itupararanga reservoir the tn and tp concentrations are based on the sum of nitrogen and phosphorus pools considering dissolved particulate organic and inorganic forms as well as internal nitrogen and phosphorus stores in phytoplankton community eq 3 and 4 the tchla concentrations are calculated as an indicator of phytoplankton abundance equation 5 using a carbon mass balance equation based on processes of uptake excretion mortality respiration and vertical movement in the water column equation 6 grazing was not taken into account in the model equations as we did not have available zooplankton data 3 t

firstly the water level and water temperature were previously calibrated as described in barbosa et al 2021 and then the parameters regarding the concentrations of tp tn and tchla we performed 3 months jan 2009 to march 2009 to spin up the model 936 days april 2009 to dec 2011 for the calibration and 784 days jan 2017 to feb 2019 for the validation a global sensitivity analysis based on the morris method morris 1991 was performed to identify the most sensitive parameters for the predictions of tp tn and tchla after that an automatic calibration was performed using the derivative free optimization algorithm cma es hansen 2016 with 100 iterations aiming to reduce the root mean square error rmse followed by a manual calibration to ensure that the model was not reproducing unreal biogeochemical parameter combinations this sensitivity analysis and calibration followed the same approach described in ladwig et al 2020 the model parameters were manually changed aiming to sequentially optimize goodness of fit gof metrics focusing on reproducing those concentrations of the dry and wet periods as the observed tp tn and tchla concentrations in the reservoir did not show a significant temporal fluctuation pattern during the calibration and validation periods we focused on representing mainly the long term median concentration as the purpose of this study was to simulate future scenarios and represent the likely alterations and quantify them based on a historical baseline scenario we did not focus on capturing peaks during the calibration process we calculated five gof metrics the mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the kling gupta efficiency kge r and rmse to compare model outputs regarding the tp and tn surface epilimnion and hypolimnion concentrations and measured data using the hydrogof package for r zambrano bigiarini 2017 we have calibrated and validated the tchla concentrations for the surface and epilimnion layers the target of the calibration was to represent the median values in order to simulate their future trends and be able to calculate the trophic state changes over the years when the ecosystem model was able to capture the median maximum and minimum concentrations of tp tn and tchla we performed simulation of future scenarios using the output of the hydrological model and the distributed basin load model and also took into account the future prediction of two climate projections and three lulc scenarios 2 9 coupled hydrological hydrodynamic ecological models we performed simulation of future scenarios using the output of the hydrological model and the distributed basin load model and also took into account the future prediction of two climate projections and three lulc scenarios we used a coupled modeling framework to assess a total combination of six scenarios fig 3 table 2 the previously presented calibrated and validated models were used to perform analysis of water quality and water level in the itupararanga reservoir based on future projections of climate data and lulc for 2050s we have used observed time series of water level and tp and tchla concentrations as baselines to compare likely changes based on the proposed scenarios to assess the future consequences on the water quality of itupararanga reservoir we have also calculated the trophic state index for tropical subtropical reservoirs ts i tsr proposed by cunha et al 2013 the ts i tsr takes in account the annual geometric mean concentrations of tp and tchla eqs 7 9 7 t s i t s

calibrated parameters are shown in table s4 in the supplementary material the hydrological model reasonably represented seasonality differences and captured flow peaks from the daily observed rainfall and evaporation data fig 4 the pbias metric was 19 and r 0 52 in the calibration period and pbias 4 and r 0 69 in the validation one the air2stream model was used to simulate the daily temperatures of the headwater of the itupararanga reservoir as shown in fig 5 simulated water temperatures were similar to observed water temperatures in the calibration mae 0 039 r 0 88 rmse 1 11 c and validation mae 0 011 r 0 95 rmse 0 89 c periods the distributed load modeling was able to represent the q and concentrations of tp and tn along the itupararanga headwaters compared with the reference values from moriasi et al 2007 highlighted in table 3 validation 1 represented the model performance at temporal scale considering the long term historical time series of q tp and tn and validation 2 considered mainly the spatial scale using the time series from rôdas 2012 and garcia 2012 although the tp simulations in validation 02 showed an unsatisfactory fit compared to the observed data these measurements only performed between 2011 and 2012 may not be representative of the long term average pattern of tp concentrations observed and validated in the first stage of the experiment validation 01 the validation results of the transition potential for the alto sorocaba basin in 2019 using 1999 and 2009 data according to each lulc are presented in table s5 in relation to the total area km² of the alto sorocaba basin overall the model had a satisfactory performance r 0 99 r2 0 99 k 0 73 to represent the lulc evolution in the basin fig s1 despite underestimating forest plantation urban soybean and other temporary crops areas the built scenarios related to the 2019 baseline are shown in figure 6 an automatic and manual calibration was performed to identify suitable values of the most sensitive parameters for the predictions of tp tn and tchla in the glm aed2 thirty seven parameters were identified through the sensitivity analysis they are related to oxygen and carbon mineralization dynamics nitrification and denitrification processes phosphate and dop fluxes and growth light respiration nitrogen and phosphorus of the phytoplankton a list of the sensitive parameters and a comparison between the calibrated values and the literature range values is shown in table s6 in the supplementary material the glm aed2 was able to simulate median and mean values of

and minimum concentrations fig 7 our calibration approach aimed to reproduce essential patterns instead of seemingly exact numerical values as suggested by jachner et al 2007 for ecological simulations 3 2 climate projections and water level trends the meteorological forcing data projected for 2050 2059 by two rcms have shown significant differences for longwave radiation air temperature and rainfall in comparison with the historical baseline period table 4 although both models taken in account the 8 5 w m ² radiative forcing scenario the eta miroc5 model has indicated to be less sensitive to ghg emissions compared with the eta hadgem2 es projections the british model predicts increase of 4 of shortwave radiation and 9 of wind speed and decrease of 2 6 of air relative humidity for the 2050s we have used the smap model with the calibrated parameters to predict future daily flows upstream from the itupararanga reservoir based on the two rcms projections mainly due to the downward trend in both rainfall projections in comparison to the long term annual flow 13 53 m³ s 1 the flows would decrease 18 11 06 m³ s 1 in the eta miroc5 projections and 57 5 86 m³ s 1 in the eta hadgem2 es climate projections fig s2 such a reduction in inflows and the air temperature increase would directly influence the water table in itupararanga reservoir leading to a water level decrease for the 2050s the median water level of the eta hadgem2 es and eta miroc5 projections are going to be 18m and 13 8m which means a reduction of 10 and 31 compared to the median water level observed between 2009 and 2018 20m 3 3 trophic state changes for the 2050s the trends in the tp and tchla concentrations for each simulated scenario are shown in fig s3 overall there is a pattern of increase in such concentrations in 28 compared with the baseline the trophic state index tsi was calculated for each year in the 2050s considering all the six simulated scenarios fig 8 table s8 as noted earlier the eta hadgem2 es climate projections tend to be more significant and have direct consequences on reservoir productivity the simulated tsi values showed shifts from mesotrophic to eutrophic state 53 6 tsi 57 7 and from oligotrophic to eutrophic state 52 4 tsi 57 7 respectively for eta hadgem2 es and eta miroc5 along lulc change scenarios the eta miroc5 projections along the green scenario which considers a reduction in deforestation predicted decrease of the tp and tchla median concentrations between 2054 and 2056 towards an oligotrophication trend 52 4 tsi 52 8 however higher phosphorus availability 60 µg l 1 tp 100 µg l 1 and phytoplankton biomass 50µg l 1 tchla 97 µg l 1 are expected for the 2050s in comparison to recent years on the other hand the main consequences of the eta hadgem2 es projections along economic development scenario were the trophic state increase in the reservoir 55 8 tsi 57 7 remaining eutrophic from 2050 to 2059 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of model s performance and reproducibility the simulated daily upstream flows were considered satisfactory for calibration and in very good agreement for validation according with moriasi et al 2007 likewise the predictions of stream water temperature by air2stream are in the range found in previous studies using the model 0 86 c rmse 1 52 c fenocchi et al 2017 toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 the simulated upstream tp and tn concentrations showed good fit criteria compared with the reference values from moriasi et al 2007 another recent study applied a catchment scale nutrient model with a similar modeling fit compared to this study messina et al 2020 the validations of tn and tp distributed modeling along the alto sorocaba basin based on the nutrient loads exported from the catchment johnes 1996 can highlight the potentialities of this gis approach to assess the lulc impacts on the streams and the itupararanga reservoir despite the good results generated by this modeling approach in the present and previous studies anjinho et al 2021 lima et al 2016 it represents the dynamics of nutrients in rural basins more effectively than in urban ones due to a poor performance in the simulation of nutrient concentrations from point source pollution since the alto sorocaba basin has less than 10 of the urban area in the total catchment area we did not consider point sources as sewage treatment plants in the basin for our simulations another limitation of this approach is considering only the conservative nutrient transport that does not take into account the temporal and spatial transformations of tn and tp concentrations in watercourses lima et al 2016 the results of the basin transition potential simulation have shown satisfactory performance based on r and r2 values 0 9 and very good agreement k 0 73 between the reference map and the simulated map according to landis and koch 1977 since the tn tp and chla concentrations of the itupararanga reservoir did not show any clear seasonal pattern the simulation efforts focused to represent the median values for the calibration and validation periods a similar approach was taken by ward et al 2020 the hydrodynamic ecological model was able to represent the median concentrations on the itupararanga reservoir the pbias values for the tp tn and tchla simulations were considered good and very good pbias 40 according to the classification given by darko et al 2019 and moriasi et al 2007 a recent study found a similar range and the same trend for the tp and tn simulations using the glm aed2 farrell et al 2020 4 2 trophic state changes for the 2050s under climate change and lulc scenarios we have analyzed lulc changes in the alto sorocaba basin comparing the last two decades 1999 and 2019 based on data from the mapbiomas project 2020 it can be observed that the pasture areas reduced 50 of their area in that period but the agricultural areas increased significantly focusing on sugarcane which grew three times and soybeans which grew five times its area in addition to forest plantation areas which grew four times their previous percentage of area the observed lulc changes were similar to the spatial pattern already highlighted for brazil in the past decades miccolis et al 2014 the potential lulc conditions in 2059 were projected based on catchment changes over 20 years highlighting the increase in agricultural areas and the decrease in pasture areas in line with the changing trends of lulc observed in previous decades this open source gis technique has been widely used to assess and predict lulc changes from small satya et al 2020 to large areas fernandes et al 2020 as expected the eta hadgem2 es projections has shown intensified climate trends compared to the eta miroc5 however both rcms predicted climate warming and rainfall decrease during the 2050s the eta hadgem2 es predicted fall of 43 of the average precipitation compared to the measurements gauged from 2009 to 2018 likewise sarmento et al 2013 have predicted rainfall decrease for the tropical south america based on the ipcc projections for this century those trends of rainfall decrease have also impacted the reservoir volume the downward trend of the water level in the itupararanga reservoir have also found in barbosa et al 2021 for the last years of this decade some studies have been highlighted the consequences of previous drought periods in the water quality of tropical and subtropical lakes and reservoirs brasil et al 2016 da costa et al 2016 tundisi et al 2015 the temporal fluctuation of nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass in tropical and subtropical lakes is mainly driven by hydrological patterns especially at the beginning of the wet season when more nutrients loads are released to the water bodies biotic and abiotic alterations in those ecosystems are stronger than in temperate regions lewis 1978 although a previous study has indicated that n is not a limiting factor for the phytoplankton development in itupararanga reservoir cunha et al 2017 we recognize that a more extensive dataset would be necessary to reveal further differences in the potential shifts in nutrient limitation total phosphorus has been well established as a predictor of phytoplankton in lakes especially in the itupararanga reservoir beghelli et al 2016 melo et al 2019 recently it has been reported that tp have nearly equal importance to that of climate in predicting water quality in lakes on a global scale shuvo et al 2021 itupararanga reservoir has already been reported as nutrients sink cunha 2012 and also it has shown to have high sedimentation rate which contribute to release in the outflow a higher quality of the water melo et al 2019 recent studies have compared the effects of climate change and lulc in watersheds and lake ecosystems bucak et al 2018 comte et al 2021 messina et al 2020 motew et al 2019 zipper et al 2018 pace et al 2021 climate have shown a stronger influence in surface water quality of yahara watershed usa than land use on three water quality indicators motew et al 2019 the authors have also highlighted that the land use effects were significant and local management plays a key role in future outcomes independent from the role of climate despite the previous identified lack of a relationship between tchla and tp concentrations beghelli et al 2016 itupararanga reservoir has been classified with mesotrophic conditions in the lacustrine zone cunha 20120 for the 2050s the simulated scenarios showed shifts from mesotrophic to eutrophic state and from oligotrophic to eutrophic state as expected there was an increase in the trophic state in the ed scenario along climate projections such high productivity is related to the increase in the impervious areas in the watershed and greater release of external loads in the reservoir compared to the current lulc previous studies have identified increase in the tsi values in dry periods in the itupararanga reservoir mainly due to the land use in the alto sorocaba basin cunha et al 2017 pedrazzi et al 2013 likewise itupararanga reservoir has been identified as having external nutrient loads more significant than internal turnover cunha 2012 cunha et al 2017 sarmento et al 2013 considering climate change consequences in large tropical lakes mainly driven by internal loads indicates oligotrophication rather than eutrophication as a result of the increased water column stability management strategies and catchment scale ecological restoration are needed to mitigate the climate change impacts in the water quality of itupararanga reservoir in a eutrophication scenario advanced water treatment may be necessary as suggested by beghelli et al 2016 however water resources management efforts must be done to control agricultural lands without environmental protection actions in the alto sorocaba basin and also change the reservoir operation to save water for drinking water supply and protection of the aquatic ecosystem investments in source control e g biogas digester fermentation bed rural population benefited by sewage treatment facilities have shown stronger impact on water quality in rivers of china than investments in restoring sinks e g ecological forest surface flow wetlands dredging of contaminated sediment fu et al 2021 4 3 framework based on coupled open source models the proposed modeling framework aimed at coupling simple process based models and gis techniques to assess impacts of the catchment lulc and climate change on the itupararanga reservoir this approach is suitable for poorly monitored basins which have a few available water quality data and can be used to analyze overall responses of water quality to changes in external nutrient loads and climate given a historical baseline the results of coupling hydrological models and aquatic ecosystems such as hydrodynamic models have highlighted their potential as management tools to understand and predict actions that cause future impacts on aquatic ecosystems munar et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2019 remote sensing techniques applied to limnology studies have also been expanded to simulate watershed features and likely lulc changes over the years curtarelli et al 2015 lins et al 2018 ma et al 2016 we highlighted the uncertainty in the model s processes and compared the prediction outputs with the historical tp tn and tchla measurements in the itupararanga reservoir to give insights to the water quality management our coupled modeling approach are not suitable for short term forecasting purposes due to the lulc changes scenarios take into account only historical trends beside dynamic land processes or human interventions it is also important to perform forecasts using several meteorological driver data quantifying the contribution of different sources of uncertainty in the model prediction is crucial for ecological forecasting several studies have proposed novel uncertainty quantification processes thomas et al 2020 khatami et al 2019 huang 2015 however less than 50 of recent papers have included uncertainty in their forecast outputs lewis et al 2022 5 conclusion the current study developed an integrated modeling approach forced by two regionalized climate models and lulc change scenarios to perform forecasting of trophic state in a subtropical reservoir for the 2050s and to compare the outputs with the historical observations we have chosen open source tools implemented in r and gis to foster the reproducibility of the modeling approach the contribution of uncertainties in the models processes was also taken into account in the modeling framework we also proceed to data processing and gap filling to reduce the uncertainty of driver data and initial conditions however we did not perform uncertainty quantification from different sources in each model our main goal was to simulate trophic state predictions and compare those results with historical observations to provide insights for water management the two rcms forced by the greenhouse gases representative concentration pathway of 8 5 w m ² showed rainfall and longwave radiation decrease and air temperature increase in the studied basin overall the outcomes of the climate model projections along the lulc change scenarios suggest water quality deterioration due to increase of tp and tchla concentrations and shifts of the reservoir trophic state from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic state due to climate and lulc changes trends we suggest installation of advanced water treatment plants and management efforts to control agricultural lands without environmental protection actions in the basin in the near future the proposed modeling framework can be a valuable tool to guide water resources management in poorly monitored basins considering climate warming and future pressures on freshwater due to population growth and intensive

24267,harvesting has been implicated in destabilizing the abundances of exploited populations because selective harvesting often targets large individuals some studies have proposed that exploited populations often experience demographic shifts toward younger smaller individuals and become more sensitive to environmental fluctuations the theory of consumer resource dynamics has been applied to address the impacts of harvesting in simple modular food webs but harvested populations are embedded in a complex food web in nature in addition exploited populations have been shown to undergo trait evolution or phenotypic changes toward early maturation at smaller sizes using an empirically derived complex food web model kuparinen et al 2016 fishing induced life history changes degrade and destabilize harvested ecosystems scientific reports 6 22 245 demonstrated that exploited fish populations and other ecosystem properties increased variability due to harvesting and harvesting induced life history evolution in the absence of environmental fluctuations in the present study we examined a large set of simulated complex food webs to attest the generality of the findings in kuparinen et al 2016 we found that harvesting both increased and decreased temporal variability of fish biomass dynamics especially in food webs with intrinsically oscillating dynamics while the vast majority of the food webs did not experience destabilization we also elucidated the large impacts of the shape of functional responses on food web structure energy flow and changes in temporal variability caused by harvesting our results suggest that the destabilizing or stabilizing effects of harvesting and harvesting induced evolution importantly depend on the shape of functional responses in dynamical models of complex food webs and that food webs with intrinsically oscillating dynamics are more prone to changes in temporal variability caused by harvesting and harvesting induced evolution keywords

z612jm6bk 1 introduction size selective harvesting which preferentially removes individuals of certain sizes has been implicated to result in phenotypic and potentially evolutionary changes in life history traits related to survival and reproduction in exploited populations ernande et al 2004 heino et al 2015 kuparinen and festa bianchet 2016 it imposes high mortality and strong selection pressure typically on older and larger individuals and thus can truncate size structure barnett et al 2017 hsieh et al 2006 the theory of life history evolution predicts greater investment in reproduction and early maturation to evolve in populations undergoing high mortality in adults or equally across all life stages resulting in smaller body size at maturity charlesworth 1994 law 1979 reznick and ghalambor 2005 as a consequence populations experiencing high mortality in adults may consist more of younger and smaller individuals with higher reproductive capacities reznick et al 1990 stearns 2000 and metabolic rate auer et al 2018 the possibilities of fisheries induced evolution fie have been demonstrated by laboratory experiments of size selective harvesting conover and munch 2002 therkildsen et al 2019 uusi heikkilä et al 2017 and indicated by a diverse array of species in the wild allendorf and hard 2009 darimont et al 2009 heino et al 2015 jorgensen et al 2007 kuparinen and festa bianchet 2016 over the last several decades reductions in the body sizes of fishes have been observed in exploited populations in response to size selective fishing devine et al 2012 mcclenachan 2009 olsen et al 2004 evolutionary and plastic changes in life history traits could modulate population growth rate interaction strength and energy flow up through food chains therefore size selective harvesting could alter the stability of populations bronikowski et al 2002 cameron et al 2013 and of consumer resource interactions mccann 2012 rip and mccann 2011 a modeling study by kuparinen et al 2016 showed that fishing induced changes in life history traits magnified temporal variation of intrinsic fish biomass dynamics and of other organisms over and above fishing even after fishing ceased using an empirically parameterized bioenergetic food web model of a well studied lake ecosystem although the notion that fishing often increases temporal variability of exploited fish populations appears to prevail anderson et al 2008 hsieh et al 2006 the theory of consumer resource interactions suggests that fishing could potentially either destabilize or stabilize fish populations through altered energy flow due to elevated metabolic rate and increased mortality of consumer populations mccann 2012 rip and mccann 2011 the generality of the effects of fishing and fie on fish population dynamics suggested by existing studies remains unknown albeit such information is highly relevant to sustainable management of fisheries ecosystems comprehensive empirical investigations are virtually impossible due to the lack of long term fisheries and survey data that include not only measurements on relevant traits of focal species but also monitoring of the key prey species and the entire ecosystem dynamics a complementary approach is to apply bioenergetic food web models such as the one used by kuparinen et al 2016 to a large set of computer generated synthetic realistic food webs that encompass a wide variety of network structures this is the path we take in the present study we investigated how typical it would be for fishing and fisheries induced life history trait changes hereafter fie these changes can be evolutionary or plastic responses to increase temporal variabilities of food web dynamics and examined the associations between food web structure and responses to fishing and fie in a large set of synthetic food webs to this end we used a recently developed composite model by nonaka and kuparinen 2021 which adds stage structure to fish populations in synthetic food web topologies stochastically generated by the niche model williams and martinez 2000 the dynamical model uses the allometric trophic network atn approach bland et al 2019 boit et al 2012 brose et al 2006 glaum et al 2020a hale et al 2020 martinez et al 2006 martinez 2020 williams et al 2007 williams and martinez 2004 which utilizes allometric scaling relationships for parameterizing vital rates predator prey interactions and energy flow we simulated deterministically without external forcing the scenarios for fishing with f fie and without fie fishing only f o on an identical set of food webs along a gradient of the shape of the functional responses of consumers functional responses describe how the consumption rate of a predator varies across prey density and have critical effects in models of population dynamics the parameter the so called hill exponent q in eq 2 below shifts the shape of functional responses from type ii hyperbolic to iii sigmoidal along which the dynamical stability of consumer resource interactions increase murdoch and oaten 1975 uszko et al 2015 type iii functional response promotes prey persistence at low prey densities through reduced predator consumption rates presumably owing to changes in prey and predator behaviors e g prey hiding in refugia or predators forming search image on more abundant prey adaptively foraging or switching prey it substantially influences the dynamical stability of atn models martinez et al 2006 williams and martinez 2004 we classified food webs by types of responses to the f fie and f o scenarios and measured food web structure and energy flow to compare food webs that showed different types of temporal dynamics and responses 2 methods 2 1 life

simulations were run in matlab with statistical toolbox and parallel computing toolbox release 2020b the mathworks inc natick massachusetts united states the code is available in the dryad digital depository https datadryad org stash dataset doi 10 5061 dryad z612jm6bk briefly the model was built on the niche model williams and martinez 2000 with an extension to add life history stages to a subset of trophic species a trophic species consists of one or more taxa that share the same sets of predators and prey cohen et al 1990 havens 1992 some of the trophic species were grouped based on niche overlap to form a stage structured population the minimum overlap between feeding ranges to be qualified as consecutive stages of the same stage structured fish taxon was set to 20 based on a literature survey nonaka and kuparinen 2021 relative body masses are assigned to the terminal stages of stage structured species and invertebrates based on the short weighted trophic levels williams and martinez 2004 in accordance with the theory of allometric predator prey body mass ratio brose et al 2006 we used the von bertalanffy isometric growth curve wootton 1998 to define the masses of younger stage classes table 1 because of this way of parameterization the final predator prey body mass ratios deviated from the theoretical mass ratio but the shape of the distribution conformed to the empirical data brose et al 2006 see the online appendix for nonaka and kuparinen 2021 it originally calculates body sizes lengths of fish as a function of age pauly 1980 froese binohlan 2000 while we used ontogenetic stages instead because age and stages are practically related in many fishes e g perch white fish and in our model see below the use of the leslie matrix we applied the atn to the food webs to simulate population biomass dynamics brose et al 2006 the population dynamics of the species and life history stages in the food web were described by a set of ordinary differential equations ode which encoded the rates of biomass changes during a growing season the population dynamics within the food webs were formulated as a multispecies consumer resource model yodzis and innes 1992 brose et al 2006 boit et al 2012 bland et al 2019 which was originally developed by yodzis and innes 1992 and has been further developed and analyzed by a number of studies bland et al 2019 boit

atn models published elsewhere bland et al 2019 brose et al 2006 nonaka and kuparinen 2021 the population dynamics were encapsulated in the following equations 1 d b i d t g i 1 j a u t o t r o p h s

o i j was the half saturation constant of consumer i eating prey j which was the density of j at which i achieved half its maximum consumption rate table 2a williams 2008 the hill exponent q of the functional response was varied between 1 05 and 1 65 by an increment of 0 15 this range was chosen because q 1 and q 2 correspond to type ii and iii functional responses respectively and because past atn studies used q between 1 2 and 1 5 see 4 2 the effect of q hill exponent of functional responses and the choices of q by previous studies williams and martinez 2004b martinez et al 2006 the second

only intraspecific interference competition and no interspecific or between stage interference competition for this study i e c k j 0 for k i see 4 4 limitation of the model in discussion each year consisted of a 90 day growing season 90 time steps in the ode solver followed by a non growing season where surplus energy dietary intake minus all the losses in eqn 2 was allocated to growth and reproduction the proportion allocated to reproduction increased linearly with stage and was none 0 for the first stage and 0 2 i m a x for the terminal stage with an equal increment between stages table 2a kuparinen et al 2016 nonaka and kuparinen 2021 fish in the terminal stage additionally reproduced in exchange for 30 of their biomass roff 1992 wootton 1998 the fraction of mature individuals of fish at each life stage was determined by a logistic function which specified that 50 of individuals were mature halfway to the terminal stage table 1 we used the leslie matrix to shift the majority of somatic biomass to the next stage via growth and to convert it to new recruitment via reproduction at the terminal stage table 1 a fraction a h of a stage class remained in the same stage to reflect variation in growth table 2a there was no gain or loss of biomass between consecutive growing seasons i e no winter mortality we generated 60 000 networks of 60 nodes s 0 and connectance c equal to 0 15 which is a commonly used value of connectance in atn models berlow et al 2009 bland et al 2019 dunne et al 2002 martinez et al 2012 with error tolerance at 0 025 i e webs with c between

were eligible to become a fish node i e need to include at least one non basal species in diet we then ran the atn on each network from random initial biomasses uniformly distributed between 0 1 and 100 µgc l taxa were considered extinct when the biomass was less than 10 6 µgc l or invalid if the biomass surpassed 1012 µgc l this occurred because the terminal stage could accumulate large biomass over time 70 of biomass remained in the last stage and some food webs allowed it to become very large at the end of each growing season fishes that retained only older stages but not younger ones for more than 10 years were removed as extinct food webs were regarded as persistent if simulations lasted for 1000 years all the nodes of persisting species were connected in one network no invertebrates were without predators and at least one fish with 3 or more stages remained the qualifying criteria we refer to these selected webs as persisting webs below fig 1b 2 2 implementing fishing and fisheries induced evolution f fie and f o scenarios on the persisting webs we implemented two scenarios 1 fishing and associated fisheries induced life history evolution f fie and 2 fishing only f o fig 1b following kuparinen et al 2016 we set stage specific fishing selectivity s s t a g e to vary by stage starting with zero in the first stage table 1 for example for a fish species with 5 stage classes s s t a g e is 0 0 27 0 73 0 95 and 0 99 for stage classes 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively non fish trophic species were not subjected to fishing fishing effort instantaneous fishing mortality rate f m a x was set at 0 5 as motivated by the empirical rate from lake constance used by kuparinen et al 2016 we imposed fisheries induced changes in life histories namely the onset of maturity and stage specific metabolic rate to investigate their effects on fish biomass dynamics as in kuparinen et al 2016 during the fishing period the age at 50 maturity in fishes was advanced by 0 5 per year younger and smaller size at maturity and fishes metabolic rate was increased by 10 4 per year andersen and pedersen 2009 audzijonyte et al 2013a darimont et al 2009 kuparinen et al 2016 we assumed that evolutionary recovery from fishing was very slow conover et al 2009 enberg et al 2009 jorgensen et al 2007 kuparinen and merilä 2007 law 2000 law et al 1989 so that fishes retained the life history traits attained at the end of the fishing period unchanged during the post fishing period we first ensured that the biomasses of the species in the persisting webs settled at dynamic equilibria stable or stable oscillations and then subjected the fish populations to fishing and fie for 50 years followed by 500 years of no fishing f fie scenario in the f o scenario no fie was imposed during the fishing period fig 1 the model was run for a long post fishing period to observe the dynamics beyond the transients after fishing ceased 2 3 determining the temporal variability of fish biomass dynamics coefficients of variation cv were calculated as the standard deviation of l o g 10 b i o m a s s divided by the absolute value of the mean across time for each fish stage the maximum cv among stages was used to characterize the temporal variability of the fish biomass dynamics of a food web we used the maximum not the mean to better capture the sensitivity of population fluctuations cvs were calculated separately for the pre fishing period from time step 901 to 1000 cvpre and for the post fishing period from time step 1451 to 1550 cvpost or from the last 50 time steps if the fish populations went extinct before the end of simulations to address the main question regarding the additional effects of fie more directly we classified the simulated food webs by their responses to the f fie and f o treatments because a set of identical food webs were subjected to the two scenarios we considered their differential responses as isolated effects of fie we categorized the food webs into a 5 5 contingency matrix for the definitions of the response categories see table 3 the combinations of responses were further classified into consistent same responses to f fie and f o higher destabilization in f fie or higher destabilization in f o for the webs that were either destabilized or stabilized hereafter refers to webs that increased and decreased temporal variability respectively consistently between the two scenarios the levels of changes in temporal variability between f fie and f o were quantitatively compared and assigned one of the three categories above table 3 2 4 quantifying food web structure and energy flow we used common network metrics in complex food web studies to quantify the basic structures of food webs table 4 dunne 2009 gross et al 2009 williams and martinez 2008 and food web energetics by measuring the slopes of biomass spectra and the amounts and variation of energy influxes gained by fishes because we wanted to compare the food web structure before and after the fishing period but not during the fishing period due to difficulties with removing transient dynamics we measured these quantities with regard only to persisting species i e filtered by the atn dynamics in the last 25 years of both the pre fishing and the post fishing periods or the last 25 years before collapse the slopes of biomass spectra were obtained by fitting a linear model with biomass in trophic levels as the response variable and body mass as the explanatory variable trebilco et al 2013 woodson et al 2018 the model output the gain metrics containing the pairwise gain term energy influxes of the biomass rate equations eqns 1 and 2 integrated over a growing season we took the mean across l o g 10 g a i n in the last 100 years of the pre fishing and post fishing periods or minimum of 25 years before collapse to calculate cvs skewness here skewness is invariant to scaling and shifting of distributions and total sum across incoming links for all the fish stages 3 results 3 1 temporal variability of fish biomass dynamics the proportion of persisting and qualified webs increased with q while the proportion of oscillating qualified webs generally decreased fig 2 a food webs with stably oscillating biomass dynamics were rare almost the same number of food webs reached the end of simulations i e 1550 years in the f fie and f o scenarios the distributions of cvs of energy gain by fishes were highly skewed to the right and the frequency rapidly and continuously declined toward larger cvs categorizing simulated time series with cv 0 05 as temporally variable i e unstable best matched visual inspection of subsets of the time series fig s1 the distributions of absolute differences between cvpre and cvpost were wide but mostly concentrated near 0 fig s2 the absolute differences greater than 0 05 appeared the most adequate to indicate differences in temporal variability in comparisons with visual inspection fig s3 hence we categorized food web dynamics as either stable cvpre cvpost 0 05 or unstable i e oscillating cvpre cvpost 0 05 and determined that fishing and fie for f fie increased the variability of the dynamics if cvpost cvpre 0 05 and reduced if cvpre cvpost 0 05 table 3 the majority of webs did not change temporal variability before and after the fishing period the proportions of the webs that became more destabilized or less stabilized temporally variable were hence small but notably peaked at q 1 2 fig 2b the peak was dominated by food webs that were stable prior to fishing fig 2b c among the oscillating webs the proportions of stabilized webs increased with the values of q up to 1 35 after which they stayed similar while the proportions of destabilized webs remained roughly constant fig 2d the proportions of food webs that changed temporal variability either increased or decreased were greater under the f fie than the f o scenario across all the values of q examined indicating additional effects of fie on the temporal variability of food web dynamics among the webs with oscillating dynamics the proportions of the webs that were more negatively affected or more destabilized by f fie than by f o were higher than those affected more by f o than by f fie at lower values of q fig 3 at higher values of q the two became similar for stable webs most webs exhibited no change in both scenarios fig s4 this result mirrored the above finding that fie had additional effects on the temporal variability of food web dynamics beyond the effects of fishing alone at lower values of q 3 2 food web structure and energy flow the modified niche model generated food webs with a wide variety of network structural properties fig s5 the values of the network structural metrics of the persisting food webs also showed high variation fig 4 the mean trend almost monotonically increased or decreased along with q and the patterns were similar among stabilized destabilized and unchanged webs in both the pre fishing and post fishing periods fig 4a o as q increased the persisting webs contained more species more links proportionally more intermediate and invertebrate species and correspondingly proportionally fewer fishes and basal species the patterns of the proportions of cannibals and omnivores and of maximum trophic levels reflected the compositional change i e more fish stages the destabilized and stabilized food webs on average had slightly lower proportions of basal species and slightly higher proportions of fishes that occupied marginally higher trophic levels than did the webs whose temporal variability not change before and after fishing fig 4c o the mean trend for the slopes of biomass spectra increased with increasing q indicating that the shapes of biomass pyramids became less bottom heavy as q increased fig 4p the total energy gained by the fishes also increased with q fig 4q these increasing patterns together with increasing patterns of maximum trophic levels suggested that the food webs channeled more energy toward the top of the food chains mostly fishes with increasing q the variation in the energy flow along each link into fishes a proxy for interaction strength increased with q fig 4s and an increasing number of these links became more concentrated at smaller values greater positive skews fig 4r as q increased these indicated that when q was high the food webs contained higher proportions of weaker feeding links on average in the post fishing period food webs contained fewer species and links and experienced changes associated with these compositional changes fig 4 the mean trends of the slopes of biomass spectra increased slightly fig 4p and the skewness and variation of energy fluxes into fishes declined modestly fig 4r s at low to intermediate values of q for the stabilized and destabilized webs hence fishing caused the food webs to have lower proportions of weak interactions and less bottom heavy biomass pyramids at low to intermediate values of q the patterns were very similar for the f o scenario fig s6 4 discussion 4 1 limiting effects of fishing and fie on the temporal variability of complex food webs kuparinen et al 2016 demonstrated that using an empirically parameterized model without external forcing increased temporal variability of fish abundances due to fisheries induced phenotypic changes could remain even after fishing stopped in the current study we examined their result in a large number of food webs with various topologies and observed that phenotypic changes caused by size selective fishing infrequently increased or decreased but predominantly neither the temporal variability of fish biomass dynamics from the pre fishing to the post fishing period the principle of energy flux gellner and mccann 2016 mccann 2012 rip and mccann 2011 can help explain the patterns of temporal variability in fish abundance it predicts that an increase in energy flux to a consumer relative to its loss term relative energy flux makes the population dynamics more temporally variable or less stable and the consumer resource biomass ratio less bottom heavy based on this principle we can expect that in the absence of environmental fluctuations fishing and fie could reduce the variability of fish populations if an increase in the loss term through fishing mortality and elevated metabolism reduce relative energy influx to the consumer likewise we can expect that they could increase variability if energy influx to the consumer increases due to increased metabolic demands or higher resource availability mediated by trophic cascades or compensatory growth of prey finally we can also expect that changes in gain and loss may be insufficient or that greater loss balances out increased gain causing not much net changes in temporal variability our results appear to support the latter possibilities the most in our study the vast majority of food webs had stable biomass dynamics before and after fishing food web theory which encompasses the principle of energy flux that has been developed by mccann and others gellner and mccann 2016 mccann 2012 mccauley et al 2018 nilsson et al 2018 rip and mccann 2011 states that along the gradient of increasing energy flux or decreasing energy loss to a consumer a food web can transition from a non excitable never oscillates to an excitable state possible to oscillate when the largest eigenvalue of the community matrix the jacobian matrix of the dynamical equations eqns 1 3 turns from real to complex before exhibiting sustained oscillations in the stable food webs we observed fishing and fie presumably did not alter the food web structure or dynamics enough to bring them into the parameter region of sustained oscillations borrelli et al 2015 our result does not seem unrealistic as intrinsically oscillating populations either exploited or not appear uncommon in nature kendall et al 1998 shelton and mangel 2011 instead studies have pointed out the importance of environmental fluctuations interacting with nonlinear population dynamics perturbed by harvesting to destabilize the abundances of exploited populations anderson et al 2008 cameron et al 2016 we observed that changes in temporal variabilities of fish biomasses occurred more often in food webs already oscillating prior to fishing and that those webs were more likely to reduce rather than increase temporal variability the oscillating food webs were in excitable states i e the largest eigenvalue of the community matrix was complex where slight shifts along the energy flux gradient due to fishing and fie could alter biomass variability qualitatively or quantitatively the reason for reduced temporal variability could be that it is more likely for fishing and fie to perturb the system to move toward a more stable state by removing energy or pruning less stable modules while it is less likely for perturbations to bring systems upward the instability gradient nonetheless temporal variability increased in some oscillating webs because the systems collapsed or reorganized possibly to channel greater energy up in remaining food chains to isolate the effects of fie from fishing we classified each food web based on its responses to the two treatments f fie and f o fig 3 the result indicated that additional negative effects increased variability or collapse of fie predominated at lower values of q at q 1 2 the food webs were relatively unstable and extra perturbations from fie brought about more temporal variability as q increased the food webs became progressively more stable and fie was equally likely to exacerbate or alleviate the effects of perturbation by fishing rip and mccann 2011 mccann 2012 gellner and mccann 2016 we speculate that when q was low food webs probably had to have high stability conferred by food web structure to persist through the pre fishing period the fraction of persisting webs was smaller when q 1 2 fig 2a and larger fractions of these webs consistently responded to both f fie and f o i e not sensitive to fie fig 3f when q was higher stability conferred by food web structure was probably not as crucial for persistence more discussion regarding q below a higher fraction of the oscillating webs was differentially perturbed by f fie and f o at higher q possibly because of weaker stability inducing network structure and consequently higher sensitivity to perturbations fig 3f 4 2 the effect of q hill exponent of functional responses and the choices of q by previous studies we found that the proportion of destabilized food webs peaked at q 1 2 fig 2b and these webs were predominantly stable in biomass dynamics prior to fishing as described above the stable food webs with q 1 2 seemed to be located along the energy flux gradient closer to the region of sustained oscillation than were those with lower or higher q i e likely to go through the discontinuity in stability when perturbed at q 1 05 probably only webs that were far from the region of sustained oscillation by having stability inducing structure attained stable dynamics at higher q stability conferred by the sigmoidal functional responses likely largely contributed to the stable dynamics oscillating food webs did not show a peak at q 1 2 fig 2d presumably because oscillating webs were already in the excitable state the parameter q determines the shape of functional responses eqn 3 and critically affects the stability and dynamics of consumer resource models including those using the atn approaches brose et al 2006 hunsicker et al 2011 koen alonso and yodzis 2005 williams and martinez 2004a existing empirical data support various values of q from 1 to above 3 rosenbaum and rall 2018 uszko et al 2015 but accurately estimating it using empirical data is challenging uszko et al 2020 among atn modeling studies popular values for q are 1 i e type ii and 1 2 e g bland et al 2019 boit et al 2012 curtsdotter et al 2018 glaum et al 2020b kuparinen et al 2016 quévreux and brose 2018 schneider et al 2012 while no sensitivity analyses were usually provided with respect to this parameter some other studies sampled values from a plausible range between type i and type ii functional responses e g curtsdotter et al 2011 kalinkat et al 2013 schneider et al 2016 but they did not report which values of q prevailed in the persisted simulation runs that were subsequently analyzed previous atn studies appear to have justified q being slightly above 1 to enhance the stability of the models and facilitate complex food web research martinez and others martinez et al 2006 williams and martinez 2004b specifically investigated the effects of q on the persistence of complex food webs and cogently demonstrated that a seemingly modest increase from 1 to 1 2 achieved about a 20 increase in persistence boit et al 2012 presented a successful application of the atn approach to an empirical system lake constance with q 1 2 although their atn model fitted well to high quality empirical data from the lake q was not directly estimated with the data kuparinen et al 2016 adopted the same parameter values from boit et al 2012 and concluded that fisheries induced trait changes in exploited fish populations of lake constance magnified the variability of their abundances based on our results the particular choice of q in kuparinen et al 2016 may have been responsible for the observed increased variability in fish dynamics post hoc analyses of their model showed that destabilization could be observed with q between 1 1 and 1 25 unpublished results furthermore the shapes of functional responses could vary among predator prey pairs smith and smith 2020 but the majority of implementations of atn in literature used a uniform value of q including our study given the large impact of functional responses on predator prey dynamics the generality of conclusions regarding stability and persistence of species in complex food webs from studies that used only one value of q in the absence of reliable estimates without providing sensitivity analysis on the parameter may be limited e g bland et al 2019 glaum et al 2020b hale et al 2020 sentis et al 2021 uncertainty also surrounds other parameters in the atn models given the large number of input parameters it is not feasible to fully explore the sensitivities of the parameters of the atn models the allometric parameters were refined as more data became available since the original formulation by yodzis and innes 1992 brose et al 2006 although our results are subject to the same criticism we focused our investigation on the effects of q on food web stability the key advantage of the atn approach is to anchor the parameterization of the models of complex species interactions on established allometric and other known relationships regarding physiological life history demographic and species interaction traits through a relatively limited number of assumptions brose et al 2006 brown et al 2004 rooney et al 2007 yodzis and innes 1992 the atn models contain parameters for which general allometric relationships are not known or there are no good estimates available these include half saturation constant b 0 predator interference c q and diet preference ω conceptually the atn models are useful as virtual mesocosms of complex food webs and a convenient heuristic tool as in empirical mesocosm studies making inferences to realistic contexts is a challenge rigorous estimation and prudent choices of parameter values and careful though limited sensitivity analyses are warranted 4 3 food web structure and responses to fishing and fie the variations in measured food web metrics were very large fig 4 for f fie fig s6 for f o clearly many more food webs were needed to narrow the ranges but it was computationally prohibitive nonetheless many of the food web metrics steadily increased or decreased in their means with q indicating the parameter s monotonic influence on food web structure and energy flow with increasing q the number of nodes species or fish stages and link density increased and the structure of food webs became more intermediate or invertebrate dominated similarly the total energy gained by fishes increased food chains became longer and the shapes of biomass pyramids became less bottom heavy i e the slopes of biomass spectra became less negative with increasing q despite increased complexity and shifts in food web structure many more food webs persisted to the end of the pre fishing period with the majority exhibiting stable fish biomasses with higher q one explanation could be that increasing proportions of weak interactions in the food webs with increasing q enhanced stability of the food webs as indicated by the skewness and cvs of fish energy gains this was likely realized because of the increased complexity more nodes and links of the food webs and species or fish stages having more interaction links on average higher link density it was not possible to discern differences in structure among food webs that responded differently to the f fie and f o scenarios the mean trends suggested that the food webs that changed temporal variability had proportionally slightly more fishes and contained longer food chains i e higher maximum trophic levels than did the webs whose variability did not change before and after fishing fig 4 it was a straightforward consequence of fishing targeting larger fishes that such food webs were more affected by fishing in the post fishing periods although food webs on average lost weak interactions as indicated by lower skewness and cvs of fish energy gains and showed less bottom heavy biomass pyramids the majority did not change the level of temporal variability before and after fishing this implies that the relationships between food web structure and stability are not robust tang et al 2014 or are very difficult to disentangle with a modest number of replicated food webs 4 4 limitations of the model the changes of life history towards attaining higher metabolic rates and reproductive capacity earlier in life in our model implicitly mimic evolution towards smaller body size a phenomenon that has been observed in multiple exploited fish populations devine et al 2012 mcclenachan 2009 olsen et al 2004 despite this assumption fishes at all stages in our model advanced from stage to stage at the same rate and interacted with the same set of predators and prey as in the pre fishing period our objective was to investigate the generality of the findings by kuparinen et al 2016 in a wider set of food webs so we decided to keep the assumption of an unchanging food web structure despite decreasing fish body sizes rewiring of trophic interactions is an important consideration for food web modeling dealing with fie and climate change audzijonyte et al 2013b however it is difficult to implement changes in food web topology as body size shrinks under the current formulation of the model because trophic relationships in the initial input food web determine body masses as in kuparinen et al 2016 mass specific metabolic rates of fishes were assumed to increase by a small percentage every year during the fishing period to match the assumption of shrinking body size under fie this was based on the inverse relationship between body size and mass specific metabolic rate which has been documented both interspecifically and intraspecifically brown et al 2004 huang et al 2013 jerde et al 2019 killen et al 2010 furthermore auer et al 2018 reported rapid evolution of higher standard metabolic rates smr in response to high predation mortality in adults in trinidadian guppy populations which was argued to be a good model system to inform about fie in exploited populations reznick and ghalambor 2005 in contrast no difference in smr was reported between size selectively and randomly harvested experimental populations of zebra fish danio rerio uusi heikkilä et al 2015 and between early and late maturing genotypes of salmonid species åsheim et al 2021 prokkola et al 2022 in experimental studies feeding rate and activity levels which are known to be positively related to smr cooke et al 2007 declined in response to harvesting treatments pauli et al 2019 walsh et al 2006 bold fast growing and active individuals are found more prone to be fished out leaving less active and shy ones behind arlinghaus et al 2017 biro and post 2008 claireaux et al 2018 redpath et al 2010 on the other hand individuals with higher swimming capacities and stamina may be more capable of escaping certain fishing gear types crespel et al 2021 hollins et al 2018 killen et al 2015 vulnerability to fishing is likely context dependent as growth and food intake rates depend on not only smr but also environmental conditions including temperature and food availability bouffet halle et al 2021 hollins et al 2018 given this uncertainty we decided to retain the original scheme of kuparinen et al 2016 and assumed the inverse intraspecific allometric relationship between body mass and mass specific metabolic rate to simulate fie this implementation resulted in higher rates of metabolic loss and dietary intake in eqn 2 i e x increased these increased loss and gain rates probably balanced out to some extent and may explain partially why most of the food webs did not change temporal variability we used the same rates of increases in metabolic rate and maturation as in kuparinen et al 2016 and similarly assumed that evolution halted after fishing ended but did not reverse during the post fishing period the rates of evolution were assumed to be small table 2a as fitness related traits often show low heritability law 2007 selection imposed by fishing is considered much stronger than is natural selection darimont et al 2009 fugère and hendry 2018 hutchings and fraser 2008 law 2000 and reversals of fie are thought to be slow or difficult allendorf and hard 2009 conover et al 2009 enberg et al 2009 kuparinen and merilä 2007 walsh et al 2006 we simulated the post fishing period for 500 years to merely observe dynamics beyond transients instead of externally imposing trait changes fie can also be modeled more mechanistically through endogenously arising natural selection forestier et al 2020 quantitative genetics methods mcpeek 2017 or adaptive dynamics dieckmann and law 1996 geritz et al 1998 could be used to model trait evolution furthermore as fished populations may potentially coevolve with other species in the community fie could cascade up or down the food chains wood et al 2018 with smaller taxa lower in the chains possibly evolving faster barraclough 2015 hence in our study selection was disconnected from species interactions changes in community dynamics due to fishing did not feedback to evolutionary dynamics and predator prey coevolution was neglected these are important challenges to move the field forward in future fie research it will increase model complexity substantially and obtaining reliable estimates for an increased number of parameters will be difficult our approach requires simpler assumptions and many fewer parameters than such mechanistic models but still can incorporate empirically supported patterns e g harvested fish becoming smaller and hypotheses or predictions from theory e g higher mass specific metabolic rates in smaller organisms it will be informative to compare results from these two approaches in future studies classifying time series into categories stable vs unstable temporal variability changed or not according to cv involved subjective judgement because of numerical errors and continuous distributions of cv or difference between cvs fig s1 s3 we visually assessed a large subset of simulated time series and selected cutoff at 0 05 because it gave the most consistent results to our visual assessments fig s1 s3 it also allocated sufficient food webs to each category because it is not feasible to obtain analytical expression of eigenvalues for the system of eqns 1 3 numerically computing eigenvalues will encounter a similar issue we assumed no interspecific and inter cohort interference competition interference competition can stabilize consumer dynamics in some consumer resource models by reducing energy uptake rate by consumers but at the same time it could decrease energy loss from predation in prey species i e increase in net energy gain to induce oscillation in prey mccann 2012 the strength of interference competition could arise from consumers themselves or from prey behavior in response to increasing consumer densities kondoh 2003 mccann 2000 for which no allometric theory based on body size or predator prey mass ratio has been developed the abovementioned study on lake constance by boit et al 2012 chose reasonable parameter values based on their expert knowledge on the system we initially used the same parameter values as in previous studies bland et al 2019 boit et al 2012 kuparinen et al 2016 but only a very small number of oscillating food webs persisted we decided to retain only intraspecific interference competition coefficients to have a reasonable number of webs with oscillating dynamics consequently our model does not speak to how common intrinsically oscillating food webs might be in nature 5 conclusions our aim was to investigate the generality of the magnifying effect of fishing and fie on food web dynamics in realistic synthetic food webs we found that the majority of the food webs did not change temporal variability in abundance before and after the fishing period in our model although food webs with oscillating fish biomass dynamics were rare those oscillating prior to fishing were more prone to increased as well as decreased temporal variability by fie than those with stable dynamics the frequencies of food webs that changed temporal variability varied across the shape of functional responses q lastly the generality of the conclusions regarding complexity and stability of food webs from studies that use the atn approach without testing the sensitivity to the shape of functional responses could be limited funding this

24267,harvesting has been implicated in destabilizing the abundances of exploited populations because selective harvesting often targets large individuals some studies have proposed that exploited populations often experience demographic shifts toward younger smaller individuals and become more sensitive to environmental fluctuations the theory of consumer resource dynamics has been applied to address the impacts of harvesting in simple modular food webs but harvested populations are embedded in a complex food web in nature in addition exploited populations have been shown to undergo trait evolution or phenotypic changes toward early maturation at smaller sizes using an empirically derived complex food web model kuparinen et al 2016 fishing induced life history changes degrade and destabilize harvested ecosystems scientific reports 6 22 245 demonstrated that exploited fish populations and other ecosystem properties increased variability due to harvesting and harvesting induced life history evolution in the absence of environmental fluctuations in the present study we examined a large set of simulated complex food webs to attest the generality of the findings in kuparinen et al 2016 we found that harvesting both increased and decreased temporal variability of fish biomass dynamics especially in food webs with intrinsically oscillating dynamics while the vast majority of the food webs did not experience destabilization we also elucidated the large impacts of the shape of functional responses on food web structure energy flow and changes in temporal variability caused by harvesting our results suggest that the destabilizing or stabilizing effects of harvesting and harvesting induced evolution importantly depend on the shape of functional responses in dynamical models of complex food webs and that food webs with intrinsically oscillating dynamics are more prone to changes in temporal variability caused by harvesting and harvesting induced evolution keywords

z612jm6bk 1 introduction size selective harvesting which preferentially removes individuals of certain sizes has been implicated to result in phenotypic and potentially evolutionary changes in life history traits related to survival and reproduction in exploited populations ernande et al 2004 heino et al 2015 kuparinen and festa bianchet 2016 it imposes high mortality and strong selection pressure typically on older and larger individuals and thus can truncate size structure barnett et al 2017 hsieh et al 2006 the theory of life history evolution predicts greater investment in reproduction and early maturation to evolve in populations undergoing high mortality in adults or equally across all life stages resulting in smaller body size at maturity charlesworth 1994 law 1979 reznick and ghalambor 2005 as a consequence populations experiencing high mortality in adults may consist more of younger and smaller individuals with higher reproductive capacities reznick et al 1990 stearns 2000 and metabolic rate auer et al 2018 the possibilities of fisheries induced evolution fie have been demonstrated by laboratory experiments of size selective harvesting conover and munch 2002 therkildsen et al 2019 uusi heikkilä et al 2017 and indicated by a diverse array of species in the wild allendorf and hard 2009 darimont et al 2009 heino et al 2015 jorgensen et al 2007 kuparinen and festa bianchet 2016 over the last several decades reductions in the body sizes of fishes have been observed in exploited populations in response to size selective fishing devine et al 2012 mcclenachan 2009 olsen et al 2004 evolutionary and plastic changes in life history traits could modulate population growth rate interaction strength and energy flow up through food chains therefore size selective harvesting could alter the stability of populations bronikowski et al 2002 cameron et al 2013 and of consumer resource interactions mccann 2012 rip and mccann 2011 a modeling study by kuparinen et al 2016 showed that fishing induced changes in life history traits magnified temporal variation of intrinsic fish biomass dynamics and of other organisms over and above fishing even after fishing ceased using an empirically parameterized bioenergetic food web model of a well studied lake ecosystem although the notion that fishing often increases temporal variability of exploited fish populations appears to prevail anderson et al 2008 hsieh et al 2006 the theory of consumer resource interactions suggests that fishing could potentially either destabilize or stabilize fish populations through altered energy flow due to elevated metabolic rate and increased mortality of consumer populations mccann 2012 rip and mccann 2011 the generality of the effects of fishing and fie on fish population dynamics suggested by existing studies remains unknown albeit such information is highly relevant to sustainable management of fisheries ecosystems comprehensive empirical investigations are virtually impossible due to the lack of long term fisheries and survey data that include not only measurements on relevant traits of focal species but also monitoring of the key prey species and the entire ecosystem dynamics a complementary approach is to apply bioenergetic food web models such as the one used by kuparinen et al 2016 to a large set of computer generated synthetic realistic food webs that encompass a wide variety of network structures this is the path we take in the present study we investigated how typical it would be for fishing and fisheries induced life history trait changes hereafter fie these changes can be evolutionary or plastic responses to increase temporal variabilities of food web dynamics and examined the associations between food web structure and responses to fishing and fie in a large set of synthetic food webs to this end we used a recently developed composite model by nonaka and kuparinen 2021 which adds stage structure to fish populations in synthetic food web topologies stochastically generated by the niche model williams and martinez 2000 the dynamical model uses the allometric trophic network atn approach bland et al 2019 boit et al 2012 brose et al 2006 glaum et al 2020a hale et al 2020 martinez et al 2006 martinez 2020 williams et al 2007 williams and martinez 2004 which utilizes allometric scaling relationships for parameterizing vital rates predator prey interactions and energy flow we simulated deterministically without external forcing the scenarios for fishing with f fie and without fie fishing only f o on an identical set of food webs along a gradient of the shape of the functional responses of consumers functional responses describe how the consumption rate of a predator varies across prey density and have critical effects in models of population dynamics the parameter the so called hill exponent q in eq 2 below shifts the shape of functional responses from type ii hyperbolic to iii sigmoidal along which the dynamical stability of consumer resource interactions increase murdoch and oaten 1975 uszko et al 2015 type iii functional response promotes prey persistence at low prey densities through reduced predator consumption rates presumably owing to changes in prey and predator behaviors e g prey hiding in refugia or predators forming search image on more abundant prey adaptively foraging or switching prey it substantially influences the dynamical stability of atn models martinez et al 2006 williams and martinez 2004 we classified food webs by types of responses to the f fie and f o scenarios and measured food web structure and energy flow to compare food webs that showed different types of temporal dynamics and responses 2 methods 2 1 life

depository https datadryad org stash dataset doi 10 5061 dryad z612jm6bk briefly the model was built on the niche model williams and martinez 2000 with an extension to add life history stages to a subset of trophic species a trophic species consists of one or more taxa that share the same sets of predators and prey cohen et al 1990 havens 1992 some of the trophic species were grouped based on niche overlap to form a stage structured population the minimum overlap between feeding ranges to be qualified as consecutive stages of the same stage structured fish taxon was set to 20 based on a literature survey nonaka and kuparinen 2021 relative body masses are assigned to the terminal stages of stage structured species and invertebrates based on the short weighted trophic levels williams and martinez 2004 in accordance with the theory of allometric predator prey body mass ratio brose et al 2006 we used the von bertalanffy isometric growth curve wootton 1998 to define the masses of younger stage classes table 1 because of this way of parameterization the final predator prey body mass ratios deviated from the theoretical mass ratio but the shape of the distribution conformed to the empirical data brose et al 2006 see the online appendix for nonaka and kuparinen 2021 it originally calculates body sizes lengths of fish as a function of age pauly 1980 froese binohlan 2000 while we used ontogenetic stages instead because age and stages are practically related in many fishes e g perch white fish and in our model see below the use of the leslie matrix we applied the atn to the food webs to simulate population biomass dynamics brose et al 2006 the population dynamics of the species and life history stages in the food web were described by a set of ordinary differential equations ode which encoded the rates of biomass changes during a growing season the population dynamics within the food webs were formulated as a multispecies consumer resource model yodzis and innes

functional response was varied between 1 05 and 1 65 by an increment of 0 15 this range was chosen because q 1 and q 2 correspond to type ii and iii functional responses respectively and because past

consisted of a 90 day growing season 90 time steps in the ode solver followed by a non growing season where surplus energy dietary intake minus all the losses in eqn 2 was allocated to growth and reproduction the proportion allocated to reproduction increased linearly with stage and was none 0 for the first stage and 0 2 i m a x for the terminal stage with an equal increment between stages table 2a kuparinen et al 2016 nonaka and kuparinen 2021 fish in the terminal stage additionally reproduced in exchange for 30 of their biomass roff 1992 wootton 1998 the fraction of mature individuals of fish at each life stage was determined by a logistic function which specified that 50 of individuals were mature halfway to the terminal stage table 1 we used the leslie matrix to shift the majority of somatic biomass to the next stage via growth and to convert it to new recruitment via reproduction at the terminal stage table 1 a fraction a h of a stage class remained in the same stage to reflect variation in growth table 2a there was no gain or loss of biomass between consecutive growing seasons i e no winter mortality we generated 60 000 networks of 60 nodes s 0 and connectance c equal to 0 15 which is a commonly used value of connectance in atn models berlow et al 2009 bland et al 2019 dunne et al 2002 martinez et al 2012 with error tolerance at 0 025 i e webs with c between

were eligible to become a fish node i e need to include at least one non basal species in diet we then ran the atn on each network from random initial biomasses uniformly distributed between 0 1 and 100 µgc l taxa were considered extinct when the biomass was less than 10 6 µgc l or invalid if the biomass surpassed 1012 µgc l this occurred because the terminal stage could accumulate large biomass over time 70 of biomass remained in the last stage and some food webs allowed it to become very large at the end of each growing season fishes that retained only older stages but not younger ones for more than 10 years were removed as extinct food webs were regarded as persistent if simulations lasted for 1000 years all the nodes of persisting species were connected in one network no invertebrates were without predators and at least one fish with 3 or more stages remained the qualifying criteria we refer to these selected webs as persisting webs below fig 1b 2 2 implementing fishing and fisheries induced evolution f fie and f o scenarios on the persisting webs we implemented two scenarios 1 fishing and associated fisheries induced life history evolution f fie and 2 fishing only f o fig 1b following kuparinen et al 2016 we set stage specific fishing selectivity s s t a g e to vary by stage starting with zero in the first stage table 1 for example for a fish species with 5 stage classes s s t a g e is 0 0 27 0 73 0 95 and 0 99 for stage classes 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively non fish trophic species were not subjected to fishing fishing effort instantaneous fishing mortality rate f m a x was set at 0 5 as motivated by the empirical rate from lake constance used by kuparinen et al 2016 we imposed fisheries induced changes in life histories namely the onset of maturity and stage specific metabolic rate to investigate their effects on fish biomass dynamics as in kuparinen et al 2016 during the fishing period the age at 50 maturity in fishes was advanced by 0 5 per year younger and smaller size at maturity and fishes metabolic rate was increased by 10 4 per year andersen and pedersen 2009 audzijonyte et al 2013a darimont et al 2009 kuparinen et al 2016 we assumed that evolutionary recovery from fishing was very slow conover et al 2009 enberg et al 2009 jorgensen et al 2007 kuparinen and merilä 2007 law 2000 law et al 1989 so that fishes retained the life history traits attained at the end of the fishing period unchanged during the post fishing period we first ensured that the biomasses of the species in the persisting webs settled at dynamic equilibria stable or stable oscillations and then subjected the fish populations to fishing and fie for 50 years followed by 500 years of no fishing f fie scenario in the f o scenario no fie was imposed during the fishing period fig 1 the model was run for a long post fishing period to observe the dynamics beyond the transients after fishing ceased 2 3 determining the temporal variability of fish biomass dynamics coefficients of variation cv were calculated as the standard deviation of l o g 10 b i o m a s s divided by the absolute value of the mean across time for each fish stage the maximum cv among stages was used to characterize the temporal variability of the fish biomass dynamics of a food web we used the maximum not the mean to better capture the sensitivity of population fluctuations cvs were calculated separately for the pre fishing period from time step 901 to 1000 cvpre and for the post fishing period from time step 1451 to 1550 cvpost or from the last 50 time steps if the fish populations went extinct before the end of simulations to address the main question regarding the additional effects of fie more directly we classified the simulated food webs by their responses to the f fie and f o treatments because a set of identical food webs were subjected to the two scenarios we considered their differential responses as isolated effects of fie we categorized the food webs into a 5 5 contingency matrix for the definitions of the response categories see table 3 the combinations of responses were further classified into consistent same responses to f fie and f o higher destabilization in f fie or higher destabilization in f o for the webs that were either destabilized or stabilized hereafter refers to webs that increased and decreased temporal variability respectively consistently between the two scenarios the levels of changes in temporal variability between f fie and f o were quantitatively compared and assigned one of the three categories above table 3 2 4 quantifying food web structure and energy flow we used common network metrics in complex food web studies to quantify the basic structures of food webs table 4 dunne 2009 gross et al 2009 williams and martinez 2008 and food web energetics by measuring the slopes of biomass spectra and the amounts and variation of energy influxes gained by fishes because we wanted to compare the food web structure before and after the fishing period but not during the fishing period due to difficulties with removing transient dynamics we measured these quantities with regard only to persisting species i e filtered by the atn dynamics in the last 25 years of both the pre fishing and the post fishing periods or the last 25 years before collapse the slopes of biomass spectra were obtained by fitting a linear model with biomass in trophic levels as the response variable and body mass as the explanatory variable trebilco et al 2013 woodson et al 2018 the model output the gain metrics containing the pairwise gain term energy influxes of the biomass rate equations eqns 1 and 2 integrated over a growing season we took the mean across l o g 10 g a i n in the last 100 years of the pre fishing and post fishing periods or minimum of 25 years before collapse to calculate cvs skewness here skewness is invariant to scaling and shifting of distributions and total sum across incoming links for all the fish stages 3 results 3 1 temporal variability of fish biomass dynamics the proportion of persisting and qualified webs increased with q while the proportion of oscillating qualified webs generally decreased fig 2 a food webs with stably oscillating biomass dynamics were rare almost the same number of food webs reached the end of simulations i e 1550 years in the f fie and f o scenarios the distributions of cvs of energy gain by fishes were highly skewed to the right and the frequency rapidly and continuously declined toward larger cvs categorizing simulated time series with cv 0 05 as temporally variable i e unstable best matched visual inspection of subsets of the time series fig s1 the distributions of absolute differences between cvpre and cvpost were wide but mostly concentrated near 0 fig s2 the absolute differences greater than 0 05 appeared the most adequate to indicate differences in temporal variability in comparisons with visual inspection fig s3 hence we categorized food web dynamics as either stable cvpre cvpost 0 05 or unstable i e oscillating cvpre cvpost 0 05 and determined that fishing and fie for f fie increased the variability of the dynamics if cvpost cvpre 0 05 and reduced if cvpre cvpost 0 05 table 3 the majority of webs did not change temporal variability before and after the fishing period the proportions of the webs that became more destabilized or less stabilized temporally variable were hence small but notably peaked at q 1 2 fig 2b the peak was dominated by food webs that were stable prior to fishing fig 2b c among the oscillating webs the proportions of stabilized webs increased with the values of q up to 1 35 after which they stayed similar while the proportions of destabilized webs remained roughly constant fig 2d the proportions of food webs that changed temporal variability either increased or decreased were greater under the f fie than the f o scenario across all the values of q examined indicating additional effects of fie on the temporal variability of food web dynamics among the webs with oscillating dynamics the proportions of the webs that were more negatively affected or more destabilized by f fie than by f o were higher than those affected more by f o than by f fie at lower values of q fig 3 at higher values of q the two became similar for stable webs most webs exhibited no change in both scenarios fig s4 this result mirrored the above finding that fie had additional effects on the temporal variability of food web dynamics beyond the effects of fishing alone at lower values of q 3 2 food web structure and energy flow the modified niche model generated food webs with a wide variety of network structural properties fig s5 the values of the network structural metrics of the persisting food webs also showed high variation fig 4 the mean trend almost monotonically increased or decreased along with q and the patterns were similar among stabilized destabilized and unchanged webs in both the pre fishing and post fishing periods fig 4a o as q increased the persisting webs contained more species more links proportionally more intermediate and invertebrate species and correspondingly proportionally fewer fishes and basal species the patterns of the proportions of cannibals and omnivores and of maximum trophic levels reflected the compositional change i e more fish stages the destabilized and stabilized food webs on average had slightly lower proportions of basal species and slightly higher proportions of fishes that occupied marginally higher trophic levels than did the webs whose temporal variability not change before and after fishing fig 4c o the mean trend for the slopes of biomass spectra increased with increasing q indicating that the shapes of biomass pyramids became less bottom heavy as q increased fig 4p the total energy gained by the fishes also increased with q fig 4q these increasing patterns together with increasing patterns of maximum trophic levels suggested that the food webs channeled more energy toward the top of the food chains mostly fishes with increasing q the variation in the energy flow along each link into fishes a proxy for interaction strength increased with q fig 4s and an increasing number of these links became more concentrated at smaller values greater positive skews fig 4r as q increased these indicated that when q was high the food webs contained higher proportions of weaker feeding links on average in the post fishing period food webs contained fewer species and links and experienced changes associated with these compositional changes fig 4 the mean trends of the slopes of biomass spectra increased slightly fig 4p and the skewness and variation of energy fluxes into fishes declined modestly fig 4r s at low to intermediate values of q for the stabilized and destabilized webs hence fishing caused the food webs to have lower proportions of weak interactions and less bottom heavy biomass pyramids at low to intermediate values of q the patterns were very similar for the f o scenario fig s6 4 discussion 4 1 limiting effects of fishing and fie on the temporal variability of complex food webs kuparinen et al 2016 demonstrated that using an empirically parameterized model without external forcing increased temporal variability of fish abundances due to fisheries induced phenotypic changes could remain even after fishing stopped in the current study we examined their result in a large number of food webs with various topologies and observed that phenotypic changes caused by size selective fishing infrequently increased or decreased but predominantly neither the temporal variability of fish biomass dynamics from the pre fishing to the post fishing period the principle of energy flux gellner and mccann 2016 mccann 2012 rip and mccann 2011 can help explain the patterns of temporal variability in fish abundance it predicts that an increase in energy flux to a consumer relative to its loss term relative energy flux makes the population dynamics more temporally variable or less stable and the consumer resource biomass ratio less bottom heavy based on this principle we can expect that in the absence of environmental fluctuations fishing and fie could reduce the variability of fish populations if an increase in the loss term through fishing mortality and elevated metabolism reduce relative energy influx to the consumer likewise we can expect that they could increase variability if energy influx to the consumer increases due to increased metabolic demands or higher resource availability mediated by trophic cascades or compensatory growth of prey finally we can also expect that changes in gain and loss may be insufficient or that greater loss balances out increased gain causing not much net changes in temporal variability our results appear to support the latter possibilities the most in our study the vast majority of food webs had stable biomass dynamics before and after fishing food web theory which encompasses the principle of energy flux that has been developed by mccann and others gellner and mccann 2016 mccann 2012 mccauley et al 2018 nilsson et al 2018 rip and mccann 2011 states that along the gradient of increasing energy flux or decreasing energy loss to a consumer a food web can transition from a non excitable never oscillates to an excitable state possible to oscillate when the largest eigenvalue of the community matrix the jacobian matrix of the dynamical equations eqns 1 3 turns from real to complex before exhibiting sustained oscillations in the stable food webs we observed fishing and fie presumably did not alter the food web structure or dynamics enough to bring them into the parameter region of sustained oscillations borrelli et al 2015 our result does not seem unrealistic as intrinsically oscillating populations either exploited or not appear uncommon in nature kendall et al 1998 shelton and mangel 2011 instead studies have pointed out the importance of environmental fluctuations interacting with nonlinear population dynamics perturbed by harvesting to destabilize the abundances of exploited populations anderson et al 2008 cameron et al 2016 we observed that changes in temporal variabilities of fish biomasses occurred more often in food webs already oscillating prior to fishing and that those webs were more likely to reduce rather than increase temporal variability the oscillating food webs were in excitable states i e the largest eigenvalue of the community matrix was complex where slight shifts along the energy flux gradient due to fishing and fie could alter biomass variability qualitatively or quantitatively the reason for reduced temporal variability could be that it is more likely for fishing and fie to perturb the system to move toward a more stable state by removing energy or pruning less stable modules while it is less likely for perturbations to bring systems upward the instability gradient nonetheless temporal variability increased in some oscillating webs because the systems collapsed or reorganized possibly to channel greater energy up in remaining food chains to isolate the effects of fie from fishing we classified each food web based on its responses to the two treatments f fie and f o fig 3 the result indicated that additional negative effects increased variability or collapse of fie predominated at lower values of q at q 1 2 the food webs were relatively unstable and extra perturbations from fie brought about more temporal variability as q increased the food webs became progressively more stable and fie was equally likely to exacerbate or alleviate the effects of perturbation by fishing rip and mccann 2011 mccann 2012 gellner and mccann 2016 we speculate that when q was low food webs probably had to have high stability conferred by food web structure to persist through the pre fishing period the fraction of persisting webs was smaller when q 1 2 fig 2a and larger fractions of these webs consistently responded to both f fie and f o i e not sensitive to fie fig 3f when q was higher stability conferred by food web structure was probably not as crucial for persistence more discussion regarding q below a higher fraction of the oscillating webs was differentially perturbed by f fie and f o at higher q possibly because of weaker stability inducing network structure and consequently higher sensitivity to perturbations fig 3f 4 2 the effect of q hill exponent of functional responses and the choices of q by previous studies we found that the proportion of destabilized food webs peaked at q 1 2 fig 2b and these webs were predominantly stable in biomass dynamics prior to fishing as described above the stable food webs with q 1 2 seemed to be located along the energy flux gradient closer to the region of sustained oscillation than were those with lower or higher q i e likely to go through the discontinuity in stability when perturbed at q 1 05 probably only webs that were far from the region of sustained oscillation by having stability inducing structure attained stable dynamics at higher q stability conferred by the sigmoidal functional responses likely largely contributed to the stable dynamics oscillating food webs did not show a peak at q 1 2 fig 2d presumably because oscillating webs were already in the excitable state the parameter q determines the shape of functional responses eqn 3 and critically affects the stability and dynamics of consumer resource models including those using the atn approaches brose et al 2006 hunsicker et al 2011 koen alonso and yodzis 2005 williams and martinez 2004a existing empirical data support various values of q from 1 to above 3 rosenbaum and rall 2018 uszko et al 2015 but accurately estimating it using empirical data is challenging uszko et al 2020 among atn modeling studies popular values for q are 1 i e type ii and 1 2 e g bland et al 2019 boit et al 2012 curtsdotter et al 2018 glaum et al 2020b kuparinen et al 2016 quévreux and brose 2018 schneider et al 2012 while no sensitivity analyses were usually provided with respect to this parameter some other studies sampled values from a plausible range between type i and type ii functional responses e g curtsdotter et al 2011 kalinkat et al 2013 schneider et al 2016 but they did not report which values of q prevailed in the persisted simulation runs that were subsequently analyzed previous atn studies appear to have justified q being slightly above 1 to enhance the stability of the models and facilitate complex food web research martinez and others martinez et al 2006 williams and martinez 2004b specifically investigated the effects of q on the persistence of complex food webs and cogently demonstrated that a seemingly modest increase from 1 to 1 2 achieved about a 20 increase in persistence boit et al 2012 presented a successful application of the atn approach to an empirical system lake constance with q 1 2 although their atn model fitted well to high quality empirical data from the lake q was not directly estimated with the data kuparinen et al 2016 adopted the same parameter values from boit et al 2012 and concluded that fisheries induced trait changes in exploited fish populations of lake constance magnified the variability of their abundances based on our results the particular choice of q in kuparinen et al 2016 may have been responsible for the observed increased variability in fish dynamics post hoc analyses of their model showed that destabilization could be observed with q between 1 1 and 1 25 unpublished results furthermore the shapes of functional responses could vary among predator prey pairs smith and smith 2020 but the majority of implementations of atn in literature used a uniform value of q including our study given the large impact of functional responses on predator prey dynamics the generality of conclusions regarding stability and persistence of species in complex food webs from studies that used only one value of q in the absence of reliable estimates without providing sensitivity analysis on the parameter may be limited e g bland et al 2019 glaum et al 2020b hale et al 2020 sentis et al 2021 uncertainty also surrounds other parameters in the atn models given the large number of input parameters it is not feasible to fully explore the sensitivities of the parameters of the atn models the allometric parameters were refined as more data became available since the original formulation by yodzis and innes 1992 brose et al 2006 although our results are subject to the same criticism we focused our investigation on the effects of q on food web stability the key advantage of the atn approach is to anchor the parameterization of the models of complex species interactions on established allometric and other known relationships regarding physiological life history demographic and species interaction traits through a relatively limited number of assumptions brose et al 2006 brown et al 2004 rooney et al 2007 yodzis and innes 1992 the atn models contain parameters for which general allometric relationships are not known or there are no good estimates available these include half saturation constant b 0 predator interference c q and diet preference ω conceptually the atn models are useful as virtual mesocosms of complex food webs and a convenient heuristic tool as in empirical mesocosm studies making inferences to realistic contexts is a challenge rigorous estimation and prudent choices of parameter values and careful though limited sensitivity analyses are warranted 4 3 food web structure and responses to fishing and fie the variations in measured food web metrics were very large fig 4 for f fie fig s6 for f o clearly many more food webs were needed to narrow the ranges but it was computationally prohibitive nonetheless many of the food web metrics steadily increased or decreased in their means with q indicating the parameter s monotonic influence on food web structure and energy flow with increasing q the number of nodes species or fish stages and link density increased and the structure of food webs became more intermediate or invertebrate dominated similarly the total energy gained by fishes increased food chains became longer and the shapes of biomass pyramids became less bottom heavy i e the slopes of biomass spectra became less negative with increasing q despite increased complexity and shifts in food web structure many more food webs persisted to the end of the pre fishing period with the majority exhibiting stable fish biomasses with higher q one explanation could be that increasing proportions of weak interactions in the food webs with increasing q enhanced stability of the food webs as indicated by the skewness and cvs of fish energy gains this was likely realized because of the increased complexity more nodes and links of the food webs and species or fish stages having more interaction links on average higher link density it was not possible to discern differences in structure among food webs that responded differently to the f fie and f o scenarios the mean trends suggested that the food webs that changed temporal variability had proportionally slightly more fishes and contained longer food chains i e higher maximum trophic levels than did the webs whose variability did not change before and after fishing fig 4 it was a straightforward consequence of fishing targeting larger fishes that such food webs were more affected by fishing in the post fishing periods although food webs on average lost weak interactions as indicated by lower skewness and cvs of fish energy gains and showed less bottom heavy biomass pyramids the majority did not change the level of temporal variability before and after fishing this implies that the relationships between food web structure and stability are not robust tang et al 2014 or are very difficult to disentangle with a modest number of replicated food webs 4 4 limitations of the model the changes of life history towards attaining higher metabolic rates and reproductive capacity earlier in life in our model implicitly mimic evolution towards smaller body size a phenomenon that has been observed in multiple exploited fish populations devine et al 2012 mcclenachan 2009 olsen et al 2004 despite this assumption fishes at all stages in our model advanced from stage to stage at the same rate and interacted with the same set of predators and prey as in the pre fishing period our objective was to investigate the generality of the findings by kuparinen et al 2016 in a wider set of food webs so we decided to keep the assumption of an unchanging food web structure despite decreasing fish body sizes rewiring of trophic interactions is an important consideration for food web modeling dealing with fie and climate change audzijonyte et al 2013b however it is difficult to implement changes in food web topology as body size shrinks under the current formulation of the model because trophic relationships in the initial input food web determine body masses as in kuparinen et al 2016 mass specific metabolic rates of fishes were assumed to increase by a small percentage every year during the fishing period to match the assumption of shrinking body size under fie this was based on the inverse relationship between body size and mass specific metabolic rate which has been documented both interspecifically and intraspecifically brown et al 2004 huang et al 2013 jerde et al 2019 killen et al 2010 furthermore auer et al 2018 reported rapid evolution of higher standard metabolic rates smr in response to high predation mortality in adults in trinidadian guppy populations which was argued to be a good model system to inform about fie in exploited populations reznick and ghalambor 2005 in contrast no difference in smr was reported between size selectively and randomly harvested experimental populations of zebra fish danio rerio uusi heikkilä et al 2015 and between early and late maturing genotypes of salmonid species åsheim et al 2021 prokkola et al 2022 in experimental studies feeding rate and activity levels which are known to be positively related to smr cooke et al 2007 declined in response to harvesting treatments pauli et al 2019 walsh et al 2006 bold fast growing and active individuals are found more prone to be fished out leaving less active and shy ones behind arlinghaus et al 2017 biro and post 2008 claireaux et al 2018 redpath et al 2010 on the other hand individuals with higher swimming capacities and stamina may be more capable of escaping certain fishing gear types crespel et al 2021 hollins et al 2018 killen et al 2015 vulnerability to fishing is likely context dependent as growth and food intake rates depend on not only smr but also environmental conditions including temperature and food availability bouffet halle et al 2021 hollins et al 2018 given this uncertainty we decided to retain the original scheme of kuparinen et al 2016 and assumed the inverse intraspecific allometric relationship between body mass and mass specific metabolic rate to simulate fie this implementation resulted in higher rates of metabolic loss and dietary intake in eqn 2 i e x increased these increased loss and gain rates probably balanced out to some extent and may explain partially why most of the food webs did not change temporal variability we used the same rates of increases in metabolic rate and maturation as in kuparinen et al 2016 and similarly assumed that evolution halted after fishing ended but did not reverse during the post fishing period the rates of evolution were assumed to be small table 2a as fitness related traits often show low heritability law 2007 selection imposed by fishing is considered much stronger than is natural selection darimont et al 2009 fugère and hendry 2018 hutchings and fraser 2008 law 2000 and reversals of fie are thought to be slow or difficult allendorf and hard 2009 conover et al 2009 enberg et al 2009 kuparinen and merilä 2007 walsh et al 2006 we simulated the post fishing period for 500 years to merely observe dynamics beyond transients instead of externally imposing trait changes fie can also be modeled more mechanistically through endogenously arising natural selection forestier et al 2020 quantitative genetics methods mcpeek 2017 or adaptive dynamics dieckmann and law 1996 geritz et al 1998 could be used to model trait evolution furthermore as fished populations may potentially coevolve with other species in the community fie could cascade up or down the food chains wood et al 2018 with smaller taxa lower in the chains possibly evolving faster barraclough 2015 hence in our study selection was disconnected from species interactions changes in community dynamics due to fishing did not feedback to evolutionary dynamics and predator prey coevolution was neglected these are important challenges to move the field forward in future fie research it will increase model complexity substantially and obtaining reliable estimates for an increased number of parameters will be difficult our approach requires simpler assumptions and many fewer parameters than such mechanistic models but still can incorporate empirically supported patterns e g harvested fish becoming smaller and hypotheses or predictions from theory e g higher mass specific metabolic rates in smaller organisms it will be informative to compare results from these two approaches in future studies classifying time series into categories stable vs unstable temporal variability changed or not according to cv involved subjective judgement because of numerical errors and continuous distributions of cv or difference between cvs fig s1 s3 we visually assessed a large subset of simulated time series and selected cutoff at 0 05 because it gave the most consistent results to our visual assessments fig s1 s3 it also allocated sufficient food webs to each category because it is not feasible to obtain analytical expression of eigenvalues for the system of eqns 1 3 numerically computing eigenvalues will encounter a similar issue we assumed no interspecific and inter cohort interference competition interference competition can stabilize consumer dynamics in some consumer resource models by reducing energy uptake rate by consumers but at the same time it could decrease energy loss from predation in prey species i e increase in net energy gain to induce oscillation in prey mccann 2012 the strength of interference competition could arise from consumers themselves or from prey behavior in response to increasing consumer densities kondoh 2003 mccann 2000 for which no allometric theory based on body size or predator prey mass ratio has been developed the abovementioned study on lake constance by boit et al 2012 chose reasonable parameter values based on their expert knowledge on the system we initially used the same parameter values as in previous studies bland et al 2019 boit et al 2012 kuparinen et al 2016 but only a very small number of oscillating food webs persisted we decided to retain only intraspecific interference competition coefficients to have a reasonable number of webs with oscillating dynamics consequently our model does not speak to how common intrinsically oscillating food webs might be in nature 5 conclusions our aim was to investigate the generality of the magnifying effect of fishing and fie on food web dynamics in realistic synthetic food webs we found that the majority of the food webs did not change temporal variability in abundance before and after the fishing period in our model although food webs with oscillating fish biomass dynamics were rare those oscillating prior to fishing were more prone to increased as well as decreased temporal variability by fie than those with stable dynamics the frequencies of food webs that changed temporal variability varied across the shape of functional responses q lastly the generality of the conclusions regarding complexity and stability of food webs from studies that use the atn approach without testing the sensitivity to the shape of functional responses could be limited funding this

24268,in 2018 west nile virus wnv was detected for the first time in germany since the first detection 36 human cases and 175 cases in horses and birds are detected the transmission cycle of west nile virus includes birds and mosquitoes and as dead end hosts humans and horses spatial dissemination of the disease is caused by the movements of birds and mosquitoes it should be noted that the vector activity and the spread of wnv are not entirely intertwined but there is a greater scale of overlap between it the dissemination process is rather complicated and it can not only be attributed to different weather driven factors like temperature but also other biological factors i e vector competency habitat suitability etc in our current study we have restricted our modelling effort only to temperature dependent to simplify the modelling assumptions while the activity and movement of mosquitoes are depending mainly on temperature in the birds there is a complex movement pattern caused by local birds and long range dispersal birds to this end we have developed a metapopulation network model to delineate the potential spatial distribution and spread of wnv across germany our model combines vector local birds and long range dispersal birds contact networks we have assumed different distance dispersal kernels models for the vector and avian populations with the intention to include short and long range dispersal the model includes spatial variation of mosquito abundance and the movements to resemble the reality keywords seir network metapopulation wnv spatial data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in august 2018 west nile virus wnv was detected for the first time in germany ziegler et al 2019 genetic characterisation indicated that the german cases are in the same central european subclade as cases found in the czech republic and austria ziegler et al 2019 since the first detection 36 human cases and 175 cases in horses and birds were detected the disease pattern was mainly focussed on the eastern part of germany the disease is maintained by an enzootic transmission cycle between birds and mosquitoes mayo and beckwith 2002 humans and horses can get infected but they will not spread the disease chancey et al 2015 the spread of mosquito borne infectious diseases is a spatio temporal dynamic process that is being affected by multiple agents such as vector and host movements pathogen transmission heterogeneity environmental factors etc vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 white et al 2018 shocket et al 2020 previous studies have revealed that increase in temperature and host vector mobility facilitate the spread of mosquito borne diseases boulinier et al 2016 shapiro et al 2017 according to ziegler et al 2019 the summer of 2018 has provided favourable climatic conditions for the potential geographical spread of zoonotic arthropod borne wnv in germany and possibly it has been introduced by wild birds as they can act as amplifying hosts a previous study on the wnv outbreak in the united states kilpatrick et al 2007 has listed the likely pathways by which wnv has spread as migratory birds dispersal of nonmigratory birds or long range birds movement of mosquitoes by flight or wind and human transport of mosquitoes birds or other animals while rappole et al 2000 and reed et al 2003 state out that migratory or the long range dispersal birds may play the significant role as a spreader to new regions along their major flyways across the globe kilpatrick et al 2007 concludes that despite the fact that many studies have carried out there is still no evidence for this hypothesis in general there are two migrating seasons for the long dispersal birds spring and autumn newton 2010 in the spring migration season birds are migrating from the south northwards to germany for breeding once the birds arrive in germany they breed and stay for summer in the same local area in autumn they leave germany and migrate into the south on their way from the south they might get infected and introduce the virus into germany while they are in germany the temperature might be suitable for disease transmission mordecai et al 2019 rohr 2020 shocket et al 2020 on the other hand in autumn birds migrating from the north and east to overwinter in germany these birds play a minor or no role in wnv transmission as temperature in winter is not suitable for transmission another potential route of introduction are local birds or vectors mayo and beckwith 2002 spreading the virus on a local area in 2017 the authors rudolf et al 2017 have reported that they detect wnv positive vectors in the czech republic other cases were found in hungary and austria zana et al 2020 čabanová et al 2019 de heus et al 2020 other studies daversa et al 2017 tatem et al 2006 have included the importance of host movement to analyse the infection transmission through spatial host networks in the heterogeneous environment in sumner et al 2017 the authors quantify the importance of movement of livestock and the dispersal of vector in the disease transmission after the first introduction of wnv to birds and equines in germany the cases of wnv have increased in the following season ziegler et al 2020 an activity of wnv was detected in the eastern part to the northern zone of germany the combination of phylogenetic analysis and the wide distribution of wnv in germany from north to the south reveals that wnv may have been introduced to germany from czech republic already before 2018 ziegler et al 2019 these findings demonstrate that there is a further risk of potential spatial transmission of wnv in germany possibly with some additional cases in the mammals and in the birds in our current work we are interested in the description of the spatial spread of wnv in germany under the effect of host bird and vector mosquito movements including seasonality given the convoluted nature of the spread of wnv and other associated factors we have simplified our modelling assumptions to build a simple mechanistic framework flexible enough to accommodate further information while accounting only the temperature dependence once wnv is introduced into germany the main actors in the local and spatial transmission are local birds and vectors in this study we assume that migratory or the long distance dispersal birds that settle down for breeding will have a similar behaviour as local birds geographical and population movements are essential in the context of spatial transmission there are several approaches to model the spatial transmission of geographical and population movements partial differential equations pde maidana and yang 2009 tarboush et al 2017 wang et al 2019a are one choice for that however while modelling the geo spatial dissemination of disease usually there is a separation between the diffusion and the dispersal models that are being made in diffusion models the transmission occurs immediately to the neighbouring zones but in a patchy environment this kind of modelling assumptions are not preferable the authors in kenkre et al 2005 described a general approach how to model the spatial transmission of wnv by a diffusion model moreover given the extent of spatial spread of wnv across germany possibly due to the migratory or long range dispersal birds distance based dispersal models seem to be more applicable while accounting for the dispersal model metapopulation models are a valuable approach for such purposes in bichara and castillo chavez 2016 and colizza and vespignani 2008 the authors investigate the impact of the host dispersal amongst the multiple patches in the disease dynamics spatio temporal features in the progress of infectious agents of different hosts are in included in arino and driessche 2006 and arino 2009 using metapopulation models in arino et al 2012 and arino 2017 the authors deal with the multi species epidemic models on n patches with migration what can potentially be employed in the vector hosts model most wnv spread models are mathematical deterministic compartmental models durand et al 2010 wang et al 2019b bowman et al 2005 however these models are usually developed at a local scale that do not necessarily include the global information about the different components such as mobility patterns of the hosts or vector temperature or landscape types in a previous study we have developed a mathematical model bhowmick et al 2020 that analyses the local spread of different regions in germany in this study we extend this model to a metapopulation network associated model in contrast to the results of our previous model bhowmick et al 2020 where the most suitable region for the establishment of the disease is in the south west the real cases in germany are mainly observed in the east the model proposed here helps us to understand the wnv spatial transmission in germany and to understand the key factors of spatio temporal transmission of wnv hence we systematically examine the relevance of the variables in our model our current endeavour is similar in spirit to other several models moon et al 2019 durand et al 2010 laperrière et al 2016 that also include spatial information 2 model formulation using our local model as a basis bhowmick et al 2020 we have constructed a metapopulation model the principle functionality of a metapopulation model is shown in fig 1 our model system comprises of a heterogeneous network of subpopulations or patches that are connected by migration each subpopulation represents the population of vectors and hosts in the habitat patch the respective migrations of individuals from one subpopulation to another subpopulation is governed by the migration paths of connections among the subpopulations individuals can migrate from a subpopulation to another on the network of connections among subpopulations transmission within each patch is modelled by a vector host compartment model ordinary differential equations ode are employed to model the local transmission and the transmission due to the migration amongst the adjoining habitat sites as well the population dynamics 2 1 migration model the movement rate from a patch j to another patch i is denoted by r i j assuming q i is the population in patch i then the dynamics associated with q i t is given by 1 for i 1 n 1 d q i d t π q i μ q i q i j i n r i j q j j i n r j i q i where π q i represents recruitment in the population q i and μ q i is the death rate at the patch i 1 can be expressed in a more compact form as 2 where q q 1 q 2 q n π q π q 1 π q 2 π q n μ q μ q 1 μ q 2 μ q n and r is the movement matrix and the elements of r are defined as r i j r i j for i j and r i i j 1 n r j i 2 2 epidemiological models for local birds and mosquitoes in fig 1 we can readily observe that it is utterly important to include the movements of interacting species as the migration of the sick individuals from one habitat patch to another habitat patch can trigger the spread of an epidemic in our previous effort bhowmick et al 2020 our model was a locally temperature driven shocket et al 2020 ode based model and did not have spatial aspects but in our present work we have coupled the geo spatial nature of wnv spread with our ode based model combining the local epidemiological model bhowmick et al 2020 and the metapopulation model leads to 3 representing a model for the mosquitoes with m i j as the rate of migration movement between two arbitrary patches j and i it is assumed

have incorporated the seasonally activated long range dispersal birds network for more details see section 3 2 2 after following the authors in lentz et al 2012 the matrix form of the equations associated with the long range dispersal birds is included in the supplementary information detailed descriptions and the values of the model parameters can be found in our previous work in bhowmick et al 2020 3 detailed description of mobility and migration in the last section we showed an ode model for wnv disease spread between patches without giving any details about the coupling matrices m and p in this section we describe the mobility networks of mosquitoes and birds 3 1 vector mobility network the importance of vector movement in the spread of wnv is ambiguous authors in maidana and yang 2009 conclude that mosquito movements do not play an important role but the authors in gubler 2007 styer et al 2007 vogels et al 2017 and hamer et al 2014 mention that opportunistic bites facilitate the escalation of wnv transmission therefore it is important to consider the mosquito movements information on exact mobility pathways for mosquitoes is scarce verdonschot and besse lototskaya 2014 estimated the flight range of culex pipiens average maximum distance is 9695 m minimum of maximum distance is 350 m and maximum of maximum distance 22 530 m respectively given their dispersal capacity it is realistic to estimate the daily movement of the mosquitoes let the distance between two patches i and j be d i j the dispersal probability is a function of decreasing distance where we follow moulay and pigné 2013 a network with such a dispersal kernel is calculated as described in algorithm 1 in fig 2 we show an example of a randomly generated mosquito network and according to algorithm 1 if d i j is greater than d m a x no links are being created 3 2 host mobility model apparently bird movements might spread the disease within the home range of birds the home range of birds depends on the required habitat as well as feed supply and bird density beal 2018 butler et al 2018 cohen and todd 2018 as the home ranges differ amongst species and depend on habitat suitability it is difficult to define a single home range for the host mobility model hence we include two movement patterns one to cover small home ranges of breeding birds with a maximal dispersal ranges from 1500 to 2164 m and minimal dispersal ranges from 80 to 170 m garcía and borda de água 2017 we term it as local bird dispersal second in order to cover large home ranges with a maximum flight distance of 500 km we follow moon et al 2019 and call it as long range dispersal we mention that once the migratory birds are present in germany during the period of migration they behave like local birds with the inclusion of long range movements bhowmick et al 2020 in their flyways around germany therefore the movements of the long range and migratory birds are used synonymously in our work 3 2 1 local bird mobility model given the above mentioned reasons we decided to follow the seed dispersal model da silveira et al 2016 levey et al 2008a báños villalba et al 2017 for the local bird dispersal mobility model that is we use the seed dispersal as a proxy for the movement network of the birds the dispersal probability follows a weibull distribution carlo and morales 2008 nathan et al 2008 calviño cancela et al 2006 type in fig 3 we show an example for the local bird flight range to construct the movement matrix p of the local birds we have made use of a similar routine to the way we have constructed the mosquito movement network m in algorithm 1 the algorithm is similar except for the used distribution and is included in the supplementary information an example of such generated local bird networks is shown in fig 4 shape and the scale parameters are taken from garcía and borda de água 2017 rogers et al 2019 and levey et al 2008b and the values for the shape and scale parameters are 2 83 and 1 0 respectively 3 2 2 long range dispersal bird mobility model power law dispersal kernel information for large home ranges in birds are scarce hence we follow the approach of newman 2005 moon et al 2019 and meyer and held 2014 using a power law distribution to model incidental long range disease transmission routes we have constructed a movement matrix n of the long range dispersal birds using the similar routine as we have done for the mosquito movement network and the local bird movement network as mentioned in algorithm 1 the corresponding algorithm to generate the movement matrices for the long range dispersal birds is included in the supplementary information the value of the power law parameter has been taken from moon et al 2019 with the value 3 3844 time events of dispersal it is important to stress that the seasonal appearance and disappearance of the migratory or long dispersal birds is of utter importance for the potential introduction and thereafter sustaining the wnv transmission in the local bird population hence the in fact spatially continuous trajectories should be adjusted to incorporate the seasonal movements and the jumps in our metapopulation network model our main motive is to accommodate the seasonally driven long range dispersal of birds as a series of movement matrices amongst different habitat patches these habitat patches are nodes of the movement network of long range dispersal birds to construct the movement matrices we follow the functional form of transition probabilities devised in kölzsch et al 2018 and kölzsch and blasius 2008 it describes the seasonal movements of long range dispersal of the birds according to the authors in kölzsch and blasius 2008 the generalised von mises distribution function defining the dispersal is the following 7 t i j f s i j ψ i j δ i j t where s i j represents the maximum hopping magnitude ψ i j represents the mean season when hopping occurs δ i j depicts the span of the time interval during which hopping takes place after following the simplification performed in kölzsch and blasius 2008 we have assumed the form of probability distribution connecting patches to be 8 t i j s i j exp cos t ψ i j 1 δ 2 fig 5 depicts the kernel accommodating the seasonal movements of the long range dispersal birds and the parameters are taken from kölzsch and blasius 2008 the associated algorithm and an example of a network generated through 8 are included in the supplementary information 4 basic reproduction number 4 1 basic reproduction number r 0 of the patchy model to compute the basic reproduction number we use the next generation method van den driessche and watmough 2002 using the notation used in van den driessche and watmough 2002 we can decompose the model system 3 and 4 as f i v i f i and v i represent the flow of new infections and the remaining transfers within and out of the infected classes respectively for the simplicity of our matrix calculation we have considered the subclinical case as γ 3 i 0 will give the clinical case f bsc i v bsc i f bsc i are given in box i let f bsc f bsc s 0 0 and v bsc v bsc s 0 0 be the jacobian matrices evaluated at the disease free equilibrium s 0 0 detailed calculation of disease free equilibrium point is included in the supplementary information following van den driessche and watmough 2002 the matrix ngm bsc f bsc v bsc 1 is the next generation matrix for the subclinical birds a number of elements of the jacobians vanish i e μ i e m i μ i i m i μ i e b s c i λ i e m i λ i e b s c i

matrix ngm bc associated with the clinical birds is f bc v bc 1 after including clinical and subclinical birds in different patches the next generation matrix ngm of the system eqs 3 and 4 is following ngm ngm bc ngm bsc the basic reproduction number is 9 r 0 ρ ngm where ρ is the spectral radius of the matrix ngm according to van den driessche and watmough 2002 the local stability of the disease free equilibrium e 0 s 0 0 is governed by r 0 if r 0 1 then e 0 is asymptotically unstable and unstable whenever r 0 1 5 simulation results 5 1 two patch model given the complexity of the model 3 and 4 it is rather difficult to quantify the impact of host vector movements and the spread of wnv analytically with expression 9 it is rather laborious to measure how the movements of the interacting species can lead to the spread of wnv even for a two patch model the relationship amongst the parameters is not trivial given the mathematical form of r 0 in order to understand the importance of the movements of the interacting host vector population we consider a two patch model and perform simulations on this model 5 1 1 impact of mosquito mobility most of the literature in the area of vector borne disease modelling centres around the movement on long distance travelling of the host species only in those models we can overlook the vector mobility but in our current effort we include the small scale flights of the vectors of wnv the influence of the vectorial capacity and the movements of the mosquitoes are important features to the potential spread and hence sustaining wnv moulay and pigné 2013 ciota and kramer 2013 therefore we conceive that the daily mobility and the short journeys carried by the vector species cannot be ignored it is of our interest to acknowledge that smaller temporal scale of wnv transmission can potentially include the new aspects in the spread of wnv in germany for now we consider only the subclinical birds and examine the influence of the mosquito movements we simulate the situation when an infected local subclinical bird is introduced to a completely susceptible population with different flight range movements of the mosquitoes we consider two cases for the simulations one with the inclusion of local mosquito mobility and another one without mosquito migration in both cases we keep the subclinical birds movement enabled the importance of local mosquito interactions is visible in fig 6 it shows the number of subclinical infected birds versus time i b s c 1 stands for the infected subclinical birds in patch number 1 and i b s c n 1 stands for the subclinical birds in the patch number 1 but without mosquito movements it is interesting to observe that in the scenario when we do not include the mosquito movements the infection spreading process takes longer and the peak is relatively flat whereas when we include the mosquito mobility the infection spreads quicker than previously considered and the peak is sharp and concentrated with subclinical birds for experimental purpose we change the maximum flight ranges of mosquitoes and the influence of the mosquito movements are clearly visible in figs 6 a and 6 b higher range of mosquito movements facilitate the potential transmission of wnv in the local birds population the shape of the epidemiology of wnv spread in germany is potentially governed by the movements of the interacting species especially the birds as a prime host it is widely accepted that the movements of the birds is likely to facilitate the dissemination of wnv in germany ziegler et al 2020 2019 in the following sections we explore the influence of the birds both local and long dispersal birds movements on the potential spatial spread of wnv in germany 5 1 2 impact of local bird movement in this section we explore the influence of the local bird movements on the basic reproduction number of the patchy model system 3 and 4 to keep our findings simple we just consider a two patch model consisting of only subclinical birds and the corresponding basic reproduction number r 0 given in 9 the analytical and the symbolic computations related to the clinical and subclinical birds are the same given the complex and the long expression of r 0 included in the supplementary information even for the two patch model it is rather difficult to quantify theoretically the impact of the local bird migration in r 0 and in the dissemination of wnv from one habitat patch to another we thus perform simulations under different conditions to understand the dynamics after following ruan 2017 to test the influence on local bird movements we run the model for two patches using the following parameters m b 1 m b 2 0 016 γ b s c 1 γ b s c 2 0 567 α 3 1 α 3 2 0 182 k m 1 k m 2 1000 k b 1 k b 2 100 c 1 1 c 1 2 0 18 d i b s c 1 d i b s c 2 0 5 m m 1 m m 2 0 4141 only the transmission parameters are different for the subclinical birds for the second patch it is 0 88 and for the first patch it is 0 78 mosquito migration rates are kept the same for both the patches as 0 9 the basic reproduction number r 0 1 of patch 1 is less than 1 and for the patch 2 it is r 0 2 greater than 1 i e r 0 1 0 87 and r 0 2 1 09 here we carry out the simulations to investigate the impact of the local bird migrations on the basic reproduction number for this purpose we keep all the parameters same except for the transmission parameters from the mosquitoes to the clinical birds for the two patch model from the magnitude of the basic reproduction number it is clear that wnv is endemic in the patch 2 and in the patch 1 it will die out first we let p 21 0 91 and let p 12 to vary then we keep p 12 0 9 and vary p 21 to observe the influence of the clinical birds on the magnitude of the basic reproduction number from fig 7 a it is evident that with the increase of migration from the patch 2 to the patch 1 the basic reproduction number reduces whereas we can witness the opposite of this phenomenon in fig 7 b where with the increase of p 21 yields the increase in the basic reproduction number of the two patch model these simulations possibly give us a glimpse of the complexity of the potential spread of wnv from one endemic patch to another one the immigration of the birds can trigger a series of such expansion of wnv and this kind of complexities cannot be explained through a local only model bhowmick et al 2020 we also have explored impact of long distance bird movements in the dissemination of wnv in germany and spatially projected over the map of germany the authors in liu et al 2006 state that the dispersal of long range birds actually establish the spatial spread of wnv it is plausible that the acquisition of wnv can happen during dispersal of long range birds reed et al 2003 in our simulations we include the movements of the local birds and mosquitoes but discard the movements of the long range dispersal birds our initial findings show the importance of the movements of long range dispersal birds in introducing and sustaining the bites of wnv in the new places the results are included in the supplementary information 5 1 3 vector control one of the main applications of models for the potential spread of wnv among the birds is to design of possible control strategies and create buffer zones to prevent or minimise the spread of wnv for the demonstration purpose we consider only the movement between two patches of the clinical birds as to analyse the similar computation with n patches are complex enough to pursue mosquito movement is also considered we follow lewis et al 2019 to assess different control strategies mathematically consider the model system 3 and 4 and we take account of the clinical birds and their movements between two patches only the next generation matrix for the clinical birds turns out to be of the following form ngm bc 0 0 a 1 a 2 0 0 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 0 0 a 7 a 8 0 0 the explicit mathematical forms of a i i 1 8 are included in the supplementary information the matrix ngm bc can be readily put into block matrix form as follows ngm bc 0 a 1 a 2 0 where a 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 2 a 5 a 6 a 7 a 8 then according to lewis et al 2019 theorem 8 1 targeting either the vector or the host population to control wnv should be an effective strategy while counting on the cost of corresponding one group target strategies according to lewis et al 2019 it is better to apply all available resources to target one population only in order to lessen the burden of wnv the mosquito population needs to be reduced below a certain threshold in our case mosquito control is only option to explore according to lewis et al 2019 the type reproduction number t m to control the mosquito population is given by t m a 1 a 2 1 p 1 where p 1 is the fraction of the vector population to be controlled therefore more than the 1 1 t m fraction of mosquitoes should be targeted to eradicate the impact of wnv in case of two patch populations using the parameters described in section 5 1 2 more than 56 of the mosquito population should be reduced to potentially stop the spatial transmission of wnv in the two patch population model 6 spatial spread in germany the study area comprised of 11 054 german municipalities which are the nodes in our network we use the model 5 and 6 and the equations associated with the movement of birds included in the supplementary information to apprehend the wnv transmission in the local bird populations in each municipality birds are grouped according to their health status as depicted in fig 1 we explicitly consider the vector population and the mobility we do not have the population distribution of birds across the different municipalities level so we have assumed uniform number of local birds as in bhowmick et al 2020 at first we keep all the local birds initially susceptible in all the municipalities we introduce i inf 1 number of infected long range dispersal bird in selected municipalities for the first season of the simulation the infection is seeded in the city halle as the first case of wnv was reported in that ziegler et al 2019 between municipalities movements of vectors and the hosts take place on three different contact networks i the vector network representing the mosquitos ii the local birds network and iii the long distance movement birds network representing sporadic movements of birds ranging distances between 0 and 500 km pathways the nodes are the centroid of municipalities and the links amongst them are formed after employing algorithms to generate the movement matrices for the three distinct networks in fig 8 we depict a long range dispersal birds pathway being constructed through the power law distance based kernel in the simulation we take note of the source of infection of each newly infected municipality municipalities that are previously free of wnv might be infected through different networks of concern simulated infection spread data provides a spatial projection on the map of germany we present in fig 9 results on the temporal and spatial evolution of the disease dynamics compared with real outbreak data here we compute the cumulative number of infected birds within each region assuming that the disease propagates from the seeding zone to the other places through the combinations of the different spatial dispersal networks in fig 9 b we show the spatial distribution of potential wnv cases while including the probable spatial spread of wnv in germany and in fig 9 a cumulative reported cases of wnv in the year 2018 according to the counting per municipalities we perform the same for the second year by the end of the wnv season 1 apparently the spatial spread of wnv infection is mostly confined within the eastern zone of germany with some spontaneous cases in the north and in the southern zones fig 9 d represents the simulated possible spatial spread of wnv in germany and in fig 9 a cumulative reported cases of wnv in the year 2019 according to the counting per municipalities are presented to generate the choropleth maps we have utilised the r package cartography giraud and lambert 2017 compared to the observed outbreak regions the affected regions in the outbreak model are very similar in 2018 figs 9 a and 9 b nevertheless the affected region in the model is larger than in the observed data in 2019 the model shows several long distance spread that have not been observed compare figs 9 c and 9 d the spatial spread aligns with the theoretical predictions and possibly highlight the close relationship between the spatial spread of wnv into the newer zones and the flyways of long range dispersal birds even though the newly infected zones are relatively far geographically to characterise the difference between the predictive ability of our deterministic metapopulation network model and the reported cases of wnv in germany for two seasons we adhere to calculate the structural similarity index ssim massaro et al 2019 wang et al 2004 wang and bovik 2009 we use this method to compare and quantify the spatial prediction of the simulations generated from our model with the reported cases it is a method primarily used to measure the similarity between two images but potentially can also be relevant to compare the structural properties of two dimensional data i e the spatial distribution of wnv cases in our modelling framework the ssim index can be regarded as a metric to measure the difference between two images with the condition that one of them is assumed to be perfect in our case the perfect image is the spatial distribution of the reported cases of wnv it is to be noted that when we have performed our simulations we have only the sparse geo spatial reports of two years of wnv cases in germany this have not helped us to construct necessary means like likelihood function etc we demonstrate the distributions of ssim values as boxplots and density plots for each season in fig 10 it can also demonstrate the perceived error or similarities between the outputs from the simulations and the reported cases of wnv in germany we show the distribution of the ssim s for 100 simulation runs for both seasons in fig 10 for more information please see the supplementary information we conclude that in the initial phase of wnv spread in germany the model performs well while approximating the observed spatial dissemination in the following season however the performance of the model is slightly better compared to the results from the previous season in the backdrop of reported cases visual representations of the spatial r 0 vs cumulative number of infected birds per municipalities are included in the supplementary information 7 discussion and conclusion in this work we endeavour a deterministic metapopulation network model of wnv transmission in germany we put an effort to analyse the transmission of wnv and employ different contact networks to investigate the wnv transmission to disease free zones the contact networks incorporate different types of vector and host movements local bird movements in their habitat patch long distance movements of birds and vector movements after the first case of wnv detected in germany in 2018 ziegler et al 2019 favourable weather conditions facilitated its possible spread to other regions of the country following rather sporadic cases of wnv in the next season extraordinary high temperatures have allowed to decrease the extrinsic incubation period eip and consequently the cases of wnv increased multifold across germany ziegler et al 2020 to procure the spatial prediction of wnv circulation across germany we compare the spatial dissemination of wnv after including and afterwards ruling out the potential role of the long range dispersal bird s role it should be noted that in the first season of wnv spread in germany the spatial transmission of wnv is well caught in a qualitative manner and in the next season a similar result was achieved after the inclusion of long range dispersal birds one possible reason could be attributed to the fact that the reported cases of wnv rely solely on the reporting and there might be reporting bias which might have hindered into the quantitative similarities of the reported cases and the simulated cases of wnv in germany several previous models daversa et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b a include network approaches to analyse the role of birds and vectors in spatial disease transmission in contrast to daversa et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b and zhang et al 2018a we have included both vector and host networks in contrast to these studies our results indicate that the role of vectors in the spatial spread of wnv cannot be neglected even if information on vector movement is scarce and uncertainty is high when reducing the vector population by 57 wnv dissemination can be controlled according to our two patch model therefore hypothetically one of the measure to consider to lower the wnv spread is to control the vector population around the infected places preceding spatial models tried to investigate the dissemination of wnv utilising travelling wave solutions with constant velocity maidana and yang 2009 lewis et al 2006 chen et al 2016 however from the work of ziegler et al 2019 and ziegler et al 2020 it is evident that the transmission of wnv follows a pattern governed by spatial jumps similar findings have been mentioned in moon et al 2019 and chen et al 2016 about the features of the transmission of wnv in the usa according to such models the reach of wnv dissemination should have been lesser compared to what we have noted in recent years the potential reason could be attributed to the fact that such models cannot incorporate the spontaneous long distance movements of birds what are equally responsible to introduce the potential pathogens of wnv into the new areas we surmise that long range dispersal birds movement network governed by a power law model can potentially explain such phenomenon as we have shown in our current endeavour keeping this in our mind we can clearly observe the salient differences of the outcomes in our present work compared to what have found in our previous work bhowmick et al 2020 in our previous effort we did not have any prior knowledge about the reported cases of wnv in germany and the possible nature of the movements of the hosts vectors species to consider into our previously developed model in our present work we have the information of first reported cases of wnv in germany and we are able to incorporate into current metapopulation network model this leaves us with a flexible geo spatial modelling framework and this aspect was absent into our previous work bhowmick et al 2020 to our knowledge the potential role of long range dispersal birds introducing wnv to the completely susceptible local bird population with the coupling of population dynamics with the host vector mobility in germany is not explored in other modelling studies a considerable number of investigations on the spatial outbreaks of wnv have been performed the epidemic threshold condition for our model is mathematically similar with the with findings of arino et al 2012 although in our work we have taken account of vector movement our findings about the effectualness of the host vector dispersal is similar to that in laperrière et al 2016 the results from our mathematical model can theoretically mirror the fact that long range dispersal birds act as a discerning factor to introduce and transport wnv into new zones in germany as mentioned in ziegler et al 2019 2020 we opine that the power law algorithm 3 2 2 we have used to generate the long range dispersal bird pathways in germany sometimes has overvalued the potential cases of wnv as the algorithm constructs long distance fly pathways as depicted in fig 9 and similar issues are mentioned in moon et al 2019 after employing a more realistic data driven dispersal function as developed in kölzsch and blasius 2008 and kölzsch et al 2018 we notice that it can improve the current endeavour while generating long range dispersal networks knowledge about the factors like the density and the population distributions of the local bird populations their habitat types flying pathways will bring finer resolutions to the simulations results and the possible further incorporations of different environmental parameters will yield better knowledge of the spread of wnv in germany it is worth mentioning that there are two major differences between our model and the reality first the observed data rely on dead birds found in the environment or in husbandry and therefore there might be a reporting bias what is not known precisely the model predictions shows the total number of infected birds secondly the direction of the spatial spread in our model is not weighted in contrast to the reality where birds fly to the feeding places additionally we would like to emphasise that many unknown factors e g long distance flyway directions could not be taken into consideration from the literatures paz 2015 shocket et al 2020 rohr 2020 it is evident that the influence of temperature precipitation wind speed and direction relative humidity etc all are important factors to be considered while modelling the spread of wnv the interplay between the mosquito activity and the spread of wnv are not entirely correlated rather there is an overlap in the mean of temperature to reduce the complexity arising from the nature of dissemination of wnv through mosquito activity we have opted not to consider different factors like habitat suitability vector competency different meteorological factors except temperature species variability etc in our mathematical model the parameters are temperature dependent laperrière et al 2016 paz 2015 as our primary goal is to construct a modelling framework that can predict the spatial spread of wnv in germany we suggest that this modelling assumption needs further investigation however as we observe that our deterministic metapopulation network modelling approach allows to evaluate the potential role of long range dispersal birds dispersal in the spatial spread of wnv in germany in order to implement control strategies for the containment it is essential to comprehend the potential eco epidemiological parameters and the disease mechanisms that yield to the potential spatial spread of wnv despite the limitations of our current effort on modelling the spatial spread of wnv quantitatively qualitatively we are able to produce the path of infection the projected wnv cases are similar to the observed reported cases except for some zones in the southern and the eastern zones finally our modelling endeavour can be useful to project the potential cases of wnv in the future and the output from our model could be useful to examine strategies required to mitigate the spread of wnv in germany we would also like to include that given the inherent flexibility of our compartment based model it can accommodate multiple hosts different meteorological factors and the simple metapopulation network formulations of our locally ode based model can produce geo spatial spread of wnv and other mosquito borne disease in other countries too under the concept of one health unified surveillance of wnv cases and monitoring the interacting species populations can provide us the foundation for effective precaution and control of wnv and any other mosquito borne disease in different countries credit authorship contribution statement suman bhowmick designed the study developed the model

24268,in 2018 west nile virus wnv was detected for the first time in germany since the first detection 36 human cases and 175 cases in horses and birds are detected the transmission cycle of west nile virus includes birds and mosquitoes and as dead end hosts humans and horses spatial dissemination of the disease is caused by the movements of birds and mosquitoes it should be noted that the vector activity and the spread of wnv are not entirely intertwined but there is a greater scale of overlap between it the dissemination process is rather complicated and it can not only be attributed to different weather driven factors like temperature but also other biological factors i e vector competency habitat suitability etc in our current study we have restricted our modelling effort only to temperature dependent to simplify the modelling assumptions while the activity and movement of mosquitoes are depending mainly on temperature in the birds there is a complex movement pattern caused by local birds and long range dispersal birds to this end we have developed a metapopulation network model to delineate the potential spatial distribution and spread of wnv across germany our model combines vector local birds and long range dispersal birds contact networks we have assumed different distance dispersal kernels models for the vector and avian populations with the intention to include short and long range dispersal the model includes spatial variation of mosquito abundance and the movements to resemble the reality keywords seir network metapopulation wnv spatial data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in august 2018 west nile virus wnv was detected for the first time in germany ziegler et al 2019 genetic characterisation indicated that the german cases are in the same central european subclade as cases found in the czech republic and austria ziegler et al 2019 since the first detection 36 human cases and 175 cases in horses and birds were detected the disease pattern was mainly focussed on the eastern part of germany the disease is maintained by an enzootic transmission cycle between birds and mosquitoes mayo and beckwith 2002 humans and horses can get infected but they will not spread the disease chancey et al 2015 the spread of mosquito borne infectious diseases is a spatio temporal dynamic process that is being affected by multiple agents such as vector and host movements pathogen transmission heterogeneity environmental factors etc vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 white et al 2018 shocket et al 2020 previous studies have revealed that increase in temperature and host vector mobility facilitate the spread of mosquito borne diseases boulinier et al 2016 shapiro et al 2017 according to ziegler et al 2019 the summer of 2018 has provided favourable climatic conditions for the potential geographical spread of zoonotic arthropod borne wnv in germany and possibly it has been introduced by wild birds as they can act as amplifying hosts a previous study on the wnv outbreak in the united states kilpatrick et al 2007 has listed the likely pathways by which wnv has spread as migratory birds dispersal of nonmigratory birds or long range birds movement of mosquitoes by flight or wind and human transport of mosquitoes birds or other animals while rappole et al 2000 and reed et al 2003 state out that migratory or the long range dispersal birds may play the significant role as a spreader to new regions along their major flyways across the globe kilpatrick et al 2007 concludes that despite the fact that many studies have carried out there is still no evidence for this hypothesis in general there are two migrating seasons for the long dispersal birds spring and autumn newton 2010 in the spring migration season birds are migrating from the south northwards to germany for breeding once the birds arrive in germany they breed and stay for summer in the same local area in autumn they leave germany and migrate into the south on their way from the south they might get infected and introduce the virus into germany while they are in germany the temperature might be suitable for disease transmission mordecai et al 2019 rohr 2020 shocket et al 2020 on the other hand in autumn birds migrating from the north and east to overwinter in germany these birds play a minor or no role in wnv transmission as temperature in winter is not suitable for transmission another potential route of introduction are local birds or vectors mayo and beckwith 2002 spreading the virus on a local area in 2017 the authors rudolf et al 2017 have reported that they detect wnv positive vectors in the czech republic other cases were found in hungary and austria zana et al 2020 čabanová et al 2019 de heus et al 2020 other studies daversa et al 2017 tatem et al 2006 have included the importance of host movement to analyse the infection transmission through spatial host networks in the heterogeneous environment in sumner et al 2017 the authors quantify the importance of movement of livestock and the dispersal of vector in the disease transmission after the first introduction of wnv to birds and equines in germany the cases of wnv have increased in the following season ziegler et al 2020 an activity of wnv was detected in the eastern part to the northern zone of germany the combination of phylogenetic analysis and the wide distribution of wnv in germany from north to the south reveals that wnv may have been introduced to germany from czech republic already before 2018 ziegler et al 2019 these findings demonstrate that there is a further risk of potential spatial transmission of wnv in germany possibly with some additional cases in the mammals and in the birds in our current work we are interested in the description of the spatial spread of wnv in germany under the effect of host bird and vector mosquito movements including seasonality given the convoluted nature of the spread of wnv and other associated factors we have simplified our modelling assumptions to build a simple mechanistic framework flexible enough to accommodate further information while accounting only the temperature dependence once wnv is introduced into germany the main actors in the local and spatial transmission are local birds and vectors in this study we assume that migratory or the long distance dispersal birds that settle down for breeding will have a similar behaviour as local birds geographical and population movements are essential in the context of spatial transmission there are several approaches to model the spatial transmission of geographical and population movements partial differential equations pde maidana and yang 2009 tarboush et al 2017 wang et al 2019a are one choice for that however while modelling the geo spatial dissemination of disease usually there is a separation between the diffusion and the dispersal models that are being made in diffusion models the transmission occurs immediately to the neighbouring zones but in a patchy environment this kind of modelling assumptions are not preferable the authors in kenkre et al 2005 described a general approach how to model the spatial transmission of wnv by a diffusion model moreover given the extent of spatial spread of wnv across germany possibly due to the migratory or long range dispersal birds distance based dispersal models seem to be more applicable while accounting for the dispersal model metapopulation models are a valuable approach for such purposes in bichara and castillo chavez 2016 and colizza and vespignani 2008 the authors investigate the impact of the host dispersal amongst the multiple patches in the disease dynamics spatio temporal features in the progress of infectious agents of different hosts are in included in arino and driessche 2006 and arino 2009 using metapopulation models in arino et al 2012 and arino 2017 the authors deal with the multi species epidemic models on n patches with migration what can potentially be employed in the vector hosts model most wnv spread models are mathematical deterministic compartmental models durand et al 2010 wang et al 2019b bowman et al 2005 however these models are usually developed at a local scale that do not necessarily include the global information about the different components such as mobility patterns of the hosts or vector temperature or landscape types in a previous study we have developed a mathematical model bhowmick et al 2020 that analyses the local spread of different regions in germany in this study we extend this model to a metapopulation network associated model in contrast to the results of our previous model bhowmick et al 2020 where the most suitable region for the establishment of the disease is in the south west the real cases in germany are mainly observed in the east the model proposed here helps us to understand the wnv spatial transmission in germany and to understand the key factors of spatio temporal transmission of wnv hence we systematically examine the relevance of the variables in our model our current endeavour is similar in spirit to other several models moon et al 2019 durand et al 2010 laperrière et al 2016 that also include spatial information 2 model formulation using our local model as a basis bhowmick et al 2020 we have constructed a metapopulation model the principle functionality of a metapopulation model is shown in fig 1 our model system comprises of a heterogeneous network of subpopulations or patches that are connected by migration each subpopulation represents the population of vectors and hosts in the habitat patch the respective migrations of individuals from one subpopulation to another subpopulation is governed by the migration paths of connections among the subpopulations individuals can migrate from a subpopulation to another on the network of connections among subpopulations transmission within each patch is modelled by a vector host compartment model ordinary differential equations ode are employed to model the local transmission and the transmission due to the migration amongst the adjoining habitat sites as well the population dynamics 2 1 migration model the movement rate from a patch j to another patch i is denoted by r i j assuming q i is the population in patch i then the dynamics associated with q i t is given by 1 for i 1 n 1 d q i d t π q i μ q i q i j i n r i j q j j i n r j i q i where π q i represents recruitment in the population q i and μ q i is the death rate at the patch i 1 can be expressed in a more compact form as 2 where q q 1 q 2 q n π q π q 1 π q 2 π q n μ q μ q 1 μ q 2 μ q n and r is the movement matrix and the elements of r are defined as r i j r i j for i j and r i i j 1 n r j i 2 2 epidemiological models for local birds and mosquitoes in fig 1 we can readily observe that it is utterly important to include the movements of interacting species as the migration of the sick individuals from one habitat patch to another habitat patch can trigger the spread of an epidemic in our previous effort bhowmick et al 2020 our model was a locally temperature driven shocket et al 2020 ode based model and did not have spatial aspects but in our present work we have coupled the geo spatial nature of wnv spread with our ode based model combining the local epidemiological model bhowmick et al 2020 and the metapopulation model leads to 3 representing a model for the mosquitoes with m i j as the rate of migration movement between two arbitrary patches j and i it is assumed

have incorporated the seasonally activated long range dispersal birds network for more details see section 3 2 2 after following the authors in lentz et al 2012 the matrix form of the equations associated with the long range dispersal birds is included in the supplementary information detailed descriptions and the values of the model parameters can be found in our previous work in bhowmick et al 2020 3 detailed description of mobility and migration in the last section we showed an ode model for wnv disease spread between patches without giving any details about the coupling matrices m and p in this section we describe the mobility networks of mosquitoes and birds 3 1 vector mobility network the importance of vector movement in the spread of wnv is ambiguous authors in maidana and yang 2009 conclude that mosquito movements do not play an important role but the authors in gubler 2007 styer et al 2007 vogels et al 2017 and hamer et al 2014 mention that opportunistic bites facilitate the escalation of wnv transmission therefore it is important to consider the mosquito movements information on exact mobility pathways for mosquitoes is scarce verdonschot and besse lototskaya 2014 estimated the flight range of culex pipiens average maximum distance is 9695 m minimum of maximum distance is 350 m and maximum of maximum distance 22 530 m respectively given their dispersal capacity it is realistic to estimate the daily movement of the mosquitoes let the distance between two patches i and j be d i j the dispersal probability is a function of decreasing distance where we follow moulay and pigné 2013 a network with such a dispersal kernel is calculated as described in algorithm 1 in fig 2 we show an example of a randomly generated mosquito network and according to algorithm 1 if d i j is greater than d m a x no links are being created 3 2 host mobility model apparently bird movements might spread the disease within the home range of birds the home range of birds depends on the required habitat as well as feed supply and bird density beal 2018 butler et al 2018 cohen and todd 2018 as the home ranges differ amongst species and depend on habitat suitability it is difficult to define a single home range for the host mobility model hence we include two movement patterns one to cover small home ranges of breeding birds with a maximal dispersal ranges from 1500 to 2164 m and minimal dispersal ranges from 80 to 170 m garcía and borda de água 2017 we term it as local bird dispersal second in order to cover large home ranges with a maximum flight distance of 500 km we follow moon et al 2019 and call it as long range dispersal we mention that once the migratory birds are present in germany during the period of migration they behave like local birds with the inclusion of long range movements bhowmick et al 2020 in their flyways around germany therefore the movements of the long range and migratory birds are used synonymously in our work 3 2 1 local bird mobility model given the above mentioned reasons we decided to follow the seed dispersal model da silveira et al 2016 levey et al 2008a báños villalba et al 2017 for the local bird dispersal mobility model that is we use the seed dispersal as a proxy for the movement network of the birds the dispersal probability follows a weibull distribution carlo and morales 2008 nathan et al 2008 calviño cancela et al 2006 type in fig 3 we show an example for the local bird flight range to construct the movement matrix p of the local birds we have made use of a similar routine to the way we have constructed the mosquito movement network m in algorithm 1 the algorithm is similar except for the used distribution and is included in the supplementary information an example of such generated local bird networks is shown in fig 4 shape and the scale parameters are taken from garcía and borda de água 2017 rogers et al 2019 and levey et al 2008b and the values for the shape and scale parameters are 2 83 and 1 0 respectively 3 2 2 long range dispersal bird mobility model power law dispersal kernel information for large home ranges in birds are scarce hence we follow the approach of newman 2005 moon et al 2019 and meyer and held 2014 using a power law distribution to model incidental long range disease transmission routes we have constructed a movement matrix n of the long range dispersal birds using the similar routine as we have done for the mosquito movement network and the local bird movement network as mentioned in algorithm 1 the corresponding algorithm to generate the movement matrices for the long range dispersal birds is included in the supplementary information the value of the power law parameter has been taken from moon et al 2019 with the value 3 3844 time events of dispersal it is important to stress that the seasonal appearance and disappearance of the migratory or long dispersal birds is of utter importance for the potential introduction and thereafter sustaining the wnv transmission in the local bird population hence the in fact spatially continuous trajectories should be adjusted to incorporate the seasonal movements and the jumps in our metapopulation network model our main motive is to accommodate the seasonally driven long range dispersal of birds as a series of movement matrices amongst different habitat patches these habitat patches are nodes of the movement network of long range dispersal birds to construct the movement matrices we follow the functional form of transition probabilities devised in kölzsch et al 2018 and kölzsch and blasius 2008 it describes the seasonal movements of long range dispersal of the birds according to the authors in kölzsch and blasius 2008 the generalised von mises distribution function defining the dispersal is the following 7 t i j f s i j ψ i j δ i j t where s i j represents the maximum hopping magnitude ψ i j represents the mean season when hopping occurs δ i j depicts the span of the time interval during which hopping takes place after following the simplification performed in kölzsch and blasius 2008 we have assumed the form of probability distribution connecting patches to be 8 t i j s i j exp cos t ψ i j 1 δ 2 fig 5 depicts the kernel accommodating the seasonal movements of the long range dispersal birds and the parameters are taken from kölzsch and blasius 2008 the associated algorithm and an example of a network generated through 8 are included in the supplementary information 4 basic reproduction number 4 1 basic reproduction number r 0 of the patchy model to compute the basic reproduction number we use the next generation method van den driessche and watmough 2002 using the notation used in van den driessche and watmough 2002 we can decompose the model system 3 and 4 as f i v i f i and v i represent the flow of new infections and the remaining transfers within and out of the infected classes respectively for the simplicity of our matrix calculation we have considered the subclinical case as γ 3 i 0 will give the clinical case f bsc i v bsc i f bsc i are given in box i let f bsc f bsc s 0 0 and v bsc v bsc s 0 0 be the jacobian

model 3 and 4 it is rather difficult to quantify the impact of host vector movements and the spread of wnv analytically with expression 9 it is rather laborious to measure how the movements of the interacting species can lead to the spread of wnv even for a two patch model the relationship amongst the parameters is not trivial given the mathematical form of r 0 in order to understand the importance of the movements of the interacting host vector population we consider a two patch model and perform simulations on this model 5 1 1 impact of mosquito mobility most of the literature in the area of vector borne disease modelling centres around the movement on long distance travelling of the host species only in those models we can overlook the vector mobility but in our current effort we include the small scale flights of the vectors of wnv the influence of the vectorial capacity and the movements of the mosquitoes are important features to the potential spread and hence sustaining wnv moulay and pigné 2013 ciota and kramer 2013 therefore we conceive that the daily mobility and the short journeys carried by the vector species cannot be ignored it is of our interest to acknowledge that smaller temporal scale of wnv transmission can potentially include the new aspects in the spread of wnv in germany for now we consider only the subclinical birds and examine the influence of the mosquito movements we simulate the situation when an infected local subclinical bird is introduced to a completely susceptible population with different flight range movements of the mosquitoes we consider two cases for the simulations one with the inclusion of local mosquito mobility and another one without mosquito migration in both cases we keep the subclinical birds movement enabled the importance of local mosquito interactions is visible in fig 6 it shows the number of subclinical infected birds versus time i b s c 1 stands for the infected subclinical birds in patch number 1 and i b s c n 1 stands for the subclinical birds in the patch number 1 but without mosquito movements it is interesting to observe that in the scenario when we do not include the mosquito movements the infection spreading process takes longer and the peak is relatively flat whereas when we include the mosquito mobility the infection spreads quicker than previously considered and the peak is sharp and concentrated with subclinical birds for experimental purpose we change the maximum flight ranges of mosquitoes and the influence of the mosquito movements are clearly visible in figs 6 a and 6 b higher range of mosquito movements facilitate the potential transmission of wnv in the local birds population the shape of the epidemiology of wnv spread in germany is potentially governed by the movements of the interacting species especially the birds as a prime host it is widely accepted that the movements of the birds is likely to facilitate the dissemination of wnv in germany ziegler et al 2020 2019 in the following sections we explore the influence of the birds both local and long dispersal birds movements on the potential spatial spread of wnv in germany 5 1 2 impact of local bird movement in this section we explore the influence of the local bird movements on the basic reproduction number of the patchy model system 3 and 4 to keep our findings simple we just consider a two patch model consisting of only subclinical birds and the corresponding basic reproduction number r 0 given in 9 the analytical and the symbolic computations related to the clinical and subclinical birds are the same given the complex and the long expression of r 0 included in the supplementary information even for the two patch model it is rather difficult to quantify theoretically the impact of the local bird migration in r 0 and in the dissemination of wnv from one habitat patch to another we thus perform simulations under different conditions to understand the dynamics after following ruan 2017 to test the influence on local bird movements we run the model for two patches using the following parameters m b 1 m b 2 0 016 γ b s c 1 γ b s c 2 0 567 α 3 1 α 3 2 0 182 k m 1 k m 2 1000 k b 1 k b 2 100 c 1 1 c 1 2 0 18 d i b s c 1 d i b s c 2 0 5 m m 1 m m 2 0 4141 only the transmission parameters are different for the subclinical birds for the second patch it is 0 88 and for the first patch it is 0 78 mosquito migration rates are kept the same for both the patches as 0 9 the basic reproduction number r 0 1 of patch 1 is less than 1 and for the patch 2 it is r 0 2 greater than 1 i e r 0 1 0 87 and r 0 2 1 09 here we carry out the simulations to investigate the impact of the local bird migrations on the basic reproduction number for this purpose we keep all the parameters same except for the transmission parameters from the mosquitoes to the clinical birds for the two patch model from the magnitude of the basic reproduction number it is clear that wnv is endemic in the patch 2 and in the patch 1 it will die out first we let p 21 0 91 and let p 12 to vary then we keep p 12 0 9 and vary p 21 to observe the influence of the clinical birds on the magnitude of the basic reproduction number from fig 7 a it is evident that with the increase of migration from the patch 2 to the patch 1 the basic reproduction number reduces whereas we can witness the opposite of this phenomenon in fig 7 b where with the increase of p 21 yields the increase in the basic reproduction number of the two patch model these simulations possibly give us a glimpse of the complexity of the potential spread of wnv from one endemic patch to another one the immigration of the birds can trigger a series of such expansion of wnv and this kind of complexities cannot be explained through a local only model bhowmick et al 2020 we also have explored impact of long distance bird movements in the dissemination of wnv in germany and spatially projected over the map of germany the authors in liu et al 2006 state that the dispersal of long range birds actually establish the spatial spread of wnv it is plausible that the acquisition of wnv can happen during dispersal of long range birds reed et al 2003 in our simulations we include the movements of the local birds and mosquitoes but discard the movements of the long range dispersal birds our initial findings show the importance of the movements of long range dispersal birds in introducing and sustaining the bites of wnv in the new places the results are included in the supplementary information 5 1 3 vector control one of the main applications of models for the potential spread of wnv among the birds is to design of possible control strategies and create buffer zones to prevent or minimise the spread of wnv for the demonstration purpose we consider only the movement between two patches of the clinical birds as to analyse the similar computation with n patches are complex enough to pursue mosquito movement is also considered we follow lewis et al 2019 to assess different control strategies mathematically consider the model system 3 and 4 and we take account of the clinical birds and their movements between two patches only the next generation matrix for the clinical birds turns out to be of the following form ngm bc 0 0 a 1 a 2 0 0 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 0 0 a 7 a 8 0 0 the explicit mathematical forms of a i i 1 8 are included in the supplementary information the matrix ngm bc can be readily put into block matrix form as follows ngm bc 0 a 1 a 2 0 where a 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 2 a 5 a 6 a 7 a 8 then according to lewis et al 2019 theorem 8 1 targeting either the vector or the host population to control wnv should be an effective strategy while counting on the cost of corresponding one group target strategies according to lewis et al 2019 it is better to apply all available resources to target one population only in order to lessen the burden of wnv the mosquito population needs to be reduced below a certain threshold in our case mosquito control is only option to explore according to lewis et al 2019 the type reproduction number t m to control the mosquito population is given by t m a 1 a 2 1 p 1 where p 1 is the fraction of the vector population to be controlled therefore more than the 1 1 t m fraction of mosquitoes should be targeted to eradicate the impact of wnv in case of two patch populations using the parameters described in section 5 1 2 more than 56 of the mosquito population should be reduced to potentially stop the spatial transmission of wnv in the two patch population model 6 spatial spread in germany the study area comprised of 11 054 german municipalities which are the nodes in our network we use the model 5 and 6 and the equations associated with the movement of birds included in the supplementary information to apprehend the wnv transmission in the local bird populations in each municipality birds are grouped according to their health status as depicted in fig 1 we explicitly consider the vector population and the mobility we do not have the population distribution of birds across the different municipalities level so we have assumed uniform number of local birds as in bhowmick et al 2020 at first we keep all the local birds initially susceptible in all the municipalities we introduce i inf 1 number of infected long range dispersal bird in selected municipalities for the first season of the simulation the infection is seeded in the city halle as the first case of wnv was reported in that ziegler et al 2019 between municipalities movements of vectors and the hosts take place on three different contact networks i the vector network representing the mosquitos ii the local birds network and iii the long distance movement birds network representing sporadic movements of birds ranging distances between 0 and 500 km pathways the nodes are the centroid of municipalities and the links amongst them are formed after employing algorithms to generate the movement matrices for the three distinct networks in fig 8 we depict a long range dispersal birds pathway being constructed through the power law distance based kernel in the simulation we take note of the source of infection of each newly infected municipality municipalities that are previously free of wnv might be infected through different networks of concern simulated infection spread data provides a spatial projection on the map of germany we present in fig 9 results on the temporal and spatial evolution of the disease dynamics compared with real outbreak data here we compute the cumulative number of infected birds within each region assuming that the disease propagates from the seeding zone to the other places through the combinations of the different spatial dispersal networks in fig 9 b we show the spatial distribution of potential wnv cases while including the probable spatial spread of wnv in germany and in fig 9 a cumulative reported cases of wnv in the year 2018 according to the counting per municipalities we perform the same for the second year by the end of the wnv season 1 apparently the spatial spread of wnv infection is mostly confined within the eastern zone of germany with some spontaneous cases in the north and in the southern zones fig 9 d represents the simulated possible spatial spread of wnv in germany and in fig 9 a cumulative reported cases of wnv in the year 2019 according to the counting per municipalities are presented to generate the choropleth maps we have utilised the r package cartography giraud and lambert 2017 compared to the observed outbreak regions the affected regions in the outbreak model are very similar in 2018 figs 9 a and 9 b nevertheless the affected region in the model is larger than in the observed data in 2019 the model shows several long distance spread that have not been observed compare figs 9 c and 9 d the spatial spread aligns with the theoretical predictions and possibly highlight the close relationship between the spatial spread of wnv into the newer zones and the flyways of long range dispersal birds even though the newly infected zones are relatively far geographically to characterise the difference between the predictive ability of our deterministic metapopulation network model and the reported cases of wnv in germany for two seasons we adhere to calculate the structural similarity index ssim massaro et al 2019 wang et al 2004 wang and bovik 2009 we use this method to compare and quantify the spatial prediction of the simulations generated from our model with the reported cases it is a method primarily used to measure the similarity between two images but potentially can also be relevant to compare the structural properties of two dimensional data i e the spatial distribution of wnv cases in our modelling framework the ssim index can be regarded as a metric to measure the difference between two images with the condition that one of them is assumed to be perfect in our case the perfect image is the spatial distribution of the reported cases of wnv it is to be noted that when we have performed our simulations we have only the sparse geo spatial reports of two years of wnv cases in germany this have not helped us to construct necessary means like likelihood function etc we demonstrate the distributions of ssim values as boxplots and density plots for each season in fig 10 it can also demonstrate the perceived error or similarities between the outputs from the simulations and the reported cases of wnv in germany we show the distribution of the ssim s for 100 simulation runs for both seasons in fig 10 for more information please see the supplementary information we conclude that in the initial phase of wnv spread in germany the model performs well while approximating the observed spatial dissemination in the following season however the performance of the model is slightly better compared to the results from the previous season in the backdrop of reported cases visual representations of the spatial r 0 vs cumulative number of infected birds per municipalities are included in the supplementary information 7 discussion and conclusion in this work we endeavour a deterministic metapopulation network model of wnv transmission in germany we put an effort to analyse the transmission of wnv and employ different contact networks to investigate the wnv transmission to disease free zones the contact networks incorporate different types of vector and host movements local bird movements in their habitat patch long distance movements of birds and vector movements after the first case of wnv detected in germany in 2018 ziegler et al 2019 favourable weather conditions facilitated its possible spread to other regions of the country following rather sporadic cases of wnv in the next season extraordinary high temperatures have allowed to decrease the extrinsic incubation period eip and consequently the cases of wnv increased multifold across germany ziegler et al 2020 to procure the spatial prediction of wnv circulation across germany we compare the spatial dissemination of wnv after including and afterwards ruling out the potential role of the long range dispersal bird s role it should be noted that in the first season of wnv spread in germany the spatial transmission of wnv is well caught in a qualitative manner and in the next season a similar result was achieved after the inclusion of long range dispersal birds one possible reason could be attributed to the fact that the reported cases of wnv rely solely on the reporting and there might be reporting bias which might have hindered into the quantitative similarities of the reported cases and the simulated cases of wnv in germany several previous models daversa et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b a include network approaches to analyse the role of birds and vectors in spatial disease transmission in contrast to daversa et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b and zhang et al 2018a we have included both vector and host networks in contrast to these studies our results indicate that the role of vectors in the spatial spread of wnv cannot be neglected even if information on vector movement is scarce and uncertainty is high when reducing the vector population by 57 wnv dissemination can be controlled according to our two patch model therefore hypothetically one of the measure to consider to lower the wnv spread is to control the vector population around the infected places preceding spatial models tried to investigate the dissemination of wnv utilising travelling wave solutions with constant velocity maidana and yang 2009 lewis et al 2006 chen et al 2016 however from the work of ziegler et al 2019 and ziegler et al 2020 it is evident that the transmission of wnv follows a pattern governed by spatial jumps similar findings have been mentioned in moon et al 2019 and chen et al 2016 about the features of the transmission of wnv in the usa according to such models the reach of wnv dissemination should have been lesser compared to what we have noted in recent years the potential reason could be attributed to the fact that such models cannot incorporate the spontaneous long distance movements of birds what are equally responsible to introduce the potential pathogens of wnv into the new areas we surmise that long range dispersal birds movement network governed by a power law model can potentially explain such phenomenon as we have shown in our current endeavour keeping this in our mind we can clearly observe the salient differences of the outcomes in our present work compared to what have found in our previous work bhowmick et al 2020 in our previous effort we did not have any prior knowledge about the reported cases of wnv in germany and the possible nature of the movements of the hosts vectors species to consider into our previously developed model in our present work we have the information of first reported cases of wnv in germany and we are able to incorporate into current metapopulation network model this leaves us with a flexible geo spatial modelling framework and this aspect was absent into our previous work bhowmick et al 2020 to our knowledge the potential role of long range dispersal birds introducing wnv to the completely susceptible local bird population with the coupling of population dynamics with the host vector mobility in germany is not explored in other modelling studies a considerable number of investigations on the spatial outbreaks of wnv have been performed the epidemic threshold condition for our model is mathematically similar with the with findings of arino et al 2012 although in our work we have taken account of vector movement our findings about the effectualness of the host vector dispersal is similar to that in laperrière et al 2016 the results from our mathematical model can theoretically mirror the fact that long range dispersal birds act as a discerning factor to introduce and transport wnv into new zones in germany as mentioned in ziegler et al 2019 2020 we opine that the power law algorithm 3 2 2 we have used to generate the long range dispersal bird pathways in germany sometimes has overvalued the potential cases of wnv as the algorithm constructs long distance fly pathways as depicted in fig 9 and similar issues are mentioned in moon et al 2019 after employing a more realistic data driven dispersal function as developed in kölzsch and blasius 2008 and kölzsch et al 2018 we notice that it can improve the current endeavour while generating long range dispersal networks knowledge about the factors like the density and the population distributions of the local bird populations their habitat types flying pathways will bring finer resolutions to the simulations results and the possible further incorporations of different environmental parameters will yield better knowledge of the spread of wnv in germany it is worth mentioning that there are two major differences between our model and the reality first the observed data rely on dead birds found in the environment or in husbandry and therefore there might be a reporting bias what is not known precisely the model predictions shows the total number of infected birds secondly the direction of the spatial spread in our model is not weighted in contrast to the reality where birds fly to the feeding places additionally we would like to emphasise that many unknown factors e g long distance flyway directions could not be taken into consideration from the literatures paz 2015 shocket et al 2020 rohr 2020 it is evident that the influence of temperature precipitation wind speed and direction relative humidity etc all are important factors to be considered while modelling the spread of wnv the interplay between the mosquito activity and the spread of wnv are not entirely correlated rather there is an overlap in the mean of temperature to reduce the complexity arising from the nature of dissemination of wnv through mosquito activity we have opted not to consider different factors like habitat suitability vector competency different meteorological factors except temperature species variability etc in our mathematical model the parameters are temperature dependent laperrière et al 2016 paz 2015 as our primary goal is to construct a modelling framework that can predict the spatial spread of wnv in germany we suggest that this modelling assumption needs further investigation however as we observe that our deterministic metapopulation network modelling approach allows to evaluate the potential role of long range dispersal birds dispersal in the spatial spread of wnv in germany in order to implement control strategies for the containment it is essential to comprehend the potential eco epidemiological parameters and the disease mechanisms that yield to the potential spatial spread of wnv despite the limitations of our current effort on modelling the spatial spread of wnv quantitatively qualitatively we are able to produce the path of infection the projected wnv cases are similar to the observed reported cases except for some zones in the southern and the eastern zones finally our modelling endeavour can be useful to project the potential cases of wnv in the future and the output from our model could be useful to examine strategies required to mitigate the spread of wnv in germany we would also like to include that given the inherent flexibility of our compartment based model it can accommodate multiple hosts different meteorological factors and the simple metapopulation network formulations of our locally ode based model can produce geo spatial spread of wnv and other mosquito borne disease in other countries too under the concept of one health unified surveillance of wnv cases and monitoring the interacting species populations can provide us the foundation for effective precaution and control of wnv and any other mosquito borne disease in different countries credit authorship contribution statement suman bhowmick designed the study developed the model

24269,this study mainly addressed the methodology issue of how to model the hydrodynamic drag effects of aquaculture facilities and activities here firstly surface shear stress was determined by roughness height for characterizing the drag from floating aquaculture activities while bottom shear stress was determined by the manning number for characterizing the drag caused by bottom fixed aquaculture activities then by taking qinzhou bay as a typical case the two dimensional model was established by integrating the multiple drag coefficients to quantify the impacts of the oyster cultivation activities on the water exchange capability tidal prism and half life time the results showed that 1 cultivation activities would reduce the average tidal prism by 6 4 in qinzhou bay 2 10 averages longer day of half life time was estimated to be resulting from the cultivation drag keywords oyster aquaculture hydrodynamic modeling tidal prism half life time data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction marine aquaculture plays an essential role in global grain production sheppard 2018 with the improvement of people s living standard people s requirement of protein resources increased dramatically thereby the capture fishery suffered resource exhaustion chang et al 2020 ghanbarzadeh et al 2021 karim et al 2020 because of the limitation of land and freshwater resource a large number of aquaculture along the coastal area are therefore a practical way to extend people s survival and development space edwards 2015 holmer 2010 china boasts the world s largest output of marine aquaculture cao et al 2015 according to the china fisheries statistics yearbook 2020 the aquaculture production hit 20 million tons in 2019 while the oyster yield accounted for over a quarter this representative aquaculture specie is mainly cultivated through the aquaculture facilities that hang on the ropes and rafts in a high density fashion moreover such way of cultivation is mainly distributed at the estuaries and bays and is reliant on the baits provided by the plankton conveyed through flushing and tidal effects filgueira et al 2014a filgueira et al 2016 powell et al 2012 yet with the booming development of intensive oyster aquaculture the physical hindrance of cultivation facilities would inevitably bring rise to some negative impacts of hydrodynamic conditions pilditch et al 2001 sun et al 2021 what s more some negative feedbacks on the marine ecosystem will thus emerge on one hand the aquaculture facilities would impede the water flow so that the renewal of particulate food would be slower thus hindering the aquatic product s growth dowd 2005 lin et al 2016 penney et al 2001 powell et al 2012 on the other hand the reduced water exchange would result in decreasing tidal prism which would bring about the accumulation of external pollutants in the semi closed bay and thereby enhancing eutrophication kakehi et al 2017 tett et al 2003 consequently the detailed hydrodynamic analysis and mathematical modeling are essential to quantify the impact of intensive oyster aquaculture activities on water environment which will not only assist in the spatial planning of marine aquaculture but also shape workable management strategies filgueira et al 2014b since the 1990s researchers have been devoted to figuring out how marine aquaculture affects the flow current onsite flow velocity observations one of the commonly used ways were conducted across multiple aquaculture sites worldwide for example in whitehaven harbour region the current speed in the bivalve s culture zones was found to be about 40 slower than that of the surrounding water body pilditch et al 2001 the alongshore velocities within the kelp forest in the northern coastal kelp cultivation area of monterey bay were found to be reduced by a factor of 5 in the upper part of the water column and a factor of 4 in the lower part of the water column rosman et al 2007 the aquaculture facilities in gouqi island not only haltered the horizontal tidal current but also induced the decrease of salinity temperature and chlorophyll along the vertical section lin et al 2016 however due to the limitations of sampling observations numerical models were utilized as an effective tool to analyze the complex interaction inside the marine aquaculture system for instance by establishing a three dimension tidal non linear barotropic model of lunenburg bay area the complicated flushing characteristics affected by the aquaculture activities were quantified sturley and bowen 1996 in order to examine the average current speed quiescent water periods and water circulation of mulroy bay a hydrodynamic model coupled with particle tracking module were set up moreno navas et al 2011 the hydrodynamic and particulate tracking model of jaran bay in the southern south korea was used to calculate the flushing time kim et al 2019 besides to outline and predict the tidal features more accurately various cultivation drag parameters were incorporated into the modeling for example to analyze the hydrographic conditions of sungo bay in details researcher added two types of drag that were caused by cultivation facilities and kelp in the water column respectively into the hydrodynamic model furthermore biological model was coupled to calculate the aquaculture carrying capacity of kelp shi et al 2011b an improved two dimensional model including drags about the mussel droppers and suspended canopy was established and applied to analyze the impacts of long line mussel farms on hydrodynamic and the solute transport in the casheen bay while using the average residence time to analyze the flushing characteristics and particle renewal terms o donncha et al 2013 for management of aquaculture farms the nemuro culture model was established by coupling the cultivated species kelp laminaria japonica oyster crassostrea gigas scallop chlamys farreri and phosphorus related variables with nemuro north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography which is used for quantify the potential influence of bivalves seaweed integrated culture on pelagic ecosystem sun et al 2020 in addition the shoal water hydrodynamic model shyfem by introducing the cultivation drag was used to characterize the impact of cage cultivation on the current field and water exchange in sansha bay lin et al 2019 actually water exchange between the semi closed bay area and the open sea is the key physical process that drive the physical chemical and biological characteristic changes within the bay ranjbar et al 2019 suara et al 2020 yang and chui 2017 which would further affect the sustainable development of marine aquaculture and other activities however few of previous studies had focused on examining the effects of the cultivation facilities on water exchange which have not been fully addressed therefore in this study by taking a semi closed bay known as the largest oyster cultivation base in china qinzhou bay as the typical case a high resolution two dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model coupled with transport module by integrating the cultivation drag was established for stimulating the impact of intensive oyster aquaculture activities on hydrodynamics conditions meanwhile tidal prism cucco and umgiesser 2006 jiang et al 2017 luo et al 2021 shi et al 2011a ying et al 2018 and half life time chen et al 2019 lin et al 2019 shang et al 2019 were calculated after hydrodynamic numerical simulation to quantify the impact of intensive oyster aquaculture activities on water exchange 2 methodology and data 2 1 study area qinzhou bay is located in the northern part of beibu gulf qinzhou city of china with the coordinates of 21 33 00 to 21 55 00 n and 108 25 00 to 108 46 00 e as shown in fig 1 qinzhou bay is a semi enclosed bay area covering 380 km2 which can be divided into three parts in line with its geographical features namely the inner bay maowei sea the mid bay longmen channel and the outer bay qinzhou harbor li et al 2018 there are two rivers flowing into maowei sea maoling river from northwest and qin river from northeast wang et al 2014 as the principal surface runoffs that flow into qinzhou bay these two major rivers play the key role in carrying lots of nutrients phytoplankton and also pollutants contributing to biological matter cycle in the bay qinzhou bay is a natural oyster farm high intensity oyster cultivation areas mainly cover the inner maowei sea and the midbay longmen channel fig 2 a generally oysters were cultivated on cement attachments at regular intervals these cement attachments were then connected through ropes and vertically hung on the fixed fig 2b and floating rafts fig 2c in accordance with their growing period in recent years increasing nutrient inputs from the two rivers and the over cultivation of oyster here have brought about the long term excessive nutrients level and red tide crisis in inner maowei sea moreover although three dimensional models have been developed and proved to be more high precise for simulating water environmental change in off shore area complex database and long time running were needed jia et al 2010b shi et al 2011 2d models are much less computationally intensive than 3d models which are also suitable for modeling low depth semi closed shallow waters wu 2004 liu and garcía 2008 castro díazet al 2009 canestrelli et al 2010 goodwell et al 2014 2 2 two dimensional hydrodynamic model and transport model the two dimensional hydrodynamic model and transport model in this study were controlled by the integration of the three dimensional incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes

the model density was set as barotropic mode meaning that the density was maintained all along the horizontal eddy viscosity was obtained via the smagorinsky formulation with the smagorinsky coefficient set as 0 28 due to data limitation the impacts of the wind forcing precipitation and evaporation were neglected the drag related parameters in this model were listed in section 2 3 3 the model was started one month prior to the scheduled operation period to ensure the dynamic stability and make sure the output of stimulation would not be affected by the initial conditions 2 3 parameterization of the cultivation drag how to characterize the drag induced by high density oyster aquaculture facilities is an important work for this study generally hydrodynamics simulations include only the bottom shear stress which would lead to the overestimate of hydrodynamic conditions of oyster aquaculture region grant and bacher 2001 as shown in the generalized model of the drag caused by seawater movement in oyster cultivation region fig 4 one extra drag that should be considered was the surface shear stress induced by the floating rafts and determined by the current speed another was the drag force generated by the pile groups of fixed rafts and the oyster strings that hung on these rafts which was a kind of body force that affected the water zone within the reach of the oyster strings which was not only determined by the current speed but also the size of those oyster strings shi et al 2011b 2 3 1 surface drag as shown in fig 4 c floating aquaculture rafts is one of the major oyster cultivation ways which would stay on the water surface as supported by the foams cultivation areas containing floating rafts were thus generalized as areas with surface shear stress similar to the bottom shear stress the surface shear stress can be defined utilizing the quadratic friction function 1 τ b ρ 0 c f u s u s where the ρ 0 means the density of seawater c f means the surface drag coefficient and u s us vs means flow velocity vector the surface drag coefficient c f can be determined by the manning number 2 c f g m h 1 6 2 where the g means the gravitational acceleration h means the total water depth and m means the manning number manning number can be estimated through the surface roughness height ks which is the control variable of surface shear stress in this model 3 m 25 4 k s 1 6 meanwhile the surface roughness height ks could also be converted with the surface roughness length z 0 s 4 z 0 s m k s where the m is the coefficient and always set as 1 30 if the current velocity under the sea conforms to the logarithmic law 5 u z u s κ ln z z 0 s where the uz is the current speed at depth z below the sea surface κ 0 4 denotes to the kármán s constant u s denotes to the surface friction velocity and z 0 s denotes to the surface roughness length lin et al 2016 as such if the information of multiple layers of velocity along the vertical cross section could be acquired then the surface roughness length z 0 s would be inferred by virtue of equation 5 in a bid to estimate the surface roughness height ks 2 3 2 drag within the water column fixed aquaculture raft is another commonly used way during the breeding period as outlined in fig 4 d fixed by the piles from the bottom of seawater the oyster cultivation rafts would submerge and emerge as the water level rose and fell the drag force was thereby included as a kind of body force within the water column in this grid region likewise this method was applied to handle the oyster strings hanging on the rafts fig 4c 4d the pile groups of fixed rafts and oyster strings could be viewed as cylinders then in accordance with previous studies the drag generated by each cylinder could be calculated through the following equation 6 d c d ρ u 2 d l where the l represents the length of the cylinder the ρ represents the water density the d represents the diameter the u represents the current speed and the c d represents the drag coefficient the flow velocity perpendicular to a cylinder is about 0 5 in the mike21 engine the effective drag force within each computational mesh is 7 f 1 2 ρ w γ c d a e u 2 the ρ w refers to the seawater density the γ refers to the streamline factor the c d refers to the drag coefficient the ae refers to the effective area of exposed to current and the u refers to the current speed then the body force of each mesh within the cultivation region was concerted into the equivalent shear stress 8 τ p δ x δ y n f c d u u where the τ p refers to the equivalent shear stress the δ x δ y refer to the grid spacings the n refers to the number of cylinders in one grid point density of cylinders the c d refers to the total drag coefficient and the u refers to the speed vector the equivalent shear stress τ p was set and then put into the momentum equations to calculate the changes of flow field under such drag to sum up during the simulation the drag within the water column could be controlled by adjusting the total drag coefficient c d 2 3 3 parameter setting of the cultivation drag due to the uncertainties associated with modeling drag in natural flows our purpose was to estimate the representative order of magnitude of the drag coefficient rather than the exact value there were totally three drags in this model for setting namely the bottom shear stress surface shear stress and the equivalent shear stress converted from the body force within the water column in this study the bottom shear stress was determined by the manning number which was set as 38 in the whole region by considering the seabed types and the averaged water depth the surface shear stress was controlled by the roughness height ks due to insufficient real data it is constantly adjusted and calibrated to ensure the accuracy of the simulation results compared with the measured data finally it was set as 0 35 9 67 in different aquaculture region fig 5 compared with previous studies manning number and roughness height are reasonable in this paper lin et al 2016 grant et al 2001 the drag within the water column was controlled by the total drag coefficient c d consistent with the actually measured and calibrated data the number of cylinder density was ultimately set as 0 025 to simulate the oyster strings at the distance of 2 5 4 0 m to the seabed and 0 01 at the distance of 0 2 5m to the seabed to simulate the piles groups of fixed rafts 3 results analysis 3 1 model validation to validate the feasibility of this model in forecasting the tidal current in the study area precision validation was undertook by comparison with observed tidal current data acquired at c1 c3 from the period of 12 00 00 june 19 to 13 00 00 june 20 2019 and the observed tidal water level data from 00 00 00 june 1 2019 to 23 00 00 june 30 2019 collected in longmen tide level station the location of three tidal current observation sites c1 108 33 20 e 21 49 03 n c2 108 35 58 e 21 41 26 n and c3 108 35 58 e 21 41 26 n and the observation site l1 108 33 e 21 45 n were shown in fig 1 the comparative result of observed values and simulated data in each site included the current velocity current direction and tidal level in time series figs 6 7 and 8 as delineated above the simulated data concerning the amplitudes and phases of tidal level in time series fit well with the observation results two dimensional statistical metrics were hence introduced to depict the deviations 1 p percent average deviation 9 p i 1 n o i m i i 1 n o i 100 where the o m denote to the real observation data and the results of the corresponding time step calculated by the model the i represents the ith time step the n represents the total time steps in validation p is used to quantify the average errors of modeling simulation allen et al 2007 when p 10 it indicates that the fitting result is perfect when 10 p 20 the fitting result is fairly excellent when 20 p 40 the fitting result is good and when p 40 the fitting result is unacceptable 1 γ 2 10 γ 2 var o m var o where the o m denote to the assemblage of real observation data and the results of the corresponding time step calculated by the model and the var denotes to the variance operator γ 2 is used to measure the fitting degree of modeling output and observed value keith et al 1997 the smaller it is the higher fitting degree it indicates when γ 2 0 1 it shows significant correlation whereas when γ 2 1 the fitting degree is unsatisfactory the quantitative evaluation results of the model were shown in figs 9 10 and 11 the scatter plots of the water levels indicated that there was a close connection between the observed values and simulated results the scattered dots were distributed closely along the diagonal while the observed data along the diagonal were no different from the simulated results fig 9 the p value was less than 11 and more importantly γ 2 was smaller than 0 1 indicating that this model could clearly demonstrate the water level changes in qinzhou bay the scatter plots of current speed however exhibited more scattered dots yet they were nevertheless roughly scattered along the diagonal fig 10 the average value of γ 2 was less than 0 5 and the p values were less than 33 with the average value less than 28 the diagonals of the current direction s scatter plots for each site demonstrated two groups of discrete yet closely spaced dots fig 11 different from the current speed all the γ 2 values of current direction were less than 0 21 and the average value was less than 0 1 with the average p value controlled within 20 the scatter plots of tidal current showcased that this model could accurately simulate the current field of qinzhou bay especially the current direction although model calibrations have been tried many times the fitting result of current speed have not been significantly improved the relatively low fitting degree of current speed could be attributed to either the neglect of wind force action or the limitation induced by the undefined drag coefficient that would change with the water depth in the two dimensional model however aforementioned validation results showed the reliability of the constructed model for meeting the need of subsequent stimulation 3 2 analysis of tidal field the distribution of tidal field regarding the maximum flood minimum flood maximum ebb and minimum ebb on the 15th day of the 5th lunar month within a tidal period spring tide in qinzhou bay was shown in figs 12 during the flood tidal period the seawater flowed from outer qinzhou bay through longmen channel into inner maowei sea with the average current speed nearing 0 221 m s the tidal speed reached the maximum in the deep water region which exceeded 2 221 m s during ebb tidal period the seawater flow in the opposite direction with an average speed hitting 0 280 m s slightly higher than those during flooding tide the maximum speed however was about 2 043 m s which was slower than that during flooding tide the residual current of qinzhou bay was recorded using the euler method as shown in figs 13 11 u e 1 n i 1 n u i 12 v e 1 n i 1 n v i where ue and ve are euler average velocities in the x and y directions respectively n is the total time steps of the simulation ui and vi are the velocities in x and y directions of each time step calculated by the model euler residual flow field and streamline distribution are obtained by synthesizing ue and ve the residual current field presented a relatively complicated and multi eddy structure with average current speed slower than 0 05 m s in areas adjacent to coastline and cultivation zones the residual current speed was relatively higher which could be affected by the periodical movement of the seawater and its nonlinear interactions with the topography meanwhile the residual current did not exhibit a significant direction toward either the inner or outer bay no matter whether it was in the middle bay or in the tidal flat demonstrating that its impact on the water exchange between the inner bay and outer bay water was limited hence the restoration of water quality through the diffusion of pollutants in qinzhou bay should give priority depending on the tidal current rather than the residual current 3 3 comparison of hydrodynamic conditions with and without raft aquaculture facilities to quantitatively analyze the impact of raft cultivation drags on water exchange scenario analysis was conducted in this study the results of scenario s2 without raft aquaculture facilities were compared with those of scenario s1 with raft aquaculture facilities 3 3 1 comparisons on tidal prism measurement of tidal prism is one of an important way for quantification of water exchange capability tidal prism refers to the water volume brought by tides that the bay could take in during a complete tidal period this indicator could to a certain degree reflect the exchange intensity between the semi closed bay and open sea the tidal prism of each mesh element could be accurately worked out through the following equation using the finite volume method 13 w i 1 n s i h 1 i h 2 i where the si refers to the area of the ith mesh the h1i h2i refer to the water levels of high and low tides of the ith mesh during a tidal period and the n refers to the total number of meshes within the calculation area by taking the open boundary as the cross section of the calculation area fig 3 tidal prism with and without raft aquaculture facilities during the 36 tidal periods spanning from june 3 to july 2 a lunar month were estimated fig 14 fig 14 showed that the tidal prism would change over time with its maximum and minimum value in spring and in neap tide respectively in cases where cultivation facilities were in place the maximum tidal prism in a lunar month was 15 55 108 m3 and the minimum value was 3 62 108 m3 with average hitting 10 18 108 m3 in cases without cultivation the maximum tidal prism in a lunar month reached 16 68 108 m3 and the minimum was 4 01 108 m3 with the average being 10 88 108 m3 as such cultivation activities had reduced the average tidal prism by 6 4 in qinzhou bay 3 3 2 comparisons on half life time estimation of half life time is another important way for quantification of water exchange capability luff and pohlmann 1995 half life time refers to the time span when the conservative tracer enters the study area and its concentration reduces to half of its original value under the convective diffusion the longer half time means weaker water exchange the constructed two dimensional transport model in this study was applied to calculate half life time in setting parameters of model the starting concentration of conservative substance within the calculation area was set as 1 while the concentration at the source and open boundary were set as 0 the biological decay process was not included the horizontal dispersion coefficient was correlated with the eddy viscosity coefficient in the scaled eddy viscosity formulation based on the concentration field of the conservative substance at different time nodes the spatial distribution of the half life time of water exchange in qinzhou bay under s1 and s2 scenarios fig 15 as well as the average half life time were obtained the results showed that 1 the half life time of water exchange in qinzhou bay showcased a growing trend from the open boundary to the inlet of maowei bay in both s1 and s2 2 the half life time near to the open boundary was less than 5 days once the water flow into maowei sea through longmen channel the half life time rose from 30 days to 40 days with the longest time of over 90 days at inlet of the maowei bay fig 16 demonstrated the trend of change in average conservative substance concentration over time in qinzhou bay in s1 and s2 scenarios with the periodical part of the curve smoothed using the loess locally weighted regression algorithm the average half life time in qinzhou bay under the two scenarios therefore were obtained from the diagram which were 383 hrs and 281hrs respectively in summary the drag induced by the cultivation facilities could increase the half life time within the bay by 36 3 4 discussions 4 1 comparison with other studies numerous researches have been carried out to simulate relevant numerical hydrodynamic value concerning aquaculture some of which still neglected cultivation drag kim et al 2019 as a result hydrodynamic and the pollutant diffusion conditions under the impact of cultivation activities were often overestimated different cultivated species with different breeding density and different farming ways in different places would demonstrate varied cultivation drag which should be considered when modeling adjusting the local sea bottom manning number of the two dimensional model is most favored way of generalizing cultivation drag grant and bacher 2001 guyondet et al 2013 lin et al 2019 wu et al 2014 kuang et al 2019 however in this study the surface shear stress was included for modelling oyster cultivation hang on floating rafts in order to make the parameter calibration more accurate and practical with the consideration of cultivation drag the overall current speed during spring tide was slower than those during ebb tide consistent with other research results through observing monitoring in this same area qiu et al 2003 moreover in a semi enclosed bay like maohai bay the spatial distribution of the half life time showed a gradual increase trend from the outward open boundary to inward inlet of bay matching with other results of previous studies dumas et al 2012 filgueira et al 2014b zainol et al 2021 4 2 contributions and limitations the two dimensional model established in this study integrating the multiple drag coefficients to quantify the impacts of the oyster cultivation activities on the water exchange capability hang on floated or fixed rafts have been proved to be of reasonable accuracy of approaching actual situation moreover although three dimensional models have been developed to simulate water environmental changes in the offshore area and proved to be feasible complex database and long time running are high requirements and high conditions jia et al 2010 shi et al 2011b 2d models are much less computationally intensive than 3d models which is suitable for low depth semi closed bay wu 2004 liu et al 2008 castro díaz et al 2009 canestrelli et al 2010 goodwell et al 2014 compared with other studies o donncha et al 2013 shi et al 2011b wang et al 2018 the cultivation drag were categorized into two groups the surface drag for oyster hang on floating raft and drag within the water column for oyster hang on fixed raft from the sea bottom which was a positive contribution for simulation modeling in the future based on this hydrodynamic model and combined by more environmental monitoring data a water quality model of qinzhou bay would be delivered thus realizing supporting information on sustainable cultivation planning however limited by monitoring data this study was unable to calibrate the drag parameters by combining the observed cross section current speed and the tidal current in a longer time series thus failing to validate the reliability of parameterization in a more comprehensive fashion 4 3 implications for the oyster cultivation sustainable development oyster is usually hanged on floating and fixed rafts currently fixed aquaculture rafts cover half of the total area of semi closed bay maowei bay where had more suitability condition of low salinity affected by flow of two major rivers while most of the short and long longmen channel has been occupied by floating rafts fixed aquaculture rafts are commonly used during the breeding period 0 1 year oyster and the floating rafts are cultivated 1 3 year oyster simulation results of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model and estimation of the impacts of high intensity cultivation activities on tidal prism and half life time showed that 10 average longer day of half life time was resulting from the cultivation drag moreover the hydrodynamics drag caused by high intensity cultivation activities at longmen channel showed a significant negative impact obviously more aquaculture facilities are in place the more negative impacts on water exchange between semi closed bay and open sea area as well as the eutrophication level are demonstrated the routine on site environmental monitoring data showed that the inorganic nitrogen din and soluble reactive phosphate srp were over the limit of national controlled standard of china therefore the relationship between environmental protection and social stability need more intelligent decision some of the suggestions were as follows 1 spatial zoning and optimal planning over aquaculture activities should be provided sea areas should be classified into three groups aquaculture prohibited area aquaculture restricted area and aquaculture suitable area 2 the simulation results demonstrated that the current speed dropped noticeably within the cultivation area hydrodynamic drag caused by floating or fixed rafts was the major factor hindering the water mass exchange thus high density cultivation should not be allowed at the inner semi closed bay and short longmen channel 3 the density of cultivation in aquaculture prohibited area and aquaculture restricted area should be scientifically calculated the recommended reasonable density of cultivation could be obtained through scenario analysis and by calculating the maximum phytoplankton capacity needed for oyster keeping in summary proper arrangement of spatial location and avoiding high density cultivation could mitigate the negative impacts of cultivation activities and promote sustainable development of traditional feature agriculture industry 5 conclusions how to model the hydrodynamic drag of cultivation activities is our major concern in this study surface shear stress was determined by roughness height for characterizing the drag from floating aquaculture activities while bottom shear stress was determined by the manning number for characterizing the drag caused by bottom fixed aquaculture activities then the two dimensional model was established by integrating the multiple drag coefficients to quantify the impacts of the oyster cultivation activities on the water exchange capability tidal prism and half life time were selected for quantifying water exchange capability this established model applied in qinzhou bay the top one scale of oyster breeding of china showed that 1 with cultivation drag the average current speed was about 0 221 m s and the maximum tidal speed exceeded 2 221 m s during a flood tidal period during ebb tide the average speed was slightly higher than that during flood period at the rate of roughly 0 280 m s while the maximum speed was slower than during flood period at the rate of about 2 043 m s the more aquaculture facilities are in place at semi closed bay the more hydrodynamic drag effects are demonstrated 2 two scenarios were conducted for comparison one with cultivation activities and the other without as for tidal prism in cases where cultivation facilities were in place the average tidal prism in a 36 lunar month was 10 18 108 m3 whereas the average tidal prism was 10 88 108 m3 in cases without cultivation indicating that cultivation activities had reduced the average tidal prism by 6 4 in qinzhou bay as for half life time the average half life time in qinzhou bay in cases where cultivation facilities in place was 383 hrs which was longer than 281hrs in cases without cultivation in summary the drag induced by the cultivation facilities could increase the half life time within the bay by 36 3 credit authorship contribution statement yu huang conceptualization

24269,this study mainly addressed the methodology issue of how to model the hydrodynamic drag effects of aquaculture facilities and activities here firstly surface shear stress was determined by roughness height for characterizing the drag from floating aquaculture activities while bottom shear stress was determined by the manning number for characterizing the drag caused by bottom fixed aquaculture activities then by taking qinzhou bay as a typical case the two dimensional model was established by integrating the multiple drag coefficients to quantify the impacts of the oyster cultivation activities on the water exchange capability tidal prism and half life time the results showed that 1 cultivation activities would reduce the average tidal prism by 6 4 in qinzhou bay 2 10 averages longer day of half life time was estimated to be resulting from the cultivation drag keywords oyster aquaculture hydrodynamic modeling tidal prism half life time data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction marine aquaculture plays an essential role in global grain production sheppard 2018 with the improvement of people s living standard people s requirement of protein resources increased dramatically thereby the capture fishery suffered resource exhaustion chang et al 2020 ghanbarzadeh et al 2021 karim et al 2020 because of the limitation of land and freshwater resource a large number of aquaculture along the coastal area are therefore a practical way to extend people s survival and development space edwards 2015 holmer 2010 china boasts the world s largest output of marine aquaculture cao et al 2015 according to the china fisheries statistics yearbook 2020 the aquaculture production hit 20 million tons in 2019 while the oyster yield accounted for over a quarter this representative aquaculture specie is mainly cultivated through the aquaculture facilities that hang on the ropes and rafts in a high density fashion moreover such way of cultivation is mainly distributed at the estuaries and bays and is reliant on the baits provided by the plankton conveyed through flushing and tidal effects filgueira et al 2014a filgueira et al 2016 powell et al 2012 yet with the booming development of intensive oyster aquaculture the physical hindrance of cultivation facilities would inevitably bring rise to some negative impacts of hydrodynamic conditions pilditch et al 2001 sun et al 2021 what s more some negative feedbacks on the marine ecosystem will thus emerge on one hand the aquaculture facilities would impede the water flow so that the renewal of particulate food would be slower thus hindering the aquatic product s growth dowd 2005 lin et al 2016 penney et al 2001 powell et al 2012 on the other hand the reduced water exchange would result in decreasing tidal prism which would bring about the accumulation of external pollutants in the semi closed bay and thereby enhancing eutrophication kakehi et al 2017 tett et al 2003 consequently the detailed hydrodynamic analysis and mathematical modeling are essential to quantify the impact of intensive oyster aquaculture activities on water environment which will not only assist in the spatial planning of marine aquaculture but also shape workable management strategies filgueira et al 2014b since the 1990s researchers have been devoted to figuring out how marine aquaculture affects the flow current onsite flow velocity observations one of the commonly used ways were conducted across multiple aquaculture sites worldwide for example in whitehaven harbour region the current speed in the bivalve s culture zones was found to be about 40 slower than that of the surrounding water body pilditch et al 2001 the alongshore velocities within the kelp forest in the northern coastal kelp cultivation area of monterey bay were found to be reduced by a factor of 5 in the upper part of the water column and a factor of 4 in the lower part of the water column rosman et al 2007 the aquaculture facilities in gouqi island not only haltered the horizontal tidal current but also induced the decrease of salinity temperature and chlorophyll along the vertical section lin et al 2016 however due to the limitations of sampling observations numerical models were utilized as an effective tool to analyze the complex interaction inside the marine aquaculture system for instance by establishing a three dimension tidal non linear barotropic model of lunenburg bay area the complicated flushing characteristics affected by the aquaculture activities were quantified sturley and bowen 1996 in order to examine the average current speed quiescent water periods and water circulation of mulroy bay a hydrodynamic model coupled with particle tracking module were set up moreno navas et al 2011 the hydrodynamic and particulate tracking model of jaran bay in the southern south korea was used to calculate the flushing time kim et al 2019 besides to outline and predict the tidal features more accurately various cultivation drag parameters were incorporated into the modeling for example to analyze the hydrographic conditions of sungo bay in details researcher added two types of drag that were caused by cultivation facilities and kelp in the water column respectively into the hydrodynamic model furthermore biological model was coupled to calculate the aquaculture carrying capacity of kelp shi et al 2011b an improved two dimensional model including drags about the mussel droppers and suspended canopy was established and applied to analyze the impacts of long line mussel farms on hydrodynamic and the solute transport in the casheen bay while using the average residence time to analyze the flushing characteristics and particle renewal terms o donncha et al 2013 for management of aquaculture farms the nemuro culture model was established by coupling the cultivated species kelp laminaria japonica oyster crassostrea gigas scallop chlamys farreri and phosphorus related variables with nemuro north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography which is used for quantify the potential influence of bivalves seaweed integrated culture on pelagic ecosystem sun et al 2020 in addition the shoal water hydrodynamic model shyfem by introducing the cultivation drag was used to characterize the impact of cage cultivation on the current field and water exchange in sansha bay lin et al 2019 actually water exchange between the semi closed bay area and the open sea is the key physical process that drive the physical chemical and biological characteristic changes within the bay ranjbar et al 2019 suara et al 2020 yang and chui 2017 which would further affect the sustainable development of marine aquaculture and other activities however few of previous studies had focused on examining the effects of the cultivation facilities on water exchange which have not been fully addressed therefore in this study by taking a semi closed bay known as the largest oyster cultivation base in china qinzhou bay as the typical case a high resolution two dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model coupled with transport module by integrating the cultivation drag was established for stimulating the impact of intensive oyster aquaculture activities on hydrodynamics conditions meanwhile tidal prism cucco and umgiesser 2006 jiang et al 2017 luo et al 2021 shi et al 2011a ying et al 2018 and half life time chen et al 2019 lin et al 2019 shang et al 2019 were calculated after hydrodynamic numerical simulation to quantify the impact of intensive oyster aquaculture activities on water exchange 2 methodology and data 2 1 study area qinzhou bay is located in the northern part of beibu gulf qinzhou city of china with the coordinates of 21 33 00 to 21 55 00 n and 108 25 00 to 108 46 00 e as shown in fig 1 qinzhou bay is a semi enclosed bay area covering 380 km2 which can be divided into three parts in line with its geographical features namely the inner bay maowei sea the mid bay longmen channel and the outer bay qinzhou harbor li et al 2018 there are two rivers flowing into maowei sea maoling river from northwest and qin river from northeast wang et al 2014 as the principal surface runoffs that flow into qinzhou bay these two major rivers play the key role in carrying lots of nutrients phytoplankton and also pollutants contributing to biological matter cycle in the bay qinzhou bay is a natural oyster farm high intensity oyster cultivation areas mainly cover the inner maowei sea and the midbay longmen channel fig 2 a generally oysters were cultivated on cement attachments at regular intervals these cement attachments were then connected through ropes and vertically hung on the fixed fig 2b and floating rafts fig 2c in accordance with their growing period in recent years increasing nutrient inputs from the two rivers and the over cultivation of oyster here have brought about the long term excessive nutrients level and red tide crisis in inner maowei sea moreover although three dimensional models have been developed and proved to be more high precise for simulating water environmental change in off shore area complex database and long time running were needed jia et al 2010b shi et al 2011 2d models are much less computationally intensive than 3d models which are also suitable for modeling low depth semi closed shallow waters wu 2004 liu and garcía 2008 castro díazet al 2009 canestrelli et al 2010 goodwell et al 2014 2 2 two dimensional hydrodynamic model and transport model the two dimensional hydrodynamic model and transport model in this study were controlled by the integration of the three dimensional incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations over depth and the convection diffusion equation respectively it was established through the mike 21 fm engine by dhi and the discretization in solution domain was performed using a finite volume method numerous studies bai et al 2021 jiang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 had validated the practicability and precision of utilizing this platform for tidal simulation in the offshore area fig 3 a delineated the high precision triangular unstructured grids of qinzhou bay area using the mesh resolution at the maximum of 500 m and minimum of 50 m with 114 594 elements and 60 611 nodes depth data were acquired from china navy hydrographic official website http hydro ngd gov cn based on which underwater bathymetry was obtained by spatial interpolation fig 3b the time series of water level need for open boundary were downloaded from the national marine data center http mds nmdis org cn for simplification two inlet runoffs of qin river and maoling river were set as constant value 46 93 m3 s and 62 16 m3 s respectively according to the historical monitoring data the simulation period ranged from 08 00 00 may 31 2019 to 08 00 00 september 28 2019 with the model time step of 3 second the model density was set as barotropic mode meaning that the density was maintained all along the horizontal eddy viscosity was obtained via the smagorinsky formulation with the smagorinsky coefficient set as 0 28 due to data limitation the impacts of the wind forcing precipitation and evaporation were neglected the drag related parameters in this model were listed in section 2 3 3 the model was started one month prior to the scheduled operation period to ensure the dynamic stability and make sure the output of stimulation would not be affected by the initial conditions 2 3 parameterization of the cultivation drag how to characterize the drag induced by high density oyster aquaculture facilities is an important work for this study generally hydrodynamics simulations include only the bottom shear stress which would lead to the overestimate of hydrodynamic conditions of oyster aquaculture region grant and bacher 2001 as shown in the generalized model of the drag caused by seawater movement in oyster cultivation region fig 4 one extra drag that should be considered was the surface shear stress induced by the floating rafts and determined by the current speed another was the drag force generated by the pile groups of fixed rafts and the oyster strings that hung on these rafts which was a kind of body force that affected the water zone within the reach of the oyster strings which was not only determined by the current speed but also the size of those oyster strings shi et al 2011b 2 3 1 surface drag as shown in fig 4 c floating aquaculture rafts is one of the major oyster cultivation ways which would stay on the water surface as supported by the foams cultivation areas containing floating rafts were thus generalized as areas with surface shear stress similar to the bottom shear stress the surface shear stress can be defined utilizing the quadratic friction function 1 τ b ρ 0 c f u s u s where the ρ 0 means the density of seawater c f means the surface drag coefficient and u s us vs means flow velocity vector the surface drag coefficient c f can be determined by the manning number 2 c f g m h 1 6 2 where the g means the gravitational acceleration h means the total water depth and m means the manning number manning number can be estimated through the surface roughness height ks which is the control variable of surface shear stress in this model 3 m 25 4 k s 1 6 meanwhile the surface roughness height ks could also be converted with the surface roughness length z 0 s 4 z 0 s m k s where the m is the coefficient and always set as 1 30 if the current velocity under the sea conforms to the logarithmic law 5 u z u s κ ln z z 0 s where the uz is the current speed at depth z below the sea surface κ 0 4 denotes to the kármán s constant u s denotes to the surface friction velocity and z 0 s denotes to the surface roughness length lin et al 2016 as such if the information of multiple layers of velocity along the vertical cross section could be acquired then the surface roughness length z 0 s would be inferred by virtue of equation 5 in a bid to estimate the surface roughness height ks 2 3 2 drag within the water column fixed aquaculture raft is another commonly used way during the breeding period as outlined in fig 4 d fixed by the piles from the bottom of seawater the oyster cultivation rafts would submerge and emerge as the water level rose and fell the drag force was thereby included as a kind of body force within the water column in this grid region likewise this method was applied to handle the oyster strings hanging on the rafts fig 4c 4d the pile groups of fixed rafts and oyster strings could be viewed as cylinders then in accordance with previous studies the drag generated by each cylinder could be calculated through the following equation 6 d c d ρ u 2 d l where the l represents the length of the cylinder the ρ represents the water density the d represents the diameter the u represents the current speed and the c d represents the drag coefficient the flow velocity perpendicular to a cylinder is about 0 5 in the mike21 engine the effective drag force within each computational mesh is 7 f 1 2 ρ w γ c d a e u 2 the ρ w refers to the seawater density the γ refers to the streamline factor the c d refers to the drag coefficient the ae refers to the effective area of exposed to current and the u refers to the current speed then the body force of each mesh within the cultivation region was concerted into the equivalent shear stress 8 τ p δ x δ y n f c d u u where the τ p refers to the equivalent shear stress the δ x δ y refer to the grid spacings the n refers to the number of cylinders in one grid point density of cylinders the c d refers to the total drag coefficient and the u refers to the speed vector the equivalent shear stress τ p was set and then put into the momentum equations to calculate the changes of flow field under such drag to sum up during the simulation the drag within the water column could be controlled by adjusting the total drag coefficient c d 2 3 3 parameter setting of the cultivation drag due to the uncertainties associated with modeling drag in natural flows our purpose was to estimate the representative order of magnitude of the drag coefficient rather than the exact value there were totally three drags in this model for setting namely the bottom shear stress surface shear stress and the equivalent shear stress converted from the body force within the water column in this study the bottom shear stress was determined by the manning number which was set as 38 in the whole region by considering the seabed types and the averaged water depth the surface shear stress was controlled by the roughness height ks due to insufficient real data it is constantly adjusted and calibrated to ensure the accuracy of the simulation results compared with the measured data finally it was set as 0 35 9 67 in different aquaculture region fig 5 compared with previous studies manning number and roughness height are reasonable in this paper lin et al 2016 grant et al 2001 the drag within the water column was controlled by the total drag coefficient c d consistent with the actually measured and calibrated data the number of cylinder density was ultimately set as 0 025 to simulate the oyster strings at the distance of 2 5 4 0 m to the seabed and 0 01 at the distance of 0 2 5m to the seabed to simulate the piles groups of fixed rafts 3 results analysis 3 1 model validation to validate the feasibility of this model in forecasting the tidal current in the study area precision validation was undertook by comparison with observed tidal current data acquired at c1 c3 from the period of 12 00 00 june 19 to 13 00 00 june 20 2019 and the observed tidal water level data from 00 00 00 june 1 2019 to 23 00 00 june 30 2019 collected in longmen tide level station the location of three tidal current observation sites c1 108 33 20 e 21 49 03 n c2 108 35 58 e 21 41 26 n and c3 108 35 58 e 21 41 26 n and the observation site l1 108 33 e 21 45 n were shown in fig 1 the comparative result of observed values and simulated data in each site included the current velocity current direction and tidal level in time series figs 6 7 and 8 as delineated above the simulated data concerning the amplitudes and phases of tidal level in time series fit well with the observation results two dimensional statistical metrics were hence introduced to depict the deviations 1 p percent average deviation 9 p i 1 n o i m i i 1 n o i 100 where the o m denote to the real observation data and the results of the corresponding time step calculated by the model the i represents the ith time step the n represents the total time steps in validation p is used to quantify the average errors of modeling simulation allen et al 2007 when p 10 it indicates that the fitting result is perfect when 10 p 20 the fitting result is fairly excellent when 20 p 40 the fitting result is good and when p 40 the fitting result is unacceptable 1 γ 2 10 γ 2 var o m var o where the o m denote to the assemblage of real observation data and the results of the corresponding time step calculated by the model and the var denotes to the variance operator γ 2 is used to measure the fitting degree of modeling output and observed value keith et al 1997 the smaller it is the higher fitting degree it indicates when γ 2 0 1 it shows significant correlation whereas when γ 2 1 the fitting degree is unsatisfactory the quantitative evaluation results of the model were shown in figs 9 10 and 11 the scatter plots of the water levels indicated that there was a close connection between the observed values and simulated results the scattered dots were distributed closely along the diagonal while the observed data along the diagonal were no different from the simulated results fig 9 the p value was less than 11 and more importantly γ 2 was smaller than 0 1 indicating that this model could clearly demonstrate the water level changes in qinzhou bay the scatter plots of current speed however exhibited more scattered dots yet they were nevertheless roughly scattered along the diagonal fig 10 the average value of γ 2 was less than 0 5 and the p values were less than 33 with the average value less than 28 the diagonals of the current direction s scatter plots for each site demonstrated two groups of discrete yet closely spaced dots fig 11 different from the current speed all the γ 2 values of current direction were less than 0 21 and the average value was less than 0 1 with the average p value controlled within 20 the scatter plots of tidal current showcased that this model could accurately simulate the current field of qinzhou bay especially the current direction although model calibrations have been tried many times the fitting result of current speed have not been significantly improved the relatively low fitting degree of current speed could be attributed to either the neglect of wind force action or the limitation induced by the undefined drag coefficient that would change with the water depth in the two dimensional model however aforementioned validation results showed the reliability of the constructed model for meeting the need of subsequent stimulation 3 2 analysis of tidal field the distribution of tidal field regarding the maximum flood minimum flood maximum ebb and minimum ebb on the 15th day of the 5th lunar month within a tidal period spring tide in qinzhou bay was shown in figs 12 during the flood tidal period the seawater flowed from outer qinzhou bay through longmen channel into inner maowei sea with the average current speed nearing 0 221 m s the tidal speed reached the maximum in the deep water region which exceeded 2 221 m s during ebb tidal period the seawater flow in the opposite direction with an average speed hitting 0 280 m s slightly higher than those during flooding tide the maximum speed however was about 2 043 m s which was slower than that during flooding tide the residual current of qinzhou bay was recorded using the euler method as shown in figs 13 11 u e 1 n i 1 n u i 12 v e 1 n i 1 n v i where ue and ve are euler average velocities in the x and y directions respectively n is the total time steps of the simulation ui and vi are the velocities in x and y directions of each time step calculated by the model euler residual flow field and streamline distribution are obtained by synthesizing ue and ve the residual current field presented a relatively complicated and multi eddy structure with average current speed slower than 0 05 m s in areas adjacent to coastline and cultivation zones the residual current speed was relatively higher which could be affected by the periodical movement of the seawater and its nonlinear interactions with the topography meanwhile the residual current did not exhibit a significant direction toward either the inner or outer bay no matter whether it was in the middle bay or in the tidal flat demonstrating that its impact on the water exchange between the inner bay and outer bay water was limited hence the restoration of water quality through the diffusion of pollutants in qinzhou bay should give priority depending on the tidal current rather than the residual current 3 3 comparison of hydrodynamic conditions with and without raft aquaculture facilities to quantitatively analyze the impact of raft cultivation drags on water exchange scenario analysis was conducted in this study the results of scenario s2 without raft aquaculture facilities were compared with those of scenario s1 with raft aquaculture facilities 3 3 1 comparisons on tidal prism measurement of tidal prism is one of an important way for quantification of water exchange capability tidal prism refers to the water volume brought by tides that the bay could take in during a complete tidal period this indicator could to a certain degree reflect the exchange intensity between the semi closed bay and open sea the tidal prism of each mesh element could be accurately worked out through the following equation using the finite volume method 13 w i 1 n s i h 1 i h 2 i where the si refers to the area of the ith mesh the h1i h2i refer to the water levels of high and low tides of the ith mesh during a tidal period and the n refers to the total number of meshes within the calculation area by taking the open boundary as the cross section of the calculation area fig 3 tidal prism with and without raft aquaculture facilities during the 36 tidal periods spanning from june 3 to july 2 a lunar month were estimated fig 14 fig 14 showed that the tidal prism would change over time with its maximum and minimum value in spring and in neap tide respectively in cases where cultivation facilities were in place the maximum tidal prism in a lunar month was 15 55 108 m3 and the minimum value was 3 62 108 m3 with average hitting 10 18 108 m3 in cases without cultivation the maximum tidal prism in a lunar month reached 16 68 108 m3 and the minimum was 4 01 108 m3 with the average being 10 88 108 m3 as such cultivation activities had reduced the average tidal prism by 6 4 in qinzhou bay 3 3 2 comparisons on half life time estimation of half life time is another important way for quantification of water exchange capability luff and pohlmann 1995 half life time refers to the time span when the conservative tracer enters the study area and its concentration reduces to half of its original value under the convective diffusion the longer half time means weaker water exchange the constructed two dimensional transport model in this study was applied to calculate half life time in setting parameters of model the starting concentration of conservative substance within the calculation area was set as 1 while the concentration at the source and open boundary were set as 0 the biological decay process was not included the horizontal dispersion coefficient was correlated with the eddy viscosity coefficient in the scaled eddy viscosity formulation based on the concentration field of the conservative substance at different time nodes the spatial distribution of the half life time of water exchange in qinzhou bay under s1 and s2 scenarios fig 15 as well as the average half life time were obtained the results showed that 1 the half life time of water exchange in qinzhou bay showcased a growing trend from the open boundary to the inlet of maowei bay in both s1 and s2 2 the half life time near to the open boundary was less than 5 days once the water flow into maowei sea through longmen channel the half life time rose from 30 days to 40 days with the longest time of over 90 days at inlet of the maowei bay fig 16 demonstrated the trend of change in average conservative substance concentration over time in qinzhou bay in s1 and s2 scenarios with the periodical part of the curve smoothed using the loess locally weighted regression algorithm the average half life time in qinzhou bay under the two scenarios therefore were obtained from the diagram which were 383 hrs and 281hrs respectively in summary the drag induced by the cultivation facilities could increase the half life time within the bay by 36 3 4 discussions 4 1 comparison with other studies numerous researches have been carried out to simulate relevant numerical hydrodynamic value concerning aquaculture some of which still neglected cultivation drag kim et al 2019 as a result hydrodynamic and the pollutant diffusion conditions under the impact of cultivation activities were often overestimated different cultivated species with different breeding density and different farming ways in different places would demonstrate varied cultivation drag which should be considered when modeling adjusting the local sea bottom manning number of the two dimensional model is most favored way of generalizing cultivation drag grant and bacher 2001 guyondet et al 2013 lin et al 2019 wu et al 2014 kuang et al 2019 however in this study the surface shear stress was included for modelling oyster cultivation hang on floating rafts in order to make the parameter calibration more accurate and practical with the consideration of cultivation drag the overall current speed during spring tide was slower than those during ebb tide consistent with other research results through observing monitoring in this same area qiu et al 2003 moreover in a semi enclosed bay like maohai bay the spatial distribution of the half life time showed a gradual increase trend from the outward open boundary to inward inlet of bay matching with other results of previous studies dumas et al 2012 filgueira et al 2014b zainol et al 2021 4 2 contributions and limitations the two dimensional model established in this study integrating the multiple drag coefficients to quantify the impacts of the oyster cultivation activities on the water exchange capability hang on floated or fixed rafts have been proved to be of reasonable accuracy of approaching actual situation moreover although three dimensional models have been developed to simulate water environmental changes in the offshore area and proved to be feasible complex database and long time running are high requirements and high conditions jia et al 2010 shi et al 2011b 2d models are much less computationally intensive than 3d models which is suitable for low depth semi closed bay wu 2004 liu et al 2008 castro díaz et al 2009 canestrelli et al 2010 goodwell et al 2014 compared with other studies o donncha et al 2013 shi et al 2011b wang et al 2018 the cultivation drag were categorized into two groups the surface drag for oyster hang on floating raft and drag within the water column for oyster hang on fixed raft from the sea bottom which was a positive contribution for simulation modeling in the future based on this hydrodynamic model and combined by more environmental monitoring data a water quality model of qinzhou bay would be delivered thus realizing supporting information on sustainable cultivation planning however limited by monitoring data this study was unable to calibrate the drag parameters by combining the observed cross section current speed and the tidal current in a longer time series thus failing to validate the reliability of parameterization in a more comprehensive fashion 4 3 implications for the oyster cultivation sustainable development oyster is usually hanged on floating and fixed rafts currently fixed aquaculture rafts cover half of the total area of semi closed bay maowei bay where had more suitability condition of low salinity affected by flow of two major rivers while most of the short and long longmen channel has been occupied by floating rafts fixed aquaculture rafts are commonly used during the breeding period 0 1 year oyster and the floating rafts are cultivated 1 3 year oyster simulation results of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model and estimation of the impacts of high intensity cultivation activities on tidal prism and half life time showed that 10 average longer day of half life time was resulting from the cultivation drag moreover the hydrodynamics drag caused by high intensity cultivation activities at longmen channel showed a significant negative impact obviously more aquaculture facilities are in place the more negative impacts on water exchange between semi closed bay and open sea area as well as the eutrophication level are demonstrated the routine on site environmental monitoring data showed that the inorganic nitrogen din and soluble reactive phosphate srp were over the limit of national controlled standard of china therefore the relationship between environmental protection and social stability need more intelligent decision some of the suggestions were as follows 1 spatial zoning and optimal planning over aquaculture activities should be provided sea areas should be classified into three groups aquaculture prohibited area aquaculture restricted area and aquaculture suitable area 2 the simulation results demonstrated that the current speed dropped noticeably within the cultivation area hydrodynamic drag caused by floating or fixed rafts was the major factor hindering the water mass exchange thus high density cultivation should not be allowed at the inner semi closed bay and short longmen channel 3 the density of cultivation in aquaculture prohibited area and aquaculture restricted area should be scientifically calculated the recommended reasonable density of cultivation could be obtained through scenario analysis and by calculating the maximum phytoplankton capacity needed for oyster keeping in summary proper arrangement of spatial location and avoiding high density cultivation could mitigate the negative impacts of cultivation activities and promote sustainable development of traditional feature agriculture industry 5 conclusions how to model the hydrodynamic drag of cultivation activities is our major concern in this study surface shear stress was determined by roughness height for characterizing the drag from floating aquaculture activities while bottom shear stress was determined by the manning number for characterizing the drag caused by bottom fixed aquaculture activities then the two dimensional model was established by integrating the multiple drag coefficients to quantify the impacts of the oyster cultivation activities on the water exchange capability tidal prism and half life time were selected for quantifying water exchange capability this established model applied in qinzhou bay the top one scale of oyster breeding of china showed that 1 with cultivation drag the average current speed was about 0 221 m s and the maximum tidal speed exceeded 2 221 m s during a flood tidal period during ebb tide the average speed was slightly higher than that during flood period at the rate of roughly 0 280 m s while the maximum speed was slower than during flood period at the rate of about 2 043 m s the more aquaculture facilities are in place at semi closed bay the more hydrodynamic drag effects are demonstrated 2 two scenarios were conducted for comparison one with cultivation activities and the other without as for tidal prism in cases where cultivation facilities were in place the average tidal prism in a 36 lunar month was 10 18 108 m3 whereas the average tidal prism was 10 88 108 m3 in cases without cultivation indicating that cultivation activities had reduced the average tidal prism by 6 4 in qinzhou bay as for half life time the average half life time in qinzhou bay in cases where cultivation facilities in place was 383 hrs which was longer than 281hrs in cases without cultivation in summary the drag induced by the cultivation facilities could increase the half life time within the bay by 36 3 credit authorship contribution statement yu huang conceptualization
