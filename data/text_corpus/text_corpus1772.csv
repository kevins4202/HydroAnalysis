8860,agricultural production in the western united states relies on water supplies from mountain source water systems that are sensitive to impacts from wildfire and a changing climate the resultant challenges to water supply forecasting directly impact agricultural producers and irrigation managers who rely on snowmelt and streamflow forecasts for crop selection and irrigation scheduling to date much research has focused on source water system processes and agricultural production separately but in this short communication we highlight a substantial need for new research connecting these disparate systems to improve forecasting accuracy we identify key knowledge and data gaps regarding the functioning of source watersheds and their contributions to agricultural water resources with associated uncertainties in the context of wildfire and changing climate in doing so we encourage researchers resource managers and agricultural producers to consider the interdependency of water supply source and sink relationships through improved observations monitoring and modeling to ensure sustainable food production in the western us graphical abstract ga1 keywords forecasting snow aridity reservoir crop selection irrigation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 agriculture in the western us relies on mountain source water systems increasingly limited water supplies threaten agricultural production especially in the western united states where irrigated crops use 80 of all surface water withdrawals maupin 2018 surface water supplies for irrigation come from rivers and reservoirs fed by seasonal melt of high elevation snowpacks that have declined over recent decades and are further impacted by increasing wildfire fassnacht and lópez moreno 2020 kampf et al 2022 li et al 2017 mcgrath et al 2023 viviroli et al 2007 there is limited research linking ecohydrological change in mountain source water systems to water availability for agricultural production despite a growing reliance on snowmelt and streamflow forecasting for crop and irrigation planning wallander et al 2022 this knowledge gap combined with a changing climate increases uncertainties with decision making and planning for reservoirs aquifers and agricultural irrigation management harmel et al 2020 mankin et al 2022a musselman et al 2021 roughly 75 of total precipitation in the western us falls in forested mountain watersheds liu et al 2022 where wildfire severity and extent is increasing abatzoglou and williams 2016 climate change could amplify the impacts of wildfire and subsequent ecohydrological feedbacks fig 1 these changes and their interactions can lead to uncertainty in various factors such as streamflow predictions flood risk and sedimentation biogeochemistry soil microbial and ecosystem functioning and snow accumulation and melt timing kampf et al 2020 kampf et al 2022 nelson et al 2022 rhoades et al 2011 williams et al 2022 moreover the impacts of fires can vary broadly based on hydrological scale and fire size but need further characterization to refine downstream impacts on agricultural production heindel et al 2022 riggan et al 1994 rust et al 2018 when combined these uncertainties complicate water supply forecasting for agricultural production qin et al 2020 wildfire may further affect water supply infrastructure through sedimentation and altered flows impacting diversion and ditch networks regardless of streamflow volumes and reservoir levels in addition wildfire patterns are changing andela et al 2017 with increasing encroachment on urban and agricultural areas previously free from the threat of fire hence research is needed to link change and disturbance in source water systems to water availability for agriculture and other downstream users to ensure sustainable food production in the future 2 uncertainty in estimating snowpack water content highlights spatiotemporal scaling issues and data gaps snow monitoring stations are not always representative of surrounding areas mankin et al 2022a moreover snow station data are fine scale point measurements that are typically more sparsely distributed than what would be ideal for forecasting blöschl 1999 especially to inform agricultural water management downstream of mountainous regions kaune et al 2020 tennant et al 2017 western us water supply forecasts are commonly made using statistical models developed to historical runoff volumes and snow water equivalent swe from snotel stations or snow courses helms et al 2008 while more complex methods have been developed including advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms their testing has been too limited to justify broad adoption at operational scales thus far fleming et al 2021 nevertheless these models trained to past data have become less reliable as the climate increasingly deviates from historical norms lehner et al 2017 livneh and badger 2020 remotely sensed snow data such as airborne lidar have increased the spatial resolution of basin wide snow metrics painter et al 2016 however landscape factors such as vegetation and topography can affect these estimates especially when snowpack depth exceeds 50 cm deems et al 2013 raleigh and small 2017 additionally the high costs of airborne lidar flights and data processing restrict widespread adoption of these methods continuing a reliance on sparsely distributed sensor networks that may delay improvements to snowmelt and streamflow forecasting 3 an uncertain future measurement gaps and incomplete understanding further complicate snowmelt and streamflow forecasting the impacts of wildfire and other disturbances e g deforestation from bark beetle outbreaks on snow accumulation and melt timing in forested areas are highly variable and amplified by a changing climate although snowpacks are generally declining across the western us fassnacht and lópez moreno 2020 reduced canopy interception of snow due to fire or disturbance can increase snowpack accumulation and reduce canopy sublimation losses moeser et al 2020 however these same canopy changes can also result in higher insolation and turbulent fluxes at the snow surface increasing melt rate harpold et al 2014 mcgrath et al 2023 characterizing these factors across the landscape can be challenging as they vary by topographic position and can be affected by decreased albedo from ash or dust on the snow surface fassnacht et al 2022 gleason et al 2013 as a result continued research is needed to improve the understanding of these interactive factors and reduce uncertainty in predictions of snowmelt rate and timing and streamflow generation from burned watersheds giovando and niemann 2022 holden et al 2012 pomeroy et al 2012 smoot and gleason 2021 similarly the magnitude of wildfire impacts on hydrologic function is spatially variable depending on burn severity topography soils climate and changes to vegetation goeking and tarboton 2020 hallema et al 2017 higher burn severity increases soil hydrophobicity and reduces soil organic matter and surface roughness reducing soil infiltration and increasing overland flow ebel and moody 2017 shakesby et al 2000 this can lead to flashier streamflow responses with faster and higher peak flows especially after high intensity rain storms moeser and douglas mankin 2021 moody and martin 2001 moreover vegetation mortality reduces evapotranspiration losses post fire potentially increasing baseflow bart and tague 2017 kinoshita and hogue 2015 conversely rapid vegetation recovery post fire can increase soil water uptake buckley et al 2012 these interactive and multifaceted effects can lead to both acute 2 3 years post fire and chronic decadal changes that can vary across burn areas hallema et al 2018 water supply reservoirs are especially important in snow dominated river basins this includes larger reservoirs with declining operating capacities e g lake mead lake powell and smaller regional reservoirs that are more likely to fill to capacity each year however wildfires and a changing climate are highlighting limitations with reservoir capacity operating levels and release rates that were designed based on historical climate and pre fire landcover the combination of unique streamflow responses flash floods and sediment and debris loading that may emerge post fire are often outside of the ranges of historical variability used during reservoir design basso et al 2021 floyd et al 2019 nyman et al 2019 therefore critical research is needed to quantify the potential impacts of wildfire and climate change on streamflow variability impacts to reservoir design and irrigation water distribution networks reservoir operating criteria are further challenged by uncertainty in the timing of watershed hydrologic recovery which can range from 3 to 45 years after fire hampton and basu 2022 wine and cadol 2016 increasing aridity and uncertain future wildfire regimes can further confound these predictions for example decreasing precipitation and increasing wildfire extent and severity in the western us may result in reduced vegetation recovery or shifts in ecological states slowing hydrologic recovery or shifting to a new hydrologic regime altogether lian et al 2021 rodman et al 2020 stevens rumann and morgan 2019 4 forest soils moderate wildfire effects on nutrient cycling water quality and ecosystem recovery severe wildfires combust forest vegetation and organic soil layers and expose mineral soils to surface runoff and leaching with direct consequences for downstream water quality rhoades et al 2011 rhoades et al 2019b however little is known about these effects on irrigated agriculture sediment and ash mobilization are the primary short term water quality concerns after severe wildfires ash is alkaline and often contains high levels of nitrogen phosphorus potassium and trace metals with lasting effects at local and regional scales rhoades et al 2019a rust et al 2018 although additions of char in irrigation water from burned lands may benefit crop production through nutrient enrichment spokas et al 2012 char may also contribute to eutrophication and harmful algal production in water bodies hohner et al 2019 and foul irrigation infrastructure for water treatment and pre treatment of water for high efficiency irrigation systems particulates are an important concern especially following high intensity rainstorms hohner et al 2016 nutrients metals and char deposited within reservoirs and floodplain sediments can also be longer term concerns for agricultural water quality when remobilized during high flows martens et al 2019 microbial communities fill essential roles in nutrient cycling and forest soil and vegetation functioning that are altered by wildfire the resilience of soil microbiomes regulates the rate of post fire vegetation recovery and nutrient cycling with downstream effects on agricultural water quality for example microbial communities can frequently transform ammonium abundant after fire to nitrate which can leach into adjacent fluvial systems microbes can also play critical roles in the methylation of mercury that is exported from burned watersheds and can bioaccumulate in the food web jensen et al 2017 additionally fire can substantially deplete ectomycorrhizal fungi emf which are critical symbiotic partners to many plant species including dominant pine vegetation in the western us recent studies have indicated that emf populations are mostly absent one year post fire especially following high severity fires nelson et al 2022 these changes likely affect the ability of seedlings to establish and grow rhoades et al 2021 with subsequent impacts on hydrology and the trajectory of ecosystem recovery widespread regeneration failures and state transitions in the forests and shrublands of the western us mahood and balch 2019 shriver et al 2019 are likely to lead to alterations in the pools and fluxes of soil nutrients mahood et al 2022 for which the role of emf reductions are largely unexplored moreover the full extent of post fire changes to microbial communities and their impacts on soil health vegetation recovery water quality and source water yields remain to be identified 5 modeling and data limitations lower confidence in water supply forecasts wildfire impacts are often considered in the context of local utilities and land disturbance blount and kroepsch 2019 however downstream impacts on agriculture can be indirect difficult to quantify and as a result remain poorly investigated process based hydrologic models can simulate future risks related to climate change and are thus important tools for improving our understanding of hydrologic responses hay et al 2011 mankin et al 2022b however no models have been developed specifically to represent fire effects or post fire recovery on ecohydrologic processes ebel et al 2023 instead integrating measurements and simulations from fire to farm involves many challenges including conceptual and data gaps for example complex terrain and spatially variable climate vegetation and geology in mountain systems confound observations and simulations of surface and groundwater flow paths frisbee et al 2011 somers and mckenzie 2020 viviroli et al 2007 water management and water supply forecasts downstream would benefit from research that improves systems level understanding of the inputs feedbacks and alterations in system dynamics due to disturbance and climate change 6 farm level impacts of a decreasing yet uncertain water supply planning crop irrigation requirements is increasingly difficult due to multi year droughts variable precipitation wildfire and disturbance in source water areas water managers and ditch companies that supply irrigation water rely on snowpack reports and streamflow monitoring for short term planning and extended weather forecasts and reservoir reports for long term planning wallander et al 2022 however without reliable long term climate outlooks and a comprehensive modeling framework as described above high resolution water supply forecasts are limited to short term i e 7 10 days insufficient water supplies post fire sediment impacts on irrigation infrastructure or poor confidence in forecasts will compel curtailments to surface and groundwater extractions this will lead producers to reduce irrigated acreage or the amount of irrigation applied or to select more drought tolerant but less productive crops schneekloth and andales 2017 it is worth noting however that water user organizations and irrigation ditch companies are attempting to coordinate water supplies river diversions reservoir releases groundwater pumping to effectuate exchanges trades and leases to maximize basin water use and address future uncertainties these efforts will be further aided by improved understanding of crop water requirements and new research focused on the development of comprehensive modeling frameworks and improved weather forecasting the timing of water delivery is also essential for planning irrigation to maximize crop yield and economic return however timing water delivery to crop requirements becomes challenging post fire and under increasing aridity as supply limitations often coincide with peak irrigation demand many modern crop hybrids e g maize have been bred with specific growth phase timing abendroth et al 2011 water limitations at key growth stages can cause substantial yield losses especially during the middle and end of season comas et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 hence peak streamflow from snowmelt and reservoir releases earlier in the season resulting in less water being available later are unlikely to provide sufficient water supply for these crops farm level water management as a result may require a shift away from full irrigation of crops with large water requirements later in the season e g maize alfalfa to crops with more flexible timing of water requirements e g sorghum sunflower regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategic irrigation shortfalls during targeted growth stages to a degree can maintain crop yields while saving crop water use comas et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 many producers however lack flexibility in their irrigation systems to apply rdi sprinkler systems often lack the capacity to rapidly replenish soil moisture after the root zone is depleted furrow systems require water to reach the end of the field but could achieve rdi by supplying fewer well timed irrigations if the ditch schedule allows if farms must use less water fully irrigating a smaller portion of a farm for a crop with high water requirements and producing an alternative crop with lower water requirements on the remainder of the farm may provide better options ultimately more advanced tools are needed for evaluating farm management options if farms are able to use rdi to save water for leasing manning et al 2018 trout and manning 2019 wichelns 2015 new research and development of adaptable decision support tools that can evaluate alternative cropping choices decision making tools e g using soil moisture evapotranspiration estimates and management options will be critical for effective management of irrigation water on farms and for the development of municipal drought response plans sedimentation in water supplies can also negatively impact irrigation systems while most surface water supplies non pressurized irrigation systems pressurized systems sprinkler and drip irrigation require settling ponds or filtration of fine sediments to prevent clogging of nozzles and emitters sediment yields post fire can reach 1000 mg l far exceeding the 50 mg l thresholds for emitter function capra and scicolone 2007 murphy et al 2012 7 thinking outside the box will advance agricultural adaptation to an uncertain future there is a critical shortage of research linking source water systems to irrigation for downstream agricultural production this has resulted in a substantial knowledge gap and a clear opportunity to develop resilient systems that can respond to uncertain agriculture water supplies in the western us snowpacks are declining and wildfire size extent and severity are increasing with large destructive fires extending into winter months and encroaching on agricultural land and the wildland urban interface e g marshall fire in colorado and the kansas grassland fire outbreak in december of 2021 a new perspective on agricultural production is now needed that encompasses both farm level decision support and broader preparation for modeling and forecasting unpredictable water supply and delivery increased focus on state of the art technology to characterize spatial distributions of snowpack water e g airborne lidar and improved snowmelt models will reduce uncertainty in

recovery flexibility and constraints in the management of infrastructure used to store and distribute source waters to agricultural users must be included explicitly in systems level research at the farm level improved irrigation management and crop genetics and selection may sustain or improve current levels of crop production but must also be considered in the context of water shortages and uncertainties in water supply numerous watershed partnerships and water management organizations have emerged across the western us with broad focus on these aspects of water resources in semi arid

one of the main barriers inhibiting the growth of rosemary cultivation in egypt s new reclamation zones chitosan is a natural biopolymer which is obtained from the deacetylation of chitin and has a high potential to improve plant productivity under stressful conditions so this study aimed to minimize the negative effects of salty irrigation water on rosemary plants by assisting them in adjusting to salt stress through foliar application of chitosan to determine the potential for increasing their cultivation in the new reclamation zones as a natural supply of essential oil rosemary plants were

technicalities application of chitosan cs is one method that has the potential to increase aromatic herbs productivity under to salt stress yang et al 2009 previous research papers reported that antioxidant and h2o2 activities of apple potato moth orchid rice white clover and grapevine treated with cs as a foliar spray x salt stress were higher than those treated with salt stress górnik et al 2008 yang et al 2009 gu 2011 jiao et al 2012 pongprayoon et al 2013 li et al 2017 furthermore cs stimulates plant cell to produce abscisic acid aba which controls the closing of plant stomata and thus reduces plant water loss when exposed to salt stress iriti and faoro 2008 lim et al 2015 within the framework of the state s keenness to support the egyptian pharmaceutical industries and encourage drug economics and its belief in the importance of increasing the production of medicinal and aromatic plants and using them in drug production programs as one of the most important national wealth that the state seeks to develop and increase the area cultivated in arid regions arid locations are characterized by their exposure to specific difficulties such as high rates of soil and water salinity which affect the yield of medicinal and aromatic plants and their active ingredients khalid and ahmed 2017 according to earlier studies rosemary plant is tolerant modest dosages of salt stress while excessive concentrations of salt cause plant damage chetouani et al 2019 thus it was expected that production of rosemary plants would not be successful in reclaimed areas of egypt so this trial is an attempt to reduce negative effects of salty irrigation water siw on rosemary plants by adapting them to salt stress via foliar spraying with cs to determine the potential for increasing their cultivation in new reclaimed zones as a natural supply of eo it should be noted that this research has never been done before particularly in egypt 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental procedures experiments were carried out in a green house at national research centre in giza egypt in two successive seasons rosemary seedlings were obtained from ministry of agriculture department of medicinal and aromatic plants in giza egypt uniform seedlings were transplanted into plastic pots 30 cm diameter and 50 cm height during the second week of february at both seasons pots were moved to a greenhouse with natural conditions in the first week of march each pot contained 10 kg of air dried soil seedlings were thinned to three plants per pot after four weeks from transplanting pots were divided into two major groups the first one was exposed to various levels of siw control plants exposed to tap water 25 7 51 3 77 0 and 102 6 mm after 45 days transplanting selection age was in accordance with schreiber and stanberey 1965 day and thompson 1975 highly soluble nacl salt was used to prepare irrigation water with different salt levels salt levels were determined by adding an appropriate amount of nacl to water and adjusting them with a portable ec meter the second group received the same treatments as the first but cs was added as a foliar spray every two weeks at a dose of 6 mg l 1 as a result of the salinity check all pots were leached by tap water every 7 days if there was no leaching when irrigating with saline water it may induce salt build up in pots all agricultural practices were carried out in accordance with the main recommendations issued by egypt s ministry of agriculture table 1 shows the physical and chemical properties of the soil used in this study as determined by jackson 1973 and cottenie et al 1982 the levels of siw and cs were determined according to the preliminary experiments that were conducted on rosemary

after cooling h2o was added to the hydrolysates before neutralization and titration total n content of raw materials was multiplied by the traditional conversion factor of 6 25 2 6 amino acids ama analysis methods used to measure free ama were based on previously described by masuda and dohmae 2010 finely powdered freeze dried samples approximately 3 g dry weight were extracted with 450 ml boiled water at 100 c for 45 min with shaking once every 10 min the extracts were filtered through filter paper and then diluted to 500 ml by adding h2o the free amino acids faa were detected using the ninhydrin colorimetric method 2 7 total phen analysis according to singleton et al 1999 the folin ciocalteu reagent was used to determine the total phen content of leaf samples in a nutshell 2 ml of crude extract 1 mg ml were diluted to 3 ml with distilled water completely combined with 0 5 ml of folin ciocalteu reagent for 3 min and then added to 2 ml of 20 w v sodium carbonate the combination was left to stand for an additional 60 min in the dark and absorbance at 650 nm was measured the calibration curve was used to determine the total phen content and the results were represented as mg of gallic acid equivalent per gram of dry weight 2 8 total flavonoids flav analysis according to pourmorad et al 2006 the total flav in leaves were measured using the aluminum chloride colorimetric method in brief 50 µl of crude extract 1 mg ml ethanol were made up to 1 ml with methanol mixed with 4 ml of distilled water and then 0 3 ml of 5 nano2 solution 0 3 ml of 10 alcl3 solution was added after 5 min of incubation and the mixture was allowed to stand for 6 min then 2 ml of 1 mol l 1 naoh solution were added final volume of the mixture was brought to 10 ml with double distilled water the mixture was allowed to stand for 15 min then it was measured at 510 nm a calibration curve was used to calculate the total flav content which was then reported as mg rutin equivalent per g of dry weight 2 9 antioxidant activity frs analysis antioxidant activity of leaf extract at full flowering stage was determined by the 1 1 diphenyl 2 picryl hydrazyl dpph assay as described by middha and purohit 2011 briefly 200 µl of each extract 100 500 µg ml were mixed with 3 8 ml dpph solution and incubated in dark at room temperature for 1 h the mixture s absorbance was then gauged at 517 nm the positive control used was ascorbic acid the sample s capacity to scavenge dpph radicals was assessed 2 10 aoea analysis assay sod ec 1 15 1 1 sod activity was determined by

isolation three replicates of each treatment were created from dried leaves a clevenger type device was used to hydro distill 800 g from each replicate for 3 h according to preliminary research the hydro distillation period should last until no more eo could be extracted clevenger 1928 divided samples and 1 l of water were added to a 2 l round bottomed flask for hydro distillation for the purpose of extracting eo the boiling temperature was set at 100 c anhydrous sodium sulphate was used to eliminate any remaining water traces from the collected eo and it was then kept at 4 c in a sealed tube until use eo content was calculated as a relative percentage w w and yield g 100 plant 1 2 12 eo analysis with the aid of a shimadzu gas chromatography mass spectrometry eo was examined using calibration curves created using gas chromatography analyses of typical constituents an external standard procedure was created to carry out the quantification by employing mass spectrum data from the nist nbs and wiley 275 l libraries retention index ri and standard materials constituent components of eos were identified adams 1995 2 13 analysis of elements dried leaves were used to measure the elemental concentrations according to anonymous 2016 micro kjeldahl method was used to measure n according to snell and snell 1954 spectrophotometer method was used to measure p using the flame photometer method described by chapman and pratt 1978 k and na levels were estimated cl was determined according the method described by adriano et al 1973 2 14 data analysis siw 5 rates and cs 2 doses were two variables in this experiment for each treatment there were 3 replicates each of which had 10 pots there were three distinct plants placed in each pot 300 pots were used in the experiment a completely random block design was used in the experiment data from both seasons were statistically evaluated using 2 way analysis of variance according to snedecor and cochran 1990 results were examined for interactions between siw and cs as well as for each factor s own effects mean or overall average data of both seasons were diagramed p values are used to evaluate significance p 0 05 is considered significant p 0 01 is considered moderately significant and p 0 001 is considered highly significant according to the stat itcf programme that method was applied in those ways foucart 1982 3 results 3 1 fresh and dry weights of aerial parts in response to siw with or without cs in table 2 and fig 1 the effects of siw cs and their interactions on fresh and dry weights of aerial parts g plant 1 during both seasons are shown changes in salt rates with or without cs had an impact on fresh and dry weights of aerial parts consequently under various salt rates especially at 102 6 mm nacl the weights of aerial parts often decreased in comparison to siw treatments addition of cs under varying siw levels increased the weights of aerial parts for siw cs and their interactions the variations in fresh and dry weights of aerial parts were highly significant p 0 001 with the exception of dry weights which were significant p 0 05 for siw x cs treatments table

response of psp to siw with or without cs a lack of psp chl a b and tcar resulted from the progressive increase in siw level however they were improved with the use of cs in both seasons table 2 fig 3 variations in chl a b and tcar were highly significant p 0 001 for siw or cs while they were significant p 0 05 for interaction between siw and cs levels table 2 3 3 effect of siw and cs on the total carb the contents of total carb increased with various rates of siw cs and cs siw interaction in both seasons table 2 fig 4 however the highest value of total carb resulted from 102 6 mm siw with cs for the first and second seasons differences in total carb were moderately significant p 0 01 for siw or cs even though they were significant p 0 05 for the interaction between levels of cs and the siw levels table 2 3 4 influence of siw and cs on the crude prot and ama a rise in siw levels resulted in a decline in the rate of prot accumulation nonetheless the improvement in prot content was caused by the addition of cs together with siw treatments table 2 fig 4 for siw or cs variations in crude prot were moderately significant p 0 01 despite the fact that they were significant p 0 05 for the interaction of cs levels with siw table 2 from rosemary plants exposed to siw either without or with cs sixteen ama were generated tables 3 and 4 as a result of various experimental treatments a number of alterations were seen in these ama prol glycine and glutamic acid made up the majority of amino acids fig 5 minor amino acids included aspartic serine histidine threonine arginine tyrosine valine methionine phenylalanine isoleucine leucine and lysine effect of the interactions treatments the maximum values of prol 36 and histidine 1 9 were recorded with plants treated with siw at 25 7 mm with cs plants treated with siw at 51 3 mm with cs resulted in the highest amounts of glycine serine arginine and isoleucine with the values of 20 1 2 5 7 9 and 5 1 respectively the maximum amounts of glutamic and lysine were produced by plants treated with siw at 51 3 mm without cs with the values of 20 1 and 1 6 respectively table 3 the highest concentration of threonine 0 8 was produced by plants exposed to control treatment while the plants treated with siw at 25 7 mm without cs had the highest aspartic content 8 3 table 3 the greatest values of methionine 3 4 and phenylalanine 7 3 were obtained from plants treated with siw at 77 mm without cs whereas the highest amounts of valine 2 6 and leucine 6 6 were obtained from the plants subjected to siw at 102 6 mm table 3 the maximum values of alanine 3 6 and tyrosine 1 9 were obtained from plants subjected to siw at 77 mm table 3 effect of cs treatments plants exposed to 0 0 mm cs gave higher values in aspartic glutamic tyrosine

leucine treatment of 102 6 mm gave the highest values of glutamic histidine threonine alanine arginine and methionine table 4 statically variations of different amino acids were recorded in tables 3 and 4 3 5 effect of siw and cs on total phen application of varied rates of siw cs and their interactions encouraged the assemblage of phen in rosemary leaves throughout both first and second seasons table5 fig 6 the highest amount of phen was found in 102 6 mm siw with cs treatment the increases in total phen were highly significant p 0 001 for siw or cs treatments but they were significant p 0 05 for the interaction treatments table 5 3 6 influence of siw and cs on total flav increased levels of siw either with or without cs resulted in increments of total flav table 5 fig 6 plants treated with cs and siw produced more flav than plants treated with siw rates the highest levels of flav were produced by plants treated with 102 6 mm siw combined with cs in both seasons the increases in total flav were highly significant p 0 001 for siw or cs treatments but they were significant p 0 05 for the interaction treatments table 5 3 7 effect of siw and cs on frs plants exposed to siw and cs modified the activity of frs in plant cells table 5 fig 7 compared to plants exposed to siw without cs plants exposed to siw with cs showed lower levels of frs changes in frs were highly significant p 0 001 for siw or cs while they were significant p 0 05 for the interactions 3 8 effect of siw and cs on aoea when plants were subjected to siw and cs the aoea pox and sod in plant cells increased table 5 fig 8 plants exposed to siw with cs had higher levels of aoea than plants subjected to siw without cs the increases in sod were highly significant p 0 001 for siw cs and their interactions the increases in pox were significant p 0 05 for siw cs and their interactions 3 9 effect of siw and cs on eo composition according to table 5 figs 9 and 10 there are no significant changes in the percentage of eo under different siw rates with or without cs during the two seasons in response to siw levels various changes in eo output g 100 plants 1 were seen however it is evident that adding cs improved the eo output changes in eo yield were significant p 0 05 for siw cs and their interactions table 5 for the siw regression equation whether it include or excludes the cs only the initial level of siw right when the water stress began was taken into consideration as the linear eo output s ultimate point fig 11 under siw levels cs and their interactions twenty constituents were found in rosemary aerial parts eo table 6 and 7 fig 12 the main constituents were 2 hydroxy 1 8 cineole α pinene borneol camphor and linalool three chemical fractions contained various recognized components the main fraction was oxygenated monoterpenes om while monoterpene hydrocarbons mh and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons sh were the minor fractions due to cs siw and their interactions many differences were seen in the main components and all chemical sections effect of the interaction treatments the control treatment without cs had the highest levels of linalool 5 2 borneol 10 1 and om 65 5 whereas 25 7 mm siw without cs yielded the highest percentage of α pinene 24 9 the highest concentration of camphor 16 2 was obtained after adding 102 6 mm siw without cs while the control treatment without cs produced the largest amount of 2 hydroxy 1 8 cineole 32 2 plants treated with 25 7 mm siw x cs produced the maximum value of sh 2 7 whereas those exposed to 51 1 mm siw gave the highest amount of mh 39 8 effect of cs treatments plants that were not exposed to cs produced higher values in α pinene linalool borneol om and sh than those treated with cs table 7 plants subjected to cs gave higher values in camphor 2 hydroxy 1 8 cineole and mh than those untreated with cs table 7 effect of siw treatments several changes were found in various identified components and their groups due to siw table 7 significant rates of various eo constituents were recorded in table 6 and 7 for siw cs and their interactions 3 10 influence of siw and cs on nutrient contents and their uptakes according to siw cs and their interactions different variations were seen in the contents and uptakes of n p k na and cl tables 8 and 9 figs 13 16 the content and uptakes of n p and k were decreased by siw but they were raised by cs application the opposite trend was found in other nutrients such as na and cl changes in n and p contents were significant p 0 05 for siw or cs but they were non significant for the interactions the variations in k contents were highly significant p 0 001 for siw or cs while they were non significant for the interactions the differences in na and cl were moderate significant p 0 01 for siw or cs while they were non significant for the interactions the variations in all elemental uptakes were highly significant p 0 001 for siw or cs whereas they were significant p 0 05 for the interactions 4 discussion siw and cs affect the physiology and biochemical characteristics of plants salehi lisar and bakhshayeshan agdam 2016 obtained results showed that siw decreases growth psp eo yield n p k and prot while eo phen flav frs aoea carb na and cl increased also different variation were recorded in ama and eo constituents on the other way exogenous applications of cs improved growth and chemical composition of rosemary herb this study detected marked reductions in fresh and dry weights of rosemary herbs which exposed to siw table 2 that may be due to siw is a source of poisonous ions that increase the osmotic pressure of soil solution jabeen and ahmed 2009 so plant roots are unable to draw water from surrounding soil and plant exposure to drought which leads to a reduction in turgor cause a decrease in expansion of plant cells followed by growth inhibition misra and srivastava 2000 however foliar application of cs is an effective approach for enhancing salinity stress tolerance of rosemary which is known to be sensitive to abiotic stress factors chetouani et al 2019 this happened because cs improved stomatal conduction and transpiration in plants under siw bistgani et al 2017 cs is a polysaccharide deduced from chitin when it metabolized and ingested by plants it starts a signaling chain reaction which is believed to be a reaction mechanism to stress bistgani et al 2017 nitric oxide ca 2 h2o2 and ethylene are key signaling molecules that are involved in the fine response system that is thus triggered that regulate stomatal opening and closure during times of stress conditions bistgani et al 2017 on the other hand cs promotes the activity of aba which is crucial for configuration of stomatal opening and reduces the rate of transpiration when there is a high rate of siw iriti and faoro 2008 lim et al 2015 current investigation indicted that siw treatments decline psp table 2 that due to the degradation of chloroplasts which causes less accumulation of chl a chl b and tcar aspinal and paleg 1981 in contrast plants subjected to cs x siw resulted in higher accumulation in psp than those exposed to siw this can be interpreted as cs may be associated with higher carboxylation efficiency exhibited by these plants which would support the conclusions reported by dos reis et al 2019 siw treatments gave an increase in carb accumulation table 2 the increase in carb under siw may be due to the storage of carb for long term energy supply sustained metabolism and enhanced plant recovery slama et al 2007 moreover this accumulation was more pronounced in cs x siw treated plants than in siw table 2 in plants treated with siw x cs higher photosynthetic activity was directly connected with a bigger accumulation of carb in leaves ávila et al 2023 it was found that the application of cs x siw promoted increases in the rates of prot and variations of ama compared to siw table2 2 4 this impact is thought to be caused by cs acting as an agent and setting off a signaling cascade that the body interprets as a pathogen attack this causes a map kinase cascade to be activated and thereby alters the expression of genes inherent in the synthesis of prot and ama associated with the induced resistance of plants agurla et al 2014 lehmann et al 2015 connection between salt stress and the buildup of antioxidant molecules is currently poorly understood due to a lack of research in response to salt stress plants produce more flav which have a dual protective effect by acting as antioxidants to prevent oxidative damage afterwards as the health promoting chemicals of edible plants martinez et al 2016 because phen and flav have the ability to frs that kills plant cells increasing the antioxidant capabilities are correlated with antioxidants substances levels polyphenols and flav huang et al 2006 ben taarit et al 2012 by activating many genes and increasing proteins and phen through the phenylpropanoid pathway cs enhances tolerance to siw hadwiger et al 1986 increases in antioxidant substances flv and phen in response to cs x siw treatments table 5 were confirmed by some pervious studies when treated with cs as a foliar spray x siw the antioxidant content of apple potato moth orchid rice white clover and grapevine was greater than when treated with salt stress górnik et al 2008 yang et al 2009 gu 2011 jiao et al 2012 pongprayoon et al 2013 li et al 2017 phen content and antioxidant properties of various aromatic species cultivated under siw x cs were enhanced pirbalouti et al 2017 moreover the ability of cs in ros scavenging table 5 might be attributed to the presence of abundant hydroxyl and amino groups in cs structure which react with ros hidangmayum et al 2019 according to these findings cs plays a basic role in improving tolerance to nacl toxicity and reduces oxidative damage by direct scavenging ros and also activating antioxidant enzymes hidangmayum et al 2019 siw treatments resulted in an increase in aoea sod and pox additionally cs x siw treated plants showed greater activities than siw treated ones table 5 exogenous cs has been observed to increase the aoea in a variety of plant species that have been exposed to stressful conditions turk 2019 yang et al 2009 ru et al 2020 enhanced aoea by cs might be due to the up regulation of their gene expression ru et al 2020 increases of aoea in response to siw were confirmed by ali et al 2022 they reported that plants respond to enhanced ros production under nacl stress by increasing the activity of antioxidant system enzymes increases in aoea under siw x cs applications more than siw treatments were confirmed by makhlouf et al 2022 they reported that in the early phases of the stress period cs has been shown to improve the aoea and also aids in decreasing lipid peroxidation in addition it has been demonstrated that cs and its derivatives are beneficial in increasing the crop s resistance to abiotic stress conditions different variations were observed in eos and their constituents in response to siw with or without cs applications tables 5 7 when rosemary plants were exposed to siw or siw x cs a number of modifications to eos and their components take place these changes can be linked to variations in the enzymatic activity of eo formations eo is considered a means of aromatic plant resistance to unfavorable conditions such as siw burbott and loomis 1969 an increase in the number of glandular hairs as well as an increase in their densities can be used to explain the rise in eo in response to siw with or without cs martínez natarén et al 2018 while the changes in eo yield can be attributed to the variations of plant dry matter when exposed siw or siw x cs el sherif et al 1990 khalid et al 2010 under this trail plants treated with siw characterized by decreased contents and uptakes of npk while those subjected to siw with cs marked by increased their contents and uptakes of npk tables 8 and 9 the opposite trend occurred in the contents and uptakes of both na and cl as they increased with siw treatments and decreased with plant exposed to cs x siw tables 8 and 9 in this case cs which has several positive charges has a strong affinity for plant cell membranes therefore increasing the plant system s responsiveness and maybe an increase in the uptake of npk and a decrease in the uptake of na and cl yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 the findings are consistent with those have been recoded by prior research on a few medicinal and aromatic plants significant differences in growth measures eo psp and mineral levels of rosemary herbs were seen after adding cs under abiotic stress helaly et al 2018 primary causes of compensatory effectiveness of cs in reducing the negative impact of siw on dry matter and eo yield were energizing of siw by prol gathering and reduction of lipid peroxidase rate which increased the integrity of thyme cell membranes bistgani et al 2017 comparing basil plants treated with cs x siw to those treated with siw led to noticeable changes in a number of morphological characteristics malekpoor et al 2016 for some basil species grown under siw and cs had a favorable effect on phen concentration and antioxidant qualities pirbalouti et al 2017 the enzymatic defense mechanisms glycogen phosphorylase glutathione s transferases ascorbate peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonialyase non enzymatic defense mechanisms pheo flav and ama morphological characteristics relative water content psp antioxidant substances macro elements and induction of genes for secondary product formation of dracocephalum and vinca were all enhanced by cs x siw but reduced the accumulation of h2o2 and malondialdehyde and preserved membrane integrity ali et al 2021 kahromi and khara 2021 siw and cs may have an effect on enzyme activity and the metabolism of eo output which could explain how these factors affect eo and its constituents burbott and loomis 1969 khalid 2015 to decrease the detrimental effects of siw and increase the chance of exporting rosemary to other nations several farmers would gain from this experiment as they will be allowed to cultivate rosemary herb in egypt s new areas also it has been reported that the manufacture of rosemary eo will reportedly use cs application due to the fact that they significantly alter its synthesis which resulted in the expansion of its biological realm as a source of eo naturally 5 conclusion there was an increase in productivity when cs was added to rosemary plants that were exposed to siw in this way cs adapted to siw by enhancing the absorption of critical nutrients increasing prot carb and antioxidants while decreasing the absorption of dangerous nutrients na and cl and frs declaration of competing interest the authors affirm that they have no known financial or interpersonal conflicts that would have seemed to have an impact on the

8861,there are numerous uses for rosemary essential oil rosmarinus officinalis including aromatherapy antioxidant activity antimicrobial and antitumour properties high salinity of irrigation water is one of the main barriers inhibiting the growth of rosemary cultivation in egypt s new reclamation zones chitosan is a natural biopolymer which is obtained from the deacetylation of chitin and has a high potential to improve plant productivity under stressful conditions so this study aimed to minimize the negative effects of salty irrigation water on rosemary plants by assisting them in adjusting to salt stress through foliar application of chitosan to determine the potential for increasing their cultivation in the new reclamation zones as a natural supply of essential oil rosemary plants were subjected to different doses of salty irrigation water 0 25 7 51 3 77 0 102 6 mm without or with chitosan 6 mg l 1 plants irrigated by salty water with spraying chitosan resulted in higher values of plant aerial parts photosynthetic pigments carbohydrates protein phenols flavonoids antioxidant enzymes peroxidase and superoxide dismutase essential oil nitrogen phosphorous and potassium than those irrigated by salty water without chitosan in contrast lower amounts were found in free radical scavenging sodium and chloride of plant treated with salty water x chitosan than those treated with

technicalities application of chitosan cs is one method that has the potential to increase aromatic herbs productivity under to salt stress yang et al 2009 previous research papers reported that antioxidant and h2o2 activities of apple potato moth orchid rice white clover and grapevine treated with cs as a foliar spray x salt stress were higher than those treated with salt stress górnik et al 2008 yang et al 2009 gu 2011 jiao et al 2012 pongprayoon et al 2013 li et al 2017 furthermore cs stimulates plant cell to produce abscisic acid aba which controls the closing of plant stomata and thus reduces plant water loss when exposed to salt stress iriti and faoro 2008 lim et al 2015 within the framework of the state s keenness to support the egyptian pharmaceutical industries and encourage drug economics and its belief in the importance of increasing the production of medicinal and aromatic plants and using them in drug production programs as one of the most important national wealth that the state seeks to develop and increase the area cultivated in arid regions arid locations are characterized by their exposure to specific difficulties such as high rates of soil and water salinity which affect the yield of medicinal and aromatic plants and their active ingredients khalid and ahmed 2017 according to earlier studies rosemary plant is tolerant modest dosages of salt stress while excessive concentrations of salt cause plant damage chetouani et al 2019 thus it was expected that production of rosemary plants would not be successful in reclaimed areas of egypt so this trial is an attempt to reduce negative effects of salty irrigation water siw on rosemary plants by adapting them to salt stress via foliar spraying with cs to determine the potential for increasing their cultivation in new reclaimed zones as a natural supply of eo it should be noted that this research has never been done before particularly in egypt 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental procedures experiments were carried out in a green house at national research centre in giza egypt in two successive seasons rosemary seedlings were obtained from ministry of agriculture department of medicinal and aromatic plants in giza egypt uniform seedlings were transplanted into plastic pots 30 cm diameter and 50 cm height during the second week of february at both seasons pots were moved to a greenhouse with natural conditions in the first week of march each pot contained 10 kg of air dried soil seedlings were thinned to three plants per pot after four weeks from transplanting pots were divided into two major groups the first one was exposed to various levels of siw control plants exposed to tap water 25 7 51 3 77 0 and 102 6 mm after 45 days transplanting selection age was in accordance with schreiber and stanberey 1965 day and thompson 1975 highly soluble nacl salt was used to prepare irrigation water with different salt levels salt levels were determined by adding an appropriate amount of nacl to water and adjusting them with a portable ec meter the second group received the same treatments as the first but cs was added as a foliar spray every two weeks at a dose of 6 mg l 1 as a result of the salinity check all pots were leached by tap water every 7 days if there was no leaching when irrigating with saline water it may induce salt build up in pots all agricultural practices were carried out in accordance with the main recommendations issued by egypt s ministry of agriculture table 1 shows the physical and chemical properties of the soil used in this study as determined by jackson 1973 and cottenie et al 1982 the levels of siw and cs were determined according to the preliminary experiments that were conducted on rosemary

flame photometer method described by chapman and pratt 1978 k and na levels were estimated cl was determined according the method described by adriano et al 1973 2 14 data analysis siw 5 rates and cs 2 doses were two variables in this experiment for each treatment there were 3 replicates each of which had 10 pots there were three distinct plants placed in each pot 300 pots were used in the experiment a completely random block design was used in the experiment data from both seasons were statistically evaluated using 2 way analysis of variance according to snedecor and cochran 1990 results were examined for interactions between siw and cs as well as for each factor s own effects mean or overall average data of both seasons were diagramed p values are used to evaluate significance p 0 05 is considered significant p 0 01 is considered moderately significant and p 0 001 is considered highly significant according to the stat itcf programme that method was applied in those ways foucart 1982 3 results 3 1 fresh and dry weights of aerial parts in response to siw with or without cs in table 2 and fig 1 the effects of siw cs and their interactions on fresh and dry weights of aerial parts g plant 1 during both seasons are shown changes in salt rates with or without cs had an impact on fresh and dry weights of aerial parts consequently under various salt rates especially at 102 6 mm nacl the weights of aerial parts often decreased in comparison to siw treatments addition of cs under varying siw levels increased the weights of aerial parts for siw cs and their interactions the variations in fresh and dry weights of aerial parts were highly significant p 0 001 with the exception of dry weights which were significant p 0 05 for siw x cs treatments table

response of psp to siw with or without cs a lack of psp chl a b and tcar resulted from the progressive increase in siw level however they were improved with the use of cs in both seasons table 2 fig 3 variations in chl a b and tcar were highly significant p 0 001 for siw or cs while they were significant p 0 05 for interaction between siw and cs levels table 2 3 3 effect of siw and cs on the total carb the contents of total carb increased with various rates of siw cs and cs siw interaction in both seasons table 2 fig 4 however the highest value of total carb resulted from 102 6 mm siw with cs for the first and second seasons differences in total carb were moderately significant p 0 01 for siw or cs even though they were significant p 0 05 for the interaction between levels of cs and the siw levels table 2 3 4 influence of siw and cs on the crude prot and ama a rise in siw levels resulted in a decline in the rate of prot accumulation nonetheless the improvement in prot content was caused by the addition of cs together with siw treatments table 2 fig 4 for siw or cs variations in crude prot were moderately significant p 0 01 despite the fact that they were significant p 0 05 for the interaction of cs levels with siw table 2 from rosemary plants exposed to siw either without or with cs sixteen ama were generated tables 3 and 4 as a result of various experimental treatments a number of alterations were seen in these ama prol glycine and glutamic acid made up the majority of amino acids fig 5 minor amino acids included aspartic serine histidine threonine arginine tyrosine

and 4 3 5 effect of siw and cs on total phen application of varied rates of siw cs and their interactions encouraged the assemblage of phen in rosemary leaves throughout both first and second seasons table5 fig 6 the highest amount of phen was found in 102 6 mm siw with cs treatment the increases in total phen were highly significant p 0 001 for siw or cs treatments but they were significant p 0

table 5 fig 8 plants exposed to siw with cs had higher levels of aoea than plants subjected to siw without cs the increases in sod were highly significant p 0 001 for siw cs and their interactions the increases in pox were significant p 0 05 for siw cs and their interactions 3 9 effect of siw and cs on eo composition according to table 5 figs 9 and 10 there are no significant changes in the percentage of eo under different siw rates with or without cs during the two seasons in response to siw levels various changes in eo output g 100 plants 1 were seen however it is evident that adding cs improved the eo output changes in eo yield were significant p 0 05 for siw cs and their interactions table 5 for the siw regression equation whether it include or excludes the cs only the initial level of siw right when the water stress began was taken into consideration as the linear eo output s ultimate point fig 11 under siw levels cs and their interactions twenty constituents were found in rosemary aerial parts eo table 6 and 7 fig 12 the main constituents were 2 hydroxy 1 8 cineole α pinene borneol camphor and linalool three chemical fractions contained various recognized components the main fraction was oxygenated monoterpenes om while monoterpene hydrocarbons mh and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons sh were the minor fractions due to cs siw and their interactions many differences were seen in the main components and all chemical sections effect of the interaction treatments the control treatment without cs had the highest levels of linalool 5 2 borneol 10 1 and om 65 5 whereas 25 7 mm siw without cs yielded the highest percentage of α pinene 24 9 the highest concentration of camphor 16 2 was obtained after adding 102 6 mm siw without cs while the control treatment without cs produced the largest amount of 2 hydroxy 1 8 cineole 32 2 plants treated with 25 7 mm siw x cs produced the maximum value of sh 2 7 whereas those exposed to 51 1 mm siw gave the highest amount of mh 39 8 effect of cs treatments plants that were not exposed to cs produced higher values in α pinene linalool borneol om and sh than those treated with cs table 7 plants subjected to cs gave higher values in camphor 2 hydroxy 1 8 cineole and mh than those untreated with cs table 7 effect of siw treatments several changes were found in various identified components and their groups due to siw table 7 significant rates of various eo constituents were recorded in table 6 and 7 for siw cs and their interactions 3 10 influence of siw and cs on nutrient contents and their uptakes according to siw cs and their interactions different variations were seen in the contents and uptakes of n p k na and cl tables 8 and 9 figs 13 16 the content and uptakes of n p and k were decreased by siw but they were raised by cs application the opposite trend was found in other nutrients such as na and cl changes in n and p contents were significant p 0 05 for siw or cs but they were non significant for the interactions the variations in k contents were highly significant p 0 001 for siw or cs while they were non significant for the interactions the differences in na and cl were moderate significant p 0 01 for siw or cs while they were non significant for the interactions the variations in all elemental uptakes were highly significant p 0 001 for siw or cs whereas they were significant p 0 05 for the interactions 4 discussion siw and cs affect the physiology and biochemical characteristics of plants salehi lisar and bakhshayeshan agdam 2016 obtained results showed that siw decreases growth psp eo yield n p k and prot while eo phen flav frs aoea carb na and cl increased also different variation were recorded in ama and eo constituents on the other way exogenous applications of cs improved growth and chemical composition of rosemary herb this study detected marked reductions in fresh and dry weights of rosemary herbs which exposed to siw table 2 that may be due to siw is a source of poisonous ions that increase the osmotic pressure of soil solution jabeen and ahmed 2009 so plant roots are unable to draw water from surrounding soil and plant exposure to drought which leads to a reduction in turgor cause a decrease in expansion of plant cells followed by growth inhibition misra and srivastava 2000 however foliar application of cs is an effective approach for enhancing salinity stress tolerance of rosemary which is known to be sensitive to abiotic stress factors chetouani et al 2019 this happened because cs improved stomatal conduction and transpiration in plants under siw bistgani et al 2017 cs is a polysaccharide deduced from chitin when it metabolized and ingested by plants it starts a signaling chain reaction which is believed to be a reaction mechanism to stress bistgani et al 2017 nitric oxide ca 2 h2o2 and ethylene are key signaling molecules that are involved in the fine response system that is thus triggered that regulate stomatal opening and closure during times of stress conditions bistgani et al 2017 on the other hand cs promotes the activity of aba which is crucial for configuration of stomatal opening and reduces the rate of transpiration when there is a high rate of siw iriti and faoro 2008 lim et al 2015 current investigation indicted that siw treatments decline psp table 2 that due to the degradation of chloroplasts which causes less accumulation of chl a chl b and tcar aspinal and paleg 1981 in contrast plants subjected to cs x siw resulted in higher accumulation in psp than those exposed to siw this can be interpreted as cs may be associated with higher carboxylation efficiency exhibited by these plants which would support the conclusions reported by dos reis et al 2019 siw treatments gave an increase in carb accumulation table 2 the increase in carb under siw may be due to the storage of carb for long term energy supply sustained metabolism and enhanced plant recovery slama et al 2007 moreover this accumulation was more pronounced in cs x siw treated plants than in siw table 2 in plants treated with siw x cs higher photosynthetic activity was directly connected with a bigger accumulation of carb in leaves ávila et al 2023 it was found that the application of cs x siw promoted increases in the rates of prot and variations of ama compared to siw table2 2 4 this impact is thought to be caused by cs acting as an agent and setting off a signaling cascade that the body interprets as a pathogen attack this causes a map kinase cascade to be activated and thereby alters the expression of genes inherent in the synthesis of prot and ama associated with the induced resistance of plants agurla et al 2014 lehmann et al 2015 connection between salt stress and the buildup of antioxidant molecules is currently poorly understood due to a lack of research in response to salt stress plants produce more flav which have a dual protective effect by acting as antioxidants to prevent oxidative damage afterwards as the health promoting chemicals of edible plants martinez et al 2016 because phen and flav have the ability to frs that kills plant cells increasing the antioxidant capabilities are correlated with antioxidants substances levels polyphenols and flav huang et al 2006 ben taarit et al 2012 by activating many genes and increasing proteins and phen through the phenylpropanoid pathway cs enhances tolerance to siw hadwiger et al 1986 increases in antioxidant substances flv and phen in response to cs x siw treatments table 5 were confirmed by some pervious studies when treated with cs as a foliar spray x siw the antioxidant content of apple potato moth orchid rice white clover and grapevine was greater than when treated with salt stress górnik et al 2008 yang et al 2009 gu 2011 jiao et al 2012 pongprayoon et al 2013 li et al 2017 phen content and antioxidant properties of various aromatic species cultivated under siw x cs were enhanced pirbalouti et al 2017 moreover the ability of cs in ros scavenging table 5 might be attributed to the presence of abundant hydroxyl and amino groups in cs structure which react with ros hidangmayum et al 2019 according to these findings cs plays a basic role in improving tolerance to nacl toxicity and reduces oxidative damage by direct scavenging ros and also activating antioxidant enzymes hidangmayum et al 2019 siw treatments resulted in an increase in aoea sod and pox additionally cs x siw treated plants showed greater activities than siw treated ones table 5 exogenous cs has been observed to increase the aoea in a variety of plant species that have been exposed to stressful conditions turk 2019 yang et al 2009 ru et al 2020 enhanced aoea by cs might be due to the up regulation of their gene expression ru et al 2020 increases of aoea in response to siw were confirmed by ali et al 2022 they reported that plants respond to enhanced ros production under nacl stress by increasing the activity of antioxidant system enzymes increases in aoea under siw x cs applications more than siw treatments were confirmed by makhlouf et al 2022 they reported that in the early phases of the stress period cs has been shown to improve the aoea and also aids in decreasing lipid peroxidation in addition it has been demonstrated that cs and its derivatives are beneficial in increasing the crop s resistance to abiotic stress conditions different variations were observed in eos and their constituents in response to siw with or without cs applications tables 5 7 when rosemary plants were exposed to siw or siw x cs a number of modifications to eos and their components take place these changes can be linked to variations in the enzymatic activity of eo formations eo is considered a means of aromatic plant resistance to unfavorable conditions such as siw burbott and loomis 1969 an increase in the number of glandular hairs as well as an increase in their densities can be used to explain the rise in eo in response to siw with or without cs martínez natarén et al 2018 while the changes in eo yield can be attributed to the variations of plant dry matter when exposed siw or siw x cs el sherif et al 1990 khalid et al 2010 under this trail plants treated with siw characterized by decreased contents and uptakes of npk while those subjected to siw with cs marked by increased their contents and uptakes of npk tables 8 and 9 the opposite trend occurred in the contents and uptakes of both na and cl as they increased with siw treatments and decreased with plant exposed to cs x siw tables 8 and 9 in this case cs which has several positive charges has a strong affinity for plant cell membranes therefore increasing the plant system s responsiveness and maybe an increase in the uptake of npk and a decrease in the uptake of na and cl yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 the findings are consistent with those have been recoded by prior research on a few medicinal and aromatic plants significant differences in growth measures eo psp and mineral levels of rosemary herbs were seen after adding cs under abiotic stress helaly et al 2018 primary causes of compensatory effectiveness of cs in reducing the negative impact of siw on dry matter and eo yield were energizing of siw by prol gathering and reduction of lipid peroxidase rate which increased the integrity of thyme cell membranes bistgani et al 2017 comparing basil plants treated with cs x siw to those treated with siw led to noticeable changes in a number of morphological characteristics malekpoor et al 2016 for some basil species grown under siw and cs had a favorable effect on phen concentration and antioxidant qualities pirbalouti et al 2017 the enzymatic defense mechanisms glycogen phosphorylase glutathione s transferases ascorbate peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonialyase non enzymatic defense mechanisms pheo flav and ama morphological characteristics relative water content psp antioxidant substances macro elements and induction of genes for secondary product formation of dracocephalum and vinca were all enhanced by cs x siw but reduced the accumulation of h2o2 and malondialdehyde and preserved membrane integrity ali et al 2021 kahromi and khara 2021 siw and cs may have an effect on enzyme activity and the metabolism of eo output which could explain how these factors affect eo and its constituents burbott and loomis 1969 khalid 2015 to decrease the detrimental effects of siw and increase the chance of exporting rosemary to other nations several farmers would gain from this experiment as they will be allowed to cultivate rosemary herb in egypt s new areas also it has been reported that the manufacture of rosemary eo will reportedly use cs application due to the fact that they significantly alter its synthesis which resulted in the expansion of its biological realm as a source of eo naturally 5 conclusion there was an increase in productivity when cs was added to rosemary plants that were exposed to siw in this way cs adapted to siw by enhancing the absorption of critical nutrients increasing prot carb and antioxidants while decreasing the absorption of dangerous nutrients na and cl and frs declaration of competing interest the authors affirm that they have no known financial or interpersonal conflicts that would have seemed to have an impact on the

8862,specific power and droplet shear stress are generally considered to be the most critical indicators of soil erosion in sprinkler irrigation but there is controversy about which indicator has a greater impact this creates uncertainty in the optimization design of low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems in this study a commonly used low pressure sprinkler i e nelson d3000 was used to carry out in soil box experiments to study the effects of specific power and average droplet shear stress at the end of a spray jet on soil erosion during sprinkler irrigation under three nozzle diameters 3 97 5 95 and 7 94 mm two operating pressures 103 and 138 kpa and two soil textures loamy sand and silty loam overall the larger specific power or average droplet shear stress resulted in higher initial and steady runoff rates and a shorter time until runoff occurs and stabilizes enlarging the specific power or average droplet shear stress could significantly increase the initial infiltration rate sediment yield and surface soil bulk density but the infiltration depth prior to runoff and surface soil porosity decreased furthermore the specific power was observed to have greater correlations than average droplet shear stress with the surface runoff rate initial infiltration rate and increase in the soil bulk density and decrease in the soil porosity after irrigation however it was weakly related to the infiltration depth prior to runoff and sediment yield indicating that the specific power could more accurately reflect the soil erosion with respect to the shear stress to minimize the risk of soil erosion a small operating pressure 103 kpa is recommended in the design of center pivot irrigation systems especially for the overhang of the system with large nozzle diameters this research can provide the technical support for soil erosion prevention under low pressure sprinkler irrigation keywords soil erosion surface runoff sediment yield specific power droplet shear stress low pressure sprinkler data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an efficient water saving irrigation method sprinkler irrigation has been widely used worldwide according to the statistics of the international commission on irrigation and drainage icid the sprinkler irrigation area in the world reached 3 8 107 ha by 2019 up to 13 of the total irrigation area hui et al 2022a nonetheless soil erosion often occurs during sprinkler irrigation resulting in the losses of soil water and fertilizer in farmland which in turn pollutes the environment silva 2006 de jong et al 2011 there are many factors affecting soil erosion in sprinkler irrigation including the soil type vegetation coverage and hydraulic performance of irrigation systems bjorneberg et al 2000 santos et al 2003 silva 2017 when the field conditions remain the same the hydraulic performance becomes the primary cause that determines soil erosion among many hydraulic performance characteristics the specific power has always been considered to be the most closely related to the occurrence of soil erosion and is commonly used to evaluate the quality of sprinkler irrigation systems yan et al 2011 al kayssi and mustafa 2016 ge et al 2020 chen et al 2021 however in recent years some researchers have observed that mechanistically soil erosion under sprinkler irrigation was mainly attributed to the droplet shear stress generated by the impact of a droplet on the ground rather than the specific power chang and hills 1993a chang and hills 1993b hui et al 2021a therefore to date which of these two indicators has a greater impact on soil erosion is still controversial and needs to be further determined as a highly automated and wide coverage sprinkler irrigation equipment the center pivot irrigation system has always played an important role in the field of agricultural irrigation worldwide ortiz et al 2010 yan et al 2020 baiamonte et al 2021 by the end of 2019 there were more than 18 000 sets of center pivot and linear move irrigation systems used in china with an irrigation area of nearly 600 000 hm2 that accounted for approximately 14 2 of the total sprinkler irrigation area hui et al 2022b notably the proportion of center pivots in the usa was as high as 84 7 usda national agricultural statistics service 2019 soil erosion is also a key factor inhibiting the promotion of center pivot irrigation systems as an important part of the irrigation system the sprinkler has a nonnegligible effect on its erosion king and bjorneberg 2011 currently the center pivot has gradually replaced medium and high pressure sprinklers with low pressure sprinklers to minimize the energy requirements of the systems thereby contributing to the global goal of carbon peak and neutrality the center pivot low pressure sprinklers are commonly classified into three types namely the fixed spray plate sprinkler fsps rotating spray plate sprinkler rsps and oscillating spray plate sprinkler osps hui et al 2021b the different structures and operating methods of these three sprinklers result in significant differences in their performances among them the fsps attains high instantaneous application rates and poor application uniformity silva 2007 yan et al 2011 in contrast the rsps has higher energy consumption in addition to their wide spraying range and relatively uniform water distribution faci et al 2001 chen et al 2020 for an osps strong wind resistance characteristics make it highly competitive in the sprinkler marketplace manke et al 2019 to clarify the soil erosion mechanisms of low pressure sprinklers scholars have extensively investigated their impact on soil from the perspective of the specific power thompson and james 1985 schneider and howell 2000 silva 2006 yan et al 2011 king and bjorneberg 2012 yan et al 2011 took the nelson d3000 sprinkler as the research object and investigated the influence of specific power on the soil infiltration surface runoff and other indicators through laboratory experiments the results showed that the runoff rate bulk density of the soil surface crust and sediment yield were generally directly proportional to the specific power while the initiation of runoff infiltration rate and infiltration depth prior to runoff were inversely proportional to the specific power king and bjorneberg 2012 developed a sealing soil infiltration model that considered transient soil seal formation on a 30 min or less time scale which explicitly used the specific powers of low pressure sprinklers as the driving factor for the formation of a soil surface seal thompson and james 1985 evaluated the infiltration characteristics of a silt loam soil affected by the specific powers of low pressure sprinklers and found that the infiltration depth prior to runoff decreased with increasing specific power meanwhile they also provided a method for determining the irrigation depth that could be applied to silt loam without the potential for runoff based on the relationship between the specific power and infiltration depth prior to runoff in contrast relatively few studies have been conducted on the effect of droplet shear stress in regard to low pressure sprinklers on soil erosion at present the relevant studies regarding shear stress effects on the soil have mainly focused on medium and high pressure sprinklers for example chang and hills 1993a used a rainbird 20jh impact sprinkler and clarified the response mechanisms of soil infiltration of three textures to shear stresses in the different droplet impact directions however low pressure sprinklers are still in a stage of revealing the distribution characteristics of droplet shear stresses hui et al 2022c and their impacts on soil erosion have not been evaluated in addition it was also found from the above studies that previous investigations on the effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on soil erosion were conducted separately and no comparative analysis of these two indicators was carried out under the same sprinkler irrigation conditions therefore it was not possible to determine which one had a greater impact on soil erosion the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to evaluate the effects of specific power and average droplet shear stress of the common low pressure sprinkler on surface runoff rate soil infiltration rate infiltration depth prior to runoff sediment yield and changes in surface soil bulk density and porosity before and after irrigation 2 to compare the correlations of specific power and average droplet shear stress with soil physical properties and then determine which droplet indicator had a greater influence on soil erosion and 3 to optimize the working parameters of the low pressure sprinkler 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the impact test of droplets on the soil using low pressure sprinklers was conducted at the zhuozhou experimental station of china agricultural university hebei china the sprinkler used in the test was the nelson d3000 nelson irrigation corp walla walla usa with a fsps equipped with a 36 grooved blue plate fig 1 which is one of the popular low pressure sprinklers for center pivot irrigation systems but it has a greater impact on the soil than other types of sprinklers king and bjorneberg 2010 the sprinkler was equipped with a pressure regulator and was mounted at a height of 120 cm above the ground to be consistent with the installation of the sprinkler on most center pivot irrigation systems the water source of the sprinkler was from groundwater meanwhile the inlet pressure of the sprinkler was monitored in real time by a pressure gauge range 0 0 6 mpa accuracy of 0 5 the droplet information of the sprinkler was obtained by a two dimensional video disdrometer 2dvd joanneum research corp graz austria the 2dvd is the most advanced precipitation particle measurement equipment in the world and is mainly composed of three parts a measurement device indoor user terminal and power supply unit fig 2 this equipment can measure the size shape aggregation state falling velocity and direction of a single precipitation particle such as rain snow hail etc in real time it is suitable for meteorology and the environment telecommunications and wave propagation industrial applications and other fields kruger and krajewski 2002 in the sprinkler droplet test the two perpendicularly disposed charge coupled device ccd cameras inside the 2dvd continuously scanned the droplets passing through the measurement area 100 100 mm2 and recorded their droplet diameter and vertical and horizontal velocity components huang et al 2010 correspondingly the water application rate at this measurement point was also collected with a catch can so as to calculate the specific power and droplet shear stress the minimum measuring droplet diameter of the 2dvd can reach 0 19 mm the soil box used in the test was made of polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe bonding with an inner diameter of 15 cm and a height of 45 cm to ensure the natural infiltration of soil water four holes with a diameter of 10 mm were made in the bottom of the soil box and a thin layer of gauze with a thickness of 2 mm was placed on the holes to reduce soil loss meanwhile a runoff hole with a diameter of 10 mm was located 5 mm below the upper brim of the soil box and connected to a rubber tube the tube conducted runoff water into a measuring cylinder with a capacity of 250 ml after the runoff water in the measuring cylinder was filled it was poured into a 3 l container for temporary storage to prevent water evaporation moreover to avoid spray droplets directly entering the measuring cylinder through the upper opening a transparent plastic cover was used the rubber tube passed through the plastic cover through a hole bored in the center of the cover in the experiment an automated weather station hobo u30 onset computer co ma usa was installed within 100 m of the measuring site collecting meteorological data such as wind speed wind direction temperature relative humidity and solar radiation in addition to the above experimental devices other devices mainly included the laser particle size analyzer ms2000 malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk electric blast drying oven wgl 230b taisite instruments ltd tianjing china and a ring knife volume of 100 cm3 chuntu hardware tool store china for measuring soil particle composition soil water content and soil bulk density respectively 2 2 experimental design the impact test of droplets on the soil was carried out by means of spraying with a single sprinkler fig 3 the test time ranged from 06 00 am to 08 00 am when solar radiation was weak the average wind speed during this period was lower than 0 5 m s 1 and the air temperature and relative humidity were approximately 25 c and 70 respectively therefore the evaporation drift loss of the sprinkler irrigation was almost zero three factors were considered in the test sprinkler operating pressure nozzle diameter and soil texture table 1 the operating pressure was set to 2 levels 103 kpa 15 psi and 138 kpa 20 psi and the nozzle diameter was set to 3 levels 3 97 mm 20 5 95 mm 30 and 7 94 mm 40 the above operating pressures and nozzle diameters were chosen because they are commonly used for low pressure sprinklers in addition 2 typical soil textures found on the north china plain loamy sand and silty loam were selected the particle size distributions of the two textured soils are shown in table 2 therefore this test consisted of 12 treatments each of which was repeated 3 times for a total of 36 trials the soil box was arranged at the end of the jet where droplets had the strongest impact on the soil hui et al 2022a to better compare the effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on soil erosion the specific distances between the soil box and sprinkler and corresponding peak water application rates specific powers and average droplet shear stresses under different treatments are depicted in table 1 before the start of the test the soil samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve according to the local average soil bulk density 1 40 g cm3 and soil porosity 47 17 the soil was evenly added into the soil box in 8 layers the depth of each soil layer was 5 cm the interface between each of the soil layers was generally leveled a 2 slope was built in by shaving the soil surface so that the surface runoff flowed from the runoff hole at the bottom of the slope when all preparations were completed the soil box was covered with a slab and the valve was opened for sprinkler irrigation when the stable operating pressure was reached the slab was uncovered and the timer began in the test the time until runoff occurs was observed and recorded and then the volume of runoff water was measured every 5 min to calculate the runoff rates under different irrigation times the irrigation time continued until a generally steady runoff rate was obtained after sprinkler irrigation the surface soil with a depth of 0 20 cm was collected with a ring knife which was used for the calculation of soil bulk density and porosity a schematic diagram of the test is shown in fig 3 2 3 calculations 2 3 1 surface runoff rate the surface runoff rate was calculated from the runoff water volume soil surface area and runoff duration by 1 r o 1000 v r a s t r where r o is the surface runoff rate mm h 1 v r is the runoff water volume m3 a s is the opening

sediment yield the runoff water collected in the container was placed in the oven at a temperature of 90 c until all water was evaporated the temperature was then adjusted to 105 c and the remaining samples were dried for 24 h until the soil mass reached a constant value yan et al 2011 the sediment yield was calculated by the following equation 4 y s m s v s where y s is the sediment yield g ml 1 m s is the mass of sediment g and v s is the total volume of runoff water collected during the test ml 2 3 5 soil bulk density the soil samples at depths of 0 20 cm collected by the ring knife were weighed immediately and then the soil water content was obtained by the drying method o kelly 2004 thereby calculating the soil bulk density 5 b s 1000 g v c r 100 w where b s is the soil bulk density

pores in a soil which can be calculated by the following equation 6 p s 1 b s d s 100 where p s is the soil porosity and d s is the soil density g cm 3 2 3 7 specific power the specific power is closely related to the droplet diameter velocity and water application rate indicating the kinetic energy of droplets per unit area and unit time at the measuring point king and bjorneberg 2010 the equation of specific power is as follows 7 s p p w i 1 n d i 3 ρ v i 2 7 2 10 6 i 1 n d i 3 where s p is the specific power w m 2 d i is the diameter of the ith droplet m v i is the resultant velocity of the ith droplet m s 1 ρ is the mass density of the droplet kg m 3 and n is the number of droplets 2 3 8 droplet shear stress the shear stress of the droplet represents the horizontal stress generated by the droplet impacting the ground ghadiri and payne 1986 which can be expressed by the following equation 8 s s 0 5 ρ v h 2 where s s is the shear stress of the droplet n m 2 and v h is the horizontal velocity of the droplet m s 1 2 4 data analysis multivariate analysis of variance manova was used to evaluate the effects of operating pressure nozzle diameter and soil texture on the surface runoff rate soil infiltration rate infiltration depth prior to runoff sediment yield and changes in surface soil bulk density and porosity before and after irrigation mean values were separated using fisher s protected least significant difference lsd at the 0 05 level by using spss 20 0 software ibm corp armonk ny usa meanwhile the pearson correlation assessed as significant at the p 0 05 level of this software was also employed to analyze the correlations among specific power average droplet shear stress and the above soil physical properties under different working conditions the pearson correlation coefficient r was used to evaluate the degree of correlation between the variables positive values represent positive correlation negative values represent negative correlation in addition regression analysis was performed using origin 8 5 software originlab northampton ma usa and applied to develop the relationships between droplet indicators and soil physical properties the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to assess the goodness of fit of these relationships a higher r 2 value reflects a higher goodness of fit 3 results 3 1 distributions of specific power and droplet shear stress fig 4 presents the specific power and average droplet shear stress at the water jet end under three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures to make a comprehensive comparison of these two droplet indicators overall there were commonalities in the distribution of the specific powers and average droplet shear stresses under different treatments that is the larger the operating pressure or nozzle diameter was the higher the specific power and average droplet shear stress whereas the effect of nozzle diameter on the specific power was obviously greater than that on the average droplet shear stress and with the increase in the operating pressure these two droplet indicators under different nozzle diameters increased to a certain extent in value but the growth momentums with the nozzle diameter decreased furthermore it was not difficult to observe that the effect of operating pressure for the smallest nozzle diameter was practically similar for the average droplet shear stress than for the specific power however the effect of the operating pressure was strongly higher for the average droplet shear stress for the other two nozzles in summary the characteristics of coexistence of similarities and differences between specific power and average droplet shear stress make it difficult to clarify the mechanisms of soil surface crusting erosion and infiltration of low pressure sprinklers ghadiri and payne 2010 caracciolo et al 2012 hui et al 2021a 3 2 effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on surface runoff rate the surface runoff rate is a key factor affecting soil erosion el kateb et al 2013 fig 5 shows the variation in the surface runoff rate with the irrigation time for two soil textures under the three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures of the sprinkler regardless of the treatment the surface runoff rate increased initially and then gradually stabilized with increasing irrigation time this phenomenon was inseparable from the infiltration characteristics of the soil when the soil was in the early stage of sprinkler irrigation almost all the water infiltrated due to its dryness and relatively large porosity by increasing the irrigation time the continuous impact of droplets on the soil gradually destroyed its structural stability as a result the crusting of the surface soil became more serious and the soil infiltration was blocked therefore the runoff rate tended to be stable from the above analysis the variation trend of the surface runoff rate with the irrigation time in low pressure sprinkler irrigation was actually universal for different treatments nonetheless due to the various specific powers and average droplet shear stresses between treatments there were certain differences in the occurrence and stability of runoff fig 6 presents the relationships between the initial and steady runoff rates times until runoff occur and stabilize and the specific power and average droplet shear stress under different working conditions in general the larger specific power or average droplet shear stress corresponded with the higher initial and steady runoff rates and shorter times until runoff occur and stabilize these results are consistent with those of yan et al 2011 who used a d3000 sprinkler on sandy loam soil this was mainly caused by the larger specific power or average droplet shear stress increasing the water application rate and accelerating the soil processes such as physical dispersion displacement pore filling and compaction according to the statistics the initial and steady runoff rates and times until runoff occur and stabilize under all treatments were distributed in ranges of 1 57 51 85 mm h 1 8 75 119 92 mm h 1 0 37 10 49 min and 35 37 70 49 min respectively fig 6 also shows that the above four runoff indicators had highly significant p 0 01 correlations with the specific power and significant p 0 05 correlations with the average droplet shear stress therefore the surface runoff was closely related to the two droplet indicators of the specific power and average droplet shear stress however relatively speaking the specific power seemed to be a more realistic reflection of the surface runoff situation these results could be explained by the relationship between the specific power and water application rate of the d3000 sprinkler hui et al 2022a therefore to further determine the effect of specific power on soil surface runoff fig 6 also shows the initial and steady runoff rates and times until runoff occur and stabilize under different treatments the nozzle diameter had an obvious influence on the various indicators of surface runoff considering the operating pressure of 103 kpa under the loamy sand as an example the initial and steady runoff rates under a nozzle diameter of 7 94 mm were 30 12 and 74 53 mm h 1 higher than those with a nozzle diameter of 3 97 mm respectively however the times until runoff occur and stabilize of at 7 94 mm were 9 28 and 29 28 min less than those at 3 97 mm respectively these outcomes indicated that increasing the nozzle diameter not only significantly p 0 05 increased the surface runoff rate but also significantly p 0 05 shortened the times until runoff occur and stabilize consequently considering the large diameter of nozzle on the overhang of the center pivot it was necessary to strengthen the prevention of surface runoff risk at the end of the system since the influence of the operating pressure on the specific power was not as great as that of the nozzle diameter a nonsignificant p 0 05 difference in the surface runoff was observed between the two operating pressures as shown in fig 6 the average differences of four runoff indicators initial and steady runoff rates and times until runoff occur and stabilize between 103 and 138 kpa under loamy sand were 3 52 mm h 1 16 49 mm h 1 2 09 min and 5 43 min respectively for the silty loam these difference values changed to 8 36 mm h 1 12 1 mm h 1 2 41 min and 4 07 min respectively in addition it was also known from the figure that the soil texture was crucial to the occurrence of surface runoff based on the comparison of runoff between loamy sand and silty loam under an operating pressure of 103 kpa and nozzle diameter of 7 94 mm although the same specific power was applied to the two soil textures the initial and steady runoff rates 31 69 and 83 28 mm h 1 respectively of loamy sand were smaller than those 34 28 and 99 51 mm h 1 respectively of silty loam this suggests that under the same sprinkler irrigation conditions the lower the soil sand content is the more serious the soil erosion sepaskhah and shahabizad 2010 3 3 effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on soil infiltration rate the soil infiltration rate affects the water uptake of sprinkler irrigation by crops to a certain extent which in turn affects the irrigation water use efficiency haghnazari et al 2015 generally the opposite relationship occurs between the soil infiltration rate and runoff rate the higher the runoff rate is the lower the soil infiltration rate and vice versa fig 7 depicts the variations in infiltration rates with irrigation time for two soil textures under the three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures of the sprinkler it was clear that the soil infiltration under sprinkler irrigation was a changing process similar to surface runoff a relatively large soil infiltration rate occurred at the beginning of sprinkler irrigation and with the extension of the irrigation time the soil infiltration rate gradually decreased and eventually stabilized the observations of thompson and james 1985 on the effect of droplet impact on the infiltration characteristics of a silt loam soil supported this process although the variation trend of the soil infiltration rate in each working condition remained the same with irrigation time it was numerically different from each other considering the initial and steady runoff rates as an example fig 8 when the soil texture and operating pressure were constant the initial infiltration rate tended to increase significantly p 0 05 as the nozzle diameter increased while the steady infiltration rate did not p 0 05 for example regarding an operating pressure of 103 kpa in loamy sand soil the initial infiltration rate of a nozzle with a diameter of 7 94 mm increased by 51 83 mm h 1 compared with that of a nozzle with a diameter of 3 97 mm the increase was as high as 157 74 however the steady infiltration rate increased by 7 43 mm h 1 and the increase was only 28 93 thus the nozzle diameter had a great influence on the initial infiltration rate fig 8 also shows that there was no significant p 0 05 difference in the initial infiltration rates between the operating pressures or soil textures the average initial infiltration rates of 103 and 138 kpa attained 60 25 and 70 97 mm h 1 respectively under loamy sand while for silty loam the corresponding results became 57 62 and 63 50 mm h 1 respectively it was not difficult to find that the maximum difference among these four values was only 13 35 mm h 1 which was much lower than that among the nozzle diameters under different working conditions mean of 52 34 mm h 1 in summary the effect of operating pressure and soil texture on the initial infiltration rate was negligible relative to the nozzle diameter part of the reason for this result could be explained by the fact that the two operating pressures in this study were relatively close resulting in a small difference in specific powers or droplet shear stresses between them fig 4 another reason was that at the beginning of sprinkler irrigation both soils were dry and less damaged by droplets therefore the irrigation water could infiltrate quickly so that the initial infiltration rate was not obviously affected by the soil texture however with the increase in the irrigation time the effect of the soil texture became apparent when the soil infiltration rate reached a steady state for example the steady infiltration rate of loamy sand in fig 8 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of silty loam which also implied that the higher the soil sand content was the greater the steady infiltration rate under the same irrigation conditions to fully understand the effect of the specific power and average shear stress on the soil infiltration rate fig 8 shows the relationships between the two droplet indicators and the initial and steady infiltration rates it was expected that the specific power and average shear stress were positively correlated with the initial infiltration rate and the correlations reached highly significant p 0 01 and significant p 0 05 levels respectively on the one hand it showed that the initial infiltration rate increased gradually with increasing specific power or average shear stress on the other hand it also revealed that the specific power seemed to have a greater effect than the average shear stress although these two droplet indicators were very effective in adjusting the initial infiltration rate these results were consistent with the previous outcomes of the initial runoff rate fig 6 however unlike the initial infiltration rate the correlations between the steady infiltration rate and specific power and average shear stress were not significant p 0 05 the steady infiltration rates were mainly in a small range of 14 56 36 82 mm h 1 under the different treatments therefore under low pressure sprinkler irrigation the steady infiltration rate actually had little relationship with the working conditions of the sprinkler even though the water application rate was relatively high for the larger operating pressure and nozzle diameter the corresponding steady runoff rate could also increase it was the dynamic relationship between the water application rate and steady runoff rate that made the steady infiltration rates under various treatments not to be apparently influenced by the impact of droplets 3 4 effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on infiltration depth prior to runoff the infiltration depth prior to runoff is critical for determining the allowable water application rate without incurring runoff of soil kay 1990 fig 9 shows the infiltration depth prior to runoff of the two soil textures under three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures of the sprinkler it was essential to note that regardless of the operating pressure and soil texture the infiltration depth prior to runoff with a nozzle with a diameter of 3 97 mm was the largest among the three nozzle diameters its infiltration depths prior to runoff under loamy sand reached 6 02 and 4 78 mm for operating pressures of 103 and 138 kpa respectively while under silty loam the infiltration depths prior to runoff of the two operating pressures became 4 84 and 2 11 mm respectively these results suggested that for the same nozzle diameter the infiltration depths prior to runoff varied significantly p 0 05 between different operating pressures or soil textures a greater operating pressure or less soil sand content could result in a smaller infiltration depth prior to runoff in addition increasing the nozzle diameter also significantly p 0 05 reduced the infiltration depth prior to runoff but the reduction trend varied with the operating pressure and soil texture fig 9 shows that the infiltration depths prior to runoff under three working conditions 103 kpa in loamy sand and 103 and 138 kpa in silty loam always presented a trend of slow and then fast reduction with increasing nozzle diameter for example the infiltration depths prior to runoff of these three working conditions under a nozzle with a diameter of 5 95 mm were reduced by 0 64 1 23 and 0 18 mm compared with the 3 97 mm nozzle respectively and the decreases were only 10 71 25 34 and 8 33 respectively however the infiltration depths prior to runoff of the 7 94 mm nozzle were 3 04 2 44 and 1 10 mm lower than those of the 5 95 mm nozzle and the decreases were as high as 56 49 67 47 and 56 93 respectively in contrast the reduction trend of 138 kpa operating pressure under loamy sand was exactly opposite to the above three working conditions its infiltration depth prior to runoff for the nozzle with a diameter of 5 95 mm was 55 51 lower than that of the 3 97 mm nozzle while the reduction of the 7 94 mm nozzle attained 19 28 compared with the 5 95 mm nozzle consequently without considering the influence of factors such as the operating pressure and soil texture the variation trend of infiltration depth prior to runoff with the nozzle diameter was very consistent with that of the specific power fig 4 this was also the reason for the highly significant p 0 01 negative correlation between the specific power and infiltration depth prior to runoff in fig 10 however it is worth noting that the specific power was not the most important factor affecting the infiltration depth prior to runoff and its correlation with the infiltration depth prior to runoff r 0 726 was slightly worse than that of the average droplet shear stress r 0 765 it can be seen from fig 9 that under the same soil texture except for the obviously lower infiltration depth prior to runoff under a working condition of 103 kpa 7 94 mm operating pressure nozzle diameter the infiltration depths prior to runoff for other nozzle diameters under an operating pressure of 103 kpa were larger than those of all nozzle diameters at 138 kpa these results were in accordance with the general trend of the average droplet shear stress with the nozzle diameter and operating pressure fig 4 this was not surprising since the increase in the droplet shear stress could accelerate the disintegration fragmentation and water absorption and expansion of soil particles as a result the porosity of the surface soil decreased rapidly which led to the relatively lower infiltration depth prior to runoff 3 5 effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on sediment yield when surface runoff occurs a certain amount of sediment can be taken away and the higher sediment yield also indicates more severe soil erosion de vente and poesen 2005 fig 11 shows the sediment yields of two soil textures under the three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures of the sprinkler obviously except for 138 kpa 3 97 mm which had a lower sediment yield the sediment yields of the other working conditions under both soil textures followed a gradual increasing trend from 103 kpa 3 97 mm to 138 kpa 7 94 mm fig 11 this was similar to the variation trend of the average droplet shear stress fig 4 it was verified that a highly significant p 0 01 correlation was found between the sediment yields and average droplet shear stresses under different treatments and its r value was as high as 0 844 fig 12 therefore the average droplet shear stress of the low pressure sprinkler was closely related to the sediment yield in addition fig 12 shows that the specific power and sediment yield also had a highly significant p 0 01 correlation however its r value 0 775 was relatively low compared to the correlation between the average droplet shear stress and sediment yield therefore from the experimental results of nozzle diameter operating pressure and soil texture the average droplet shear stress was more suitable for predicting the sediment yield in low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems than the specific power however apart from the other two factors only considering the sediment yields under different nozzle diameters the prediction effect of the specific power seemed to be better fig 4 furthermore it is essential to note from fig 11 that no matter what operating pressure and soil texture were used the sediment yield with a nozzle diameter of 3 97 mm was always lowest a larger nozzle diameter was associated with a higher specific power which in turn led to a higher sediment yield it was found that for two operating pressures 103 and 138 kpa the ranges of sediment yields at each nozzle diameter were 0 002 0 011 and 0 006 0 043 g ml 1 under loamy sand respectively the corresponding values under silty loam were 0 005 0 030 and 0 011 0 068 g ml 1 respectively this outcome suggested that the overall effect of operating pressure and soil texture on the sediment yield was still relatively significant p 0 05 and a larger operating pressure or lower soil sand content could result in a greater sediment yield in summary for silty loam to meet the requirements of sprinkler irrigation the low pressure sprinkler should have a smaller operating pressure to reduce soil erosion however the operating pressure could be increased appropriately for loamy sand 3 6 effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on surface soil bulk density and porosity the continuous impact of sprinkler droplets can destroy the originally stable structure of the soil surface the large soil particles are constantly decomposed into small particles and enter the soil pores with water thereby changing the soil bulk density and porosity tarchitzky et al 1984 lehrsch et al 2005 fig 13 illustrates the changes in surface soil bulk densities and porosities before and after irrigation of two soil textures under the three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures of the sprinkler regardless of the soil texture operating pressure and nozzle diameter the bulk density of the surface soil after irrigation increased compared with that before irrigation while the soil porosity decreased correspondingly this finding was consistent with silva et al 2006 in regard to a mediterranean soil and yan et al 2011 in regard to a sandy loam with low pressure sprinkler irrigation for example for the two operating pressures 103 and 138 kpa under silty loam their surface soil bulk densities after irrigation increased on average by 0 17 and 0 21 g cm 3 respectively compared with those before irrigation and the corresponding soil porosities decreased by an average of 6 53 and 7 80 respectively the above results also suggested that under the same soil texture even though the operating pressure had no significant p 0 05 fig 13 effect on the bulk density and porosity of surface soil after irrigation the increase in the operating pressure increased the soil bulk density and decreased the porosity in addition fig 13 shows that the nozzle diameter and soil texture had significant p 0 05 effects on the bulk density and porosity of the surface soil after irrigation considering the two working conditions 103 kpa 3 97 mm and 103 kpa 7 94 mm as examples the bulk density and porosity of the surface soil after irrigation were 1 43 g cm 3 1 53 g cm 3 45 91 and 42 18 respectively under loamy sand for silty loam the above values changed to 1 51 g cm 3 1 63 g cm 3 43 09 and 38 34 respectively these results mainly explained two problems one was that the bulk density of surface soil tended to increase as the nozzle diameter increased while the porosity decreased accordingly the other was that the bulk density and porosity of silty loam after irrigation were larger and smaller than those of loamy sand respectively indicating that under the same sprinkler irrigation conditions the lower the soil sand content was the greater the damage by droplets to determine the effect of sprinkler droplets on the physical properties of the soil surface under different treatments fig 13 shows the relationships between the increase in surface soil bulk density and the decrease in surface soil porosity after irrigation and the specific power and average droplet shear stress it was notable to observe that the specific power and average droplet shear stress had completely different effects on the physical properties of the soil surface the correlations between the specific power and increase in the soil bulk density and decrease in the porosity were highly significant p 0 01 while the average droplet shear stress had no correlation with the above two soil indicators p 0 05 this was mainly because the specific power was closely related to the water application rate in general the larger specific power corresponded with the higher initial infiltration rate fig 8 which increased the probability of small sized sediment entering the soil pores with water flow in summary in the design of low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems a small nozzle diameter and operating pressure should preferably be selected to reduce the specific power 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on soil erosion this study compared the effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on the different soil physical properties under low pressure sprinklers it was observed that the specific power and average droplet shear stress showed a certain similarity in predicting soil erosion that is the higher the specific power or average droplet shear stress is the more serious the soil erosion this result was in line with the basic judgment of scholars yan et al 2011 chang and hills 1993a on the impact of these two droplet indicators on the soil nevertheless compared with the average droplet shear stress the specific power seemed to have a greater correlation with the surface runoff rate initial infiltration rate increase in the soil bulk density and decrease in the soil porosity after irrigation however it was less correlated with the infiltration depth prior to runoff and sediment yield from the aforementioned analysis the specific power was more accurate than droplet shear stress to reflect the soil erosion in low pressure sprinkler irrigation this was contrary to the previous research results hui et al 2021a for two main reasons firstly there was a big difference in the types of sprinklers used in the two studies the previous study used a ball driven sprinkler and this study used a fixed spray plate sprinkler the spraying methods and operating pressure ranges of the two were obviously different which brought the different results of the specific power and droplet shear stress secondly the previous study mainly indicated from the theoretical point of view that the shear stress was the critical indicator affecting soil erosion relative to the specific power chang and hills 1993a chang and hills 1993b ghadiri and payne 2010 but did not compare and analyze the effects of these two indicators on soil erosion under the same sprinkler irrigation and soil conditions thereby resulting in a difference in the results from this study according to the differences between specific power and droplet shear stress in terms of the formation mechanism i e the former incorporates the factor of water application rate while the latter considers the direction of the droplet impacting the ground chang and hills 1993b ge et al 2018 hui et al 2022c it could be concluded that the water application rate actually played a key role in indirectly influencing soil erosion and it was more feasible to use a low intensity and high frequency irrigation method in the design of irrigation systems this result was consistent with the finding of santos et al 2003 on water application rate gholamhoseini et al 2013 reported an increase in corn grain yield by 63 with high frequency irrigation and by 25 with low frequency irrigation in particular for center pivot irrigation systems the travel speed should be appropriately improved to reduce the water application rate under the same amount of irrigation the additional circles traveled by the system could minimize the surface runoff in good agreement with the results reported by dong et al 2013 however it was also noted that not all soil physical properties were accurately reflected by the specific power significantly greater correlations were observed between the average droplet shear stress and infiltration depth prior to runoff and sediment yield especially for the sediment yield these findings indicated that the droplet shear stress had a nonnegligible effect on the movement of sediment taken together in low pressure sprinkler irrigation engineering the specific power was suggested to predict the overall situation of soil erosion however if only for the more accurate prediction of the sediment yield the droplet shear stress is recommended 4 2 analysis of relationships between various factors and soil erosion since the nozzle diameter and operating pressure were found to have positive effects on both the specific power and average droplet shear stress a smaller nozzle diameter and lower operating pressure are recommended to reduce soil erosion under low pressure sprinkler irrigation however for center pivot irrigation systems the nozzle diameter of each sprinkler must be scientifically and reasonably configured according to the water distribution of the system martin et al 2012 li et al 2016 the nozzle diameter of any sprinkler cannot be changed at will otherwise its application uniformity could be affected therefore only by reducing the operating pressure can the risk of soil erosion of the center pivot be minimized especially for the overhang of the system with large nozzle diameters in addition the nozzle diameter and operating pressure also have obvious influences on evaporation and drift losses in sprinkler irrigation ortiz et al 2009 maroufpoor et al 2018 in general the smaller the nozzle diameter or the larger the operating pressure is the better the atomization effect and the greater the evaporation and drift losses consequently when designing a low pressure sprinkler irrigation system it is necessary to further weigh the relationship between soil erosion and evaporation and drift losses to select the reasonable working parameters of the system which is also an urgent topic to be solved in the future furthermore from the comparison of the soil physical properties of the loamy sand and silty loam under low pressure sprinkler irrigation the soil texture had an obvious effect on soil erosion therefore under certain sprinkler irrigation conditions loam soils or soils with less sand content could be appropriately increased by surface vegetation coverage or sprayed with suitable soil amendments this is also in line with current common soil and water conservation practices hengsdijk et al 2005 huffman et al 2011 4 3 limitations and suggestions these research results can provide guidance for the accurate prediction and prevention of soil erosion in sprinkler irrigation and they can also provide a critical reference for the design of low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems however this study also has some limitations that need to be addressed in future work in this study the d3000 sprinkler was used for testing as a representative of low pressure sprinklers this kind of sprinkler is a fsps and low pressure sprinklers also include rspss and ospss due to the different structures these sprinklers vary greatly in spray method these differences lead to the variable distributions of specific powers and droplet shear stresses which result in the deviation of their impacts on soil hui et al 2022a hui et al 2022c in addition this paper only investigated soil erosion in two soils loamy sand and silty loam and there are many other soils such as sandy loam clay loam clay etc that need to be further considered therefore more sprinkler types and soil textures should be selected to conduct combined tests in future studies to comprehensively evaluate the impacts of specific power and droplet shear stress on soil erosion under low pressure sprinkler irrigation furthermore the impact test of droplets on the soil in this paper was carried out in a soil box however due to the limited volume of the soil box there is still a large gap between the soil box and actual soil conditions in the field consequently it is critical to further reveal the soil erosion caused by sprinkler irrigation under field conditions it is worth emphasizing that more attention was paid on the impact of droplets on the soil at the end of the spray jet without environmental disturbances and the situation at other distances from the sprinkler under various environments was not analyzed again a center pivot irrigation system is composed of multiple sprinklers the spraying method of multiple sprinklers is more complicated than that of a single sprinkler some of the droplets between adjacent sprinklers may collide with each other during movement ge et al 2015 this phenomenon can lead to unpredictable changes in the distributions of specific powers and droplet shear stresses hence it is highly desirable to conduct future research regarding the effect of these two droplet indicators on soil erosion under a center pivot irrigation system with multiple sprinklers 5 conclusions in general the increase in the specific power or average droplet shear stress led to the increase in the corresponding water application rate and acceleration in the soil crusting thereby increasing the initial and steady runoff rates and decreasing the time until runoff occurs and stabilizes the greater the specific power or average droplet shear stress was the higher the initial infiltration rate sediment yield and surface soil bulk density however this also led to a lower infiltration depth prior to runoff and surface soil porosity in addition it could be observed that the correlations between the specific power and initial and steady runoff rates and times until runoff occur and stabilize initial infiltration rate and increase in the soil bulk density and decrease in the soil porosity after irrigation were better than those of average droplet shear stress nonetheless the correlations with soil physical properties such as the infiltration depth prior to runoff and sediment yield were relatively poor therefore overall the specific power was more suitable for accurately predicting the soil erosion under low pressure sprinkler irrigation than the droplet shear stress furthermore considering the positive influences of nozzle diameter and operating pressure on the specific power and average droplet shear stress to minimize the risk of soil erosion in low pressure sprinkler irrigation engineering a lower operating pressure 103 kpa should be preferably selected for center pivot irrigation systems with d3000 sprinklers especially for the overhang of the system with large nozzle diameters these results are critical to the optimization of low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems and prevention of soil erosion declaration of competing interest the

8862,specific power and droplet shear stress are generally considered to be the most critical indicators of soil erosion in sprinkler irrigation but there is controversy about which indicator has a greater impact this creates uncertainty in the optimization design of low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems in this study a commonly used low pressure sprinkler i e nelson d3000 was used to carry out in soil box experiments to study the effects of specific power and average droplet shear stress at the end of a spray jet on soil erosion during sprinkler irrigation under three nozzle diameters 3 97 5 95 and 7 94 mm two operating pressures 103 and 138 kpa and two soil textures loamy sand and silty loam overall the larger specific power or average droplet shear stress resulted in higher initial and steady runoff rates and a shorter time until runoff occurs and stabilizes enlarging the specific power or average droplet shear stress could significantly increase the initial infiltration rate sediment yield and surface soil bulk density but the infiltration depth prior to runoff and surface soil porosity decreased furthermore the specific power was observed to have greater correlations than average droplet shear stress with the surface runoff rate initial infiltration rate and increase in the soil bulk density and decrease in the soil porosity after irrigation however it was weakly related to the infiltration depth prior to runoff and sediment yield indicating that the specific power could more accurately reflect the soil erosion with respect to the shear stress to minimize the risk of soil erosion a small operating pressure 103 kpa is recommended in the design of center pivot irrigation systems especially for the overhang of the system with large nozzle diameters this research can provide the technical support for soil erosion prevention under low pressure sprinkler irrigation keywords soil erosion surface runoff sediment yield specific power droplet shear stress low pressure sprinkler data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an efficient water saving irrigation method sprinkler irrigation has been widely used worldwide according to the statistics of the international commission on irrigation and drainage icid the sprinkler irrigation area in the world reached 3 8 107 ha by 2019 up to 13 of the total irrigation area hui et al 2022a nonetheless soil erosion often occurs during sprinkler irrigation resulting in the losses of soil water and fertilizer in farmland which in turn pollutes the environment silva 2006 de jong et al 2011 there are many factors affecting soil erosion in sprinkler irrigation including the soil type vegetation coverage and hydraulic performance of irrigation systems bjorneberg et al 2000 santos et al 2003 silva 2017 when the field conditions remain the same the hydraulic performance becomes the primary cause that determines soil erosion among many hydraulic performance characteristics the specific power has always been considered to be the most closely related to the occurrence of soil erosion and is commonly used to evaluate the quality of sprinkler irrigation systems yan et al 2011 al kayssi and mustafa 2016 ge et al 2020 chen et al 2021 however in recent years some researchers have observed that mechanistically soil erosion under sprinkler irrigation was mainly attributed to the droplet shear stress generated by the impact of a droplet on the ground rather than the specific power chang and hills 1993a chang and hills 1993b hui et al 2021a therefore to date which of these two indicators has a greater impact on soil erosion is still controversial and needs to be further determined as a highly automated and wide coverage sprinkler irrigation equipment the center pivot irrigation system has always played an important role in the field of agricultural irrigation worldwide ortiz et al 2010 yan et al 2020 baiamonte et al 2021 by the end of 2019 there were more than 18 000 sets of center pivot and linear move irrigation systems used in china with an irrigation area of nearly 600 000 hm2 that accounted for approximately 14 2 of the total sprinkler irrigation area hui et al 2022b notably the proportion of center pivots in the usa was as high as 84 7 usda national agricultural statistics service 2019 soil erosion is also a key factor inhibiting the promotion of center pivot irrigation systems as an important part of the irrigation system the sprinkler has a nonnegligible effect on its erosion king and bjorneberg 2011 currently the center pivot has gradually replaced medium and high pressure sprinklers with low pressure sprinklers to minimize the energy requirements of the systems thereby contributing to the global goal of carbon peak and neutrality the center pivot low pressure sprinklers are commonly classified into three types namely the fixed spray plate sprinkler fsps rotating spray plate sprinkler rsps and oscillating spray plate sprinkler osps hui et al 2021b the different structures and operating methods of these three sprinklers result in significant differences in their performances among them the fsps attains high instantaneous application rates and poor application uniformity silva 2007 yan et al 2011 in contrast the rsps has higher energy consumption in addition to their wide spraying range and relatively uniform water distribution faci et al 2001 chen et al 2020 for an osps strong wind resistance characteristics make it highly competitive in the sprinkler marketplace manke et al 2019 to clarify the soil erosion mechanisms of low pressure sprinklers scholars have extensively investigated their impact on soil from the perspective of the specific power thompson and james 1985 schneider and howell 2000 silva 2006 yan et al 2011 king and bjorneberg 2012 yan et al 2011 took the nelson d3000 sprinkler as the research object and investigated the influence of specific power on the soil infiltration surface runoff and other indicators through laboratory experiments the results showed that the runoff rate bulk density of the soil surface crust and sediment yield were generally directly proportional to the specific power while the initiation of runoff infiltration rate and infiltration depth prior to runoff were inversely proportional to the specific power king and bjorneberg 2012 developed a sealing soil infiltration model that considered transient soil seal formation on a 30 min or less time scale which explicitly used the specific powers of low pressure sprinklers as the driving factor for the formation of a soil surface seal thompson and james 1985 evaluated the infiltration characteristics of a silt loam soil affected by the specific powers of low pressure sprinklers and found that the infiltration depth prior to runoff decreased with increasing specific power meanwhile they also provided a method for determining the irrigation depth that could be applied to silt loam without the potential for runoff based on the relationship between the specific power and infiltration depth prior to runoff in contrast relatively few studies have been conducted on the effect of droplet shear stress in regard to low pressure sprinklers on soil erosion at present the relevant studies regarding shear stress effects on the soil have mainly focused on medium and high pressure sprinklers for example chang and hills 1993a used a rainbird 20jh impact sprinkler and clarified the response mechanisms of soil infiltration of three textures to shear stresses in the different droplet impact directions however low pressure sprinklers are still in a stage of revealing the distribution characteristics of droplet shear stresses hui et al 2022c and their impacts on soil erosion have not been evaluated in addition it was also found from the above studies that previous investigations on the effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on soil erosion were conducted separately and no comparative analysis of these two indicators was carried out under the same sprinkler irrigation conditions therefore it was not possible to determine which one had a greater impact on soil erosion the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to evaluate the effects of specific power and average droplet shear stress of the common low pressure sprinkler on surface runoff rate soil infiltration rate infiltration depth prior to runoff sediment yield and changes in surface soil bulk density and porosity before and after irrigation 2 to compare the correlations of specific power and average droplet shear stress with soil physical properties and then determine which droplet indicator had a greater influence on soil erosion and 3 to optimize the working parameters of the low pressure sprinkler 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the impact test of droplets on the soil using low pressure sprinklers was conducted at the zhuozhou experimental station of china agricultural university hebei china the sprinkler used in the test was the nelson d3000 nelson irrigation corp walla walla usa with a fsps equipped with a 36 grooved blue plate fig 1 which is one of the popular low pressure sprinklers for center pivot irrigation systems but it has a greater impact on the soil than other types of sprinklers king and bjorneberg 2010 the sprinkler was equipped with a pressure regulator and was mounted at a height of 120 cm above the ground to be consistent with the installation of the sprinkler on most center pivot irrigation systems the water source of the sprinkler was from groundwater meanwhile the inlet pressure of the sprinkler was monitored in real time by a pressure gauge range 0 0 6 mpa accuracy of 0 5 the droplet information of the sprinkler was obtained by a two dimensional video disdrometer 2dvd joanneum research corp graz austria the 2dvd is the most advanced precipitation particle measurement equipment in the world and is mainly composed of three parts a measurement device indoor user terminal and power supply unit fig 2 this equipment can measure the size shape aggregation state falling velocity and direction of a single precipitation particle such as rain snow hail etc in real time it is suitable for meteorology and the environment telecommunications and wave propagation industrial applications and other fields kruger and krajewski 2002 in the sprinkler droplet test the two perpendicularly disposed charge coupled device ccd cameras inside the 2dvd continuously scanned the droplets passing through the measurement area 100 100 mm2 and recorded their droplet diameter and vertical and horizontal velocity components huang et al 2010 correspondingly the water application rate at this measurement point was also collected with a catch can so as to calculate the specific power and droplet shear stress the minimum measuring droplet diameter of the 2dvd can reach 0 19 mm the soil box used in the test was made of polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe bonding with an inner diameter of 15 cm and a height of 45 cm to ensure the natural infiltration of soil water four holes with a diameter of 10 mm were made in the bottom of the soil box and a thin layer of gauze with a thickness of 2 mm was placed on the holes to reduce soil loss meanwhile a runoff hole with a diameter of 10 mm was located 5 mm below the upper brim of the soil box and connected to a rubber tube the tube conducted runoff water into a measuring cylinder with a capacity of 250 ml after the runoff water in the measuring cylinder was filled it was poured into a 3 l container for temporary storage to prevent water evaporation moreover to avoid spray droplets directly entering the measuring cylinder through the upper opening a transparent plastic cover was used the rubber tube passed through the plastic cover through a hole bored in the center of the cover in the experiment an automated weather station hobo u30 onset computer co ma usa was installed within 100 m of the measuring site collecting meteorological data such as wind speed wind direction temperature relative humidity and solar radiation in addition to the above experimental devices other devices mainly included the laser particle size analyzer ms2000 malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk electric blast drying oven wgl 230b taisite instruments ltd tianjing china and a ring knife volume of 100 cm3 chuntu hardware tool store china for measuring soil particle composition soil water content and soil bulk density respectively 2 2 experimental design the impact test of droplets on the soil was carried out by means of spraying with a single sprinkler fig 3 the test time ranged from 06 00 am to 08 00 am when solar radiation was weak the average wind speed during this period was lower than 0 5 m s 1 and the air temperature and relative humidity were approximately 25 c and 70 respectively therefore the evaporation drift loss of the sprinkler irrigation was almost zero three factors were considered in the test sprinkler operating pressure nozzle diameter and soil texture table 1 the operating pressure was set to 2 levels 103 kpa 15 psi and 138 kpa 20 psi and the nozzle diameter was set to 3 levels 3 97 mm 20 5 95 mm 30 and 7 94 mm 40 the above operating pressures and nozzle diameters were chosen because they are commonly used for low pressure sprinklers in addition 2 typical soil textures found on the north china plain loamy sand and silty loam were selected the particle size distributions of the two textured soils are shown in table 2 therefore this test consisted of 12 treatments each of which was repeated 3 times for a total of 36 trials the soil box was arranged at the end of the jet where droplets had the strongest impact on the soil hui et al 2022a to better compare the effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on soil erosion the specific distances between the soil box and sprinkler and corresponding peak water application rates specific powers and average droplet shear stresses under different treatments are depicted in table 1 before the start of the test the soil samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve according to the local average soil bulk density 1 40 g cm3 and soil porosity 47 17 the soil was evenly added into the soil box in 8 layers the depth of each soil layer was 5 cm the interface between each of the soil layers was generally leveled a 2 slope was built in by shaving the soil surface so that the surface runoff flowed from the runoff hole at the bottom of the slope when all preparations were completed the soil box was covered with a slab and the valve was opened for sprinkler irrigation when the stable operating pressure was reached the slab was uncovered and the timer began in the test the time until runoff occurs was observed and recorded and then the volume of runoff water was measured every 5 min to calculate the runoff rates under different irrigation times the irrigation time continued until a generally steady runoff rate was obtained after sprinkler irrigation the surface soil with a depth of 0 20 cm was collected with a ring knife which was used for the calculation of soil bulk density and porosity a schematic diagram of the test is shown in fig 3 2 3 calculations 2 3 1 surface runoff rate the surface runoff rate was calculated from the runoff water volume soil surface area and runoff duration by 1 r o 1000 v r a s t r where r o is the surface runoff rate mm h 1 v r is the runoff water volume m3 a s is the opening area of the soil box m2 and t r is the collection time h 2 3 2 soil infiltration rate the infiltration rate was determined by the following equation 2 i r p w r o where i r is the soil infiltration rate mm h 1 and p w is the water application rate of the sprinkler mm h 1 2 3 3 infiltration depth prior to runoff the infiltration depth prior to runoff was calculated from the measured water application rate of the sprinkler and the time before the occurrence of runoff 3 i b p w t b where i b is the infiltration depth prior to runoff mm and t b is the time until runoff occurs h 2 3 4 sediment yield the runoff water collected in the container was placed in the oven at a temperature of 90 c until all water was evaporated the temperature was then adjusted to 105 c and the remaining samples were dried for 24 h until the soil mass reached a constant value yan et al 2011 the sediment yield was calculated by the following equation 4 y s m s v s where y s is the sediment yield g ml 1 m s is the mass of sediment g and v s is the total volume of runoff water collected during the test ml 2 3 5 soil bulk density the soil samples at depths of 0 20 cm collected by the ring knife were weighed immediately and then the soil water content was obtained by the drying method o kelly 2004 thereby calculating the soil bulk density 5 b s 1000 g v c r 100 w where b s is the soil bulk density g cm 3 g is the wet weight of the soil in the ring knife g v cr is the volume of the ring knife cm3 and w is the soil water content 2 3 6 soil porosity soil porosity refers to the volume percentage of pores in a soil which can be calculated by the following equation 6 p s 1 b s d s 100 where p s is the soil porosity and d s is the soil density g cm 3 2 3 7 specific power the specific power is closely related to the droplet diameter velocity and water application rate indicating the kinetic energy of droplets per unit area and unit time at the measuring point king and bjorneberg 2010 the equation of specific power is as follows 7 s p p w i 1 n d i 3 ρ v i 2 7 2 10 6 i 1 n d i 3 where s p is the specific power w m 2 d i is the diameter of the ith droplet m v i is the resultant velocity of the ith droplet m s 1 ρ is the mass density of the droplet kg m 3 and n is the number of droplets 2 3 8 droplet shear stress the shear stress of the droplet represents the horizontal stress generated by the droplet impacting the ground ghadiri and payne 1986 which can be expressed by the following equation 8 s s 0 5 ρ v h 2 where s s is the shear stress of the droplet n m 2 and v h is the horizontal velocity of the droplet m s 1 2 4 data analysis multivariate analysis of variance manova was used to evaluate the effects of operating pressure nozzle diameter and soil texture on the surface runoff rate soil infiltration rate infiltration depth prior to runoff sediment yield and changes in surface soil bulk density and porosity before and after irrigation mean values were separated using fisher s protected least significant difference lsd at the 0 05 level by using spss 20 0 software ibm corp armonk ny usa meanwhile the pearson correlation assessed as significant at the p 0 05 level of this software was also employed to analyze the correlations among specific power average droplet shear stress and the above soil physical properties under different working conditions the pearson correlation coefficient r was used to evaluate the degree of correlation between the variables positive values represent positive correlation negative values represent negative correlation in addition regression analysis was performed using origin 8 5 software originlab northampton ma usa and applied to develop the relationships between droplet indicators and soil physical properties the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to assess the goodness of fit of these relationships a higher r 2 value reflects a higher goodness of fit 3 results 3 1 distributions of specific power and droplet shear stress fig 4 presents the specific power and average droplet shear stress at the water jet end under three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures to make a comprehensive comparison of these two droplet indicators overall there were commonalities in the distribution of the specific powers and average droplet shear stresses under different treatments that is the larger the operating pressure or nozzle diameter was the higher the specific power and average droplet shear stress whereas the effect of nozzle diameter on the specific power was obviously greater than that on the average droplet shear stress and with the increase in the operating pressure these two droplet indicators under different nozzle diameters increased to a certain extent in value but the growth momentums with the nozzle diameter decreased furthermore it was not difficult to observe that the effect of operating pressure for the smallest nozzle diameter was practically similar for the average droplet shear stress than for the specific power however the effect of the operating pressure was strongly higher for the average droplet shear stress for the other two nozzles in summary the characteristics of coexistence of similarities and differences between specific power and average droplet shear stress make it difficult to clarify the mechanisms of soil surface crusting erosion and infiltration of low pressure sprinklers ghadiri and payne 2010 caracciolo et al 2012 hui et al 2021a 3 2 effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on surface runoff rate the surface runoff rate is a key factor affecting soil erosion el kateb et al 2013 fig 5 shows the variation in the surface runoff rate with the irrigation time for two soil textures under the three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures of the sprinkler regardless of the treatment the surface runoff rate increased initially and then gradually stabilized with increasing irrigation time this phenomenon was inseparable from the infiltration characteristics of the soil when the soil was in the early stage of sprinkler irrigation almost all the water infiltrated due to its dryness and relatively large porosity by increasing the irrigation time the continuous impact of droplets on the soil gradually destroyed its structural stability as a result the crusting of the surface soil became more serious and the soil infiltration was blocked therefore the runoff rate tended to be stable from the above analysis the variation trend of the surface runoff rate with the irrigation time in low pressure sprinkler irrigation was actually universal for different treatments nonetheless due to the various specific powers and average droplet shear stresses between treatments there were certain differences in the occurrence and stability of runoff fig 6 presents the relationships between the initial and steady runoff rates times until runoff occur and stabilize and the specific power and average droplet shear stress under different working conditions in general the larger specific power or average droplet shear stress corresponded with the higher initial and steady runoff rates and shorter times until runoff occur and stabilize these results are consistent with those of yan et al 2011 who used a d3000 sprinkler on sandy loam soil this was mainly caused by the larger specific power or average droplet shear stress increasing the water application rate and accelerating the soil processes such as physical dispersion displacement pore filling and compaction according to the statistics the initial and steady runoff rates and times until runoff occur and stabilize under all treatments were distributed in ranges of 1 57 51 85 mm h 1 8 75 119 92 mm h 1 0 37 10 49 min and 35 37 70 49 min respectively fig 6 also shows that the above four runoff indicators had highly significant p 0 01 correlations with the specific power and significant p 0 05 correlations with the average droplet shear stress therefore the surface runoff was closely related to the two droplet indicators of the specific power and average droplet shear stress however relatively speaking the specific power seemed to be a more realistic reflection of the surface runoff situation these results could be explained by the relationship between the specific power and water application rate of the d3000 sprinkler hui et al 2022a therefore to further determine the effect of specific power on soil surface runoff fig 6 also shows the initial and steady runoff rates and times until runoff occur and stabilize under different treatments the nozzle diameter had an obvious influence on the various indicators of surface runoff considering the operating pressure of 103 kpa under the loamy sand as an example the initial and steady runoff rates under a nozzle diameter of 7 94 mm were 30 12 and 74 53 mm h 1 higher than those with a nozzle diameter of 3 97 mm respectively however the times until runoff occur and stabilize of at 7 94 mm were 9 28 and 29 28 min less than those at 3 97 mm respectively these outcomes indicated that increasing the nozzle diameter not only significantly p 0 05 increased the surface runoff rate but also significantly p 0 05 shortened the times until runoff occur and stabilize consequently considering the large diameter of nozzle on the overhang of the center pivot it was necessary to strengthen the prevention of surface runoff risk at the end of the system since the influence of the operating pressure on the specific power was not as great as that of the nozzle diameter a nonsignificant p 0 05 difference in the surface runoff was observed between the two operating pressures as shown in fig 6 the average differences of four runoff indicators initial and steady runoff rates and times until runoff occur and stabilize between 103 and 138 kpa under loamy sand were 3 52 mm h 1 16 49 mm h 1 2 09 min and 5 43 min respectively for the silty loam these difference values changed to 8 36 mm h 1 12 1 mm h 1 2 41 min and 4 07 min respectively in addition it was also known from the figure that the soil texture was crucial to the occurrence of surface runoff based on the comparison of runoff between loamy sand and silty loam under an operating pressure of 103 kpa and nozzle diameter of 7 94 mm although the same specific power was applied to the two soil textures the initial and steady runoff rates 31 69 and 83 28 mm h 1 respectively of loamy sand were smaller than those 34 28 and 99 51 mm h 1 respectively of silty loam this suggests that under the same sprinkler irrigation conditions the lower the soil sand content is the more serious the soil erosion sepaskhah and shahabizad 2010 3 3 effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on soil infiltration rate the soil infiltration rate affects the water uptake of sprinkler irrigation by crops to a certain extent which in turn affects the irrigation water use efficiency haghnazari et al 2015 generally the opposite relationship occurs between the soil infiltration rate and runoff rate the higher the runoff rate is the lower the soil infiltration rate and vice versa fig 7 depicts the variations in infiltration rates with irrigation time for two soil textures under the three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures of the sprinkler it was clear that the soil infiltration under sprinkler irrigation was a changing process similar to surface runoff a relatively large soil infiltration rate occurred at the beginning of sprinkler irrigation and with the extension of the irrigation time the soil infiltration rate gradually decreased and eventually stabilized the observations of thompson and james 1985 on the effect of droplet impact on the infiltration characteristics of a silt loam soil supported this process although the variation trend of the soil infiltration rate in each working condition remained the same with irrigation time it was numerically different from each other considering the initial and steady runoff rates as an example fig 8 when the soil texture and operating pressure were constant the initial infiltration rate tended to increase significantly p 0 05 as the nozzle diameter increased while the steady infiltration rate did not p 0 05 for example regarding an operating pressure of 103 kpa in loamy sand soil the initial infiltration rate of a nozzle with a diameter of 7 94 mm increased by 51 83 mm h 1 compared with that of a nozzle with a diameter of 3 97 mm the increase was as high as 157 74 however the steady infiltration rate increased by 7 43 mm h 1 and the increase was only 28 93 thus the nozzle diameter had a great influence on the initial infiltration rate fig 8 also shows that there was no significant p 0 05 difference in the initial infiltration rates between the operating pressures or soil textures the average initial infiltration rates of 103 and 138 kpa attained 60 25 and 70 97 mm h 1 respectively under loamy sand while for silty loam the corresponding results became 57 62 and 63 50 mm h 1 respectively it was not difficult to find that the maximum difference among these four values was only 13 35 mm h 1 which was much lower than that among the nozzle diameters under different working conditions mean of 52 34 mm h 1 in summary the effect of operating pressure and soil texture on the initial infiltration rate was negligible relative to the nozzle diameter part of the reason for this result could be explained by the fact that the two operating pressures in this study were relatively close resulting in a small difference in specific powers or droplet shear stresses between them fig 4 another reason was that at the beginning of sprinkler irrigation both soils were dry and less damaged by droplets therefore the irrigation water could infiltrate quickly so that the initial infiltration rate was not obviously affected by the soil texture however with the increase in the irrigation time the effect of the soil texture became apparent when the soil infiltration rate reached a steady state for example the steady infiltration rate of loamy sand in fig 8 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of silty loam which also implied that the higher the soil sand content was the greater the steady infiltration rate under the same irrigation conditions to fully understand the effect of the specific power and average shear stress on the soil infiltration rate fig 8 shows the relationships between the two droplet indicators and the initial and steady infiltration rates it was expected that the specific power and average shear stress were positively correlated with the initial infiltration rate and the correlations reached highly significant p 0 01 and significant p 0 05 levels respectively on the one hand it showed that the initial infiltration rate increased gradually with increasing specific power or average shear stress on the other hand it also revealed that the specific power seemed to have a greater effect than the average shear stress although these two droplet indicators were very effective in adjusting the initial infiltration rate these results were consistent with the previous outcomes of the initial runoff rate fig 6 however unlike the initial infiltration rate the correlations between the steady infiltration rate and specific power and average shear stress were not significant p 0 05 the steady infiltration rates were mainly in a small range of 14 56 36 82 mm h 1 under the different treatments therefore under low pressure sprinkler irrigation the steady infiltration rate actually had little relationship with the working conditions of the sprinkler even though the water application rate was relatively high for the larger operating pressure and nozzle diameter the corresponding steady runoff rate could also increase it was the dynamic relationship between the water application rate and steady runoff rate that made the steady infiltration rates under various treatments not to be apparently influenced by the impact of droplets 3 4 effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on infiltration depth prior to runoff the infiltration depth prior to runoff is critical for determining the allowable water application rate without incurring runoff of soil kay 1990 fig 9 shows the infiltration depth prior to runoff of the two soil textures under three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures of the sprinkler it was essential to note that regardless of the operating pressure and soil texture the infiltration depth prior to runoff with a nozzle with a diameter of 3 97 mm was the largest among the three nozzle diameters its infiltration depths prior to runoff under loamy sand reached 6 02 and 4 78 mm for operating pressures of 103 and 138 kpa respectively while under silty loam the infiltration depths prior to runoff of the two operating pressures became 4 84 and 2 11 mm respectively these results suggested that for the same nozzle diameter the infiltration depths prior to runoff varied significantly p 0 05 between different operating pressures or soil textures a greater operating pressure or less soil sand content could result in a smaller infiltration depth prior to runoff in addition increasing the nozzle diameter also significantly p 0 05 reduced the infiltration depth prior to runoff but the reduction trend varied with the operating pressure and soil texture fig 9 shows that the infiltration depths prior to runoff under three working conditions 103 kpa in loamy sand and 103 and 138 kpa in silty loam always presented a trend of slow and then fast reduction with increasing nozzle diameter for example the infiltration depths prior to runoff of these three working conditions under a nozzle with a diameter of 5 95 mm were reduced by 0 64 1 23 and 0 18 mm compared with the 3 97 mm nozzle respectively and the decreases were only 10 71 25 34 and 8 33 respectively however the infiltration depths prior to runoff of the 7 94 mm nozzle were 3 04 2 44 and 1 10 mm lower than those of the 5 95 mm nozzle and the decreases were as high as 56 49 67 47 and 56 93 respectively in contrast the reduction trend of 138 kpa operating pressure under loamy sand was exactly opposite to the above three working conditions its infiltration depth prior to runoff for the nozzle with a diameter of 5 95 mm was 55 51 lower than that of the 3 97 mm nozzle while the reduction of the 7 94 mm nozzle attained 19 28 compared with the 5 95 mm nozzle consequently without considering the influence of factors such as the operating pressure and soil texture the variation trend of infiltration depth prior to runoff with the nozzle diameter was very consistent with that of the specific power fig 4 this was also the reason for the highly significant p 0 01 negative correlation between the specific power and infiltration depth prior to runoff in fig 10 however it is worth noting that the specific power was not the most important factor affecting the infiltration depth prior to runoff and its correlation with the infiltration depth prior to runoff r 0 726 was slightly worse than that of the average droplet shear stress r 0 765 it can be seen from fig 9 that under the same soil texture except for the obviously lower infiltration depth prior to runoff under a working condition of 103 kpa 7 94 mm operating pressure nozzle diameter the infiltration depths prior to runoff for other nozzle diameters under an operating pressure of 103 kpa were larger than those of all nozzle diameters at 138 kpa these results were in accordance with the general trend of the average droplet shear stress with the nozzle diameter and operating pressure fig 4 this was not surprising since the increase in the droplet shear stress could accelerate the disintegration fragmentation and water absorption and expansion of soil particles as a result the porosity of the surface soil decreased rapidly which led to the relatively lower infiltration depth prior to runoff 3 5 effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on sediment yield when surface runoff occurs a certain amount of sediment can be taken away and the higher sediment yield also indicates more severe soil erosion de vente and poesen 2005 fig 11 shows the sediment yields of two soil textures under the three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures of the sprinkler obviously except for 138 kpa 3 97 mm which had a lower sediment yield the sediment yields of the other working conditions under both soil textures followed a gradual increasing trend from 103 kpa 3 97 mm to 138 kpa 7 94 mm fig 11 this was similar to the variation trend of the average droplet shear stress fig 4 it was verified that a highly significant p 0 01 correlation was found between the sediment yields and average droplet shear stresses under different treatments and its r value was as high as 0 844 fig 12 therefore the average droplet shear stress of the low pressure sprinkler was closely related to the sediment yield in addition fig 12 shows that the specific power and sediment yield also had a highly significant p 0 01 correlation however its r value 0 775 was relatively low compared to the correlation between the average droplet shear stress and sediment yield therefore from the experimental results of nozzle diameter operating pressure and soil texture the average droplet shear stress was more suitable for predicting the sediment yield in low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems than the specific power however apart from the other two factors only considering the sediment yields under different nozzle diameters the prediction effect of the specific power seemed to be better fig 4 furthermore it is essential to note from fig 11 that no matter what operating pressure and soil texture were used the sediment yield with a nozzle diameter of 3 97 mm was always lowest a larger nozzle diameter was associated with a higher specific power which in turn led to a higher sediment yield it was found that for two operating pressures 103 and 138 kpa the ranges of sediment yields at each nozzle diameter were 0 002 0 011 and 0 006 0 043 g ml 1 under loamy sand respectively the corresponding values under silty loam were 0 005 0 030 and 0 011 0 068 g ml 1 respectively this outcome suggested that the overall effect of operating pressure and soil texture on the sediment yield was still relatively significant p 0 05 and a larger operating pressure or lower soil sand content could result in a greater sediment yield in summary for silty loam to meet the requirements of sprinkler irrigation the low pressure sprinkler should have a smaller operating pressure to reduce soil erosion however the operating pressure could be increased appropriately for loamy sand 3 6 effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on surface soil bulk density and porosity the continuous impact of sprinkler droplets can destroy the originally stable structure of the soil surface the large soil particles are constantly decomposed into small particles and enter the soil pores with water thereby changing the soil bulk density and porosity tarchitzky et al 1984 lehrsch et al 2005 fig 13 illustrates the changes in surface soil bulk densities and porosities before and after irrigation of two soil textures under the three nozzle diameters and two operating pressures of the sprinkler regardless of the soil texture operating pressure and nozzle diameter the bulk density of the surface soil after irrigation increased compared with that before irrigation while the soil porosity decreased correspondingly this finding was consistent with silva et al 2006 in regard to a mediterranean soil and yan et al 2011 in regard to a sandy loam with low pressure sprinkler irrigation for example for the two operating pressures 103 and 138 kpa under silty loam their surface soil bulk densities after irrigation increased on average by 0 17 and 0 21 g cm 3 respectively compared with those before irrigation and the corresponding soil porosities decreased by an average of 6 53 and 7 80 respectively the above results also suggested that under the same soil texture even though the operating pressure had no significant p 0 05 fig 13 effect on the bulk density and porosity of surface soil after irrigation the increase in the operating pressure increased the soil bulk density and decreased the porosity in addition fig 13 shows that the nozzle diameter and soil texture had significant p 0 05 effects on the bulk density and porosity of the surface soil after irrigation considering the two working conditions 103 kpa 3 97 mm and 103 kpa 7 94 mm as examples the bulk density and porosity of the surface soil after irrigation were 1 43 g cm 3 1 53 g cm 3 45 91 and 42 18 respectively under loamy sand for silty loam the above values changed to 1 51 g cm 3 1 63 g cm 3 43 09 and 38 34 respectively these results mainly explained two problems one was that the bulk density of surface soil tended to increase as the nozzle diameter increased while the porosity decreased accordingly the other was that the bulk density and porosity of silty loam after irrigation were larger and smaller than those of loamy sand respectively indicating that under the same sprinkler irrigation conditions the lower the soil sand content was the greater the damage by droplets to determine the effect of sprinkler droplets on the physical properties of the soil surface under different treatments fig 13 shows the relationships between the increase in surface soil bulk density and the decrease in surface soil porosity after irrigation and the specific power and average droplet shear stress it was notable to observe that the specific power and average droplet shear stress had completely different effects on the physical properties of the soil surface the correlations between the specific power and increase in the soil bulk density and decrease in the porosity were highly significant p 0 01 while the average droplet shear stress had no correlation with the above two soil indicators p 0 05 this was mainly because the specific power was closely related to the water application rate in general the larger specific power corresponded with the higher initial infiltration rate fig 8 which increased the probability of small sized sediment entering the soil pores with water flow in summary in the design of low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems a small nozzle diameter and operating pressure should preferably be selected to reduce the specific power 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on soil erosion this study compared the effects of specific power and droplet shear stress on the different soil physical properties under low pressure sprinklers it was observed that the specific power and average droplet shear stress showed a certain similarity in predicting soil erosion that is the higher the specific power or average droplet shear stress is the more serious the soil erosion this result was in line with the basic judgment of scholars yan et al 2011 chang and hills 1993a on the impact of these two droplet indicators on the soil nevertheless compared with the average droplet shear stress the specific power seemed to have a greater correlation with the surface runoff rate initial infiltration rate increase in the soil bulk density and decrease in the soil porosity after irrigation however it was less correlated with the infiltration depth prior to runoff and sediment yield from the aforementioned analysis the specific power was more accurate than droplet shear stress to reflect the soil erosion in low pressure sprinkler irrigation this was contrary to the previous research results hui et al 2021a for two main reasons firstly there was a big difference in the types of sprinklers used in the two studies the previous study used a ball driven sprinkler and this study used a fixed spray plate sprinkler the spraying methods and operating pressure ranges of the two were obviously different which brought the different results of the specific power and droplet shear stress secondly the previous study mainly indicated from the theoretical point of view that the shear stress was the critical indicator affecting soil erosion relative to the specific power chang and hills 1993a chang and hills 1993b ghadiri and payne 2010 but did not compare and analyze the effects of these two indicators on soil erosion under the same sprinkler irrigation and soil conditions thereby resulting in a difference in the results from this study according to the differences between specific power and droplet shear stress in terms of the formation mechanism i e the former incorporates the factor of water application rate while the latter considers the direction of the droplet impacting the ground chang and hills 1993b ge et al 2018 hui et al 2022c it could be concluded that the water application rate actually played a key role in indirectly influencing soil erosion and it was more feasible to use a low intensity and high frequency irrigation method in the design of irrigation systems this result was consistent with the finding of santos et al 2003 on water application rate gholamhoseini et al 2013 reported an increase in corn grain yield by 63 with high frequency irrigation and by 25 with low frequency irrigation in particular for center pivot irrigation systems the travel speed should be appropriately improved to reduce the water application rate under the same amount of irrigation the additional circles traveled by the system could minimize the surface runoff in good agreement with the results reported by dong et al 2013 however it was also noted that not all soil physical properties were accurately reflected by the specific power significantly greater correlations were observed between the average droplet shear stress and infiltration depth prior to runoff and sediment yield especially for the sediment yield these findings indicated that the droplet shear stress had a nonnegligible effect on the movement of sediment taken together in low pressure sprinkler irrigation engineering the specific power was suggested to predict the overall situation of soil erosion however if only for the more accurate prediction of the sediment yield the droplet shear stress is recommended 4 2 analysis of relationships between various factors and soil erosion since the nozzle diameter and operating pressure were found to have positive effects on both the specific power and average droplet shear stress a smaller nozzle diameter and lower operating pressure are recommended to reduce soil erosion under low pressure sprinkler irrigation however for center pivot irrigation systems the nozzle diameter of each sprinkler must be scientifically and reasonably configured according to the water distribution of the system martin et al 2012 li et al 2016 the nozzle diameter of any sprinkler cannot be changed at will otherwise its application uniformity could be affected therefore only by reducing the operating pressure can the risk of soil erosion of the center pivot be minimized especially for the overhang of the system with large nozzle diameters in addition the nozzle diameter and operating pressure also have obvious influences on evaporation and drift losses in sprinkler irrigation ortiz et al 2009 maroufpoor et al 2018 in general the smaller the nozzle diameter or the larger the operating pressure is the better the atomization effect and the greater the evaporation and drift losses consequently when designing a low pressure sprinkler irrigation system it is necessary to further weigh the relationship between soil erosion and evaporation and drift losses to select the reasonable working parameters of the system which is also an urgent topic to be solved in the future furthermore from the comparison of the soil physical properties of the loamy sand and silty loam under low pressure sprinkler irrigation the soil texture had an obvious effect on soil erosion therefore under certain sprinkler irrigation conditions loam soils or soils with less sand content could be appropriately increased by surface vegetation coverage or sprayed with suitable soil amendments this is also in line with current common soil and water conservation practices hengsdijk et al 2005 huffman et al 2011 4 3 limitations and suggestions these research results can provide guidance for the accurate prediction and prevention of soil erosion in sprinkler irrigation and they can also provide a critical reference for the design of low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems however this study also has some limitations that need to be addressed in future work in this study the d3000 sprinkler was used for testing as a representative of low pressure sprinklers this kind of sprinkler is a fsps and low pressure sprinklers also include rspss and ospss due to the different structures these sprinklers vary greatly in spray method these differences lead to the variable distributions of specific powers and droplet shear stresses which result in the deviation of their impacts on soil hui et al 2022a hui et al 2022c in addition this paper only investigated soil erosion in two soils loamy sand and silty loam and there are many other soils such as sandy loam clay loam clay etc that need to be further considered therefore more sprinkler types and soil textures should be selected to conduct combined tests in future studies to comprehensively evaluate the impacts of specific power and droplet shear stress on soil erosion under low pressure sprinkler irrigation furthermore the impact test of droplets on the soil in this paper was carried out in a soil box however due to the limited volume of the soil box there is still a large gap between the soil box and actual soil conditions in the field consequently it is critical to further reveal the soil erosion caused by sprinkler irrigation under field conditions it is worth emphasizing that more attention was paid on the impact of droplets on the soil at the end of the spray jet without environmental disturbances and the situation at other distances from the sprinkler under various environments was not analyzed again a center pivot irrigation system is composed of multiple sprinklers the spraying method of multiple sprinklers is more complicated than that of a single sprinkler some of the droplets between adjacent sprinklers may collide with each other during movement ge et al 2015 this phenomenon can lead to unpredictable changes in the distributions of specific powers and droplet shear stresses hence it is highly desirable to conduct future research regarding the effect of these two droplet indicators on soil erosion under a center pivot irrigation system with multiple sprinklers 5 conclusions in general the increase in the specific power or average droplet shear stress led to the increase in the corresponding water application rate and acceleration in the soil crusting thereby increasing the initial and steady runoff rates and decreasing the time until runoff occurs and stabilizes the greater the specific power or average droplet shear stress was the higher the initial infiltration rate sediment yield and surface soil bulk density however this also led to a lower infiltration depth prior to runoff and surface soil porosity in addition it could be observed that the correlations between the specific power and initial and steady runoff rates and times until runoff occur and stabilize initial infiltration rate and increase in the soil bulk density and decrease in the soil porosity after irrigation were better than those of average droplet shear stress nonetheless the correlations with soil physical properties such as the infiltration depth prior to runoff and sediment yield were relatively poor therefore overall the specific power was more suitable for accurately predicting the soil erosion under low pressure sprinkler irrigation than the droplet shear stress furthermore considering the positive influences of nozzle diameter and operating pressure on the specific power and average droplet shear stress to minimize the risk of soil erosion in low pressure sprinkler irrigation engineering a lower operating pressure 103 kpa should be preferably selected for center pivot irrigation systems with d3000 sprinklers especially for the overhang of the system with large nozzle diameters these results are critical to the optimization of low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems and prevention of soil erosion declaration of competing interest the

8863,the determination of field capacity fc irrigation thresholds and irrigation amounts is characterized by site specific soil hydraulic properties shps this study conducted in two zones zone 1 and zone 2 delineated based on soil topography and historical crop yield in alabama usa focused on determining zone specific fc using negligible drainage flux q fc criterion the hydrus 1d model was used to optimize zone specific shps using measured soil matric potential h the zone specific fcs were determined using optimized and raw shps at 0 01 cm day as q fc the results showed that the optimized fc at q fc was at 39 kpa in zone 1 and raw fc was at 15 kpa however in zone 2 optimized fc was at 25 kpa and raw fc was at 59 kpa to validate that optimized values are more accurate than raw values a relationship between accumulated crop evapotranspiration et c and required irrigation amount was determined using optimized parameters shps and fc and showed a stronger correlation in both zones than using raw parameters shps and fc at flux based fc the optimized irrigation thresholds and amounts in zone 1 were 88 kpa and 20 mm and raw irrigation threshold and amount were 58 kpa and 33 mm respectively in zone 2 the optimized irrigation thresholds and amounts were 45 kpa and 18 mm and raw irrigation threshold and amount were 116 kpa and 14 mm respectively therefore using raw and benchmark fc can result in inefficient irrigation strategies the proposed novel method of optimizing zone specific fc and irrigation thresholds can help with adopting timely best irrigation management

evapotranspiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction field capacity fc criterion is important in defining the initial hydrologic state of soils which affects both agronomic and hydrologic applications and determining the effective soil water available to plants despite its significance the definition of fc remains obscure for well defined hydrologic states of soils traditionally a static soil matric potential h of 10 kpa for coarse textured soils and 33 kpa for fine textured soils has been used to represent fc rivers and shipp 1972 however studies have indicated discrepancies and uncertainty associated with the static nature of fc liang et al 2016 and these values change based on soil physical and hydraulic characteristics and soil profile depth considered which suggests fc is dynamic assouline and or 2014 lena et al 2022 nemes et al 2011 twarakavi et al 2009 as the upper limit of soil water holding capacity changes dynamically the available soil water will change accordingly ultimately varying irrigation recommendations lena et al 2022 defining such limits is imperative to improving irrigation water use efficiency and agricultural water management practices de jong van lier 2017 irmak et al 2016 pinheiro et al 2019 lena et al 2022 romano et al 2011 since it allows us to define irrigation timing and depth considering a soil water depletion swd therefore an accurate determination of h at fc that accounts for site specific soil characteristics is the first step when the objective is to implement irrigation best management practices and mitigate the negative impact associated with over or under application of irrigation water due to high uncertainty onerous and time consuming measurements of fc in the field and laboratory the idea of internal drainage flux has been a topic of interest lena et al 2022 meyer and gee 1999 twarakavi et al 2009 computer codes have been used to determine fc when the drainage flux at the bottom of a pre defined soil profile reaches a negligible value schroeder et al 1994 used help software to estimate fc at negligible drainage flux q fc ranging from 0 001 cm day to 0 1 cm day depending on the application hillel 1998 recommended a value of 0 05 cm day as q fc to estimate fc meyer and gee 1999 found consistency with the original range from 0 001 cm day to 0 1 cm day to interpret fc twarakavi et al 2009 tested three q fc values 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 cm day using the hydrus 1d model to determine fc for homogeneous soil profile and a value of 0 01 cm day was recommended to represent fc across a range of usa soils although many studies have proposed the use of different q fc values to represent fc the impact of different q fc values on irrigation calculations is hardly ever investigated one of the few examples is the study conducted by lena et al 2022 in which different q fc were tested to estimate the soil matric potential at fc for irrigation recommendations in alabama and the fc using 0 01 cm day and 0 025 cm day resulted best for irrigation recommendations vs accumulated crop evapotranspiration etc relationships in fine textured and coarse textured soils respectively this study showed the importance of site specific evaluation of q fc to reduce the uncertainties in fc determination and irrigation recommendations however the study did not optimize the fc and irrigation thresholds irrigation threshold refers to soil matric potential h at which irrigation is initiated further kumar et al 2022a optimized the soil hydraulic properties shps but did not optimize the fc to determine irrigation thresholds for irrigation scheduling and mentioned it as a limitation of the study therefore we propose a method to optimize the fc and address the innovative solution for the research gap in the study investigated by kumar et al 2022a and lena et al 2022 the use of q fc to estimate fc has been well accepted by the scientific community however the accurate determination of fc highly depends on well defined and effective shps i e soil water retention curve swrc and hydraulic conductivity curve hcc field or laboratory measurements of shps have been considered the standard methods since they provide site specific information about soil physical characteristics but these methods are time consuming onerous and include disparities in the measurements diamantopoulos et al 2015 additionally a recent study indicated discrepancies between field observations and fc determined in the laboratory based shps which impacted the irrigation scheduling evett et al 2019 an alternative is to use estimated shps based on soil texture or pedo transfer functions schaap et al 2001 with the drawback of not being as precise as measured shps one way to overcome the limitations regarding measured and estimated shps is the optimization of shps with h or soil water content θ measured using soil sensors in the field accurate determinations of swrc and hydraulic conductivity k help in characterizing the soil water dynamics diamantopoulos et al 2013 iden et al 2021 which is important in irrigation scheduling therefore optimizing the k θ h relationship is desirable in q fc based determination of fc and irrigation scheduling to reduce uncertainty in our knowledge there has been a lack of research into the effects of optimized shps on determining fc and irrigation recommendations in actual field conditions the accurate shps enable researchers and farmers to increase water use efficiency improve crop yield and maintain water resources by using improved irrigation management strategies jabro and stevens 2022 we hypothesize that optimized shps that also take into consideration the differences in site specific properties in the crop field can not only improve the determination of fc but also the irrigation threshold values over the measured or estimated shps during the growing season which can help with irrigation scheduling decisions thus for site specific management it is best to delineate a crop field into different management zones based on soil texture topography historical crop yield etc kumar et al 2022a and determine zone specific fc to avoid discrepancies by assuming one static fc throughout the field for irrigation water management real time h or θ monitoring using sensors in the soil profiles to schedule irrigation has been gaining attention during the last decade fontanet et al 2020 although this sensor based irrigation can improve irrigation efficiency and reduce water stress irmak et al 2010 leininger et al 2019 these improvements are only achieved if the k θ h relationship is accurately and precisely defined due to variability in soil hydraulic and physical characteristics different irrigation thresholds have been adopted to trigger irrigation among the soil types leininger et al 2019 recommended an h of 50 kpa for very fine sandy loam textured soil in peanut field and irmak et al 2016 recommended values ranging from 20 kpa to 25 kpa for fine sandy soils and from 90 kpa to 110 kpa for silt loam and silty clay loam soils in corn field however a single irrigation threshold has been adopted for the entire field and a single threshold does not account for site specific variability in h or θ due to soil physical properties topography and soil water dynamics monitored within the field and these values were recommended considering non optimized shps the determination of fc using q fc has shown promise in determining irrigation thresholds however investigations to quantify the impact of zone specific optimized shps and fc at q fc on determination of zone specific irrigation thresholds considering discrepancies in soil water dynamics monitored in the field are hardly ever conducted recently kumar et al 2022a optimized the irrigation thresholds using the soil textured based fc without considering zone specific characteristics and indicated the limitation of not optimizing the fc similarly studies irmak et al 2016 lena et al 2022 used the shps determined in the laboratory or based on the soil texture assuming fc based on soil texture these are raw or observed shps and these shps do not account for soil water dynamics in determining the irrigation thresholds and fc optimizing the raw or observed shps optimize the fc and result in optimized irrigation thresholds to schedule site specific irrigation zone specific differences in h or θ can be due to soil physical properties topographic gradient and vegetation kumar et al 2022a hence improved and optimized zone specific shps using measured h or θ can help in determining upper limit of soil water holding capacity consequently improving irrigation strategy during the growing season the specific objectives of this study were 1 to develop a modeling approach of optimizing zone specific fc considering a q fc criterion using the hydrus 1d model and investigate the impact of zone specific optimized shps on the irrigation recommendation and 2 to investigate the effect of zone specific optimized fc and shps on the zone specific irrigation thresholds and irrigation amounts at soil water depletion swd the study was conducted in two irrigated management zones of a delineated crop field we used optimized and raw zone specific shps in this investigation to validate the fc simulations using optimized and raw shps we estimated the relationship between accumulated crop evapotranspiration etc and required irrigation amounts for irrigation recommendations using optimized and raw shps in this article we use term raw shps for the measurements obtained in the laboratory using hyprop measurement systems kumar et al 2022a and optimized shps resulted after

rainfall by the end of the growing season the time of rainfall is critical to reducing the crop water stress therefore it is essential to plan irrigation according to the site specific conditions and crop water demand the field was delineated in three irrigation management zones zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 based on soil texture topography and historical yield data kumar et al 2022a 2022b using management zone analyst software mza 1 01 usda ars columbia mo usa fridgen et al 2004 the slope in the field varied from 0 to 10 the corn grain yield was monitored using a yield monitor mounted on the combine we also generated a topographic wetness index twi in the field beven kirkby 1979 and twi varied from 5 11 to 18 two zones zone 1 and zone 2 in fig 1 which were different in soil texture topographic gradients twi and slope and crop yield were selected for this study similar to kumar et al 2022a fig 1 zone 1 had a lower slope greater twi and greater crop yield as compared to zone 2 which had a greater slope lower twi and lower crop yield zone 3 had properties between zone 1 and zone 2 therefore it was not used in the study table 1 shows the average particle size distribution of zone 1 and zone 2 based on particle size distribution of each zone the soil profiles in each zone were relatively uniform an array of three watermark sensors irrometer co riverside ca usa were installed at multiple locations in both zones at 15 cm 30 cm and 60 cm soil depths during the growing season to monitor zone specific h in the soil profile the slurry was added to fill the holes and to ensure good contact between the sensors and the ground the antennas and electronic boards were configured and a base station was set up close to the field in the 2018 growing season sensors were installed on 16 may 2018 and removed on 12 august 2018 during the 2019 growing season sensors were installed on 01 may 2019 and removed on 11 august 2019 the corn was planted on 28 march 2019 and harvested on 30 august 2019 during the 2018 growing season corn was planted on 10 april and harvested on 03 september an automated weather station vantage pro2 plus davis instruments hayward ca usa was installed near the field to record meteorological parameters 2 2 hydrus 1d model description the hydrus 1d is a numerically approximate model which has been widely used to simulate soil water and nutrient dynamics glaesner et al 2018 in different soil types and field conditions the model uses an axisymmetric finite element code to solve richard s equation numerically šimůnek et al 2016 the hydrus 1d model has been used to simulate the soil water dynamics in multiple types of variably saturated soils in different crops such as corn wheat and paddy kumar et al 2022a iqbal et al 2020 zhou and zhao 2019 the one dimensional equation for water flow in an unsaturated flow medium is described by eq 1 1 θ t z k h z 1 s where θ is soil water content l3l 3 h is soil matric potential l t is

following 2 5 3 section of the methodology eq 15 the h and θ are interchangeable using swrc for any hydrologic state of soils based on measurements h or θ the user can convert one hydrologic component into another to fulfill the needs 2 3 hydrus 1d model input parameters for inverse modeling 2 3 1 determination of zone specific raw soil hydraulic properties undisturbed soil cores were collected for shps in both zones using a stainless steel sampler ring meter group pullman wa usa of 5 cm in height and 8 cm diameter 251 33 cm3 to collect the soil samples we used four tools including soil sampling ring sample ring insertion tool meter group pullman wa usa rubber mallet and trowel the sampling ring comes with two plastic caps to cover the blunt and cutting edges of the ring one side of the sampling has a blunt edge and the other has a cutting edge the blunt edge of the sampling ring was attached to the insertion tool and a sharp edge was placed facing the soil surface followed by hammering using the rubber mallet until the sampling ring fully penetrated the ground then top surface of the sampling ring was covered with the sampling ring cap the sampler rings were carefully removed by digging out surrounding soils using trowel to maintain the original soil properties then the cutting edge was also covered with a sampling ring cap and transported to measure the shps swrc and hcc in the laboratory raw or observed shp after samples were brought to the lab the cap was removed from the blunt edge and covered with a cheesecloth on top of the soil cores a perforated tray was then positioned then the soil cores were flipped and cap was removed from the cutting edge too the soil cores were placed in an empty container and the container was filled with distilled water to soak for 24 h or until the cores were fully saturated while filling the container with water it is necessary not to pour water on top of soil core to avoid the air trap the water level in the container was kept up to the cutting edge of the ring to allow saturation from bottom to top the cap was placed on the top of cutting edge to avoid the evaporation a detailed procedure for sample preparation and experiment run is given in shokrana and ghane 2020 the ring was inserted into the hydraulic property analyzer hyprop 2 meter group pullman wa usa for the determination of the wet end of the swrc using the evaporation method peters et al 2015 hyprop measurements are limited by the cavitation point of the two tensiometers and for this reason water retention curves can be estimated from saturation until around pf 3 the pf is a logarithmic function of absolute h in cm 5 pf log 10 h the h θ data and weight of soil samples were automatically recorded by hyprop view software version 4 2 2 0 meter group pullman wa usa every 30 min after h θ data measurements the soil samples were removed from the hydraulic property analyzer and placed into an oven at 105 ºc to determine the dry weight after the determination of the wet end of the swrc the soil was removed from the sampler ring and four replicates of small disturbed samples were taken for the measurement of the dry end of the swrc using a dew point hygrometer wp4c potentiameter meter group pullman wa usa the soil sample was placed in the chamber of the dew point hygrometer to measure h for the dry end the permanent wilting point pwp was measured at 1500 kpa in both zones soil samples were weighed immediately for wet weight and dried in the oven for determining dry weight detailed procedures for determining the wet and dry end of the swrc are shown in lena et al 2022 the h θ pairs measured by the hydraulic property analyzer and dew point hygrometer were input into hyprop fit software version 4 2 2 0 meter group pullman wa usa to generate the shps a single porosity model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 characterized the shps to satisfy the relation in both zones the generated shps in the laboratory are referred to as raw shps in the following sections 2 3 2 dynamic field measurements the collected meteorological observations from installed weather station including water flux rainfall and irrigation minimum and maximum temperatures relative humidity solar radiations and wind speed were input into the hydrus 1d model we recorded the growth stages and plant heights in both zones to determine the associated crop coefficients k c using irmak 2017 to determine crop evapotranspiration et c the leaf area index lai using lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor environmental lincoln ne usa on the 57th 72nd 92nd and 128th day after planting at four locations in each zone with five replications of each location was also measured kumar et al 2022a these crop data were also provided to the hydrus 1d model for each zone to input collected meteorological and crop data we selected time variable boundary conditions in the hydrs 1d model 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the user can define the initial conditions based on h or θ in the hydrus 1d model we defined initial conditions as h in both the zones for our study since we measured h in both the zones since the study was a field study and the surface layer was subjected to the atmosphere we selected the upper boundary condition as atmospheric boundary conditions with surface runoff in the hydrus 1d model from the meteorological data hydrus 1d calculates reference evapotranspiration et o using penman montheith equation hydrus 1d does not consider et o to be a single process hydrus 1d partitioned et 0 into potential evaporation and potential transpiration using beer s law ritchie 1972 and lai 6 t p et o 1 e k lai 7 e p et o e k lai where t p is potential transpiration lt 1 e p is potential evaporation lt 1 lai is leaf area index and k is radiation extinction by canopy the lower boundary condition was selected as a free drainage boundary condition at 100 cm soil depth indicating no interaction with the groundwater using boundary conditions at 60 cm in hydrus 1d for simulations it introduces boundary condition effects meaning that water crossing this level would never be available for uptake in reality there may be some upward flow from the 60 100 cm soil layer to the root zone if the soil is drying out therefore free drainage boundary condition is a good approximation if the water table is relatively deep and it does not affect water dynamic in the 100 cm profile also the use of a 200 cm profile required more computation time and resources in numerical modeling and did not result in different outcomes than using a 100 cm profile this was valid for the simulated zones in this study depending on crop and site information the root zone depth and lower boundary conditions can vary and the user must be careful in defining root zone depth and lower boundary conditions since they can affect the root water uptake such model set up has widely been used in previous studies conducted in field conditions kumar et al 2022a lena et al 2022 mokari et al 2019 the observation nodes were defined at the same depths of 15 cm 30 cm and 60 cm where watermark sensors were installed in both zones 2 3 4 root water uptake hydrus 1d model provides the flexibility for users to select the root water uptake module depending on the crop that allows to calculate the actual transpiration relatively to the potential transpiration the hydrus 1d has inbuilt crop modules for different crops including corn grass tomato etc the sink term s in richard s equation was computed using an equation given by feddes et al 1978 8 s α h β z t p where α h is a dimensionless response function of h 0 α h 1 which accounts for root water uptake stress β z is normalized water uptake distribution l 1 t p is a potential transpiration rate lt 1 water stress causes rot water uptake reduction α h can be explained as 9 α h 0 h h 1 or h h 4 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 1 h h 2 1 h 2 h h 3 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 3 h h 4 where h 1 is called anaerobiosis point i e water uptake considered to be zero close to the saturation h h 1 h 4 is pressure head at the wilting point and water uptake is also considered to be zero when h h 4 maximum root water uptake happens between h 2 and h 3 and it decreases or increases linearly between the pressure heads h 3 and h 4 or h 1 and h 2 respectively fig 2 since 95 of the corn roots are linearly distributed within the 0 60 cm soil profile and for this reason model assumed linear root distribution function to a depth of 60 cm depending on the crop information hydrus 1d model then assumes a linear interpolation with time the parameters in wesseling 1991 were selected for the root water uptake of corn in both zones 2 4 inverse modeling for shp optimization and goodness of fit analysis we used inverse modeling to optimize the shps using measured h from the array of three watermark sensors at 15 cm 30 cm and 60 cm soil depths to simulate the soil water dynamics in each zone after model setup with input parameters hydrus 1d model was coupled with the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm for global optimization of shps diamantopoulos et al 2012 duan et al 1994 qu et al 2014 in the zone 1 and zone 2 due to fairly uniform soil profiles and textural homogeneity within the soil depths of each zone as mentioned by kumar et al 2022a we used a single layer zone specific raw shps in each zone to build hydrus 1d model and optimized with multi depth measured h an objective function obj was defined for minimization in the sce ua algorithm for each observation at each depth 10 obj min j 1 nn pf j pf j ˆ x 2 where pf j pf 15 cm pf 30 cm pf 60 cm is a vector of daily observations of h as pf values pf j ˆ pf ˆ 15 cm pf ˆ 30 cm pf ˆ 60 cm is a vector contains daily hydrus 1d predictions of h as pf values x θ r θ s α n k s l is a vector of soil hydraulic parameters used in the van genuchten mualem model θ r is residual soil water content l3l 3 θ s is saturated soil water content l3l 3 α l 1 m and n are shape parameters l is shape parameter in hydraulic conductivity function k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 j is the measurement time and nn is the total number of measurements at each soil depth to fully use the zone specific shps we consider all parameters of the van genuchten mualem model to optimize and simulate soil water dynamics accurately in both zones the model was set up from 05 april 2018 30 august 2019 until harvesting the crop from 05 april 2018 until 30 april 2019 the model was trained to set initial conditions to run the simulations for the optimization of shps the performance of the hydrus 1d model was checked using different statistical indices of goodness of fit root mean square error rmse index of agreement k and relative root mean square error rrmse were used in this study 11 rmse 1 nn j 1 nn pf j ˆ pf j 2 12 d 1 j 1 nn pf j ˆ pf j 2 j 1 nn pf j ˆ pf avg pf j pf avg 2 13 rrmse 1 nn j 1 nn pf j ˆ pf j 2 pf avg where nn is the total number of

the data in terms of its absolute error the d value ranges from 0 to 1 and a value close to 1 indicates a better performance of the model the rrmse indicates the performance of the model is excellent when rrmse 10 good if 10 rrmse 20 fair if 20 rrmse 30 and poor if rrmse 30 2 5 negligible drainage flux based field capacity simulations and evaluation of flux based field capacity for irrigation recommendations 2 5 1 model development and simulations for negligible drainage flux based field capacity once the optimized shps from inverse modeling in hydrus 1d in section 2 4 and raw shps from hyprop 2 in section 2 3 1 were generated in both zones the simulations of fc using the q fc criterion were performed using the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2016 in both zones now we had two sets of shps optimized and raw in each zone since the soils in zone 1 and zone 2 represented fine textures category we adopted a q fc value of 0 01 cm day to simulate the fc in both zones following the recommendation of lena et al 2022 for fine textured soils in alabama we setup another hydrus 1d model for estimating h at fc in zone 1 and zone 2 for the model setup of fc simulations the upper boundary condition was fixed as constant zero flux the lower boundary condition as free drainage and the initial condition was defined as h of 0 98 kpa 10 cm of water the model setup was kept same as recommended in previous studies for fc simulations lena et al 2022 twarakavi et al 2009 the zone specific optimized and raw shps were used as input parameters in the hydrus 1d model for the flow of flux to determine h at fc in the 100 cm soil profile therefore two hydrus 1d models one for optimized shps and the other for raw shps in each zone were setup for zone specific fc simulations when the bottom of the soil profile reached the desired q fc of 0 01 cm day the profile was assumed to be at the fc condition the fc determined using optimized shps was named as optimized fc and the fc using raw shps was named as raw fc after fc simulations using optimized and raw shps in each zone we evaluated the impact of these optimized and raw fc on irrigation recommendations in each zone additionally we also studied the impact of fc on determination of irrigation thresholds 2 5 2 negligible drainage flux criteria evaluation for zone specific irrigation recommendations using optimized and raw shps to prove if optimized fc and shps are more accurate than raw fc and shps we developed the relationship between accumulated et c and required irrigation amounts for h fc at optimized and raw fc the et c was calculated using crop coefficient allen et al 1998 as 14 et c k c et 0 where k c is crop coefficient and et 0 is reference evapotranspiration and k c was determined using irmark 2017 these calculations were performed outside the hydrus 1d modeling environment to generate irrigation recommendations based on fc recommendations using a negligible drainage flux of 0 01 cm day for zone specific irrigation management we determined the irrigation recommendation for optimized and raw zone specific shps in this study to evaluate the impact of q fc of 0 01 cm day using zone specific optimized and raw shps on irrigation recommendations we implemented an analysis using observed h data in each zone we used three depths of installed sensors where h measurements were recorded during the growing season for this analysis the periods with no rainfall events were selected to calculate the required irrigation water as the amount of water required to replenish h measured with sensors back to h fc soil matric potential at fc the required irrigation water was calculated based on h fc and θ fc determined using the q fc of 0 01 cm day we also calculated accumulated et c for the same periods in which irrigation amounts were calculated the daily et c values were calculated using eq 14 to calculate accumulated et c for the validation of this method we selected the periods when there was a crop minimum bare soil evaporation in the field similar to lena et al 2022 the accumulated et c values were calculated as the sum of daily et c values for the selected interval between irrigations or rainfall for comparisons a regression model was fit between required irrigation amounts based on 0 01 cm day as q fc and accumulated et c for the selected intervals in both zones using optimized and raw shps to validate optimized parameters shps and fc are more accurate than raw parameters 2 5 3 determination of irrigation thresholds and amounts the swd based irrigation method is the most commonly adopted technique to determine irrigation thresholds or amounts to schedule irrigation which can reduce crop water stress and increase the crop yield kisekka et al 2016 the irrigation thresholds and amounts can be determined using a predefined value of swd in the following equations depending on the soil water depletion in the crop fields irrigation thresholds and irrigation amounts can be determined for irrigation scheduling during the growing season 15 h swd θ s θ r θ swd θ r 1 m 1 1 n α 16 θ swd θ fc swd θ fc θ pwp 17 i swd θ fc θ swd z where h swd is irrigation threshold as soil matric potential h at predefined swd l θ swd is the soil water content at predefined swd l3l 3 θ fc is the soil water content at fc l3l 3 θ s is the saturated soil water

irrigation amount l z is the thickness of the soil layer l the soil water content at fc using the q fc criterion for each shp and the soil water content at pwp 1500 kpa in each zone were used to determine the upper and lower limits of water holding capacity to derive irrigation thresholds and amounts the upper limit was set as 0 swd at fc while the lower limit was set as 100 at pwp 3 results and discussion 3 1 goodness of fit analysis of inverse hydrus 1d modeling the raw shps from both zones showed differences in the pattern of swrc and hcc fig 3 the differences in the pattern of swrc and hcc indicated the need for optimization using the observed data in the field conditions from fig 3 towards the lower pf end of the raw swrcs the raw swrc in zone 2 started at lower soil water content as compared to raw swrc in zone 1 which can also be observed at pf 0 h 0 i e saturation when pf increases raw swrcs in both zones intersected at around pf 2 h 9 8 kpa and acquired reversed pattern of the swrcs towards higher pf compared to the pattern at lower pf in both zones fig 3 at pf 4 2 h 1500 kpa using raw swrcs the zone 2 had a higher soil water content 20 than the soil water content 14 in zone 1 however after inverse modeling using hydrus 1d model optimized swrcs in both zones had identical soil water content 44 at saturation with a pf 0 fig 3 and optimized swrcs in both zones never intersected the optimized swrcs had the same pattern from lower pf to higher pf ends with higher soil water content in zone 2 compared to zone 1 throughout the patterns of swrcs fig 3 for example at pf 4 2 with optimized swrcs the soil water content in zone 2 was 18 and the soil water content in zone 1 was 7 which showed the differences in zone specific retention characteristics although raw shps showed the importance of zone specific shps between the zones the raw shps did not consider the actual soil water dynamics within the soil profiles in the field conditions to address the significance of the observed h in each zone and ignored the soil water movement within the soil profiles therefore we need to consider spatial variability in the raw shps between the zones for better irrigation management and adopt zone specific shps since both zones had distinct patterns of shps which means invariable shps cannot be assumed throughout the study field for irrigation management for example if we assume that raw shps of zone 1 represents the entire field the soil water content at pf 3 in the field was 23 for the entire study field therefore it reflects that if irrigation needs to be applied it will be applied at one rate throughout the study field which can result in over irrigation in some parts and under irrigation in others due to zone specific differences in shps however if we consider zone specific optimized shps the soil water content at pf 2 was 25 in zone 1 and 36 in zone 2 this reflects that zones will have different soil water content at the same soil matric potential which can lead to different rates of irrigation hence based on the soil water content differences at a particular pf reflects that the considering uniform shps within the field can be a flawed irrigation strategy due to zone specific variability in the pattern of shps the performance of the hydrus 1d model was tested at multiple locations in each zone the results showed that the simulated pf fit well with measured values of pf at all three soil depths in both zones table 2 the one layer optimized hydrus 1d model is a simplified version using single layer shps of the complex system which can be used to simulate soil water dynamics at all three different layers in our study we found d varied from 0 78 to 0 86 with an average of 0 81 in zone 1 and from 0 62 to 0 89 with an average of 0 78 in zone the rrmse was less than 0 2 in both zones at all the soil depths we achieved rmse ranging from 1 66 cm to 2 57 cm 0 22 0 41 as pf with an average of 2 19 cm 0 34 as pf in zone 1 and from 1 74 cm to 3 55 cm 0 24 0 55 as pf with an average of 2 39 cm 0 37 as pf in zone 2 in the entire soil profile table 2 on comparing the inversing modeling performance of hydrus 1d with previous multilayer modeling studies li et al 2014 achieved the minimum average rmse of 2 61 cm 0 42 as pf using an individual swrc for each soil layer from 0 to 100 cm at 20 cm depth increments wyatt et al 2017 found rmse ranged from 897 cm to 3388 cm 2 95 3 53 as pf with a higher rmse in a deep soil layer to estimate groundwater recharge at four various sites in oklahoma mokari et al 2019 achieved a d varying from 0 44 to 0 73 to simulate soil water movement however these studies did not consider all van genuchten parameters to optimize the shps based on the statistical indices to evaluate hydrus 1d model the performance was evaluated as excellent to optimize zone specific shps since our results were consistently better than previous studies the variation in the model performances in both zones can be due to differences in the shps and soil water retention behavior of the soils as we found different soil water content at same pf in both zones additionally since a high slope area increases the chances of sub surface lateral water movement compared to low slope areas huat et al 2006 the low slope in zone 1 and high slope in zone 2 can affect the soil water dynamics in both zones and one dimensional models cannot measure lateral movement of soil water kumar et al 2022a found differences in root water uptake between two zones affected the crop characteristics as a greater plant height and lai in zone 1 than in zone 2 the recorded plant heights and lai values that were greater in zone 1 maximum lai of 4 13 cm2 cm 2 with corresponding plant height of 225 cm than in zone 2 maximum lai of 3 34 cm2 cm 2 with corresponding plant height of 195 cm the zone 1 had silt type texture in the soil profile however zone 2 had clay texture the clay texture has maximum water holding capacity and minimum water releasing property çakir and cangir 2021 on the other hand silt type soils have slightly less water holding capacity than clay but have greater water releasing property than clay soils similar outcomes of differences in water holding capacity were noticed in the soil of silt texture and clay texture in turkey çakir 2019 çakir and cangir 2021 3 2 assessment of negligible drainage flux criteria for irrigation recommendations using optimized and raw shps the relationship between required irrigation and accumulated et c was determined fig 4a for zone 1 and fig 4b for zone 2 for zone specific optimized and raw fc table 3 using zone specific optimized and raw shps fig 3 a linear model was fit to best represent the relationships for optimized and raw fc values in both zones in zone 1 a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 88 was achieved between accumulated et c and required irrigation for optimized fc and shps however an r2 of 0 50 for raw fc and shps similarly an r2 of 0 74 was achieved with optimized fc and shps in zone 2 and an r2 of 0 33 for raw fc and shps these relationships support the hypothesis of optimized fc and shps are more effective to use in irrigation recommendation than raw fc and shps in both zones since optimized ones consider soil water dynamics in determining the irrigation thresholds and amounts the discrepancies in irrigation amount reflect the effect of determined fc and adoption of optimized and raw shps in each zone with smaller values of h fc the amount required for irrigation amount will be lower to replenish the soil water content back to fc from a given h since h fc gets closer to zero also the higher values of h fc will require a higher amount of irrigation water to replenish the soil water content back to fc from a given h since h fc gets farther from zero based on the relationship between accumulated et c and required irrigation using optimized and raw fc and shps we found that optimized fc and optimized shps resulted in a stronger correlation than raw fc and raw shps in both zones fig 4a for zone 1 and fig 4b for zone 2 which means that irrigation water is being used more efficiently the results found in this study suggest that the use of zone specific optimized fc for irrigation recommendations can potentially improve the irrigation management practices therefore we recommend optimizing zone specific fc values table 3 using optimized shps fig 3 for determining irrigation recommendations the fc determination using raw shps or assuming benchmark fc may not be accurate in irrigation management due to discrepancies between monitored h in the fields and laboratory experiments to develop shps fig 3 such discrepancies between fc determined in the lab and field soil water measurements have been discussed by evett et al 2019 however we do not suggest obliterating the determination of fc using such shps methods the optimized threshold values table 4 for irrigation triggering showed the differences between the zones and resulted in promising results of zone specific irrigation demands which might result in the variable time of irrigation threshold arrival and frequency of irrigations in the zones using this inverse modeling approach to optimizing fc we can determine effective irrigation thresholds and amounts to trigger irrigation which reduces the chance of flawed irrigation using raw shps and soil textured based fc since fc is the upper limit for irrigation and critical in determining the irrigation thresholds for sensor based irrigation it is necessary to consider the soil water dynamics to optimize the shps and site specific fc 3 3 flux based field capacity estimation using hydrus 1d the determined fc values using different shps are tabulated in table 3 on comparison between optimized and raw fcs the optimized fc was at 39 kpa and the raw fc was at 15 kpa in zone 1 table 3 however in zone 2 the optimized fc was at 25 kpa and the raw fc was at 59 kpa a similar trend of fc was also found by lena et al 2022 using multilayered raw shps for fine textured soil types however lena et al 2022 did not optimize shps and fc values these differences between optimized and raw fc table 3 in each zone resulted since raw fc did not account for soil water dynamics and optimized fc did account for soil water dynamics using h observations in each zone the impact of optimized fc and raw fc in each zone were noticed on irrigation recommendation in figs 4a and 4b also the differences in zone specific optimized fc values show the differences in dynamic soil water movement processes that occurred in the actual field conditions which were captured by zone specific h measurements recorded during the growing season and incorporated in the inverse hydrus 1d modeling for optimization table 2 measuring fc in the field condition is impossible to control the external factors and know the drainage flux in the sub surface which was achieved in the hydrus 1d the irrigation recommendations reflected this impact of optimized fc in each zone figs 4a and 4b the differences in zone specific fc values considerably affect the irrigation water management to meet the water demands required for a crop in each zone figs 4a and 4b additionally the optimized fc values compared to benchmark fc 33 kpa were different in both zones the optimized fc was at 39 kpa in zone 1 and 25 kpa in zone 2 compared to the benchmark fc at 33 kpa which was the same in both zones shows that the benchmark fc did not account for zone specific characteristics for soil water dynamics during the growing season the differences in zone specific fc can result in differences in the irrigation thresholds and ultimately the time to trigger irrigation during the growing season defining irrigation timing and amount is highly dependent on the upper limit of soil water holding capacity therefore different fc values will result in differences in irrigation recommendations the differences in determined fc using optimized and raw shps suggested that irrigation recommendations can be improved when zone specific optimized shps are used for optimizing fc with numerical modeling ultimately promoting irrigation best management practices the optimized fc in zone 1 and zone 2 have different values which indicate the difference in the upper limits of soil available water assuming a static fc value of 33 kpa as the benchmark fc throughout the field for irrigation scheduling may not be accurate for efficient irrigation water management and can be flawed for irrigation recommendations nemes et al 2011 this assumption can over or under estimate the zone specific irrigation thresholds which can result in over or under irrigation in the zones table 4 therefore determining accurate zone specific fc values can enable precise and zone specific irrigation scheduling with improved irrigation thresholds in each zone 3 4 determination of zone specific irrigation thresholds and amounts based on drainage flux fc criterion the optimized irrigation thresholds and amounts were determined with variation in swd to trigger irrigation in both zones fig 5 in zone 1 we found that the optimized irrigation thresholds absolute were greater fig 5a and optimized irrigation amounts were lower fig 5c than raw irrigation thresholds and amounts respectively due to differences in shps and fc the optimized irrigation amounts were always greater in zone 1 than zone 2 figs 5c and 5d the trend of the optimized and raw irrigation threshold curves indicated that the two curves intersect at swd of greater than 70 in zone 1 fig 5a which show the reduced differences in the upper and lower limits with the shape of optimized and raw shps due to higher depletion in zone 2 the optimized irrigation thresholds absolute were lower than the raw irrigation thresholds fig 5b and the optimized irrigation amounts were greater than the raw irrigation amounts fig 5d comparing optimized irrigation thresholds of both zones the optimized irrigation thresholds absolute were always greater in zone 1 than zone 2 differences in the pattern of irrigation threshold and amount showed inaccuracy in irrigation scheduling using raw shps and fcs therefore it is essential to optimize zone specific shps and fc to adopt best irrigation practices in each zone for example using a hypothetical 35 swd as the timing of irrigation value the optimized soil matric potential h 35 at 35 swd was 88 kpa with a corresponding irrigation amount of 20 mm for a 60 cm soil profile in zone 1 on the other hand the optimized h 35 in zone 2 was 45 kpa and its corresponding irrigation amount was 18 mm table 4 at swd of 35 the raw h 35 using flux based fcs in zone 1 and zone 2 was 58 kpa and 116 kpa respectively these differences in the optimized and raw irrigation thresholds at 35 swd in both zones were due to discrepancies in shps and the site specific measurements were incorporated in the case of optimized computations but not in the raw computations from these findings it was observed that the accurate determination of irrigation threshold and amount is highly dependent on accurate and effective shps which showed zone specific soil water dynamics and discrepancies in determination of fc values as a result irrigation scheduling using optimized parameters can be an efficient irrigation practice figs 4a and 4b as compared to raw parameters 3 5 determination of irrigation thresholds and amounts based on benchmark fc both zones had a similar pattern of irrigation thresholds and amounts variation with increasing swd fig 6 the irrigation thresholds as absolute values figs 6a and 6b and irrigation amounts figs 6c and 6d were lower considering benchmark fc and optimized shps in both zones using a hypothetical swd of 35 the optimized h 35 using benchmark fc was 76 kpa and raw h 35 using benchmark fc was 102 kpa table 4 however in zone 2 optimized h 35 using benchmark fc was 59 kpa and raw h 35 using benchmark fc was 70 kpa table 4 the change in fc values resulted in different values of irrigation thresholds and amounts at the swd based on the linear regression between accumulated etc and required irrigation using benchmark fc with optimized shps the r 2 0 5 in zone 1 and 0 4 in zone 2 was quite identical in both zones however it was lower than the flux based criterion with optimized shps figs 4a and 4b different shps can lead to various fcs and available water content values in the soils therefore a correct zone specific fc value can help in efficient zone specific irrigation water management within the crop field it can be concluded that the determination of fc in field conditions using optimization of shps can be an essential and foremost step in adopting best irrigation practices 3 6 limitations of the study and future research this study presented an inverse modeling approach to optimize the zone specific irrigation recommendations using zone specific optimized flux based fc the irrigation thresholds and amounts using flux based fc with optimized shps can potentially reduce the water stress in the crops increase irrigation water use efficiency and conserve water resources for irrigation however the limitation of this study is that we need field measurements for inverse modeling to optimize fc and to determine the effective irrigation thresholds and amounts this study is one dimension using hydrus 1d which does not account for lateral water flow in the model hence it would be interesting to incorporate two or three dimensional models in the future irrigation recommendations using shps derived from conventional methods such as tempe cell sand kaolin box and compare with shps from hyprop would be a future research question also it would be interesting to measure site specific etc using lysimeters and generate irrigation recommendations the outcomes of the study can be used in the crop models to understand the impact of irrigation recommendations on crop yield this study used a simplified single layer version of a complex subsurface system and it would be of interest to investigate a multilayer complex model 4 conclusions the flux based optimized fcs yielded best result for the accumulated etc and irrigation recommendations in both zones compared to irrigation recommendation using raw and benchmark fcs the determination of irrigation thresholds was highly dependent on the determination of fcs and shps in each zone the flux based fc determination showed the importance of using optimized shps over the raw shps since raw and benchmark fcs in both zones did not consider soil water dynamics and zone specific characteristics the optimized fc was at 39 kpa in zone 1 and 25 kpa in zone 2 however raw fcs in zone 1 and zone 2 were at 15 kpa and 59 kpa respectively the zone specific optimized fc in absolute values show that raw and benchmark fc values were underrepresented in zone 1 and overrepresented in zone 2 therefore raw and benchmark fcs may not be the best options in irrigation scheduling schemes without optimization also assuming a single fc benchmark throughout the field may not be the best option for irrigation recommendations the determination of fc using zone specific optimized and raw shps with a negligible drainage flux methods showed differences in irrigation thresholds and amounts to schedule irrigation resulting from the differences in the k h θ relation of shps hence considering zone specific optimized irrigation thresholds with optimized fc and shps and adopting a variable rate irrigation scheme for efficient irrigation water management in the zones can be the best climate

8863,the determination of field capacity fc irrigation thresholds and irrigation amounts is characterized by site specific soil hydraulic properties shps this study conducted in two zones zone 1 and zone 2 delineated based on soil topography and historical crop yield in alabama usa focused on determining zone specific fc using negligible drainage flux q fc criterion the hydrus 1d model was used to optimize zone specific shps using measured soil matric potential h the zone specific fcs were determined using optimized and raw shps at 0 01 cm day as q fc the results showed that the optimized fc at q fc was at 39 kpa in zone 1 and raw fc was at 15 kpa however in zone 2 optimized fc was at 25 kpa and raw fc was at 59 kpa to validate that optimized values are more accurate than raw values a relationship between accumulated crop evapotranspiration et c and required irrigation amount was determined using optimized parameters shps and fc and showed a stronger correlation in both zones than using raw parameters shps and fc at flux based fc the optimized irrigation thresholds and amounts in zone 1 were 88 kpa and 20 mm and raw irrigation threshold and amount were 58 kpa and 33 mm respectively in zone 2 the optimized irrigation thresholds and amounts were 45 kpa and 18 mm and raw irrigation threshold and amount were 116 kpa and 14 mm respectively therefore using raw and benchmark fc can result in inefficient irrigation strategies the proposed novel method of optimizing zone specific fc and irrigation thresholds can help with adopting timely best irrigation management

evapotranspiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction field capacity fc criterion is important in defining the initial hydrologic state of soils which affects both agronomic and hydrologic applications and determining the effective soil water available to plants despite its significance the definition of fc remains obscure for well defined hydrologic states of soils traditionally a static soil matric potential h of 10 kpa for coarse textured soils and 33 kpa for fine textured soils has been used to represent fc rivers and shipp 1972 however studies have indicated discrepancies and uncertainty associated with the static nature of fc liang et al 2016 and these values change based on soil physical and hydraulic characteristics and soil profile depth considered which suggests fc is dynamic assouline and or 2014 lena et al 2022 nemes et al 2011 twarakavi et al 2009 as the upper limit of soil water holding capacity changes dynamically the available soil water will change accordingly ultimately varying irrigation recommendations lena et al 2022 defining such limits is imperative to improving irrigation water use efficiency and agricultural water management practices de jong van lier 2017 irmak et al 2016 pinheiro et al 2019 lena et al 2022 romano et al 2011 since it allows us to define irrigation timing and depth considering a soil water depletion swd therefore an accurate determination of h at fc that accounts for site specific soil characteristics is the first step when the objective is to implement irrigation best management practices and mitigate the negative impact associated with over or under application of irrigation water due to high uncertainty onerous and time consuming measurements of fc in the field and laboratory the idea of internal drainage flux has been a topic of interest lena et al 2022 meyer and gee 1999 twarakavi et al 2009 computer codes have been used to determine fc when the drainage flux at the bottom of a pre defined soil profile reaches a negligible value schroeder et al 1994 used help software to estimate fc at negligible drainage flux q fc ranging from 0 001 cm day to 0 1 cm day depending on the application hillel 1998 recommended a value of 0 05 cm day as q fc to estimate fc meyer and gee 1999 found consistency with the original range from 0 001 cm day to 0 1 cm day to interpret fc twarakavi et al 2009 tested three q fc values 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 cm day using the hydrus 1d model to determine fc for homogeneous soil profile and a value of 0 01 cm day was recommended to represent fc across a range of usa soils although many studies have proposed the use of different q fc values to represent fc the impact of different q fc values on irrigation calculations is hardly ever investigated one of the few examples is the study conducted by lena et al 2022 in which different q fc were tested to estimate the soil matric potential at fc for irrigation recommendations in alabama and the fc using 0 01 cm day and 0 025 cm day resulted best for irrigation recommendations vs accumulated crop evapotranspiration etc relationships in fine textured and coarse textured soils respectively this study showed the importance of site specific evaluation of q fc to reduce the uncertainties in fc determination and irrigation recommendations however the study did not optimize the fc and irrigation thresholds irrigation threshold refers to soil matric potential h at which irrigation is initiated further kumar et al 2022a optimized the soil hydraulic properties shps but did not optimize the fc to determine irrigation thresholds for irrigation scheduling and mentioned it as a limitation of the study therefore we propose a method to optimize the fc and address the innovative solution for the research gap in the study investigated by kumar et al 2022a and lena et al 2022 the use of q fc to estimate fc has been well accepted by the scientific community however the accurate determination of fc highly depends on well defined and effective shps i e soil water retention curve swrc and hydraulic conductivity curve hcc field or laboratory measurements of shps have been considered the standard methods since they provide site specific information about soil physical characteristics but these methods are time consuming onerous and include disparities in the measurements diamantopoulos et al 2015 additionally a recent study indicated discrepancies between field observations and fc determined in the laboratory based shps which impacted the irrigation scheduling evett et al 2019 an alternative is to use estimated shps based on soil texture or pedo transfer functions schaap et al 2001 with the drawback of not being as precise as measured shps one way to overcome the limitations regarding measured and estimated shps is the optimization of shps with h or soil water content θ measured using soil sensors in the field accurate determinations of swrc and hydraulic conductivity k help in characterizing the soil water dynamics diamantopoulos et al 2013 iden et al 2021 which is important in irrigation scheduling therefore optimizing the k θ h relationship is desirable in q fc based determination of fc and irrigation scheduling to reduce uncertainty in our knowledge there has been a lack of research into the effects of optimized shps on determining fc and irrigation recommendations in actual field conditions the accurate shps enable researchers and farmers to increase water use efficiency improve crop yield and maintain water resources by using improved irrigation management strategies jabro and stevens 2022 we hypothesize that optimized shps that also take into consideration the differences in site specific properties in the crop field can not only improve the determination of fc but also the irrigation threshold values over the measured or estimated shps during the growing season which can help with irrigation scheduling decisions thus for site specific management it is best to delineate a crop field into different management zones based on soil texture topography historical crop yield etc kumar et al 2022a and determine zone specific fc to avoid discrepancies by assuming one static fc throughout the field for irrigation water management real time h or θ monitoring using sensors in the soil profiles to schedule irrigation has been gaining attention during the last decade fontanet et al 2020 although this sensor based irrigation can improve irrigation efficiency and reduce water stress irmak et al 2010 leininger et al 2019 these improvements are only achieved if the k θ h relationship is accurately and precisely defined due to variability in soil hydraulic and physical characteristics different irrigation thresholds have been adopted to trigger irrigation among the soil types leininger et al 2019 recommended an h of 50 kpa for very fine sandy loam textured soil in peanut field and irmak et al 2016 recommended values ranging from 20 kpa to 25 kpa for fine sandy soils and from 90 kpa to 110 kpa for silt loam and silty clay loam soils in corn field however a single irrigation threshold has been adopted for the entire field and a single threshold does not account for site specific variability in h or θ due to soil physical properties topography and soil water dynamics monitored within the field and these values were recommended considering non optimized shps the determination of fc using q fc has shown promise in determining irrigation thresholds however investigations to quantify the impact of zone specific optimized shps and fc at q fc on determination of zone specific irrigation thresholds considering discrepancies in soil water dynamics monitored in the field are hardly ever conducted recently kumar et al 2022a optimized the irrigation thresholds using the soil textured based fc without considering zone specific characteristics and indicated the limitation of not optimizing the fc similarly studies irmak et al 2016 lena et al 2022 used the shps determined in the laboratory or based on the soil texture assuming fc based on soil texture these are raw or observed shps and these shps do not account for soil water dynamics in determining the irrigation thresholds and fc optimizing the raw or observed shps optimize the fc and result in optimized irrigation thresholds to schedule site specific irrigation zone specific differences in h or θ can be due to soil physical properties topographic gradient and vegetation kumar et al 2022a hence improved and optimized zone specific shps using measured h or θ can help in determining upper limit of soil water holding capacity consequently improving irrigation strategy during the growing season the specific objectives of this study were 1 to develop a modeling approach of optimizing zone specific fc considering a q fc criterion using the hydrus 1d model and investigate the impact of zone specific optimized shps on the irrigation recommendation and 2 to investigate the effect of zone specific optimized fc and shps on the zone specific irrigation thresholds and irrigation amounts at soil water depletion swd the study was conducted in two irrigated management zones of a delineated crop field we used optimized and raw zone specific shps in this investigation to validate the fc simulations using optimized and raw shps we estimated the relationship between accumulated crop evapotranspiration etc and required irrigation amounts for irrigation recommendations using optimized and raw shps in this article we use term raw shps for the measurements obtained in the laboratory using hyprop measurement systems kumar et al 2022a and optimized shps resulted after

alabama fig 1 the detailed information about study site irrigation management zones irrigation system irrigation scheduling lena et al 2021a 2021b precipitation and crops in the region are given in kumar et al 2022b a brief description is given in this paper the area is classified as subtropical humid cfa köppen climate classification kottek et al 2006 and has an annual average rainfall of about 1400 mm the entire field was covered by a full circle of remotely controlled 625 m long reinke center pivot irrigation system reinke manufacturing co inc deshler ne usa with mid elevation spray application mesa sprinklers fitted with pressure regulators climate change is affecting the rainfall over the years takhellambam et al 2023 2022 which would alter time erosion and intensity of rainfall events the distribution of rainfall over the growing season is important for irrigation management and for crop water demand kumar et al 2021a 2021b although crops might receive enough rainfall by the end of the growing season the time of rainfall is critical to reducing the crop water stress therefore it is essential to plan irrigation according to the site specific conditions and crop water demand the field was delineated in three irrigation management zones zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 based on soil texture topography and historical yield data kumar et al 2022a 2022b using management zone analyst software mza 1 01 usda ars columbia mo usa fridgen et al 2004 the slope in the field varied from 0 to 10 the corn grain yield was monitored using a yield monitor mounted on the combine we also generated a topographic wetness index twi in the field beven kirkby 1979 and twi varied from 5 11 to 18 two zones zone 1 and zone 2 in fig 1 which were different in soil texture topographic gradients twi and slope and crop yield were selected for this study similar to kumar et al 2022a fig 1 zone 1 had a lower slope greater twi and greater crop yield as compared to zone 2 which had a greater slope lower twi and lower crop yield zone 3 had properties between zone 1 and zone 2 therefore it was not used in the study table 1 shows the average particle size distribution of zone 1 and zone 2 based on particle size distribution of each zone the soil profiles in each zone were relatively uniform an array of three watermark sensors irrometer co riverside ca usa were installed at multiple locations in both zones at 15 cm 30 cm and 60 cm soil depths during the growing season to monitor zone specific h in the soil profile the slurry was added to fill the holes and to ensure good contact between the sensors and the ground the antennas and electronic boards were configured and a base station was set up close to the field in the 2018 growing season sensors were installed on 16 may 2018 and removed on 12 august 2018 during the 2019 growing season sensors were installed on 01 may 2019 and removed on 11 august 2019 the corn was planted on 28 march 2019 and harvested on 30 august 2019 during the 2018 growing season corn was planted on 10 april and harvested on 03 september an automated weather station vantage pro2 plus davis instruments hayward ca usa was installed near the field to record meteorological parameters 2 2 hydrus 1d model description the hydrus 1d is a numerically approximate model which has been widely used to simulate soil water and nutrient dynamics glaesner et al 2018 in different soil types and field conditions the model uses an axisymmetric finite element code to solve richard s equation numerically šimůnek et al 2016 the hydrus 1d model has been used to simulate the soil water dynamics in multiple types of variably saturated soils in different crops such as corn wheat and paddy kumar et al 2022a iqbal et al 2020 zhou and zhao 2019 the one dimensional equation for water flow in an unsaturated flow medium is described by eq 1 1 θ t z k h z 1 s where θ is soil water content l3l 3 h is soil matric potential l t is

following 2 5 3 section of the methodology eq 15 the h and θ are interchangeable using swrc for any hydrologic state of soils based on measurements h or θ the user can convert one hydrologic component into another to fulfill the needs 2 3 hydrus 1d model input parameters for inverse modeling 2 3 1 determination of zone specific raw soil hydraulic properties undisturbed soil cores were collected for shps in both zones using a stainless steel sampler ring meter group pullman wa usa of 5 cm in height and 8 cm diameter 251 33 cm3 to collect the soil samples we used four tools including soil sampling ring sample ring insertion tool meter group pullman wa usa rubber mallet and trowel the sampling ring comes with two plastic caps to cover the blunt and cutting edges of the ring one side of the sampling has a blunt edge and the other has a cutting edge the blunt edge of the sampling ring was attached to the insertion tool and a sharp edge was placed facing the soil surface followed by hammering using the rubber mallet until the sampling ring fully penetrated the ground then top surface of the sampling ring was covered with the sampling ring cap the sampler rings were carefully removed by digging out surrounding soils using trowel to maintain the original soil properties then the cutting edge was also covered with a sampling ring cap and transported to measure the shps swrc and hcc in the laboratory raw or observed shp after samples were brought to the lab the cap was removed from the blunt edge and covered with a cheesecloth on top of the soil cores a perforated tray was then positioned then the soil cores were flipped and cap was removed from the cutting edge too the soil cores were placed in an empty container and the container was filled with distilled water to soak for 24 h or until the cores were fully saturated while filling the container with water it is necessary not to pour water on top of soil core to avoid the air trap the water level in the container was kept up to the cutting edge of the ring to allow saturation from bottom to top the cap was placed on the top of cutting edge to avoid the evaporation a detailed procedure for sample preparation and experiment run is given in shokrana and ghane 2020 the ring was inserted into the hydraulic property analyzer hyprop 2 meter group pullman wa usa for the determination of the wet end of the swrc using the evaporation method peters et al 2015 hyprop measurements are limited by the cavitation point of the two tensiometers and for this reason water retention curves can be estimated from saturation until around pf 3 the pf is a logarithmic function of absolute h in cm 5 pf log 10 h the h θ data and weight of soil samples were automatically recorded by hyprop view software version 4 2 2 0 meter group pullman wa usa every 30 min after h θ data measurements the soil samples were removed from the hydraulic property analyzer and placed into an oven at 105 ºc to determine the dry weight after the determination of the wet end of the swrc the soil was removed from the sampler ring and four replicates of small disturbed samples were taken for the measurement of the dry end of the swrc using a dew point hygrometer wp4c potentiameter meter group pullman wa usa the soil sample was placed in the chamber of the dew point hygrometer to measure h for the dry end the permanent wilting point pwp was measured at 1500 kpa in both zones soil samples were weighed immediately for wet weight and dried in the oven for determining dry weight detailed procedures for determining the wet and dry end of the swrc are shown in lena et al 2022 the h θ pairs measured by the hydraulic property analyzer and dew point hygrometer were input into hyprop fit software version 4 2 2 0 meter group pullman wa usa to generate the shps a single porosity model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 characterized the shps to satisfy the relation in both zones the generated shps in the laboratory are referred to as raw shps in the following sections 2 3 2 dynamic field measurements the collected meteorological observations from installed weather station including water flux rainfall and irrigation minimum and maximum temperatures relative humidity solar radiations and wind speed were input into the hydrus 1d model we recorded the growth stages and plant heights in both zones to determine the associated crop coefficients k c using irmak 2017 to determine crop evapotranspiration et c the leaf area index lai using lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor environmental lincoln ne usa on the 57th 72nd 92nd and 128th day after planting at four locations in each zone with five replications of each location was also measured kumar et al 2022a these crop data were also provided to the hydrus 1d model for each zone to input collected meteorological and crop data we selected time variable boundary conditions in the hydrs 1d model 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the user can define the initial conditions based on h or θ in the hydrus 1d model we defined initial conditions as h in both the zones for our study since we measured h in both the zones since the study was a field study and the surface layer was subjected to the atmosphere we selected the upper boundary condition as atmospheric boundary conditions with surface runoff in the hydrus 1d model from the meteorological data hydrus 1d calculates reference evapotranspiration et o using penman montheith equation hydrus 1d does not consider et o to be a single process hydrus 1d partitioned et 0 into potential evaporation and potential transpiration using beer s law ritchie 1972 and lai 6 t p et o 1 e k lai 7 e p et o e k lai where t p is potential transpiration lt 1 e p is potential evaporation lt 1 lai is leaf area index and k is radiation extinction by canopy the lower boundary condition was selected as a free drainage boundary condition at 100 cm soil depth indicating no interaction with the groundwater using boundary conditions at 60 cm in hydrus 1d for simulations it introduces boundary condition effects meaning that water crossing this level would never be available for uptake in reality there may be some upward flow from the 60 100 cm soil layer to the root zone if the soil is drying out therefore free drainage boundary condition is a good approximation if the water table is relatively deep and it does not affect water dynamic in the 100 cm profile also the use of a 200 cm profile required more computation time and resources in numerical modeling and did not result in different outcomes than using a 100 cm profile this was valid for the simulated zones in this study depending on crop and site information the root zone depth and lower boundary conditions can vary and the user must be careful in defining root zone depth and lower boundary conditions since they can affect the root water uptake such model set up has widely been used in previous studies conducted in field conditions kumar et al 2022a lena et al 2022 mokari et al 2019 the observation nodes were defined at the same depths of 15 cm 30 cm and 60 cm where watermark sensors were installed in both zones 2 3 4 root water uptake hydrus 1d model provides the flexibility for users to select the root water uptake module depending on the crop that allows to calculate the actual transpiration relatively to the potential transpiration the hydrus 1d has inbuilt crop modules for different crops including corn grass tomato etc the sink term s in richard s equation was computed using an equation given by feddes et al 1978 8 s α h β z t p where α h is a dimensionless response function of h 0 α h 1 which accounts for root water uptake stress β z is normalized water uptake distribution l 1 t p is a potential transpiration rate lt 1 water stress causes rot water uptake reduction α h can be explained as 9 α h 0 h h 1 or h h 4 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 1 h h 2 1 h 2 h h 3 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 3 h h 4 where h 1 is called anaerobiosis point i e water uptake considered to be zero close to the saturation h h 1 h 4 is pressure head at the wilting point and water uptake is also considered to be zero when h h 4 maximum root water uptake happens between h 2 and h 3 and it decreases or increases linearly between the pressure heads h 3 and h 4 or h 1 and h 2 respectively fig 2 since 95 of the corn roots are linearly distributed within the 0 60 cm soil profile and for this reason model assumed linear root distribution function to a depth of 60 cm depending on the crop information hydrus 1d model then assumes a linear interpolation with time the parameters in wesseling 1991 were selected for the root water uptake of corn in both zones 2 4 inverse modeling for shp optimization and goodness of fit analysis we used inverse modeling to optimize the shps using measured h from the array of three watermark sensors at 15 cm 30 cm and 60 cm soil depths to simulate the soil water dynamics in each zone after model setup with input parameters hydrus 1d model was coupled with the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm for global optimization of shps diamantopoulos et al 2012 duan et al 1994 qu et al 2014 in the zone 1 and zone 2 due to fairly uniform soil profiles and textural homogeneity within the soil depths of each zone as mentioned by kumar et al 2022a we used a single layer zone specific raw shps in each zone to build hydrus 1d model and optimized with multi depth measured h an objective function obj was defined for minimization in the sce ua algorithm for each observation at each depth 10 obj min j 1 nn pf j

at each soil depth to fully use the zone specific shps we consider all parameters of the van genuchten mualem model to optimize and simulate soil water dynamics accurately in both zones the model was set up from 05 april 2018 30 august 2019 until harvesting the crop from 05 april 2018 until 30 april 2019 the model was trained to set initial conditions to run the simulations for the optimization of shps the performance of the hydrus 1d model was checked using different statistical indices of goodness of fit root mean square error rmse index of agreement k and relative root mean square error

when rrmse 10 good if 10 rrmse 20 fair if 20 rrmse 30 and poor if rrmse 30 2 5 negligible drainage flux based field capacity simulations and evaluation of flux based field capacity for irrigation recommendations 2 5 1 model development and simulations for negligible drainage flux based field capacity once the optimized shps from inverse modeling in hydrus 1d in section 2 4 and raw shps from hyprop 2 in section 2 3 1 were generated in both zones the simulations of fc using the q fc criterion were performed using the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2016 in both zones now we had two sets of shps optimized and raw in each zone since the soils in zone 1 and zone 2 represented fine textures category we adopted a q fc value of 0 01 cm day to simulate the fc in both zones following the recommendation of lena et al 2022 for fine textured soils in alabama we setup another hydrus 1d model for estimating h at fc in zone 1 and zone 2 for the model setup of fc simulations the upper boundary condition was fixed as constant zero flux the lower boundary condition as free drainage and the initial condition was defined as h of 0 98 kpa 10 cm of water the model setup was kept same as recommended in previous studies for fc simulations lena et al 2022 twarakavi et al 2009 the zone specific optimized and raw shps were used as input parameters in the hydrus 1d model for the flow of flux to determine h at fc in the 100 cm soil profile therefore two hydrus 1d models one for optimized shps and the other for raw shps in each zone were setup for zone specific fc simulations when the bottom of the soil profile reached the desired q fc of 0 01 cm day the profile was assumed to be at the fc condition the fc determined using optimized shps was named as optimized fc and the fc using raw shps was named as raw fc after fc simulations using optimized and raw shps in each zone we evaluated the impact of these optimized and raw fc on irrigation recommendations in each zone additionally we also studied the impact of fc on determination of irrigation thresholds 2 5 2 negligible drainage flux criteria evaluation for zone specific irrigation recommendations using optimized and raw shps to prove if optimized fc and shps are more accurate than raw fc and shps we developed the relationship between accumulated et c and required irrigation amounts for h fc at optimized and raw fc the et c was calculated using crop coefficient allen et al 1998 as 14 et c k c et 0 where k c is crop coefficient and et 0 is reference evapotranspiration and k c was determined using irmark 2017 these calculations were performed outside the hydrus 1d modeling environment to generate irrigation recommendations based on fc recommendations using a negligible drainage flux of 0 01 cm day for zone specific irrigation management we determined the irrigation recommendation for optimized and raw zone specific shps in this study to evaluate the impact of q fc of 0 01 cm day using zone specific optimized and raw shps on irrigation recommendations we implemented an analysis using observed h data in each zone we used three depths of installed sensors where h measurements were recorded during the growing season for this analysis the periods with no rainfall events were selected to calculate the required irrigation water as the amount of water required to replenish h measured with sensors back to h fc soil matric potential at fc the required irrigation water was calculated based on h fc and θ fc determined using the q fc of 0 01 cm day we also calculated accumulated et c for the same periods in which irrigation amounts were calculated the daily et c values were calculated using eq 14 to calculate accumulated et c for the validation of this method we selected the periods when there was a crop minimum bare soil evaporation in the field similar to lena et al 2022 the accumulated et c values were calculated as the sum of daily et c values for the selected interval between irrigations or rainfall for comparisons a regression model was fit between required irrigation amounts based on 0 01 cm day as q fc and accumulated et c for the selected intervals in both zones using optimized and raw shps to validate optimized parameters shps and fc are more accurate than raw parameters 2 5 3 determination of irrigation thresholds and amounts the swd based irrigation method is the most commonly adopted technique to determine irrigation thresholds or amounts to schedule irrigation which can reduce crop water stress and increase the crop yield kisekka et al 2016 the irrigation thresholds and amounts can be determined using a predefined value of swd in the following equations depending on the soil water depletion in the crop fields irrigation thresholds and irrigation amounts can be determined for irrigation scheduling during the growing season 15 h swd θ s θ r θ swd θ r 1 m 1 1 n α 16 θ swd θ fc swd θ fc θ pwp 17 i swd θ fc θ swd z where h swd is

irrigation amount l z is the thickness of the soil layer l the soil water content at fc using the q fc criterion for each shp and the soil water content at pwp 1500 kpa in each zone were used to determine the upper and lower limits of water holding capacity to derive irrigation thresholds and amounts the upper limit was set as 0 swd at fc while the lower limit was set as 100 at pwp 3 results and discussion 3 1 goodness of fit analysis of inverse hydrus 1d modeling the raw shps from both zones showed differences in the pattern of swrc and hcc fig 3 the differences in the pattern of swrc and hcc indicated the need for optimization using the observed data in the field conditions from fig 3 towards the lower pf end of the raw swrcs the raw swrc in zone 2 started at lower soil water content as compared to raw swrc in zone 1 which can also be observed at pf 0 h 0 i e saturation when pf increases raw swrcs in both zones intersected at around pf 2 h 9 8 kpa and acquired reversed pattern of the swrcs towards higher pf compared to the pattern at lower pf in both zones fig 3 at pf 4 2 h 1500 kpa using raw swrcs the zone 2 had a higher soil water content 20 than the soil water content 14 in zone 1 however after inverse modeling using hydrus 1d model optimized swrcs in both zones had identical soil water content 44 at saturation with a pf 0 fig 3 and optimized swrcs in both zones never intersected the optimized swrcs had the same pattern from lower pf to higher pf ends with higher soil water content in zone 2 compared to zone 1 throughout the patterns of swrcs fig 3 for example at pf 4 2 with optimized swrcs the soil water content in zone 2 was 18 and the soil water content in zone 1 was 7 which showed the differences in zone specific retention characteristics although raw shps showed the importance of zone specific shps between the zones the raw shps did not consider the actual soil water dynamics within the soil profiles in the field conditions to address the significance of the observed h in each zone and ignored the soil water movement within the soil profiles therefore we need to consider spatial variability in the raw shps between the zones for better irrigation management and adopt zone specific shps since both zones had distinct patterns of shps which means invariable shps cannot be assumed throughout the study field for irrigation management for example if we assume that raw shps of zone 1 represents the entire field the soil water content at pf 3 in the field was 23 for the entire study field therefore it reflects that if irrigation needs to be applied it will be applied at one rate throughout the study field which can result in over irrigation in some parts and under irrigation in others due to zone specific differences in shps however if we consider zone specific optimized shps the soil water content at pf 2 was 25 in zone 1 and 36 in zone 2 this reflects that zones will have different soil water content at the same soil matric potential which can lead to different rates of irrigation hence based on the soil water content differences at a particular pf reflects that the considering uniform shps within the field can be a flawed irrigation strategy due to zone specific variability in the pattern of shps the performance of the hydrus 1d model was tested at multiple locations in each zone the results showed that the simulated pf fit well with measured values of pf at all three soil depths in both zones table 2 the one layer optimized hydrus 1d model is a simplified version using single layer shps of the complex system which can be used to simulate soil water dynamics at all three different layers in our study we found d varied from 0 78 to 0 86 with an average of 0 81 in zone 1 and from 0 62 to 0 89 with an average of 0 78 in zone the rrmse was less than 0 2 in both zones at all the soil depths we achieved rmse ranging from 1 66 cm to 2 57 cm 0 22 0 41 as pf with an average of 2 19 cm 0 34 as pf in zone 1 and from 1 74 cm to 3 55 cm 0 24 0 55 as pf with an average of 2 39 cm 0 37 as pf in zone 2 in the entire soil profile table 2 on comparing the inversing modeling performance of hydrus 1d with previous multilayer modeling studies li et al 2014 achieved the minimum average rmse of 2 61 cm 0 42 as pf using an individual swrc for each soil layer from 0 to 100 cm at 20 cm depth increments wyatt et al 2017 found rmse ranged from 897 cm to 3388 cm 2 95 3 53 as pf with a higher rmse in a deep soil layer to estimate groundwater recharge at four various sites in oklahoma mokari et al 2019 achieved a d varying from 0 44 to 0 73 to simulate soil water movement however these studies did not consider all van genuchten parameters to optimize the shps based on the statistical indices to evaluate hydrus 1d model the performance was evaluated as excellent to optimize zone specific shps since our results were consistently better than previous studies the variation in the model performances in both zones can be due to differences in the shps and soil water retention behavior of the soils as we found different soil water content at same pf in both zones additionally since a high slope area increases the chances of sub surface lateral water movement compared to low slope areas huat et al 2006 the low slope in zone 1 and high slope in zone 2 can affect the soil water dynamics in both zones and one dimensional models cannot measure lateral movement of soil water kumar et al 2022a found differences in root water uptake between two zones affected the crop characteristics as a greater plant height and lai in zone 1 than in zone 2 the recorded plant heights and lai values that were greater in zone 1 maximum lai of 4 13 cm2 cm 2 with corresponding plant height of 225 cm than in zone 2 maximum lai of 3 34 cm2 cm 2 with corresponding plant height of 195 cm the zone 1 had silt type texture in the soil profile however zone 2 had clay texture the clay texture has maximum water holding capacity and minimum water releasing property çakir and cangir 2021 on the other hand silt type soils have slightly less water holding capacity than clay but have greater water releasing property than clay soils similar outcomes of differences in water holding capacity were noticed in the soil of silt texture and clay texture in turkey çakir 2019 çakir and cangir 2021 3 2 assessment of negligible drainage flux criteria for irrigation recommendations using optimized and raw shps the relationship between required irrigation and accumulated et c was determined fig 4a for zone 1 and fig 4b for zone 2 for zone specific optimized and raw fc table 3 using zone specific optimized and raw shps fig 3 a linear model was fit to best represent the relationships for optimized and raw fc values in both zones in zone 1 a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 88 was achieved between accumulated et c and required irrigation for optimized fc and shps however an r2 of 0 50 for raw fc and shps similarly an r2 of 0 74 was achieved with optimized fc and shps in zone 2 and an r2 of 0 33 for raw fc and shps these relationships support the hypothesis of optimized fc and shps are more effective to use in irrigation recommendation than raw fc and shps in both zones since optimized ones consider soil water dynamics in determining the irrigation thresholds and amounts the discrepancies in irrigation amount reflect the effect of determined fc and adoption of optimized and raw shps in each zone with smaller values of h fc the amount required for irrigation amount will be lower to replenish the soil water content back to fc from a given h since h fc gets closer to zero also the higher values of h fc will require a higher amount of irrigation water to replenish the soil water content back to fc from a given h since h fc gets farther from zero based on the relationship between accumulated et c and required irrigation using optimized and raw fc and shps we found that optimized fc and optimized shps resulted in a stronger correlation than raw fc and raw shps in both zones fig 4a for zone 1 and fig 4b for zone 2 which means that irrigation water is being used more efficiently the results found in this study suggest that the use of zone specific optimized fc for irrigation recommendations can potentially improve the irrigation management practices therefore we recommend optimizing zone specific fc values table 3 using optimized shps fig 3 for determining irrigation recommendations the fc determination using raw shps or assuming benchmark fc may not be accurate in irrigation management due to discrepancies between monitored h in the fields and laboratory experiments to develop shps fig 3 such discrepancies between fc determined in the lab and field soil water measurements have been discussed by evett et al 2019 however we do not suggest obliterating the determination of fc using such shps methods the optimized threshold values table 4 for irrigation triggering showed the differences between the zones and resulted in promising results of zone specific irrigation demands which might result in the variable time of irrigation threshold arrival and frequency of irrigations in the zones using this inverse modeling approach to optimizing fc we can determine effective irrigation thresholds and amounts to trigger irrigation which reduces the chance of flawed irrigation using raw shps and soil textured based fc since fc is the upper limit for irrigation and critical in determining the irrigation thresholds for sensor based irrigation it is necessary to consider the soil water dynamics to optimize the shps and site specific fc 3 3 flux based field capacity estimation using hydrus 1d the determined fc values using different shps are tabulated in table 3 on comparison between optimized and raw fcs the optimized fc was at 39 kpa and the raw fc was at 15 kpa in zone 1 table 3 however in zone 2 the optimized fc was at 25 kpa and the raw fc was at 59 kpa a similar trend of fc was also found by lena et al 2022 using multilayered raw shps for fine textured soil types however lena et al 2022 did not optimize shps and fc values these differences between optimized and raw fc table 3 in each zone resulted since raw fc did not account for soil water dynamics and optimized fc did account for soil water dynamics using h observations in each zone the impact of optimized fc and raw fc in each zone were noticed on irrigation recommendation in figs 4a and 4b also the differences in zone specific optimized fc values show the differences in dynamic soil water movement processes that occurred in the actual field conditions which were captured by zone specific h measurements recorded during the growing season and incorporated in the inverse hydrus 1d modeling for optimization table 2 measuring fc in the field condition is impossible to control the external factors and know the drainage flux in the sub surface which was achieved in the hydrus 1d the irrigation recommendations reflected this impact of optimized fc in each zone figs 4a and 4b the differences in zone specific fc values considerably affect the irrigation water management to meet the water demands required for a crop in each zone figs 4a and 4b additionally the optimized fc values compared to benchmark fc 33 kpa were different in both zones the optimized fc was at 39 kpa in zone 1 and 25 kpa in zone 2 compared to the benchmark fc at 33 kpa which was the same in both zones shows that the benchmark fc did not account for zone specific characteristics for soil water dynamics during the growing season the differences in zone specific fc can result in differences in the irrigation thresholds and ultimately the time to trigger irrigation during the growing season defining irrigation timing and amount is highly dependent on the upper limit of soil water holding capacity therefore different fc values will result in differences in irrigation recommendations the differences in determined fc using optimized and raw shps suggested that irrigation recommendations can be improved when zone specific optimized shps are used for optimizing fc with numerical modeling ultimately promoting irrigation best management practices the optimized fc in zone 1 and zone 2 have different values which indicate the difference in the upper limits of soil available water assuming a static fc value of 33 kpa as the benchmark fc throughout the field for irrigation scheduling may not be accurate for efficient irrigation water management and can be flawed for irrigation recommendations nemes et al 2011 this assumption can over or under estimate the zone specific irrigation thresholds which can result in over or under irrigation in the zones table 4 therefore determining accurate zone specific fc values can enable precise and zone specific irrigation scheduling with improved irrigation thresholds in each zone 3 4 determination of zone specific irrigation thresholds and amounts based on drainage flux fc criterion the optimized irrigation thresholds and amounts were determined with variation in swd to trigger irrigation in both zones fig 5 in zone 1 we found that the optimized irrigation thresholds absolute were greater fig 5a and optimized irrigation amounts were lower fig 5c than raw irrigation thresholds and amounts respectively due to differences in shps and fc the optimized irrigation amounts were always greater in zone 1 than zone 2 figs 5c and 5d the trend of the optimized and raw irrigation threshold curves indicated that the two curves intersect at swd of greater than 70 in zone 1 fig 5a which show the reduced differences in the upper and lower limits with the shape of optimized and raw shps due to higher depletion in zone 2 the optimized irrigation thresholds absolute were lower than the raw irrigation thresholds fig 5b and the optimized irrigation amounts were greater than the raw irrigation amounts fig 5d comparing optimized irrigation thresholds of both zones the optimized irrigation thresholds absolute were always greater in zone 1 than zone 2 differences in the pattern of irrigation threshold and amount showed inaccuracy in irrigation scheduling using raw shps and fcs therefore it is essential to optimize zone specific shps and fc to adopt best irrigation practices in each zone for example using a hypothetical 35 swd as the timing of irrigation value the optimized soil matric potential h 35 at 35 swd was 88 kpa with a corresponding irrigation amount of 20 mm for a 60 cm soil profile in zone 1 on the other hand the optimized h 35 in zone 2 was 45 kpa and its corresponding irrigation amount was 18 mm table 4 at swd of 35 the raw h 35 using flux based fcs in zone 1 and zone 2 was 58 kpa and 116 kpa respectively these differences in the optimized and raw irrigation thresholds at 35 swd in both zones were due to discrepancies in shps and the site specific measurements were incorporated in the case of optimized computations but not in the raw computations from these findings it was observed that the accurate determination of irrigation threshold and amount is highly dependent on accurate and effective shps which showed zone specific soil water dynamics and discrepancies in determination of fc values as a result irrigation scheduling using optimized parameters can be an efficient irrigation practice figs 4a and 4b as compared to raw parameters 3 5 determination of irrigation thresholds and amounts based on benchmark fc both zones had a similar pattern of irrigation thresholds and amounts variation with increasing swd fig 6 the irrigation thresholds as absolute values figs 6a and 6b and irrigation amounts figs 6c and 6d were lower considering benchmark fc and optimized shps in both zones using a hypothetical swd of 35 the optimized h 35 using benchmark fc was 76 kpa and raw h 35 using benchmark fc was 102 kpa table 4 however in zone 2 optimized h 35 using benchmark fc was 59 kpa and raw h 35 using benchmark fc was 70 kpa table 4 the change in fc values resulted in different values of irrigation thresholds and amounts at the swd based on the linear regression between accumulated etc and required irrigation using benchmark fc with optimized shps the r 2 0 5 in zone 1 and 0 4 in zone 2 was quite identical in both zones however it was lower than the flux based criterion with optimized shps figs 4a and 4b different shps can lead to various fcs and available water content values in the soils therefore a correct zone specific fc value can help in efficient zone specific irrigation water management within the crop field it can be concluded that the determination of fc in field conditions using optimization of shps can be an essential and foremost step in adopting best irrigation practices 3 6 limitations of the study and future research this study presented an inverse modeling approach to optimize the zone specific irrigation recommendations using zone specific optimized flux based fc the irrigation thresholds and amounts using flux based fc with optimized shps can potentially reduce the water stress in the crops increase irrigation water use efficiency and conserve water resources for irrigation however the limitation of this study is that we need field measurements for inverse modeling to optimize fc and to determine the effective irrigation thresholds and amounts this study is one dimension using hydrus 1d which does not account for lateral water flow in the model hence it would be interesting to incorporate two or three dimensional models in the future irrigation recommendations using shps derived from conventional methods such as tempe cell sand kaolin box and compare with shps from hyprop would be a future research question also it would be interesting to measure site specific etc using lysimeters and generate irrigation recommendations the outcomes of the study can be used in the crop models to understand the impact of irrigation recommendations on crop yield this study used a simplified single layer version of a complex subsurface system and it would be of interest to investigate a multilayer complex model 4 conclusions the flux based optimized fcs yielded best result for the accumulated etc and irrigation recommendations in both zones compared to irrigation recommendation using raw and benchmark fcs the determination of irrigation thresholds was highly dependent on the determination of fcs and shps in each zone the flux based fc determination showed the importance of using optimized shps over the raw shps since raw and benchmark fcs in both zones did not consider soil water dynamics and zone specific characteristics the optimized fc was at 39 kpa in zone 1 and 25 kpa in zone 2 however raw fcs in zone 1 and zone 2 were at 15 kpa and 59 kpa respectively the zone specific optimized fc in absolute values show that raw and benchmark fc values were underrepresented in zone 1 and overrepresented in zone 2 therefore raw and benchmark fcs may not be the best options in irrigation scheduling schemes without optimization also assuming a single fc benchmark throughout the field may not be the best option for irrigation recommendations the determination of fc using zone specific optimized and raw shps with a negligible drainage flux methods showed differences in irrigation thresholds and amounts to schedule irrigation resulting from the differences in the k h θ relation of shps hence considering zone specific optimized irrigation thresholds with optimized fc and shps and adopting a variable rate irrigation scheme for efficient irrigation water management in the zones can be the best climate

8864,saline water is widely used as an alternative water resource for agriculture to overcome the freshwater shortage in arid and semiarid regions but long term using of the saline water for irrigation would negatively affect soil properties and crop production and the salinity of the irrigation water should be properly managed to reduce the risks in this study saline water with five levels of electrical conductivities eciw at 1 3 ck 3 4 7 1 10 6 and 14 1 ds m 1 were used to irrigate winter wheat and summer maize with annual double cropping system in the north china plain ncp from 2006 to 2019 to decide the threshold value for long term using saline water crop yields and soil salinity were continuously examined from 2006 to 2019 and soil physicochemical properties were monitored in 2018 and 2019 after 12 years saline water irrigation results showed that soil salinity in the 0100 cm layer could be maintained at a low level using saline water with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 soil salt accumulated in winter wheat seasons could be leached from the main root zone in the following summer maize seasons which were rainy in this region due to the monsoon climate no significant difference was observed in grain yields for treatment with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 compared to ck treatment the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ec e soil ph sodium adsorption ratio and bulk density within the top soil layer of 030 cm increased with the increase in eciw whereas the soil organic carbon porosity macroaggregates 0 25 mm content and activities of catalase urease and alkaline phosphatase decreased indicating the long term using saline water irrigation deteriorated soil properties but the difference in soil properties between the treatment of eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 and the ck was not apparent there were reductions below 5 in relative grain yields and soil quality index sqi with eciw lower than 3 17 and 3 10 ds m 1 compared with ck treatment respectively comprehensive consideration to maintain a stable crop production and benign soil quality eciw of 3 10 ds m 1 for long term saline water irrigation was recommended as the safe utilization threshold in

freshwater resources play an important role in agricultural production and its shortage constrains the development of many countries in the world wang et al 2020 the scarcity of freshwater is considered to be a major concern affecting the development of agriculture in china especially in the north china plain ncp which is an important grain producing region with the area of 3 2 105 km2 and the agricultural land of 1 798 105 km2 sun et al 2015 and contributes to over 2 3 of the country s wheat and 1 3 of its maize production nbsc 2018 however many agricultural lands in this region exploit deep fresh groundwater zheng et al 2020 which has resulted in a continuous decline of the deep groundwater table in the past 40 years yan et al 2020 serious environmental and geological problems such as land subsidence have occurred because of the overuse of groundwater han et al 2021 wu et al 2010 nevertheless there are rich reserves of shallow underground saline water in the ncp particularly in the heilonggang region zhang and fei 2009 wang et al 2014 where approximately 86 3 132 8 108 m3 of the total stored saline water has a salinity of 27 g l 1 3 412 4 ds m 1 wang et al 2014 many studies have indicated that saline water resource can be used for irrigation to replace freshwater with proper management wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 yang et al 2020 guo and liu 2021 feng et al 2015 however irrigation with high salinity water could result in accumulation of salt ions in the soil change the soil physicochemical properties and potentially damage the soil environment and crop production wang et al 2022 singh et al 2021 chen et al 2019 ould ahmed et al 2010 yang et al 2020 hu et al 2020 ning et al 2021 drip irrigation with saline water increased soil electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar and decreased soil organic carbon soc content which led to adverse effects on soil environment hu et al 2020 similarly singh et al 2021 found that irrigation water with high concentrations of salt ions could reduce the availability of nutrients in the soil and adversely affect the growth and activity of soil microbes besides irrigation the complicated variation in soil salinization was also influenced by many factors such as precipitation evapotranspiration irrigation technology and cropping system zheng et al 2020 ren et al 2019 more attention should be paid to the effect of saline water irrigation on soil physicochemical properties under the long term duration due to the slow and steady change in soil properties previous studies on soil physicochemical properties under saline water irrigation have mostly focused on few indicators dong et al 2022 li et al 2019 singh et al 2021 furthermore there is lack of long term experiment on saline water irrigation especially in the ncp region the changes in soil physicochemical properties caused by saline water irrigation will affect the growth and development of crops finally affecting the crop yield wang et al 2016 lamsal et al 1999 katerji et al 1996 the effects of saline water irrigation on wheat and maize yields have been studied by many scholars feng et al 2017 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2015a cucci et al 2019 liu et al 2016 studied the impact of saline water on wheat and maize yields and found that rotational surface irrigation with fresh water at sowing of summer maize and saline water at the jointing stage of winter wheat had no significant negative effect on the aggregated annual yields of wheat and maize compared with that under only freshwater irrigation cucci et al 2019 indicated that the grain yield of maize declined by 34 when average soil salinity increased from 3 8 to 7 4 ds m 1 under saline water furrow irrigation in southern italy however wang et al 2015a reported that flood irrigation with water salinity of 5 ds m 1 increased wheat yield compared with that under salinity of 3 3 ds m 1 and the inter annual differences in wheat yield were obtained to summarize the effects of saline water irrigation on crop production can be influenced by various factors such as climatic regions irrigation methods cropping systems soil properties initial soil reaction salt load soil texture and crop varieties therefore it is essential to explore the responses of crop yield to long term saline water irrigation especially in the ncp region which characterized by freshwater shortage based on a long term saline water irrigation experiment from 2006 to 2019 for a winter wheat summer maize crop rotation this study aimed to 1 explore soil salt changes across different years i e 20062019 and cropping seasons i e four growing seasons of wheat and maize from 2017 to 2019 under saline water irrigation 2 analyze the responses of annual crop yields to saline water irrigation from 2006 to 2019 3 evaluate the variation in soil physicochemical properties within the main root zone 030 cm during the last two years 2018 and 2019 and 4 determine the safe threshold of irrigation water salinity under long term saline water irrigation the findings of our study are expected to provide a scientific basis for a better management of saline water resources and the sustainable development of agriculture in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiment was conducted at the hengshui experimental station 37 44 n 115 47 e 21 m asl in the northeast ncp fig 1 the station is characterized by a temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 12 8 and sunshine duration of 2509 h the average annual precipitation was around 500 mm the soil particle composition textural class and bulk density bd within the 0100 cm depth soil are presented in table 1 the shallow groundwater table is more than 6 m from soil surface at the experimental station at the beginning of the experiment in 2006 the soil organic matter alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen available phosphorus olsen p and available potassium nh4oac extractable k contents were 12 8 g kg 1 65 5 mg kg 1 17 6 mg kg 1 and 134 0 mg kg 1 respectively and the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ec e soil ph sar bd and water stable aggregates 0 25 mm content within plough layer 020 cm were 2 30 ds m 1 8 12 0 95 meq l 1 1 2 1 32 mg m 3 and 54 98 respectively 2 2 experimental design the long term saline water irrigation experiment was started from 2006 with a winter wheat summer maize crop rotation this study focused on the long term variation in the soil salinity within 0100 cm depth and crop yields during 20062019 and the soil physicochemical properties within the main root zone 030 cm at maize harvest of the last two years 2018 and 2019 at the experimental site the salinities of the local shallow groundwater mainly varied from 1 to 10 g l 1 1 317 7 ds m 1 zhang and fei 2009 the shallow groundwater was formed from continental salinized phreatic water and seawater intrusion zhou et al 2008 and the dominant ions were na and cl therefore five salinity levels of irrigation water with electrical conductivity eciw of 1 3 deep groundwater at 110 m depth below soil surface as ck 3 4 t1 7 1 t2 10 6 t3 and 14 1 ds m 1 t4 were designed to match the major salinity levels of the shallow groundwater in the study area the different salinity levels of the irrigation water were obtained by mixing deep groundwater with sea salt main ions of na and cl in a pool of 14 m3 the mixed water was then pumped to the experimental plots through a pipe and the quantity of water pumped was monitored by a water meter the ion compositions for different levels of the saline water are shown in table 2 the experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with three replicates the area of each plot being 9 5 m 6 0 m in this study a crop rotation with winter wheat summer maize was used in this experiment in general winter wheat cultivar shijiazhuang 8 in 20062010 and heng 4399 in 20112018 was sown after rotary tillage depth at 1215 cm in october and harvested in june of the following year summer maize cultivar zhengdan 958 was sown with no tillage in june and harvested in october of each year border irrigation was implemented to each plot with an irrigation quota of 60 mm for winter wheat depending on the rainfall in the summer season when soil water contents for the 020 cm were over 70 of the field capacity no irrigation was applied at sowing otherwise an irrigation was applied to ensure good germination of the crop during the growing season two irrigations at jointing and flowering stages were applied for summer maize the irrigation at sowing was decided as the same with winter wheat during the growing season irrigations at the seedling or jointing stages were applied depending on the soil water contents supplementary irrigation was conducted with the soil moisture of the 040 cm layer lower than 60 of the field capacity the detailed irrigation scheduling and rainfall during each crop growing season from 2017 to 2019 are shown in table 3 other field management measures such as tillage fertilization pest control and weeding were

salinity within 0100 cm depth the monthly precipitation and soil salinity within the root zone of 0 100 cm depth taking the maize harvest stage as node every year from 2006 to 2019 are exhibited in fig 2 the soil ec e 100 showed significant distinctions among treatments from 2006 to 2019 with mean ec e 100 of 0 49 1 73 3 58 and 5 27 ds m 1 in t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments higher than that of ck treatment respectively soil salinity showed a trend of fluctuation instead of continuous rise with the extension of years under the leaching effects of summer rainfall the soil salinity for treatment of eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 could be maintained at a low level with small difference of 0 13 1 49 ds m 1 in soil ec e 100 observed in t1 treatment compared with that of ck during 20062019 an apparent rising trend of the soil salinity in each treatment was observed in some years i e 2014 and 2019 with annual rainfall below 400 mm the ec e distribution across the 0 100 cm soil profile during the growth periods of wheat and maize in 20172019 were used to investigate the changes in soil salinity among different growing seasons in this study fig 3 in general the soil salinity increased with the eciw of irrigation water increasing as exhibited in fig 3 the soil ec e of the top 100 cm layer was raised dramatically after the application of saline water irrigation such as in the early and late wheat seasons and early maize seasons soil salt was leached greatly during the rainy late maize seasons especially in the main root zone of upper 30 cm the soil ec e of 30100 cm layer was higher than that of 030 cm layer with increments of 17 193 7 37 091 3 19 629 7 and 1 335 4 in wheat season of 20172018 maize season of 2018 wheat season of 20182019 and maize season of 2019 respectively the soil ec e within 030 cm and 0100 cm layer increased by 26 388 1 and 6 846 8 in wheat season of 20172018 decreased by 3 041 3 and 11 727 4 in maize season of 2018 increased by 68 9135 8 and 32 861 8 in wheat season of 20182019 and decreased by 0 930 3 and 1 615 1 in maize season of 2019 respectively the degree of soil salt accumulation in wheat season of 20182019 was more severe than that of 20172018 and the leaching rate of soil salt in the maize season of 2019 was lower than that of 2018 overall affected by rainfall the soil salt accumulated in winter wheat seasons while leached in summer maize seasons 3 2 yields of winter wheat and summer maize 3 2 1 annual grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize as exhibited in fig 4 the grain yields of winter wheat and summer maize were significantly p 0 01 affected by the irrigation water salinity s year factor y and s y interaction remarkable distinctions in the yields of winter wheat and summer maize could be observed among treatments with increasing eciw especially in the high salinity treatments i e t3 and t4 grain yield showed decreasing tendency with an increase in eciw there was no significant change p 0 05 in wheat grain yield under t1 treatment 3 4 ds m 1 compared with ck whereas when the eciw reached 7 1 ds m 1 t2 the wheat grain yields in 20082009 20102011 20112012 20132014 20162017 and 20182019 seasons were 13 9 41 2 29 5 20 0 18 1 and 35 6 significantly p 0 05 lower than that of ck treatment for summer maize no significant difference p 0 05 of grain yields existed between ck and t1 treatments except for 2009 compared with ck treatment the grain yields under t2 treatment in the most years except for 2016 significantly p 0 05 declined by 7 535 9 overall the treatment with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 generally had no significant effect on grain yields of winter wheat and summer maize while higher irrigation salinity greater than 10 6 ds m 1 distinctly decreased the grain yields 3 2 2 sustainability analysis of crop yields under long term use of saline water irrigation in our study the wheat and maize yields did not decrease with the extension of irrigation years but exhibited great annual fluctuations fig 4 as shown in fig 5 the average annual yields of winter wheat and summer maize in 20062019 declined with eciw increasing the average yields decreased significantly p 0 05 when the eciw was over 3 4 ds m 1 as the eciw increased the syi exhibited a downtrend while the cv showed an uptrend when the eciw was not greater than 3 4 ds m 1 there was little change in the syi and cv of wheat and maize yields great distinctions in syi and cv were observed in high salinity treatments with eciw over 7 1 ds m 1 compared with those of ck the syi of wheat yield was higher than that of maize yield under each treatment while the cv of maize yield was higher than wheat yield in general long term irrigation with low salinity could maintain relatively good sustainability and stability of crop yields 3 2 3 regression analysis between relative grain yield and eciw relative grain yield was obtained from the ratio of grain yield of other treatments to that of ck the regression analysis between relative grain yield and eciw is shown in fig 6 it indicates that there were significant quadratic correlations p 0 01 between the relative grain yields of winter wheat y 1 and eciw x ds m 1 summer maize y 2 and eciw x ds m 1 respectively when y 1 and y 2 reached 95 of the theoretical maximum value the eciw was 3 36 and 3 17 ds m 1 when y 1 and y 2 reached 90 of the theoretical maximum value the eciw was 4 90 and 4 62 ds m 1 3 3 soil physicochemical properties within main root zone 3 3 1 soil chemical properties soil ec e within the main root zone during the maize harvest in 2018 and 2019 was significantly p 0 01 influenced by the y s and y s interaction table 4 compared with the ck treatment soil ec e of t2 t3 and t4 treatments significantly p 0 05 increased by 1 103 99 1 958 80 and 5

that of 2018 the y and s had a significant effect p 0 05 on soil ph table 4 increasing eciw tended to raise the soil ph the soil ph of the t4 treatment in 2018 was 6 2 and t3 and t4 treatments in 2019 were 5 5 and 9 1 significantly p 0 05 greater than that of the ck treatment compared with 2018 the soil ph in 2019 increased by 2 0 4 8 for the ck to t4 treatments the soc content was also significantly p 0 01 affected by y and s and the content decreased as the eciw increased table 4 compared with ck treatment soc content significantly p 0 05 decreased by 10 920 2 for t3 treatment and 23 033 0 for t4 treatment in 20182019 compared with 2018 the soc content in 2019 decreased by 7 8 8 3 14 7 17 5 and 19 8 for ck t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments respectively soil sar was significantly p 0 01 influenced by y s and y s interaction which increased as the eciw increased table 4 the soil sar of the t1t4 treatments increased by 0 744 28 and 2 039 18 meq l 1 1 2 when compared with ck treatment in 2018 and 2019 significant differences p 0 05 were observed in t2 t3 t4 treatments compared with ck treatment soil sar was greater in 2019 than 2018 with an increment of 51 8 108 5 83 3 75 1 and 104 1 in ck t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments respectively 3 3 2 soil physical properties soil bd porosity and macroaggregate 0 25 mm content in the main root zone during the maize harvest in 2018 and 2019 were significantly p 0 01 affected by y and s soil bd tended to raise with an increase of eciw table 5 the values of t3 and t4 treatments were significantly higher p 0 05 than the ck treatment by 5 5 and 6 6 in 2018 and 5 2 and 5 7 in 2019 compared with 2018 the soil bd declined by 4 97 1 in 2019 the variation in soil porosity with increasing eciw was opposite to that of the bd table 5 as the eciw increased the content of soil macroaggregate 0 25 mm decreased the macroaggregate contents of the t2 t3 and t4 treatments were significantly lower p 0 05 than that of ck by 20 6 40 2 and 54 3 in 2018 and 16 7 29 7 and 43 5 in 2019 respectively table 5 higher contents of soil macroaggregate were observed in 2019 with 18 6 21 4 24 5 39 3 and 46 7 greater than those in 2018 for ck t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments respectively 3 3 3 soil enzyme activity the activities of soil cat ure and alp were significantly p 0 05 affected by s whereas only alp was significantly p 0 01 affected by y table 6 activities of enzymes declined as eciw increased compared with the ck treatment the cat activity of t4 treatment in 2018 significantly p 0 05 decreased by 24 1 and t3 and t4 treatments in 2019 significantly p 0 05 decreased by 17 7 and 24 8 respectively the ure activity in t4 treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased by 8 7 and 7 7 compared to the ck treatment in 2018 and 2019 respectively the alp activity in t4 treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased by 17 1 and 29 5 compared to the ck treatment in 2018 and 2019 respectively the cat ure and alp activities in 2019 were 3 111 5 1 45 2 and 13 127 6 lower than those in 2018 respectively 3 3 4 soil quality evaluation the pca results of the soil physicochemical indicators are shown in table 7 the pc1 68 2 and pc2 28 3 that were extracted explained 96 6 of the total variance of the variables with the eigenvalues greater than 1 6 82 for pc1 and 2 83 for pc2 there were high correlations among soil chemical indicators and those were also observed between chemical indicators and enzyme activities low correlations were observed between soil physical indicators and others nevertheless high correlations existed among physical indicators among the chemical indicators soil ec e as the dominant factor of all indicators should be remained in the mds the soc with the highest load in pc1 was selected into the mds soil bd had the highest load in pc2 was selected into the mds as the representation of physical indicators for the soil biological indicators the cat with the highest load among three enzymes in pc1 was remained in the mds finally the mds included ec e soc bd and cat the weight of each evaluation indicator in the mds was determined by the ratio of the load of each variable to the total cumulative loads in the respective individual pc based on different effects of increasing indicator values the scores were calculated according to li et al 2023 the weights and scores of evaluation indicators are exhibited in table 8 then the sqi was calculated using eq 6 the sqi decreased with the eciw increased compared with ck treatment the sqi of t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments declined by 6 4 14 4 20 8 and 27 3 respectively the regression equation between sqi and eciw showed a significant linear correlation p 0 01 sqi 0 0135eciw 0 6531 r2 0 99 when the sqi declined by 5 and 10 of the maximum value the corresponding eciw were 3 10 and 5 48 ds m 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of saline water irrigation on annual soil salinity saline water irrigation increased soil moisture content while brought salt into the soil irrigation water with higher salinity could bring more salt into soil and thus soil ec e 100 showed remarkable distinctions among treatments fig 2 in terms of long term variation in soil salinity soil salt reached a dynamic balance under low eciw with rainfall leaching it was similar to other long term studies of saline water irrigation in the same area zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 feng et al 2015 with relatively sufficient rainfall soil salt for treatment of eciw at 3 4 ds m 1can be kept close to that for the freshwater treatment ck in 20092010 20122013 and 20152018 soil salt accumulated during the wheat seasons while was leached during the maize seasons based on the variations of soil salinity across different growing seasons in 20172019 fig 3 this phenomenon suggested that changes in soil salt was closely related to the relative amount of irrigation and rainfall zheng et al 2020 in our previous studies feng et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the ratio of irrigation amount to precipitation i p was used to analyze soil salt variation over a period it was found that soil salt accumulated when i p increased otherwise the soil salt was leached in this experiment the i p values in the four growing seasons were 1 13 0 18 1 35 and 0 49 respectively during the 2018 summer maize season soil salt was leached greatly owing to a low i p of 0 18 however there was less rainfall during the 20182019 wheat season and 2019 maize season which raised the i p dramatically this resulted in an increase of soil salt at maize harvest stage in 2019 compared with that in 2018 numerous studies have been reported that excessive salt content exceeded the threshold salinity of crop in the root zone under saline water irrigation condition could reduce evapotranspiration and relative grain yield of crop by exerting osmotic stress feddes et al 1978 dudley et al 2008 ning et al 2020 2021 2022 which could cause a certain amount of percolation water from the root zone based on the soil water balance crop transpiration decreased linearly with the increase of soil salinity in root zone when soil salinity increased beyond the threshold salinity of crop maas and hoffman 1977 ning et al 2020 compared without salt stress condition soil ec e is below the threshold salinity of crop ning et al 2021 2022 further pointed out that higher soil salt stress in the root zone soil ec e exceeded the threshold salinity of crop limited root water uptake and crop evapotranspiration by reducing soil water availability resulting in some of the irrigation water subsequently drained away from the root zone and thus having a leaching effect on soil salt in this study the annual soil ec e 100 in the root zone fig 2 of ck t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments exceeded the threshold salinity of maize 1 7 ds m 1 reported by maas and hoffman 1977 so the evapotranspiration of maize was affected by salt stress during 2006 2019 similarly the evapotranspiration of wheat growing seasons were also affected by salt stress especially in high salinity treatments this further confirmed that the soil salt did not accumulate successively within the 0100 cm depth soil from year to year and salt leaching could occur in this study based on annual soil salinity variation the critical salinity threshold 3 4 ds m 1 obtained in our study was lower than those reported by zheng et al 2020 and zhang et al 2022a in the same area which were 7 1 ds m 1 and 4 5 ds m 1 respectively this could be ascribed to the annual irrigation amount cotton monoculture was conducted in the studies above whereas wheat maize crop rotation was conducted in our study more salt was brought into the soil with higher annual irrigation amount in our study thus to maintain the soil salinity at a safe level the critical salinity threshold of irrigation water was kept lower in this study than the studies above 4 2 effects of saline water irrigation on crop yields results showed that s y and s y interaction significantly p 0 01 affected the grain yields of winter wheat and summer maize fig 4 the grain yields significantly decreased when eciw reached 7 1 ds m 1 especially for summer maize other researchers have also reported similar results jiang et al 2012 mosaffaa and sepaskhah 2019 wang et al 2016 as observed in the results saline water could raise soil ec e and sar which can lessen the concentration difference between soil solution and root cell cytosol and inhibit the water absorption of root system hanson et al 2006 wang et al 2016 additionally the soil structure deterioration caused by sodification such as increasing soil bd decreasing porosity and decreasing macroaggregates observed in our study demonstrated the decrease of soil permeability and hydraulic conductivity li et al 2020 phogat et al 2020 which could reduce water infiltration impair growth of crop root and cause the yield reduction minhas et al 2019 distinct annual differences in grain yields of wheat and maize were also observed in this study mosaffaa and sepaskhah 2019 indicated that the changes of grain yields among different years were related with soil salt content however we found that the variation in grain yields did not always coincide with soil salinity in our study the crop yields over years may be influenced by many factors such as varieties tillage practices fertilization plant diseases e g maize stalk rot and rust in the ncp insect pests and others lv et al 2020 seddaiu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2023 climate is also one of the important factors in the variation of crop yields previous studies have demonstrated that crop yields are very sensitive to the changes in climate for example the differences in solar radiation and temperature among years could cause apparent interannual differences in yields xiao et al 2020 zhang et al 2022b soil salinity was only a dominant factor for yield differences among treatments during the same year numerous scholars had different findings in the salinity thresholds for the reduction of grain yields grieve et al 2012 indicated that the salt tolerance thresholds of wheat and maize were 6 0 and 1 7 ds m 1 respectively mosaffaa and sepaskhah 2019 reported that no reduction of wheat yield occurred with salinity level of 3 36 ds m 1 however jiang et al 2012 found that wheat yield decreased under irrigation water salinity of 3 2 ds m 1 wang et al 2016 indicated that the irrigation water with salt concentration of 3 g l 1 led to 10 reduction of maize yield the different reactions of yield responses to saline water irrigation may be caused by different varieties of wheat and maize and climate conditions studies have shown that dry and hot climate can result in higher salt sensitivity of many crops maas and hoffman 1977 in our study irrigation with eciw over 7 1 ds m 1 could lead to significant reductions of grain yield under long term saline water irrigation a high salinity soil environment formed in the fields which adversely affected the initial seedling rate and final spike number qadir and oster 2004 grieve et al 2012 therefore the reduction of grain yields in our study was possibly due to the decrease in spike number thus to avoid a low spike number of wheat and maize the seeding amount and sowing density could be increased in practical applications from regression analysis it was found that relative grain yields showed decreasing trends with eciw increasing fig 6 since the saline water has been prepared by mixing groundwater with sea salt the sariw increased along with eciw due to the concentration of na increase in this study irrigation water with high eciw had a high sariw could lead to poor soil hydraulic conductivity inhibiting water infiltration and root uptake of water singh et al 1992 guo and liu 2014 phogat et al 2020 thus reducing crop yield additionally a large amount of na ion had direct adverse effects on crops owing to a lower salt tolerance of maize hanson et al 2006 maas et al 1986 a greater decrease in the maize grain yield was observed in comparison to wheat with increasing eciw however close salinity thresholds were obtained under the same reductions of relative grain yields between the wheat and maize in our study this may be due to higher soil salinity in wheat seasons than maize seasons because only saline water was used for irrigation in our study and the irrigation amount was higher in wheat seasons 3 times of irrigation with amount of 180 mm than in maize seasons 1 or 2 times of irrigation with amount of 60 or 120 mm with higher precipitation in maize seasons than wheat seasons fig 2 a 4 3 effects of saline water irrigation on soil physicochemical properties soil ec e sar and ph are important chemical indicators that reflect soil salinization and alkalization levels significant correlations were found among the soil ec e ph and sar table 7 results showed that soil ec e and sar increased with increasing eciw which was consistent with the results of wang et al 2022 and zhang et al 2020 in our experiment na ion was the dominant cations in the irrigation water with high sariw which could participate in exchange reaction with ca2 and mg2 in the soil colloid as eciw and sariw increased the exchange and adsorption effects of na on ca2 and mg2 ions were enhanced thus more ca2 and mg2 ions were replaced and leached into deep soil with rainfall and irrigation guo et al 2019 wu and wang 2010 this led to an increase in soil sar within the top 0 30 cm layer since the summer maize season in 2019 had one additional irrigation than that of 2018 soil ec e and sar were higher in 2019 previous studies have suggested that soil sodication can also be caused by high soil sar bajwa and josan 1989 leading to an increase in soil ph similar findings were also obtained in our study high bd and low porosity indicate a poor soil structure wang et al 2015b saline water irrigation increased soil bd while reduced soil porosity in our study salt ions especially na brought by saline water could cause the dispersion of soil particles and plugging the soil pores causing an increase in bd and a reduction in soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity murtaza et al 2006 guo and liu 2014 additionally the impacts of sariw and eciw interaction on soil dispersion and hydraulic behaviour were also reported by many scholars guo and liu 2014 indicated that the adverse effects such as clay dispersion and swelling caused by high sar can be counteracted by high salinity of saline water the guidelines for water quality with different sar and ec for irrigation was also presented by ayers and tanji 1981 which numerically defined the applicability of saline water in terms of soil dispersion and infiltration rates performance we found that the irrigation water applied in our study mostly reached the no problem level according to ayers and tanji 1981 this can explain why the variation in soil bd and porosity was not so much with increasing eciw in the results the structure and quantity of aggregates can affect soil water conductivity and distribution of soil pores zhang et al 2012 carter 2002 our results showed that the macroaggregate content gradually decreased with increasing eciw table 5 this could be explained by the fact that salt ions especially na introduced into the soil can replace soil binders such as ca2 and mg2 which adsorbed on the surface of soil particles or between aggregates and then caused the expansion and dispersion of soil particles wu and wang 2010 wang et al 2018 huang et al 2011 found that saline water irrigation could reduce the water stability of soil aggregates rahimi et al 2000 reported that increasing sariw could decrease the tensile strength of soil aggregates these may be caused by the same reason as our study additionally some scholars also indicated that irrigation water with high concentration of mg2 could also lead to the destruction of soil structure especially for the irrigation water with ca mg ratio 1 qadir et al 2018 in this study the ca mg ratio of irrigation water ranged between 0 400 89 which may be a detrimental factor in 2019 the soil was sampled before the mechanical harvest of maize whereas in 2018 the soil sampling was conducted after the harvesting of maize wang et al 2017 has reported that the mechanical compaction had adverse impacts on the soil macroaggregates bd and porosity which is similar to the results of our study owing to the effect of mechanical compaction on soil in 2018 the soil physical properties were adversely affected the soil organic carbon can bind soil particles and promote aggregate formation mahmoud et al 2012 pulleman and marinissen 2004 in this study saline water irrigation most likely ruptured soil macroaggregates and this probably resulted in the release of soc dong et al 2022 additionally soil organic matter from plant production could be reduced by increasing salinity usman et al 2016 morrissey et al 2014 however some studies found that soc increased with rising salinity because of the reduced microbial activity and decomposition rate of organic carbon zhu et al 2020 this is different from our study yuan et al 2007 indicated that the decrease in decomposition rate of soc could be counteracted by the decreasing inputs from plant production under high salinity conditions based on the long term application of saline water irrigation in our study this was the most likely reason that induced the decline trend in soc content soil cat ure and alp are essential for the transformation of soil nutrients singh and kumar 2008 zornoza et al 2006 their activities are affected by various physical and chemical factors in soil bruins et al 2000 saline water irrigation inhibited the three soil enzymes activities in our study which was similar to the results of previous studies zhang et al 2015 luo et al 2017 based on a 10 year saline water drip irrigation experiment on cotton zhou et al 2022 also found that irrigation with salinity of 8 04 ds m 1 decreased the activities of alp and cat by 35 2 and 3 9 compared with freshwater treatment 0 35 ds m 1 respectively soil salt can reduce the solubility of enzymes and induce proteolytic inactivation garcia et al 2000 additionally high soil salinity can inhibit root and soil microorganisms secretion and enzyme synthesis ghollarata and raiesi 2007 rietz and haynes 2003 yuan et al 2007 indicated that the salt concentrations were more important in inhibiting the activity of soil microorganisms than individual salt ions therefore the decreasing enzyme activities were mainly influenced by increasing eciw rather than sariw as shown in table 7 the enzyme activity was the most correlated with soc indicating that organic matter could promote soil enzyme activity this was consistent with the results reported by díaz et al 2021 compared with the initial soil physicochemical properties in 2006 soil ec e ph sar bd and water stable macroaggregate 0 25 mm content did not change dramatically in 2018 under irrigation water salinity of 3 4 ds m 1 this also suggests that irrigation with appropriate salinity level could be carried out for long periods under adequate rainfall without causing great deterioration of the soil environment additionally soil physicochemical properties are not influenced by only irrigation but also by fertilization or tillage practices this is why changes were also observed under the freshwater treatment in this study long term use of low salinity of irrigation water had little negative impact on soil environment with only a decline of 6 4 in sqi under eciw of 3 4 ds m 1 nevertheless saline water irrigation still exhibited the potential to damage the soil quality therefore more attention should be paid to long term use of saline water measures such as exogenous application of calcium or biochar rotation irrigation with fresh and saline water and underground tube salt drainage can mitigate the damage from saline water irrigation and improve the soil environment singh et al 2021 shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 soil salinity in treatment with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 showed no significant changes in the rainy year of the long term irrigation experiment meanwhile the annual yields of winter wheat and summer maize showed no significant decline under eciw below 3 4 ds m 1 and the relative yields reduction of wheat and maize could be maintained below 5 under eciw lower than 3 36 and 3 17 ds m 1 respectively additionally soil physicochemical properties i e soil ec e ph sar soc bd porosity macroaggregates content and cat ure and alp activities were also not significantly influenced by treatment with eciw lower than 3 4 ds m 1 and the reduction of sqi could be maintained below 5 under eciw not greater than 3 10 ds m 1 compared with ck treatment comprehensive consideration to maintain a stable crop production and benign soil quality under long term saline water irrigation the safe utilization threshold of eciw was recommended below 3 10 ds m 1 in the ncp however the decline trend of sqi was still observed under long term use of saline water irrigation in our study which should be addressed in future studies 5 conclusion based on a long term saline water irrigation experiment since 2006 this study focused on soil salinity dynamics crop yields soil physicochemical properties and soil quality under different irrigation water salinities results showed that soil salinity within 0100 cm depth could basically achieve a dynamic equilibrium using saline water with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 soil salt accumulated in winter wheat seasons could be leached in the following rainy summer maize seasons the annual grain yields of winter wheat and summer maize did not significantly decline in treatment with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 as compared with that of the ck soil physicochemical properties within the main root zone 030 cm also did not deteriorate significantly with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 however when eciw was over 3 4 ds m 1 significant salt accumulation and apparent decline in soil quality were observed under continuous saline water irrigation being used therefore using mild saline water to irrigate crops could relieve the fresh water shortage issue and taking the advantage of the concentrated rainfall in the rainy season in the ncp to leach the salt from the top soil layers could avoid salt accumulation and achieve sustainable saline water use the upper limit in the irrigation water salinity should be decided by comprehensive consideration of maintaining a stable crop production and benign soil quality under long term utilization of the saline

8864,saline water is widely used as an alternative water resource for agriculture to overcome the freshwater shortage in arid and semiarid regions but long term using of the saline water for irrigation would negatively affect soil properties and crop production and the salinity of the irrigation water should be properly managed to reduce the risks in this study saline water with five levels of electrical conductivities eciw at 1 3 ck 3 4 7 1 10 6 and 14 1 ds m 1 were used to irrigate winter wheat and summer maize with annual double cropping system in the north china plain ncp from 2006 to 2019 to decide the threshold value for long term using saline water crop yields and soil salinity were continuously examined from 2006 to 2019 and soil physicochemical properties were monitored in 2018 and 2019 after 12 years saline water irrigation results showed that soil salinity in the 0100 cm layer could be maintained at a low level using saline water with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 soil salt accumulated in winter wheat seasons could be leached from the main root zone in the following summer maize seasons which were rainy in this region due to the monsoon climate no significant difference was observed in grain yields for treatment with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 compared to ck treatment the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ec e soil ph sodium adsorption ratio and bulk density within the top soil layer of 030 cm increased with the increase in eciw whereas the soil organic carbon porosity macroaggregates 0 25 mm content and activities of catalase urease and alkaline phosphatase decreased indicating the long term using saline water irrigation deteriorated soil properties but the difference in soil properties between the treatment of eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 and the ck was not apparent there were reductions below 5 in relative grain yields and soil quality index sqi with eciw lower than 3 17 and 3 10 ds m 1 compared with ck treatment respectively comprehensive consideration to maintain a stable crop production and benign soil quality eciw of 3 10 ds m 1 for long term saline water irrigation was recommended as the safe utilization threshold in

freshwater resources play an important role in agricultural production and its shortage constrains the development of many countries in the world wang et al 2020 the scarcity of freshwater is considered to be a major concern affecting the development of agriculture in china especially in the north china plain ncp which is an important grain producing region with the area of 3 2 105 km2 and the agricultural land of 1 798 105 km2 sun et al 2015 and contributes to over 2 3 of the country s wheat and 1 3 of its maize production nbsc 2018 however many agricultural lands in this region exploit deep fresh groundwater zheng et al 2020 which has resulted in a continuous decline of the deep groundwater table in the past 40 years yan et al 2020 serious environmental and geological problems such as land subsidence have occurred because of the overuse of groundwater han et al 2021 wu et al 2010 nevertheless there are rich reserves of shallow underground saline water in the ncp particularly in the heilonggang region zhang and fei 2009 wang et al 2014 where approximately 86 3 132 8 108 m3 of the total stored saline water has a salinity of 27 g l 1 3 412 4 ds m 1 wang et al 2014 many studies have indicated that saline water resource can be used for irrigation to replace freshwater with proper management wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 yang et al 2020 guo and liu 2021 feng et al 2015 however irrigation with high salinity water could result in accumulation of salt ions in the soil change the soil physicochemical properties and potentially damage the soil environment and crop production wang et al 2022 singh et al 2021 chen et al 2019 ould ahmed et al 2010 yang et al 2020 hu et al 2020 ning et al 2021 drip irrigation with saline water increased soil electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar and decreased soil organic carbon soc content which led to adverse effects on soil environment hu et al 2020 similarly singh et al 2021 found that irrigation water with high concentrations of salt ions could reduce the availability of nutrients in the soil and adversely affect the growth and activity of soil microbes besides irrigation the complicated variation in soil salinization was also influenced by many factors such as precipitation evapotranspiration irrigation technology and cropping system zheng et al 2020 ren et al 2019 more attention should be paid to the effect of saline water irrigation on soil physicochemical properties under the long term duration due to the slow and steady change in soil properties previous studies on soil physicochemical properties under saline water irrigation have mostly focused on few indicators dong et al 2022 li et al 2019 singh et al 2021 furthermore there is lack of long term experiment on saline water irrigation especially in the ncp region the changes in soil physicochemical properties caused by saline water irrigation will affect the growth and development of crops finally affecting the crop yield wang et al 2016 lamsal et al 1999 katerji et al 1996 the effects of saline water irrigation on wheat and maize yields have been studied by many scholars feng et al 2017 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2015a cucci et al 2019 liu et al 2016 studied the impact of saline water on wheat and maize yields and found that rotational surface irrigation with fresh water at sowing of summer maize and saline water at the jointing stage of winter wheat had no significant negative effect on the aggregated annual yields of wheat and maize compared with that under only freshwater irrigation cucci et al 2019 indicated that the grain yield of maize declined by 34 when average soil salinity increased from 3 8 to 7 4 ds m 1 under saline water furrow irrigation in southern italy however wang et al 2015a reported that flood irrigation with water salinity of 5 ds m 1 increased wheat yield compared with that under salinity of 3 3 ds m 1 and the inter annual differences in wheat yield were obtained to summarize the effects of saline water irrigation on crop production can be influenced by various factors such as climatic regions irrigation methods cropping systems soil properties initial soil reaction salt load soil texture and crop varieties therefore it is essential to explore the responses of crop yield to long term saline water irrigation especially in the ncp region which characterized by freshwater shortage based on a long term saline water irrigation experiment from 2006 to 2019 for a winter wheat summer maize crop rotation this study aimed to 1 explore soil salt changes across different years i e 20062019 and cropping seasons i e four growing seasons of wheat and maize from 2017 to 2019 under saline water irrigation 2 analyze the responses of annual crop yields to saline water irrigation from 2006 to 2019 3 evaluate the variation in soil physicochemical properties within the main root zone 030 cm during the last two years 2018 and 2019 and 4 determine the safe threshold of irrigation water salinity under long term saline water irrigation the findings of our study are expected to provide a scientific basis for a better management of saline water resources and the sustainable development of agriculture in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiment was conducted at the hengshui experimental station 37 44 n 115 47 e 21 m asl in the northeast ncp fig 1 the station is characterized by a temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 12 8 and sunshine duration of 2509 h the average annual precipitation was around 500 mm the soil particle composition textural class and bulk density bd within the 0100 cm depth soil are presented in table 1 the shallow groundwater table is more than 6 m from soil surface at the experimental station at the beginning of the experiment in 2006 the soil organic matter alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen available phosphorus olsen p and available potassium nh4oac extractable k contents were 12 8 g kg 1 65 5 mg kg 1 17 6 mg kg 1 and 134 0 mg kg 1 respectively and the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil

long term saline water irrigation experiment was started from 2006 with a winter wheat summer maize crop rotation this study focused on the long term variation in the soil salinity within 0100 cm depth and crop yields during 20062019 and the soil physicochemical properties within the main root zone 030 cm at maize harvest of the last two years 2018 and 2019 at the experimental site the salinities of the local shallow groundwater mainly varied from 1 to 10 g l 1 1 317 7 ds m 1 zhang and fei 2009 the shallow groundwater was formed from continental salinized phreatic water and seawater intrusion zhou et al 2008 and the dominant ions were na and cl therefore five salinity levels of irrigation water with electrical conductivity eciw of 1 3 deep groundwater at 110 m depth below soil surface as ck 3 4 t1 7 1 t2 10 6 t3 and 14 1 ds m 1 t4 were designed to match the major salinity levels of the shallow groundwater in the study area the different salinity levels of the irrigation water were obtained by mixing deep groundwater with sea salt main ions of na and cl in a pool of 14 m3 the mixed water was then pumped to the experimental plots through a pipe and the quantity of water pumped was monitored by a water meter the ion compositions for different levels of the saline water are shown in table 2 the experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with three replicates the area of each plot being 9 5 m 6 0 m in this study a crop rotation with winter wheat summer maize was used in this experiment in general winter wheat cultivar shijiazhuang 8 in 20062010

harvested in october of each year border irrigation was implemented to each plot with an irrigation quota of 60 mm for winter wheat depending on the rainfall in the summer season when soil water contents for the 020 cm were over 70 of the field capacity no irrigation was applied at sowing otherwise an irrigation was applied to ensure good germination of the crop during the growing season two irrigations at jointing and flowering stages were applied for summer maize the irrigation at sowing was decided as the same with winter wheat during the growing season irrigations at the seedling or jointing stages were applied depending on the soil water contents supplementary irrigation was conducted with the soil moisture of the 040 cm layer lower than 60 of the field capacity the detailed

salinity within 0100 cm depth the monthly precipitation and soil salinity within the root zone of 0 100 cm depth taking the maize harvest stage as node every year from 2006 to 2019 are exhibited in fig 2 the soil ec e 100 showed significant distinctions among treatments from 2006 to 2019 with mean ec e 100 of 0 49 1 73 3 58 and 5 27 ds m 1 in t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments higher than that of ck treatment respectively soil salinity showed a trend of fluctuation instead of continuous rise with the extension of years under the leaching effects of summer rainfall the soil salinity for treatment of eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 could be maintained at a low level with small difference of 0 13 1 49 ds m 1 in soil ec e 100 observed in t1 treatment compared with that of ck during 20062019 an apparent rising trend of the soil salinity in each treatment was observed in some years i e 2014 and 2019 with annual rainfall below 400 mm the ec e distribution across the 0 100 cm soil profile during the growth periods of wheat and maize in 20172019 were used to investigate the changes in soil salinity among different growing seasons in this study fig 3 in general the soil salinity increased with the eciw of irrigation water increasing as exhibited in fig 3 the soil ec e of the top 100 cm layer was raised dramatically after the application of saline water irrigation such as in the early and late wheat seasons and early maize seasons soil salt was leached greatly during the rainy late maize seasons especially in the main root zone of upper 30 cm the soil ec e of 30100 cm layer was higher than that of 030 cm layer with increments of 17 193 7 37 091 3 19 629 7 and 1 335 4 in wheat season of 20172018 maize season of 2018 wheat season of 20182019 and maize season of 2019 respectively the soil ec e within 030 cm and 0100 cm layer increased by 26 388 1 and 6 846 8 in wheat season of 20172018 decreased by 3 041 3 and 11 727 4 in maize season of 2018 increased by 68 9135 8 and 32 861 8 in wheat season of 20182019 and decreased by 0 930 3 and 1 615 1 in maize season of 2019 respectively the degree of soil salt accumulation in wheat season of 20182019 was more severe than that of 20172018 and the leaching rate of soil salt in the maize season of 2019 was lower than that of 2018 overall affected by rainfall the soil salt accumulated in winter wheat seasons while leached in summer maize seasons 3 2 yields of winter wheat and summer maize 3 2 1 annual grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize as exhibited in fig 4 the grain yields of winter wheat and summer maize were significantly p 0 01 affected by the irrigation water salinity s year factor y and s y interaction remarkable distinctions in the yields of winter wheat and summer maize could be observed among treatments with increasing eciw especially in the high salinity treatments i e t3 and t4 grain yield showed decreasing tendency with an increase in eciw there was no significant change p 0 05 in wheat grain yield under t1 treatment 3 4 ds m 1 compared with ck whereas when the eciw reached 7 1 ds m 1 t2 the wheat grain yields in 20082009 20102011 20112012 20132014 20162017 and 20182019 seasons were 13 9 41 2 29 5 20 0 18 1 and 35 6 significantly p 0 05 lower than that of ck treatment for summer maize no significant difference p 0 05 of grain yields existed between ck and t1 treatments except for 2009 compared with ck treatment the grain yields under t2 treatment in the most years except for 2016 significantly p 0 05 declined by 7 535 9 overall the treatment with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 generally had no significant effect on grain yields of winter wheat and summer maize while higher irrigation salinity greater than 10 6 ds m 1 distinctly decreased the grain yields 3 2 2 sustainability analysis of crop yields under long term use of saline water irrigation in our study the wheat and maize yields did not decrease with the extension of irrigation years but exhibited great annual fluctuations fig 4 as shown in fig 5 the average annual yields of winter wheat and summer maize in 20062019 declined with eciw increasing the average yields decreased significantly p 0 05 when the eciw was over 3 4 ds m 1 as the eciw increased the syi exhibited a downtrend while the cv showed an uptrend when the eciw was not greater than 3 4 ds m 1 there was little change in the syi and cv of wheat and maize yields great distinctions in syi and cv were observed in high salinity treatments with eciw over 7 1 ds m 1 compared with those of ck the syi of wheat yield was higher than that of maize yield under each treatment while the cv of maize yield was higher than wheat yield in general long term irrigation with low salinity could maintain relatively good sustainability and stability of crop yields 3 2 3 regression analysis between relative grain yield and eciw relative grain yield was obtained from the ratio of grain yield of other treatments to that of ck the regression analysis between relative grain yield and eciw is shown in fig 6 it indicates that there were significant quadratic correlations p 0 01 between the relative grain yields of winter wheat y 1 and eciw x ds m 1 summer maize y 2 and eciw x ds m 1 respectively when y 1 and y 2 reached 95 of the theoretical maximum value the eciw was 3 36 and 3 17 ds m 1 when y 1 and y 2 reached 90 of the theoretical maximum value the eciw was

that of 2018 the y and s had a significant effect p 0 05 on soil ph table 4 increasing eciw tended to raise the soil ph the soil ph of the t4 treatment in 2018 was 6 2 and t3 and t4 treatments in 2019 were 5 5 and 9 1 significantly p 0 05 greater than that of the ck treatment compared with 2018 the soil ph in 2019 increased by 2 0 4 8 for the ck to t4 treatments the soc content was also

the alp activity in t4 treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased by 17 1 and 29 5 compared to the ck treatment in 2018 and 2019 respectively the cat ure and alp activities in 2019 were 3 111 5 1 45 2 and 13 127 6 lower than those in 2018 respectively 3 3 4 soil quality evaluation the pca results of the soil physicochemical indicators are shown in table 7 the pc1 68 2 and pc2 28 3 that were extracted explained 96 6 of the total variance of the variables with the eigenvalues greater than 1 6 82 for pc1 and 2 83 for pc2 there were high correlations among soil chemical indicators and those were also observed between chemical indicators and enzyme activities low correlations were observed between soil physical indicators and others nevertheless high correlations existed among physical indicators among the chemical indicators soil ec e as the dominant factor of all indicators should be remained in the mds the soc with the highest load in pc1 was selected into the mds soil bd had the highest load in pc2 was selected into the mds as the representation of physical indicators for the soil biological indicators the cat with the highest load among three enzymes in pc1 was remained in the mds finally the mds included ec e soc bd and cat the weight of each evaluation indicator in the mds was determined by the ratio of the load of each variable to the total cumulative loads in the respective individual pc based on different effects of increasing indicator values the scores were calculated according to li et al 2023 the weights and scores of evaluation indicators are exhibited in table 8 then the sqi was calculated using eq 6 the sqi decreased with the eciw increased compared with ck treatment the sqi of t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments declined by 6 4 14 4 20 8 and 27 3 respectively the regression equation between sqi and eciw showed a significant linear correlation p 0 01 sqi 0 0135eciw 0 6531 r2 0 99 when the sqi declined by 5 and 10 of the maximum value the corresponding eciw were 3 10 and 5 48 ds m 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of saline water irrigation on annual soil salinity saline water irrigation increased soil moisture content while brought salt into the soil irrigation water with higher salinity could bring more salt into soil and thus soil ec e 100 showed remarkable distinctions among treatments fig 2 in terms of long term variation in soil salinity soil salt reached a dynamic balance under low eciw with rainfall leaching it was similar to other long term studies of saline water irrigation in the same area zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 feng et al 2015 with relatively sufficient rainfall soil salt for treatment of eciw at 3 4 ds m 1can be kept close to that for the freshwater treatment ck in 20092010 20122013 and 20152018 soil salt accumulated during the wheat seasons while was leached during the maize seasons based on the variations of soil salinity across different growing seasons in 20172019 fig 3 this phenomenon suggested that changes in soil salt was closely related to the relative amount of irrigation and rainfall zheng et al 2020 in our previous studies feng et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the ratio of irrigation amount to precipitation i p was used to analyze soil salt variation over a period it was found that soil salt accumulated when i p increased otherwise the soil salt was leached in this experiment the i p values in the four growing seasons were 1 13 0 18 1 35 and 0 49 respectively during the 2018 summer maize season soil salt was leached greatly owing to a low i p of 0 18 however there was less rainfall during the 20182019 wheat season and 2019 maize season which raised the i p dramatically this resulted in an increase of soil salt at maize harvest stage in 2019 compared with that in 2018 numerous studies have been reported that excessive salt content exceeded the threshold salinity of crop in the root zone under saline water irrigation condition could reduce evapotranspiration and relative grain yield of crop by exerting osmotic stress feddes et al 1978 dudley et al 2008 ning et al 2020 2021 2022 which could cause a certain amount of percolation water from the root zone based on the soil water balance crop transpiration decreased linearly with the increase of soil salinity in root zone when soil salinity increased beyond the threshold salinity of crop maas and hoffman 1977 ning et al 2020 compared without salt stress condition soil ec e is below the threshold salinity of crop ning et al 2021 2022 further pointed out that higher soil salt stress in the root zone soil ec e exceeded the threshold salinity of crop limited root water uptake and crop evapotranspiration by reducing soil water availability resulting in some of the irrigation water subsequently drained away from the root zone and thus having a leaching effect on soil salt in this study the annual soil ec e 100 in the root zone fig 2 of ck t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments exceeded the threshold salinity of maize 1 7 ds m 1 reported by maas and hoffman 1977 so the evapotranspiration of maize was affected by salt stress during 2006 2019 similarly the evapotranspiration of wheat growing seasons were also affected by salt stress especially in high salinity treatments this further confirmed that the soil salt did not accumulate successively within the 0100 cm depth soil from year to year and salt leaching could occur in this study based on annual soil salinity variation the critical salinity threshold 3 4 ds m 1 obtained in our study was lower than those reported by zheng et al 2020 and zhang et al 2022a in the same area which were 7 1 ds m 1 and 4 5 ds m 1 respectively this could be ascribed to the annual irrigation amount cotton monoculture was conducted in the studies above whereas wheat maize crop rotation was conducted in our study more salt was brought into the soil with higher annual irrigation amount in our study thus to maintain the soil salinity at a safe level the critical salinity threshold of irrigation water was kept lower in this study than the studies above 4 2 effects of saline water irrigation on crop yields results showed that s y and s y interaction significantly p 0 01 affected the grain yields of winter wheat and summer maize fig 4 the grain yields significantly decreased when eciw reached 7 1 ds m 1 especially for summer maize other researchers have also reported similar results jiang et al 2012 mosaffaa and sepaskhah 2019 wang et al 2016 as observed in the results saline water could raise soil ec e and sar which can lessen the concentration difference between soil solution and root cell cytosol and inhibit the water absorption of root system hanson et al 2006 wang et al 2016 additionally the soil structure deterioration caused by sodification such as increasing soil bd decreasing porosity and decreasing macroaggregates observed in our study demonstrated the decrease of soil permeability and hydraulic conductivity li et al 2020 phogat et al 2020 which could reduce water infiltration impair growth of crop root and cause the yield reduction minhas et al 2019 distinct annual differences in grain yields of wheat and maize were also observed in this study mosaffaa and sepaskhah 2019 indicated that the changes of grain yields among different years were related with soil salt content however we found that the variation in grain yields did not always coincide with soil salinity in our study the crop yields over years may be influenced by many factors such as varieties tillage practices fertilization plant diseases e g maize stalk rot and rust in the ncp insect pests and others lv et al 2020 seddaiu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2023 climate is also one of the important factors in the variation of crop yields previous studies have demonstrated that crop yields are very sensitive to the changes in climate for example the differences in solar radiation and temperature among years could cause apparent interannual differences in yields xiao et al 2020 zhang et al 2022b soil salinity was only a dominant factor for yield differences among treatments during the same year numerous scholars had different findings in the salinity thresholds for the reduction of grain yields grieve et al 2012 indicated that the salt tolerance thresholds of wheat and maize were 6 0 and 1 7 ds m 1 respectively mosaffaa and sepaskhah 2019 reported that no reduction of wheat yield occurred with salinity level of 3 36 ds m 1 however jiang et al 2012 found that wheat yield decreased under irrigation water salinity of 3 2 ds m 1 wang et al 2016 indicated that the irrigation water with salt concentration of 3 g l 1 led to 10 reduction of maize yield the different reactions of yield responses to saline water irrigation may be caused by different varieties of wheat and maize and climate conditions studies have shown that dry and hot climate can result in higher salt sensitivity of many crops maas and hoffman 1977 in our study irrigation with eciw over 7 1 ds m 1 could lead to significant reductions of grain yield under long term saline water irrigation a high salinity soil environment formed in the fields which adversely affected the initial seedling rate and final spike number qadir and oster 2004 grieve et al 2012 therefore the reduction of grain yields in our study was possibly due to the decrease in spike number thus to avoid a low spike number of wheat and maize the seeding amount and sowing density could be increased in practical applications from regression analysis it was found that relative grain yields showed decreasing trends with eciw increasing fig 6 since the saline water has been prepared by mixing groundwater with sea salt the sariw increased along with eciw due to the concentration of na increase in this study irrigation water with high eciw had a high sariw could lead to poor soil hydraulic conductivity inhibiting water infiltration and root uptake of water singh et al 1992 guo and liu 2014 phogat et al 2020 thus reducing crop yield additionally a large amount of na ion had direct adverse effects on crops owing to a lower salt tolerance of maize hanson et al 2006 maas et al 1986 a greater decrease in the maize grain yield was observed in comparison to wheat with increasing eciw however close salinity thresholds were obtained under the same reductions of relative grain yields between the wheat and maize in our study this may be due to higher soil salinity in wheat seasons than maize seasons because only saline water was used for irrigation in our study and the irrigation amount was higher in wheat seasons 3 times of irrigation with amount of 180 mm than in maize seasons 1 or 2 times of irrigation with amount of 60 or 120 mm with higher precipitation in maize seasons than wheat seasons fig 2 a 4 3 effects of saline water irrigation on soil physicochemical properties soil ec e sar and ph are important chemical indicators that reflect soil salinization and alkalization levels significant correlations were found among the soil ec e ph and sar table 7 results showed that soil ec e and sar increased with increasing eciw which was consistent with the results of wang et al 2022 and zhang et al 2020 in our experiment na ion was the dominant cations in the irrigation water with high sariw which could participate in exchange reaction with ca2 and mg2 in the soil colloid as eciw and sariw increased the exchange and adsorption effects of na on ca2 and mg2 ions were enhanced thus more ca2 and mg2 ions were replaced and leached into deep soil with rainfall and irrigation guo et al 2019 wu and wang 2010 this led to an increase in soil sar within the top 0 30 cm layer since the summer maize season in 2019 had one additional irrigation than that of 2018 soil ec e and sar were higher in 2019 previous studies have suggested that soil sodication can also be caused by high soil sar bajwa and josan 1989 leading to an increase in soil ph similar findings were also obtained in our study high bd and low porosity indicate a poor soil structure wang et al 2015b saline water irrigation increased soil bd while reduced soil porosity in our study salt ions especially na brought by saline water could cause the dispersion of soil particles and plugging the soil pores causing an increase in bd and a reduction in soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity murtaza et al 2006 guo and liu 2014 additionally the impacts of sariw and eciw interaction on soil dispersion and hydraulic behaviour were also reported by many scholars guo and liu 2014 indicated that the adverse effects such as clay dispersion and swelling caused by high sar can be counteracted by high salinity of saline water the guidelines for water quality with different sar and ec for irrigation was also presented by ayers and tanji 1981 which numerically defined the applicability of saline water in terms of soil dispersion and infiltration rates performance we found that the irrigation water applied in our study mostly reached the no problem level according to ayers and tanji 1981 this can explain why the variation in soil bd and porosity was not so much with increasing eciw in the results the structure and quantity of aggregates can affect soil water conductivity and distribution of soil pores zhang et al 2012 carter 2002 our results showed that the macroaggregate content gradually decreased with increasing eciw table 5 this could be explained by the fact that salt ions especially na introduced into the soil can replace soil binders such as ca2 and mg2 which adsorbed on the surface of soil particles or between aggregates and then caused the expansion and dispersion of soil particles wu and wang 2010 wang et al 2018 huang et al 2011 found that saline water irrigation could reduce the water stability of soil aggregates rahimi et al 2000 reported that increasing sariw could decrease the tensile strength of soil aggregates these may be caused by the same reason as our study additionally some scholars also indicated that irrigation water with high concentration of mg2 could also lead to the destruction of soil structure especially for the irrigation water with ca mg ratio 1 qadir et al 2018 in this study the ca mg ratio of irrigation water ranged between 0 400 89 which may be a detrimental factor in 2019 the soil was sampled before the mechanical harvest of maize whereas in 2018 the soil sampling was conducted after the harvesting of maize wang et al 2017 has reported that the mechanical compaction had adverse impacts on the soil macroaggregates bd and porosity which is similar to the results of our study owing to the effect of mechanical compaction on soil in 2018 the soil physical properties were adversely affected the soil organic carbon can bind soil particles and promote aggregate formation mahmoud et al 2012 pulleman and marinissen 2004 in this study saline water irrigation most likely ruptured soil macroaggregates and this probably resulted in the release of soc dong et al 2022 additionally soil organic matter from plant production could be reduced by increasing salinity usman et al 2016 morrissey et al 2014 however some studies found that soc increased with rising salinity because of the reduced microbial activity and decomposition rate of organic carbon zhu et al 2020 this is different from our study yuan et al 2007 indicated that the decrease in decomposition rate of soc could be counteracted by the decreasing inputs from plant production under high salinity conditions based on the long term application of saline water irrigation in our study this was the most likely reason that induced the decline trend in soc content soil cat ure and alp are essential for the transformation of soil nutrients singh and kumar 2008 zornoza et al 2006 their activities are affected by various physical and chemical factors in soil bruins et al 2000 saline water irrigation inhibited the three soil enzymes activities in our study which was similar to the results of previous studies zhang et al 2015 luo et al 2017 based on a 10 year saline water drip irrigation experiment on cotton zhou et al 2022 also found that irrigation with salinity of 8 04 ds m 1 decreased the activities of alp and cat by 35 2 and 3 9 compared with freshwater treatment 0 35 ds m 1 respectively soil salt can reduce the solubility of enzymes and induce proteolytic inactivation garcia et al 2000 additionally high soil salinity can inhibit root and soil microorganisms secretion and enzyme synthesis ghollarata and raiesi 2007 rietz and haynes 2003 yuan et al 2007 indicated that the salt concentrations were more important in inhibiting the activity of soil microorganisms than individual salt ions therefore the decreasing enzyme activities were mainly influenced by increasing eciw rather than sariw as shown in table 7 the enzyme activity was the most correlated with soc indicating that organic matter could promote soil enzyme activity this was consistent with the results reported by díaz et al 2021 compared with the initial soil physicochemical properties in 2006 soil ec e ph sar bd and water stable macroaggregate 0 25 mm content did not change dramatically in 2018 under irrigation water salinity of 3 4 ds m 1 this also suggests that irrigation with appropriate salinity level could be carried out for long periods under adequate rainfall without causing great deterioration of the soil environment additionally soil physicochemical properties are not influenced by only irrigation but also by fertilization or tillage practices this is why changes were also observed under the freshwater treatment in this study long term use of low salinity of irrigation water had little negative impact on soil environment with only a decline of 6 4 in sqi under eciw of 3 4 ds m 1 nevertheless saline water irrigation still exhibited the potential to damage the soil quality therefore more attention should be paid to long term use of saline water measures such as exogenous application of calcium or biochar rotation irrigation with fresh and saline water and underground tube salt drainage can mitigate the damage from saline water irrigation and improve the soil environment singh et al 2021 shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 soil salinity in treatment with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 showed no significant changes in the rainy year of the long term irrigation experiment meanwhile the annual yields of winter wheat and summer maize showed no significant decline under eciw below 3 4 ds m 1 and the relative yields reduction of wheat and maize could be maintained below 5 under eciw lower than 3 36 and 3 17 ds m 1 respectively additionally soil physicochemical properties i e soil ec e ph sar soc bd porosity macroaggregates content and cat ure and alp activities were also not significantly influenced by treatment with eciw lower than 3 4 ds m 1 and the reduction of sqi could be maintained below 5 under eciw not greater than 3 10 ds m 1 compared with ck treatment comprehensive consideration to maintain a stable crop production and benign soil quality under long term saline water irrigation the safe utilization threshold of eciw was recommended below 3 10 ds m 1 in the ncp however the decline trend of sqi was still observed under long term use of saline water irrigation in our study which should be addressed in future studies 5 conclusion based on a long term saline water irrigation experiment since 2006 this study focused on soil salinity dynamics crop yields soil physicochemical properties and soil quality under different irrigation water salinities results showed that soil salinity within 0100 cm depth could basically achieve a dynamic equilibrium using saline water with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 soil salt accumulated in winter wheat seasons could be leached in the following rainy summer maize seasons the annual grain yields of winter wheat and summer maize did not significantly decline in treatment with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 as compared with that of the ck soil physicochemical properties within the main root zone 030 cm also did not deteriorate significantly with eciw at 3 4 ds m 1 however when eciw was over 3 4 ds m 1 significant salt accumulation and apparent decline in soil quality were observed under continuous saline water irrigation being used therefore using mild saline water to irrigate crops could relieve the fresh water shortage issue and taking the advantage of the concentrated rainfall in the rainy season in the ncp to leach the salt from the top soil layers could avoid salt accumulation and achieve sustainable saline water use the upper limit in the irrigation water salinity should be decided by comprehensive consideration of maintaining a stable crop production and benign soil quality under long term utilization of the saline
