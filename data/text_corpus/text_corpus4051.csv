20255,an ultra deep water remotely operated vehicle rov can be designed to have an almost neutral buoyancy to compensate the large tension coming from the long and heavy umbilical that connects the rov to the surface facility however an rov with light submerged weight experiences large motions when it is traveling through the splash zone due to the hydrodynamic loads on the rov these motions lead to tension spikes in the umbilical also known as snap loads which can damage the umbilical components and endanger the rov operation it is important to ensure that the tension spikes in the umbilical never exceed the safe working load during launch and recovery of the rov around the splash zone the non linear interaction between rov and surface waves strongly governs the tension in the umbilical which is also exacerbated by the ship motions and winching mechanisms this study focuses on experimental measurement and numerical prediction of the tension in the umbilical during launch and recovery of an ultra deep water work class rov passing through splash zone under a set of regular waves combined with winching process and ship motions a 1 10 model of a deep water rov is built then lowered to and raise up from the water under 5 different regular wave conditions generated in a wave flume facility for each wave set three different ship motions and five winching conditions are simulated by superimposing a sinusoidal motion to the constant haul in and pay out of the umbilical from an electric motor in the end a simple numerical model is developed to replicate the wave flume experiment the wave flume experiments and numerical simulations show that the recovery process experiences larger umbilical tension than the launch process in general for the launching process the snap load can be suppressed down by increasing the pay out speed of the winch faster than the terminal velocity of the rov in water though a certain winch mechanism is required to minimize the tension spike due to the sudden start or end of the winching for the recovery of the rov increasing the winch speed does not significantly reduce the maximum tension in the umbilical though minimizing the ship motions shows a great effect on suppressing the tension due to snap load the developed numerical model shows a good agreement with the experimental results hence it is also used to predict safe working window for launch and recovery of the rov through splash zone keywords deep water rov snap force umbilical splash zone wave flume 1 introduction an ultra deep water rov commonly has working procedures which can be sequentially grouped into five main phases launching lowering operating rising and recovery during the launching phase the rov is lowered through the splash zone by gradually extending the umbilical fig 1 shows an illustration of this process as the opposite the umbilical is hauled in to move the rov up from water to air during the recovery phase wave induced rov and ship motions may hinder the success of these two phases there is a reciprocal interaction between the rov and ocean waves which is also exacerbated by the wave induced ship motions resulting in a non linear relation between wave and tension in the umbilical that is difficult to be modelled accurately by a simple mathematical formulation this combination of wave ship and rov motions may initiate a slack in the umbilical commonly followed by a rapid transition to taut condition and can drastically increase the tension in the umbilical this phenomenon is known as snap load and it may exceed the safe working load swl niedzwecki and thampi 1988 or the allowable bending strain driscoll et al 2000 of the umbilical leading to a premature failure of the line therefore a proper analysis of the system should be performed considering the non linear interaction between rov umbilical ship and wave to define the environmental limit of launch and recovery process dnv has a recommended practice for lifting operation through splash zone which provides a simplified method to analyze the hydrodynamic forces on an offshore system during its lifting procedure through splash zone dnv 2019 in the dnv methodology the dynamic amplification factor daf in the rope line tension during lowering phase of the system is determined by taking the ratio of total force static and hydrodynamic forces to the static force static force is described by the difference between dry weight and buoyancy force of the offshore system the hydrodynamic forces are the forces on the offshore system due to the ocean waves and determined through four force components slamming varying buoyancy drag and inertia forces when the total upward hydrodynamic forces exceed the static force the slack occurs on the umbilical triggering the snap force in the event of slack the hydrodynamic forces term are substituted with the snap force term using daf the tension on the umbilical can be simply assessed whether it exceeds the safe working load or not in term of launch phase by comparing the results from dnv simplified formulation and the numerical models it is shown that the recommended practice from dnv usually leads to overestimated results kimiaei and khosroshahli 2008 kimiaei et al 2009 by utilizing a proper numerical model to represent the umbilical and the rov more accurate and less conservative results can be achieved through time domain analysis of the system for numerical simulation a set of simplification are commonly made where the umbilical is represented by a series of axial spring and damper while a lump mass with predefined hydrodynamic parameters represents the rov khojasteh and kamali 2017 listed various studies on marine cable structural analysis and their application to numerically represent the umbilical of rov the wave induced motion of the ship is commonly characterized through response amplitude operator rao of the ship which translates the wave motion into excitations for the top of the umbilical model it is also reasonable to assume that the rov dimension is small compared to the wavelength indicating that the viscous drag and the mass load are more dominant than the diffraction load faltinsen 1993 as a result the wave load on rov during launch and recovery phase can be represented by morison equation morison et al 1950 however obtaining precise hydrodynamic coefficients for the umbilical and rov are another important challenge a precise drag and added mass coefficient can be obtained using computational fluid dynamic cfd allowing a more appropriate structural and hydrodynamic analysis of the launch and recovery process jia and agrawal 2014 showed an example of fluid structure interaction model using a commercial cfd software for analysing the lowering phase of a subsea structure another way to appropriately capture the interaction between the surface wave and an offshore system is by performing a scaled experiment in the wave flume nam et al 2017 presented their work on the analysis of a lifted subsea manifold through scaled model in the wave basin the scaled model consisted of a crane model hoisting line ship and a 3 d printed of the subsea manifold they then compared the wave basin experiment result with a numerical model and showed a good agreement between results of the two approaches for rov launch and recovery sayer 2008 performed an experiment in a wave flume with a 1 8 scale model of a work class rov he focused on measuring the added mass and drag coefficients of the rov traveling through the splash zone and neglected the ship motions and winch speed during the test the hydrodynamic coefficients were feed into morison equation with airy and stokes waves to compare the measured hydrodynamic loads on the rov for lightweight rov the snap load is inevitable and critical to the launch and recovery process hence it is crucial to incorporate the snap load during the flume experiment hennessey et al 2005 performed a test to study snap load on a synthetic rope where they dropped a steel bar vertically and measured the tension of the line and the acceleration of the bar using load cell and accelerometer respectively hsu et al 2019 performed a snap load experiment in the wave flume to measure its effect on the mooring line in shallow water they combined a load cell to measure the load and a camera for particle image velocimetry piv to measure the motion of the mooring for normal operation of an ultra deep water rov in deep seas the umbilical tensile load under self weight of the rov umbilical system is not very far from its safe working load dynamically amplified load in the umbilical during normal operation of the rov in deep seas may be more onerous than those ones during launch and recovery of the rov through splash zone lubis et al 2021 studied these effects and possible options for minimizing the dynamic tensile loads for an ultra deep water rov operating in deep seas under combined effects of wave current and ship motions in this study the interaction between rov wave and ship motion during launching and recovery process when it is passing through splash zone is firstly observed experimentally through a 1 10 scaled model of an ultra deep water work class rov in a wave flume various combinations of winch speeds regular waves and ship motions are generated to see their effects on the magnitude of snap load with the inclusion of ship motion winching mechanism and slack in the umbilical a better representation of rov launch and recovery operations is expected in the wave flume a simplified and practical numerical model is also developed and then validated based on wave flume experimental results this numerical model is later used to simulate the launch and recovery simulation under larger waves than those ones generated in the flume in the end a safe working window for launching and recovering the ultra deep water work class rov through splash zone is determined using the numerical model 2 experiment set up and procedure 2 1 scaling system based on buckingham s π theorem buckingham 1914 all the parameters involved in an experiment can be represented by a set of dimensionless parameters π in this experiment three parameters are selected to normalize the remaining parameters rov length l gravity acceleration g and density of water ρ the

engineering lab coel of the university of western australia the wave is generated 11 m from the rov model using wavemaker with hinge mechanism to measure the transformation of the wave wave gauges are installed at 5 different locations around the rov location 1 m before and after the rov location 5 m before and after the rov location fig 2 shows a schematic view of the experiment set up the flume is filled with fresh water up to 1 1 m depth an electric motor representing crane tip motions and winching operation is mounted on a rigid frame 2 5 m away from the flume the floating rov in the flume is connected to the electric motor through a flexible rope with small bending stiffness representing the umbilical the rope is supported through pulleys at point a and point b as shown in fig 2 the pulley at point b is supported by a 200 n load cell connected to a portal frame installed over the flume the time history of axial load in the umbilical is monitored and recorded by the load cell at point b the data rate of load cell and wave gauge are 333 hz and 125 hz respectively 2 3 rov umbilical model the experiment uses a 1 10 model of an ultra deep water work class rov table 1 shows the parameters for the rov prototype and model fig 3 shows the prototype and model of the tested rov through a test in the o tube facility at coel of the university of western australia the drag coefficients of the rov model are determined and reported by meng et al 2020 the safe working line of the real umbilical is 70 kn 1 6 times of the rov weight in air while its minimum breaking load is 210 kn 4 7 times of the rov weight in air since there is no available cable that matches the scaled parameter of the real umbilical a flexible rope with small bending stiffness is chosen to represent the umbilical in this study a 2 mm venetian blind cord made from polyester with 3 3 g m mass per unit length and an ultimate tensile strength of 525 n is used to represent the umbilical 2 4 wave ship motion and winch speed five different sinusoidal waves as shown in table 2 are tested during the experiment for simulation of marine operation in general the ship and crane tip motions are commonly determined using wave parameters through a set of transfer functions which are governed by the shape of the ship and the relative position of crane tip it is also well known that the snap load in umbilical is mostly affected by the vertical heave crane motion during the tests to simplify the problem the vertical crane tip motions are represented by sinusoidal motions generated by the electrical motor with amplitudes equal to a percentage of wave amplitude representing heave rao while the period is the same as the wave period three different crane tip motion amplitudes i e 0 50 and 100 of wave amplitude are selected for each wave combination to study effect of ship motion amplitudes on the umbilical tensile load to study the effect of winch speed on the line tension 5 different winch speeds as shown in table 3 are observed in launch and recovery of an rov it is common to use winch speed up to 0 4 m s three other winch speeds higher than 0 4 m s presented in table 3 are tested to see whether a faster winch speed can reduce the tension in the umbilical 2 5 wave flume procedure the test is started by positioning the rov 0 4 m above the flume floor then raising it up with a selected winch speed up to 1 55 m above the flume floor 1 15 m travel distance to firstly simulate the recovery process due to the short traveling distance between the rov location and water surface in the wave flume at the beginning of the launch or recovery process it is not possible to ramp up the winch speed properly therefore in all experiments the winch is suddenly started to a selected speed with no ramping up procedure the inevitable sudden change in the winch speed creates a transient fluctuation on the line tension which will be damped out after a certain period at the end of the traveling distance when the rov is 1 55 m above the flume floor the winch winding up operation is suddenly stopped creating another transient tension after 10s delay to avoid mixing of transient fluctuations between consecutive recovery and launch simulations the winch is suddenly started again with the same speed but in the opposite direction to simulate the launch process at the end of launch process when the rov is at 0 4 m above the flume floor the winch is suddenly stopped another 10s delay is applied and then entire recovery delay launch process is repeated with a different winch speed fig 4 shows the time history of winch speed and rov elevation for 5 successive rounds of recovery and launch operation with different winch speeds the time history of rov elevation as per fig 4 is generated for 10 ms time intervals i e sampling rate of 100 hz and feed into the electrical motor as input data to simulate the crane tip motion the time history of rov elevation is superimposed with a predefined sinusoidal motion as explained in section 2 4 and then feed into the electrical motor as input data before performing the test with the combination of wave ship motion and winching process the experiment is firstly carried out with three preliminary arrangements as follows 1 fixed length test where the rov is hung from the portal frame with constant umbilical length for three submerged depths just above mean water level half submerged and just below mean water level the wave is then generated to see the effect of wave on rov when there is no ship motion and winching process for each combination of submerged depth and wave configuration 30 wave cycles are generated in the flume excluding the ramping cycles 2 dry test where the rov is winched up and down in air with different speeds to observe the tension fluctuation in umbilical due to winching process 3 still water test where the rov is winched up and down with different speed between air and water without any wave and ship motion the still water test shows the tension change when rov travels between air and water it is later set as the benchmark to measure the tension change in the umbilical when the winching process combined with wave and ship motions to cover possible different random interactions between rov umbilical system from one side and the wave ship motions from the other side every test condition is repeated 30 times in total there are 100 different test conditions including the fixed length dry still water and wave tests 3 wave flume test results 3 1 fixed length test the fixed length test is carried out with three submerge depths as follows 1 above mean water level mwl where the rov is not submerged but its bottom face touches the mwl 2 half submerged where the rov is submerged up to half of its height 3 below mwl where the rov is fully submerged and its top face is located just below the mwl fig 5 shows the line tension ft results normalized by rov weight in air gmrov versus the time t normalized by wave period t for all wave and submerged depth combinations with 30 tested wave cycles under each combination for each combination all 30 wave cycles show similar time history of normalized tension even during the occurrence of the snap loads for above mwl case the normalized tension is generally capped at 1 i e maximum line tension rov weight in air since the rov is completely out of water when the wave trough exists around the rov location with the increase in wave height there is a slight increase in the maximum tension per wave cycle due to the larger amount of trapped water inside the rov that is just pouring out when the rov exits the water for half submerged the normalized line tension fluctuates around 0 5 and the overall fluctuation gets larger with the increase of wave height for below mwl case the snap load occurs in the line indicated by the tension spike followed by small tension fluctuations the largest tension spike exists during the largest simulated wave and the number of following tension fluctuations increases with the wave period the largest normalized tension during fixed length experiment is 1 1 3 2 dry test during the dry test the flume is emptied and the rov is raised and lowered i e recovery and launch following the procedure presented in section 2 5 with five different winch speeds as in table 3 and the results are presented in fig 6 the sudden start stop of the winch under different speeds lead to different transient tension fluctuations in the umbilical for the recovery the transient fluctuation period at the end of the process is less than that one at the start it is the opposite for launch case because the paid out cable is getting shorter resulting in both higher natural frequency and structural damping of the cable increasing the winch speed amplifies the tension fluctuation in the umbilical with the largest normalized tension is up to 2 1 exceeding the swl of the real umbilical 1 6 times of the rov weight in air at the end of launch and the start of recovery the normalized tension in the umbilical increases significantly while it is the opposite at the end of the recovery and start of launch the amplitude of normalized tension fluctuations i e maximum of absolute difference between the recorded time varying tension and the rov weight in air for these two cases are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 another parameter is introduced as the normalized acceleration which is formulated as the sudden change of winch speed in 10 ms δv δt divided by gravity acceleration g in general the largest amplitude of the normalized tension fluctuation exists during the stop of the launch process where it is up to 1 1 times of rov weight in air a linear function with good agreement to the recorded results is then fitted on the data and presented in each plot and this shows that the line tension amplitude can reasonably be approximated as a linear function of winch acceleration 3 3 still water test the time history of normalized tension in the umbilical from 30 different simulations of still water test as outlined in section 2 5 are gathered and grouped based on the selected winch speed then presented in fig 9 for each case the simulation started and stopped with a sudden change on winch speed resulting spikes in the line tension time history as in the dry test configuration both in launch and recovery simulations since the simulation is started with the rov fully submerged in water the initial normalized tension in the time history is almost negligible fig 10 and fig 11 show the amplitude of normalized tension fluctuation versus the winch normalized acceleration due to its sudden start and stop when the rov is fully submerged and when it is in air respectively a linear function is fitted on the data and presented as the orange line in each plot of figs 10 and 11 as expected there is almost no difference between the results of dry and still water tests when the rov motion is suddenly stopped or started above the water comparing figs 11 and 8 the existence of hydrodynamic loads alters the behavior of tension fluctuation when the rov suddenly moves inside the water and that is why the results of dry and still water tests when the rov is suddenly stopped or started in the water are totally different comparing figs 10 and 7 the transient fluctuation of the normalized tension from dry test now manifests as tension spike with different magnitudes moreover the spike in tension is relatively constant when the launch simulation is suddenly stopped from winch speed 0 13 m s as indicated in fig 10 in these cases the cable is in slack condition and the rov travels down with speed around its terminal velocity before the tension spike exist due the transition of the umbilical from slack to taut condition from fig 10 the terminal velocity of the rov is approximated by drawing a horizontal line around the relatively constant normalized tension on the stop of launch plot the same line is then redrawn at start of recovery plot and then the terminal velocity is approximated as 0 16 m s the terminal velocity of rov model can also be calculated using equation 16 based on the experiment at the o tube facility the drag coefficients of stern bottom and starboard sides of the rov are presented in table 4 meng et al 2020 however the rov model sink with certain pitch and roll angle to accommodate the effect of rolling and pitching the area and drag coefficient of the rov model are recalculated using the euclidian distance formulation before using equation 16 this procedure produces a terminal velocity around 0 16 m s which agrees well with the approximation from fig 10 16 v t 2 g m r o v w e t ρ a r o v c d where v t terminal velocity m s m r o v w e t mass of rov model in water kg g gravity acceleration ρ density of fresh water a r o v projected area of bottom rov model m2 c d drag coefficient from the still water test the transient tension fluctuation in air and under water is greater when the winch is operated with fast speed this worsen the launch and recovery process of the rov since the increase of umbilical tension is significant during experiment is up to 2 times of the rov weight and exceeds the safe working load of the umbilical 1 6 times of the rov weight 3 4 wave and ship motion tests fig 12 and fig 13 shows the snapshots of launch and recovery operations with 0 06 m s winch speed 0 15 m wave height 2 2s wave period and 100 ship motion respectively the snapshots in figs 12 and 13 also highlight the occurrences of snap load plot no 4in each figure when the rov located around the wave crest for every single wave and ship motion combination out of 30 repeated tests the normalized tension in the line is ensemble averaged for every 10 ms and shown in fig 14 in general the result of averaging process on different combinations of wave and ship motion converges to the ensemble average of 30 still water tests for the certain winch speed presented by orange line in fig 9 except for the tension fluctuation due to the stopping of the winch during the launch process in that case the umbilical switches from slack to taut invoking a significant tension increase the transition from slack to taut is notably affected by the roll and pitch angle of the rov while it freely sinks since the transit time is random and not the same for all 30 repeated tests the tension fluctuation is diminished during the averaging process except when the winch speed is 0 06 m s when the cable is in taut for the whole launching process until the winch stops fig 15 shows the time history of ensemble maximum tension for each 10 ms from different combination of wave and ship motions the plots are grouped based on the selected winch speed and it is seen that during the launch process there are significant number of strong snap loads when the rov is lowered with speed of 0 06 m s it is also observed that the snap load can be suppressed by increasing the winch speed which make the umbilical slack and the rov travels with its terminal velocity when the winch is activated with speed of 0 32 m s the snap load is significantly suppressed during the launch phase until the winch is stopped therefore it can be concluded that when ship and rov move with large vertical motions increasing the winch speed during the launch process reduces the possibility of rapid transition from slack to taut and hence suppressing the snap load magnitude during the recovery process increasing the winch speed does not eliminate the snap load however raising the rov with slower speed exposes the rov in the splash zone for longer period resulting the umbilical experiences snap loads with larger number of occurrences as shown in fig 15 increasing the winch speed shortens the duration of umbilical experiencing the snap load but it leads to larger tension spikes when the winch is suddenly started for the highest and lowest winch speed i e 0 32 m s and 0 06 m s respectively when the rov is under water and the winch starts the recovery phase the normalized tension spike reaches up to 1 8 and 1 1 respectively in general the snap load is stronger when the rov is launched with slower winch speed or when it is recovered with larger winch speed for both launch and recovery the number of snap load occurrences decreases with increasing the winch speed 3 5 comparison between experiment set ups the maximum tension for the whole launch and recovery processes in fig 15 is analyzed separately for each combination of wave ship motion and winch speed to further analyze their effects on the line tension during launch and recovery process the results of fixed length test are also included in the comparison fig 16 shows the normalized maximum tension for each wave ship motion and winch speed combinations versus the normalized wave vertical velocity at the mean water level taken as h t gl where the zero value refers to the still water test for convenience the normalized wave vertical velocity at mean water level is referred as normalized vertical velocity hereafter in general the launch and recovery simulation with faster winch speed results in higher normalized maximum tension the normalized maximum tension generally occurs during the sudden start stop of winch when the rov is in air large ship motion generally increases the normalized maximum tension for normalized vertical velocity 0 03 which is more apparent for winch speed 0 13 m s in this case the normalized maximum tension comes from the snap load is due to wave and ship motions not due to the sudden start stop of winch anymore due to its relatively small transient tension fluctuation when the winch is suddenly started stopped while the rov is in air the slow winch speed consistently produces the smallest normalized maximum tension as the opposite the worst condition occurs when the rov is lowered with speed of 0 32 m s under the largest normalized vertical velocity and with 100 ship motion i e 1 1 ratio between the amplitude of ship motion and wave height in this case the normalized tension reaches 2 4 significantly larger than the real umbilical swl of 1 6 compared to the fixed length experiment the launch and recovery simulations with the inclusion of winch speed produces greater normalized tension where the ratio between the maximums from both test configurations i e maximum tension from winching experiment divided by that one from the fixed length experiment is up to 2 2 this highlights the importance and significant effect of winch speed and its sudden start stop on the maximum line tension during the launch and recovery operations fig 17 shows the maximum line tension when the tension spikes due to sudden start stop of winch are neglected in this case the normalized maximum tension generally comes from wave induced snap loads compared to fig 16 the increase on normalized maximum tension in fig 17 is less apparent with the increase in winch speed interestingly for 100 ship motion and normalized vertical velocity 0 03 launching the rov with higher winch speed decreases the normalized maximum tension in overall the recovery process produces larger normalized maximum tension than the launch simulation especially under larger ship motion and normalized vertical velocity these conditions implies that it is hard to avoid snap load during rov recovery if the ship operates under energetic waves while the snap can be suppressed during launch process by imminently lowering the rov through the splash zone at the worst the normalized maximum tension due to snap load is up to 2 1 smaller than the worst normalized tension in fig 16 compared to the fixed length test the inclusion of winching process in the launch and recovery experiment still produces larger normalized maximum tension highlighting the significant effect of winching process to the wave induced snap load to measure the increase in tension fluctuation due to wave and ship motion only all normalized maximum tension under different combination of wave ship motion and winch speed is subtracted by the result from the still water test i e the case with the normalized vertical velocity of 0 representing the winching effects only the same procedure is also conducted for the fixed length experiment for various submerged depths the results are presented in fig 18 in general the increase in the maximum tension is more apparent during recovery case where larger normalized vertical velocity with larger percentage of ship motion leads to higher tension increase the source of tension increase is mainly due to wave ship induced snap load interestingly the increase is more significant for the case with winch speed of 0 06 m s with magnitude up to 1 6 for the launch process the tension increase due to wave and ship motion can be suppressed by lowering the rov with faster speed from the flume tests it is concluded that the maximum tension in the line is governed by two major factors the winching mechanism sudden start stop as well as the winch speed and the wave ship induced snap load if the operator is capable to apply a good ramping mechanism for the winching process it is suggested to launch and recover rov under combination of fast winch speed and suppressed ship motion to reduce the magnitude and occurrences of snap load otherwise the operator should utilize slow winch speed to avoid large tension due to sudden activation of the winch 4 numerical simulation 4 1 model input data due to dimension and time limitations in the flume only limited number of regular waves can be successfully and precisely simulated a simplified numerical model is then built in orcaflex software orcina 2019 to replicate the wave flume launch and recovery process and later used to simulate the process under wave with larger normalized vertical velocity considering the actual shape of the rov model a combination of two 6dof degrees of freedom buoy with 3 translations and 3 rotations buoys is used to simply represent the rov numerically the first 6dof buoy represents the rov floater while the second one represents the rov frame and its components the floater model is a massless buoy with a defined volume to provide buoyance force on the rov and is attached on top the frame model orcaflex winch element is used to model the umbilical as the rov is raised and lowered between the air and water fig 19 shows schematic view of the rov umbilical model in orcaflex while it is hung above the mean water level in engineering practice the required input data for rov umbilical and winch should be determined independently and implemented in the model in this study the input data for the numerical model are determined and calibrated through separate steps using the results of wave flume experiments under different configurations the flowchart in fig 20 shows briefly how the parameters in the numerical model are determined 4 2 mass and volume distribution of rov numerical model the volume of each 6dof buoy models and the distance between their center of gravities is determined by comparing the result of slow recovery test between the numerical simulation and wave flume experiment in the slow recovery test the rov is raised from still water to air with a slow constant speed to avoid any significant dynamic tension in the line the results of slow recovery test from wave flume experiment and the numerical model are presented in fig 21 using savitzky and golay 1964 procedure the result of wave flume experiment is smoothened and included in fig 21 due to the inevitable simplification of complex shape and geometry of the rov model into a lumped 6dof buoys in orcaflex the simplified numerical model is not able to capture the non linearity of the tension increase in the umbilical when the rov nose and frame are passing through splash zone the floater however has a relatively uniform mass and volume distribution in the vertical direction hence the tension increase is almost linear and can be captured accurately by the simple numerical model table 5 shows the calibrated input data for 6dof buoys in the numerical model leading to the result presented in fig 21 to simplify the numerical process for this study roll pitch and yaw motion of the rov are suppressed by setting the roll pitch and yaw moment of inertia with a large number implying that the rov numerical model is only able to experience translational motions 4 3 umbilical axial stiffness and damping in this study the section stiffness ea and structural damping c of the umbilical for numerical model as defined in orcaflex are determined experimentally by adjusting their value to produce a comparable time history of umbilical tension as that one from dry test result presented in section 3 2 during the dry test the hydrodynamic parameters of the rov can be neglected and the cable section stiffness and structural damping can be determined by matching the natural period and exponential decay of the transient tension fluctuation between the numerical and experimental results since the umbilical is paid out and hauled in the period and decay rate of the tension fluctuation varies with the changes of umbilical length in this study the section stiffness and structural damping of the umbilical are acquired by continuously changing the section stiffness and structural damping in orcaflex model until the resulted time history matches well with the experimental result during the iteration the priority is given to the period of tension fluctuation then to the tension decay rate refer to fig 6 the tension fluctuation is more apparent when the winch is activated with speed of 0 32 m s the adjustment of line stiffness and damping parameters in the orcaflex model is firstly performed only for case with winch speed of 0 32 m s and then the proposed configuration is used to numerically simulate other winch speed configurations and compare the numerical and wave flume results it is found that one section stiffness parameter cannot perfectly represent the behavior of tension fluctuation both in launch and recovery process since the axial tension is governed by the axial stiffness of umbilical ea lu where lu line length to produce a better representation of tension time history two umbilical configurations are used by varying the length between the launch and recovery simulation in orcaflex table 6 shows the best fitted section stiffness structural damping and the cable length of the umbilical model during launch and recovery process 4 4 rov added mass coefficient and unit damping the added mass coefficient and unit damping of the 6dof buoys representing the rov are determined using the results of still water test using the numerical model that has been adjusted to the dry test the added mass coefficient and unit damping in vertical direction are determined to produce similar snap load as the winch starts and stops when the rov is under water fig 22 shows the comparison of numerical and wave flume experiment results for still water test under different winch speeds there is a very good match between the experimental and numerical results of tension spikes as the winch starts or stops while the rov is under water however there is a slight difference between the experimental and numerical results for the rest of tension fluctuations in the line while the rov is still under water there are several reasons for this mismatch 1 during experiment the rov moves with a certain tilting angle which cannot be captured by the simple numerical model this leads to different hydrodynamic damping in the system 2 the porosity of the rov also introduces some non linear hydrodynamic loads which also cannot be captured accurately by the simplified model despite the insignificant mismatch is some areas the simplified model is accurate enough to simulate the experimental results numerically the added mass coefficient and unit damping for the 6dof buoys representing the rov are presented in table 7 4 5 numerical simulation of lars under wave and ship motion the orcaflex numerical model with adjusted input parameters through slow recovery dry and still water tests is used to simulate the launch and recovery of rov under the effect of wave and ship motion numerical simulations are carried out using 5th order stokes waves in three different wave directions 0 wave parallel to rov longitudinal axis 45 and 90 wave perpendicular to rov longitudinal axis in addition different time lags between the wave and ship motion are also considered to account for random phase angle between wave and ship response the time lag from 0 to 90 with 10 interval is defined as percentage of the simulated wave period for each set of ship motion winch speed and wave parameter firstly the numerical simulation is carried out then the results are obtained and post processed the ensemble maximum is determined and the results are shown in fig 23 as seen in fig 23 the maximum tension during the launch process is almost constant for 0 and 50 ship motion indicating that the winch mechanism govern the maximum tension only for 100 ship motion there is a slight increase in the maximum tension as the normalized vertical velocity increases especially for 0 06 m s winch speed implying that the wave induced snap load is the governing factor in this case these observations match well with the wave flume results for recovery case the snap load governs the maximum tension for large normalized vertical velocity especially for 50 and 100 ship motions and increasing the winch speed fails to decrease the maximum tension the increase in snap load cannot be easily predicted by the increase of winch speed though the increase of normalized vertical velocity consistently results in larger snap load especially for 100 ship motion the maximum normalized tension from all numerical cases is up to 2 3 which is slightly larger than the one obtained from the wave flume experiment i e 2 2 when excluding the tension fluctuation due to the sudden start stop of the winch operationally representing a condition where the transient fluctuation due to sudden start stop of the winch is suppressed through proper ramping up down of the winch speed the wave ship induced snap load is more onerous during the recovery process as presented in fig 24 for small ship motion the increment in winch speed gradually increases the maximum tension whereas a more severe ship motion produces a less predictable and larger increase on the maximum tension when the winch speed is increased for the launch case the wave ship induced snap load is only governing the maximum tension under large normalized vertical velocity and large ship motion similar to the wave flume experiment slow winch speed produces larger maximum tension since the umbilical experiences more frequent snap loads when the rov lower speed is less than its terminal velocity the tension increases due to hydrodynamic loads are measured by subtracting the time history result of tension for launch and recovery under wave with that one from still water simulation the results are presented in fig 25 and it is seen that the increase on tension is more predictable during launch simulation at maximum the normalized tension increase is up to 2 which is larger than the one from wave flume experiment i e 1 6 in general for the maximum line tension due to wave ship induced loads only the presented simplified numerical model provides more conservative results compared to the wave flume experiment 4 6 environmental limit of rov operation the adjusted numerical model is utilized to simulate the launch and recovery process under wider range of wave heights and periods to predict the environmental limit of the entire operation table 8 shows the selected wave height period and their normalized vertical velocity the numerical simulations are carried out for waves with large normalized vertical velocity since large tension in the umbilical is more pronounced under that condition three wave directions and 10 time lags between ship and wave are observed for each combination of wave height and period the ensemble maximum for each combination of wave height period ship motion and winch speed is taken and presented in fig 26 while the increase in tension due to hydrodynamic loads only is taken by subtracting the ensemble maximum from each wave conditions with the ensemble maximum of still water test and the results are presented in fig 27 when the ship motion is suppressed and the umbilical is hauled in with fast winch speed the tension spike due to sudden stop of the winch when the rov is in air governs the maximum tension during the recovery process for wave with normalized vertical velocity less than 0 04 as presented in fig 26 for large ship motion and normalized vertical velocity value the wave ship induced snap load governs the maximum tension the best option to recover the rov is by combining slow winch speed i e 0 06 m s during the experiment and suppressed ship motion 0 ship motion where the exceedance of umbilical swl i e 1 6 times the rov weight in air can be avoided even under wave with normalized vertical velocity up to 0 06 in all performed simulations even under large wave and large ship motions the minimum breaking load of the umbilical i e 4 7 times the rov weight in air is not exceeded yet implying that the rov can still be safely recovered over the deck during launch process the tension spike due to sudden start of the winch governs the maximum tension for small ship motion even for large normalized vertical velocity up to 0 065 meanwhile the wave ship induced snap load governs the maximum tension for large ship motion and normalized vertical velocity larger than 0 046 in general the maximum tension during the launch process is smaller than the recovery process there is no minimum breaking load exceedance during the simulations when using slow winch speed the launch process can be performed without any swl exceedance with larger normalized vertical velocity range than the recovery process even under large ship motion in this case for 100 ship motion the launch can be performed safely under wave with normalized vertical velocity less than 0 046 if the rov is lowered with 0 06 m s winch speed though this winch speed produces the largest maximum tension for operation under large normalized vertical velocity and large ship motion fig 27 shows the increase in the maximum line tension due to the inclusion of wave ship induced motion only in the numerical simulation for different normalized vertical velocity as in the wave flume tests and previous numerical simulations for each combination of wave and ship motion the observed difference in the tension increasing trend between recovery and launch process is getting bigger with the increase in winch speed for larger normalized vertical velocity than those generated in the flume using the fast winch speed can still suppress maximum tension during launch process but fast winch speed can produce larger maximum tension during recovery case which contradicts the result acquired from smaller normalized vertical velocity cases i e different observed trend as the winch speed increases for recovery case with normalized vertical velocity smaller or larger than 0 04 the environmental limit of the launch and recovery operation can be determined by the normalized vertical velocity of the wave for each ship motion magnitude similar to the wave flume experiment the maximum tension in the umbilical during launch and recovery process is governed by the winching mechanism and wave ship induced snap load for the launch process the magnitude of wave ship induced snap load can be reduced by a combination of fast winch speed and suppressed ship motion though this approach only works if a certain ramping procedure can be applied on the winching mechanism to avoid tension spike due to sudden change in winch speed if the required ramping mechanism cannot be applied for the winch operation the best way to launch the rov is by suppressing the ship motion and using a slow winch speed combination of slow winch speed and suppressed ship motion also produces the best recovery process for the rov 5 conclusion the effect of wave ship motion and winch speed on the umbilical tension during launch and recovery process of an ultra deep water work class rov is observed through a set of wave flume experiments the vertical ship motion is generated by an electric motor and superimposed to a constant downward or upward winch speed to simulate respectively a real launch or recovery process for 1 10 scaled rov model one hundred different test conditions combinations of fixed length dry still water tests and different wave setups ship motions and winch speeds and each one repeated 30 times to cover the random interaction between the rov and water are investigated experimentally a simplified numerical model is developed and the model parameters are calibrated based on the wave flume experimental results the calibrated numerical model is used for series of numerical simulations of launch and recovery operation under wider range of waves condition using the rov model and the presented input data in this study the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the inclusion of ship motion and winching mechanism during the launch and recovery operation is proven important since the maximum line tension may increase up to 2 2 times the maximum tension from the case where the winching mechanism is excluded from the experiment 2 in the dry test configuration there is a significant fluctuation in the umbilical tension due to sudden start stop of the winch having hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads on rov during the still water test these transient fluctuations lead to notable tension spikes during the wave flume experiment the tension fluctuation can be twice as large as the rov dry weight which is higher than the umbilical safe working load indicating an unsafe condition for the rov operation this can be avoided by using a slow winch speed during launch and recovery of the rov 3 the inclusion of wave and ship motion furtherly increase the tension in the umbilical the increase is more pronounced for wave with larger normalized vertical velocity around the mean water level and larger ship motions based on the numerical simulations the environmental limit for safe launch and recovery simulation can be broadened by suppressing the ship motion and using slow winch speed when the tension spike due to sudden winch activation cannot be avoided 4 if the tension spike due to sudden winch activation can be avoided the wave ship induced snap load governs the maximum tension in the umbilical in this case the best way to launch the rov is by using fast winch speed to keep the umbilical in slack condition until the rov pass the energetic area of the wave for recovery the best scenario is still by a combination of slow winch speed and suppressed ship motion 5 the environmental limit in the launch process is larger than in the recovery process this emphasizes that the recovery of rov with light submerged weight is more critical to its umbilical integrity than the launch process therefore the rov operation should be planned with a stricter environmental limits and ship motions on the recovery phase than the launch phase to ensure a

20255,an ultra deep water remotely operated vehicle rov can be designed to have an almost neutral buoyancy to compensate the large tension coming from the long and heavy umbilical that connects the rov to the surface facility however an rov with light submerged weight experiences large motions when it is traveling through the splash zone due to the hydrodynamic loads on the rov these motions lead to tension spikes in the umbilical also known as snap loads which can damage the umbilical components and endanger the rov operation it is important to ensure that the tension spikes in the umbilical never exceed the safe working load during launch and recovery of the rov around the splash zone the non linear interaction between rov and surface waves strongly governs the tension in the umbilical which is also exacerbated by the ship motions and winching mechanisms this study focuses on experimental measurement and numerical prediction of the tension in the umbilical during launch and recovery of an ultra deep water work class rov passing through splash zone under a set of regular waves combined with winching process and ship motions a 1 10 model of a deep water rov is built then lowered to and raise up from the water under 5 different regular wave conditions generated in a wave flume facility for each wave set three different ship motions and five winching conditions are simulated by superimposing a sinusoidal motion to the constant haul in and pay out of the umbilical from an electric motor in the end a simple numerical model is developed to replicate the wave flume experiment the wave flume experiments and numerical simulations show that the recovery process experiences larger umbilical tension than the launch process in general for the launching process the snap load can be suppressed down by increasing the pay out speed of the winch faster than the terminal velocity of the rov in water though a certain winch mechanism is required to minimize the tension spike due to the sudden start or end of the winching for the recovery of the rov increasing the winch speed does not significantly reduce the maximum tension in the umbilical though minimizing the ship motions shows a great effect on suppressing the tension due to snap load the developed numerical model shows a good agreement with the experimental results hence it is also used to predict safe working window for launch and recovery of the rov through splash zone keywords deep water rov snap force umbilical splash zone wave flume 1 introduction an ultra deep water rov commonly has working procedures which can be sequentially grouped into five main phases launching lowering operating rising and recovery during the launching phase the rov is lowered through the splash zone by gradually extending the umbilical fig 1 shows an illustration of this process as the opposite the umbilical is hauled in to move the rov up from water to air during the recovery phase wave induced rov and ship motions may hinder the success of these two phases there is a reciprocal interaction between the rov and ocean waves which is also exacerbated by the wave induced ship motions resulting in a non linear relation between wave and tension in the umbilical that is difficult to be modelled accurately by a simple mathematical formulation this combination of wave ship and rov motions may initiate a slack in the umbilical commonly followed by a rapid transition to taut condition and can drastically increase the tension in the umbilical this phenomenon is known as snap load and it may exceed the safe working load swl niedzwecki and thampi 1988 or the allowable bending strain driscoll et al 2000 of the umbilical leading to a premature failure of the line therefore a proper analysis of the system should be performed considering the non linear interaction between rov umbilical ship and wave to define the environmental limit of launch and recovery process dnv has a recommended practice for lifting operation through splash zone which provides a simplified method to analyze the hydrodynamic forces on an offshore system during its lifting procedure through splash zone dnv 2019 in the dnv methodology the dynamic amplification factor daf in the rope line tension during lowering phase of the system is determined by taking the ratio of total force static and hydrodynamic forces to the static force static force is described by the difference between dry weight and buoyancy force of the offshore system the hydrodynamic forces are the forces on the offshore system due to the ocean waves and determined through four force components slamming varying buoyancy drag and inertia forces when the total upward hydrodynamic forces exceed the static force the slack occurs on the umbilical triggering the snap force in the event of slack the hydrodynamic forces term are substituted with the snap force term using daf the tension on the umbilical can be simply assessed whether it exceeds the safe working load or not in term of launch phase by comparing the results from dnv simplified formulation and the numerical models it is shown that the recommended practice from dnv usually leads to overestimated results kimiaei and khosroshahli 2008 kimiaei et al 2009 by utilizing a proper numerical model to represent the umbilical and the rov more accurate and less conservative results can be achieved through time domain analysis of the system for numerical simulation a set of simplification are commonly made where the umbilical is represented by a series of axial spring and damper while a lump mass with predefined hydrodynamic parameters represents the rov khojasteh and kamali 2017 listed various studies on marine cable structural analysis and their application to numerically represent the umbilical of rov the wave induced motion of the ship is commonly characterized through response amplitude operator rao of the ship which translates the wave motion into excitations for the top of the umbilical model it is also reasonable to assume that the rov dimension is small compared to the wavelength indicating that the viscous drag and the mass load are more dominant than the diffraction load faltinsen 1993 as a result the wave load on rov during launch and recovery phase can be represented by morison equation morison et al 1950 however obtaining precise hydrodynamic coefficients for the umbilical and rov are another important challenge a precise drag and added mass coefficient can be obtained using computational fluid dynamic cfd allowing a more appropriate structural and hydrodynamic analysis of the launch and recovery process jia and agrawal 2014 showed an example of fluid structure interaction model using a commercial cfd software for analysing the lowering phase of a subsea structure another way to appropriately capture the interaction between the surface wave and an offshore system is by performing a scaled experiment in the wave flume nam et al 2017 presented their work on the analysis of a lifted subsea manifold through scaled model in the wave basin the scaled model consisted of a crane model hoisting line ship and a 3 d printed of the subsea manifold they then compared the wave basin experiment result with a numerical model and showed a good agreement between results of the two approaches for rov launch and recovery sayer 2008 performed an experiment in a wave flume with a 1 8 scale model of a work class rov he focused on measuring the added mass and drag coefficients of the rov traveling through the splash zone and neglected the ship motions and winch speed during the test the hydrodynamic coefficients were feed into morison equation with airy and stokes waves to compare the measured hydrodynamic loads on the rov for lightweight rov the snap load is inevitable and critical to the launch and recovery process hence it is crucial to incorporate the snap load during the flume experiment hennessey et al 2005 performed a test to study snap load on a synthetic rope where they dropped a steel bar vertically and measured the tension of the line and the acceleration of the bar using load cell and accelerometer respectively hsu et al 2019 performed a snap load experiment in the wave flume to measure its effect on the mooring line in shallow water they combined a load cell to measure the load and a camera for particle image velocimetry piv to measure the motion of the mooring for normal operation of an ultra deep water rov in deep seas the umbilical tensile load under self weight of the rov umbilical system is not very far from its safe working load dynamically amplified load in the umbilical during normal operation of the rov in deep seas may be more onerous than those ones during launch and recovery of the rov through splash zone lubis et al 2021 studied these effects and possible options for minimizing the dynamic tensile loads for an ultra deep water rov operating in deep seas under combined effects of wave current and ship motions in this study the interaction between rov wave and ship motion during launching and recovery process when it is passing through splash zone is firstly observed experimentally through a 1 10 scaled model of an ultra deep water work class rov in a wave flume various combinations of winch speeds regular waves and ship motions are generated to see their effects on the magnitude of snap load with the inclusion of ship motion winching mechanism and slack in the umbilical a better representation of rov launch and recovery operations is expected in the wave flume a simplified and practical numerical model is also developed and then validated based on wave flume experimental results this numerical model is later used to simulate the launch and recovery simulation under larger waves than those ones generated in the flume in the end a safe working window for launching and recovering the ultra deep water work class rov through splash zone is determined using the numerical model 2 experiment set up and procedure 2 1 scaling system based on buckingham s π theorem buckingham 1914 all the parameters involved in an experiment can be

engineering lab coel of the university of western australia the wave is generated 11 m from the rov model using wavemaker with hinge mechanism to measure the transformation of the wave wave gauges are installed at 5 different locations around the rov location 1 m before and after the rov location 5 m before and after the rov location fig 2 shows a schematic view of the experiment set up the flume is filled with fresh water up to 1 1 m depth an electric motor representing crane tip motions and winching operation is mounted on a rigid frame 2 5 m away from the flume the floating rov in the flume is connected to the electric motor through a flexible rope with small bending stiffness representing the umbilical the rope is supported through pulleys at point a and point b as shown in fig 2 the pulley at point b is supported by a 200 n load cell connected to a portal frame installed over the flume the time history of axial load in the umbilical is monitored and recorded by the load cell at point b the data rate of load cell and wave gauge are 333 hz and 125 hz respectively 2 3 rov umbilical model the experiment uses a 1 10 model of an ultra deep water work class rov table 1 shows the parameters for the rov prototype and model fig 3 shows the prototype and model of the tested rov through a test in the o tube facility at coel of the university of western australia the drag coefficients of the rov model are determined and reported by meng et al 2020 the safe working line of the real umbilical is 70 kn 1 6 times of the rov weight in air while its minimum breaking load is 210 kn 4 7 times of the rov weight in air since there is no available cable that matches the scaled parameter of the real umbilical a flexible rope with small bending stiffness is chosen to represent the umbilical in this study a 2 mm venetian blind cord made from polyester with 3 3 g m mass per unit length and an ultimate tensile strength of 525 n is used to represent the umbilical 2 4 wave ship motion and winch speed five different sinusoidal waves as shown in table 2 are tested during the experiment for simulation of marine operation in general the ship and crane tip motions are commonly determined using wave parameters through a set of transfer functions which are governed by the shape of the ship and the relative position of crane tip it is also well known that the snap load in umbilical is mostly affected by the vertical heave crane motion during the tests to simplify the problem the vertical crane tip motions are represented by sinusoidal motions generated by the electrical motor with amplitudes equal to a percentage of wave amplitude representing heave rao while the period is the same as the wave period three different crane tip motion amplitudes i e 0 50 and 100 of wave amplitude are selected for each wave combination to study effect of ship motion amplitudes on the umbilical tensile load to study the effect of winch speed on the line tension 5 different winch speeds as shown in table 3 are observed in launch and recovery of an rov it is common to use winch speed up to 0 4 m s three other winch speeds higher than 0 4 m s presented in table 3 are tested to see whether a faster winch speed can reduce the tension in the umbilical 2 5 wave flume procedure the test is started by positioning the rov 0 4 m above the flume floor then raising it up with a selected winch speed up to 1 55 m above the flume floor 1 15 m travel distance to firstly simulate the recovery process due to the short traveling distance between the rov location and water surface in the wave flume at the beginning of the launch or recovery process it is not possible to ramp up the winch speed properly therefore in all experiments the winch is suddenly started to a selected speed with no ramping up procedure the inevitable sudden change in the winch speed creates a transient fluctuation on the line tension which will be damped out after a certain period at the end of the traveling distance when the rov is 1 55 m above the flume floor the winch winding up operation is suddenly stopped creating another transient tension after 10s delay to avoid mixing of transient fluctuations between consecutive recovery and launch simulations the winch is suddenly started again with the same speed but in the opposite direction to simulate the launch process at the end of launch process when the rov is at 0 4 m above the flume floor the winch is suddenly stopped another 10s delay is applied and then entire recovery delay launch process is repeated with a different winch speed fig 4 shows the time history of winch speed and rov elevation for 5 successive rounds of recovery and launch operation with different winch speeds the time history of rov elevation as per fig 4 is generated for 10 ms time intervals i e sampling rate of 100 hz and feed into the electrical motor as input data to simulate the crane tip motion the time history of rov elevation is superimposed with a predefined sinusoidal motion as explained in section 2 4 and then feed into the electrical motor as input data before performing the test with the combination of wave ship motion and winching process the experiment is firstly carried out with three preliminary arrangements as follows 1 fixed length test where the rov is hung from the portal frame with constant umbilical length for three submerged depths just above mean water level half submerged and just below mean water level the wave is then generated to see the effect of wave on rov when there is no ship motion and winching process for each combination of submerged depth and wave configuration 30 wave cycles are generated in the flume excluding the ramping cycles 2 dry test where the rov is winched up and down in air with different speeds to observe the tension fluctuation in umbilical due to winching process 3 still water test where the rov is winched up and down with different speed between air and water without any wave and ship motion the still water test shows the tension change when rov travels between air and water it is later set as the benchmark to measure the tension change in the umbilical when the winching process combined with wave and ship motions to cover possible different random interactions between rov umbilical system from one side and the wave ship motions from the other side every test condition is repeated 30 times in total there are 100 different test conditions including the fixed length dry still water and wave tests 3 wave flume test results 3 1 fixed length test the fixed length test is carried out with three submerge depths as follows 1 above mean water level mwl where the rov is not submerged but its bottom face touches the mwl 2 half submerged where the rov is submerged up to half of its height 3 below mwl where the rov is fully submerged and its top face is located just below the mwl fig 5 shows the line tension ft results normalized by rov weight in air gmrov versus the time t normalized by wave period t for all wave and submerged depth combinations with 30 tested wave cycles under each combination for each combination all 30 wave cycles show similar time history of normalized tension even during the occurrence of the snap loads for above mwl case the normalized tension is generally capped at 1 i e maximum line tension rov weight in air since the rov is completely out of water when the wave trough exists around the rov location with the increase in wave height there is a slight increase in the maximum tension per wave cycle due to the larger amount of trapped water inside the rov that is just pouring out when the rov exits the water for half submerged the normalized line tension fluctuates around 0 5 and the overall fluctuation gets larger with the increase of wave height for below mwl case the snap load occurs in the line indicated by the tension spike followed by small tension fluctuations the largest tension spike exists during the largest simulated wave and the number of following tension fluctuations increases with the wave period the largest normalized tension during fixed length experiment is 1 1 3 2 dry test during the dry test the flume is emptied and the rov is raised and lowered i e recovery and launch following the procedure presented in section 2 5 with five different winch speeds as in table 3 and the results are presented in fig 6 the sudden start stop of the winch under different speeds lead to different transient tension fluctuations in the umbilical for the recovery the transient fluctuation period at the end of the process is less than that one at the start it is the opposite for launch case because the paid out cable is getting shorter resulting in both higher natural frequency and structural damping of the cable increasing the winch speed amplifies the tension fluctuation in the umbilical with the largest normalized tension is up to 2 1 exceeding the swl of the real umbilical 1 6 times of the rov weight in air at the end of launch and the start of recovery the normalized tension in the umbilical increases significantly while it is the opposite at the end of the recovery and start of launch the amplitude of normalized tension fluctuations i e maximum of absolute difference between the recorded time varying tension and the rov weight in air for these two cases are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 another parameter is introduced as the normalized acceleration which is formulated as the sudden change of winch speed in 10 ms δv δt divided by gravity acceleration g in general the largest amplitude of the normalized tension fluctuation exists during the stop of the launch process where it is up to 1 1 times of rov weight in air a linear function with good agreement to the recorded results is then fitted on the data and presented in each plot and this shows that the line tension amplitude can reasonably be approximated as a linear function of winch acceleration 3 3 still water test the time history of normalized tension in the umbilical from 30 different simulations of still water test as outlined in section 2 5 are gathered and grouped based on the selected winch speed then presented in fig 9 for each case the simulation started and stopped with a sudden change on winch speed resulting spikes in the line tension time history as in the dry test configuration both in launch and recovery simulations since the simulation is started with the rov fully submerged in water the initial normalized tension in the time history is almost negligible fig 10 and fig 11 show the amplitude of normalized tension fluctuation versus the winch normalized acceleration due to its sudden start and stop when the rov is fully submerged and when it is in air respectively a linear function is fitted on the data and presented as the orange line in each plot of figs 10 and 11 as expected there is almost no difference between the results of dry and still water tests when the rov motion is suddenly stopped or started above the water comparing figs 11 and 8 the existence of hydrodynamic loads alters the behavior of tension fluctuation when the rov suddenly moves inside the water and that is why the results of dry and still water tests when the rov is suddenly stopped or started in the water are totally different comparing figs 10 and 7 the transient fluctuation of the normalized tension from dry test now manifests as tension spike with different magnitudes moreover the spike in tension is relatively constant when the launch simulation is suddenly stopped from winch speed 0 13 m s as indicated in fig 10 in these cases the cable is in slack condition and the rov travels down with speed around its terminal velocity before the tension spike exist due the transition of the umbilical from slack to taut condition from fig 10 the terminal velocity of the rov is approximated by drawing a horizontal line around the relatively constant normalized tension on the stop of launch plot the same line is then redrawn at start of recovery plot and then the terminal velocity is approximated as 0 16 m s the terminal velocity of rov model can also be calculated using equation 16 based on the experiment at the o tube facility the drag coefficients of stern bottom and starboard sides of the rov are presented in table 4 meng et al 2020 however the rov model sink with certain pitch and roll angle to accommodate the effect of rolling and pitching the area and drag coefficient of the rov model are recalculated using the euclidian distance formulation before using equation 16 this procedure produces a terminal velocity around 0 16 m s which agrees well with the approximation from fig 10 16 v t 2

c d drag coefficient from the still water test the transient tension fluctuation in air and under water is greater when the winch is operated with fast speed this worsen the launch and recovery process of the rov since the increase of umbilical tension is significant during experiment is up to 2 times of the rov weight and exceeds the safe working load of the umbilical 1 6 times of the rov weight 3 4 wave and ship motion tests fig 12 and fig 13 shows the snapshots of launch and recovery operations with 0 06 m s winch speed 0 15 m wave height 2 2s wave period and 100 ship motion respectively the snapshots in figs 12 and 13 also highlight the occurrences of snap load plot no 4in each figure when the rov located around the wave crest for every single wave and ship motion combination out of 30 repeated tests the normalized tension in the line is ensemble averaged for every 10 ms and shown in fig 14 in general the result of averaging process on different combinations of wave and ship motion converges to the ensemble average of 30 still water tests for the certain winch speed presented by orange line in fig 9 except for the tension fluctuation due to the stopping of the winch during the launch process in that case the umbilical switches from slack to taut invoking a significant tension increase the transition from slack to taut is notably affected by the roll and pitch angle of the rov while it freely sinks since the transit time is random and not the same for all 30 repeated tests the tension fluctuation is diminished during the averaging process except when the winch speed is 0 06 m s when the cable is in taut for the whole launching process until the winch stops fig 15 shows the time history of ensemble maximum tension for each 10 ms from different combination of wave and ship motions the plots are grouped based on the selected winch speed and it is seen that during the launch process there are significant number of strong snap loads when the rov is lowered with speed of 0 06 m s it is also observed that the snap load can be suppressed by increasing the winch speed which make the umbilical slack and the rov travels with its terminal velocity when the winch is activated with speed of 0 32 m s the snap load is significantly suppressed during the launch phase until the winch is stopped therefore it can be concluded that when ship and rov move with large vertical motions increasing the winch speed during the launch process reduces the possibility of rapid transition from slack to taut and hence suppressing the snap load magnitude during the recovery process increasing the winch speed does not eliminate the snap load however raising the rov with slower speed exposes the rov in the splash zone for longer period resulting the umbilical experiences snap loads with larger number of occurrences as shown in fig 15 increasing the winch speed shortens the duration of umbilical experiencing the snap load but it leads to larger tension spikes when the winch is suddenly started for the highest and lowest winch speed i e 0 32 m s and 0 06 m s respectively when the rov is under water and the winch starts the recovery phase the normalized tension spike reaches up to 1 8 and 1 1 respectively in general the snap load is stronger when the rov is launched with slower winch speed or when it is recovered with larger winch speed for both launch and recovery the number of snap load occurrences decreases with increasing the winch speed 3 5 comparison between experiment set ups the maximum tension for the whole launch and recovery processes in fig 15 is analyzed separately for each combination of wave ship motion and winch speed to further analyze their effects on the line tension during launch and recovery process the results of fixed length test are also included in the comparison fig 16 shows the normalized maximum tension for each wave ship motion and winch speed combinations versus the normalized wave vertical velocity at the mean water level taken as h t gl where the zero value refers to the still water test for convenience the normalized wave vertical velocity at mean water level is referred as normalized vertical velocity hereafter in general the launch and recovery simulation with faster winch speed results in higher normalized maximum tension the normalized maximum tension generally occurs during the sudden start stop of winch when the rov is in air large ship motion generally increases the normalized maximum tension for normalized vertical velocity 0 03 which is more apparent for winch speed 0 13 m s in this case the normalized maximum tension comes from the snap load is due to wave and ship motions not due to the sudden start stop of winch anymore due to its relatively small transient tension fluctuation when the winch is suddenly started stopped while the rov is in air the slow winch speed consistently produces the smallest normalized maximum tension as the opposite the worst condition occurs when the rov is lowered with speed of 0 32 m s under the largest normalized vertical velocity and with 100 ship motion i e 1 1 ratio between the amplitude of ship motion and wave height in this case the normalized tension reaches 2 4 significantly larger than the real umbilical swl of 1 6 compared to the fixed length experiment the launch and recovery simulations with the inclusion of winch speed produces greater normalized tension where the ratio between the maximums from both test configurations i e maximum tension from winching experiment divided by that one from the fixed length experiment is up to 2 2 this highlights the importance and significant effect of winch speed and its sudden start stop on the maximum line tension during the launch and recovery operations fig 17 shows the maximum line tension when the tension spikes due to sudden start stop of winch are neglected in this case the normalized maximum tension generally comes from wave induced snap loads compared to fig 16 the increase on normalized maximum tension in fig 17 is less apparent with the increase in winch speed interestingly for 100 ship motion and normalized vertical velocity 0 03 launching the rov with higher winch speed decreases the normalized maximum tension in overall the recovery process produces larger normalized maximum tension than the launch simulation especially under larger ship motion and normalized vertical velocity these conditions implies that it is hard to avoid snap load during rov recovery if the ship operates under energetic waves while the snap can be suppressed during launch process by imminently lowering the rov through the splash zone at the worst the normalized maximum tension due to snap load is up to 2 1 smaller than the worst normalized tension in fig 16 compared to the fixed length test the inclusion of winching process in the launch and recovery experiment still produces larger normalized maximum tension highlighting the significant effect of winching process to the wave induced snap load to measure the increase in tension fluctuation due to wave and ship motion only all normalized maximum tension under different combination of wave ship motion and winch speed is subtracted by the result from the still water test i e the case with the normalized vertical velocity of 0 representing the winching effects only the same procedure is also conducted for the fixed length experiment for various submerged depths the results are presented in fig 18 in general the increase in the maximum tension is more apparent during recovery case where larger normalized vertical velocity with larger percentage of ship motion leads to higher tension increase the source of tension increase is mainly due to wave ship induced snap load interestingly the increase is more significant for the case with winch speed of 0 06 m s with magnitude up to 1 6 for the launch process the tension increase due to wave and ship motion can be suppressed by lowering the rov with faster speed from the flume tests it is concluded that the maximum tension in the line is governed by two major factors the winching mechanism sudden start stop as well as the winch speed and the wave ship induced snap load if the operator is capable to apply a good ramping mechanism for the winching process it is suggested to launch and recover rov under combination of fast winch speed and suppressed ship motion to reduce the magnitude and occurrences of snap load otherwise the operator should utilize slow winch speed to avoid large tension due to sudden activation of the winch 4 numerical simulation 4 1 model input data due to dimension and time limitations in the flume only limited number of regular waves can be successfully and precisely simulated a simplified numerical model is then built in orcaflex software orcina 2019 to replicate the wave flume launch and recovery process and later used to simulate the process under wave with larger normalized vertical velocity considering the actual shape of the rov model a combination of two 6dof degrees of freedom buoy with 3 translations and 3 rotations buoys is used to simply represent the rov numerically the first 6dof buoy represents the rov floater while the second one represents the rov frame and its components the floater model is a massless buoy with a defined volume to provide buoyance force on the rov and is attached on top the frame model orcaflex winch element is used to model the umbilical as the rov is raised and lowered between the air and water fig 19 shows schematic view of the rov umbilical model in orcaflex while it is hung above the mean water level in engineering practice the required input data for rov umbilical and winch should be determined independently and implemented in the model in this study the input data for the numerical model are determined and calibrated through separate steps using the results of wave flume experiments under different configurations the flowchart in fig 20 shows briefly how the parameters in the numerical model are determined 4 2 mass and volume distribution of rov numerical model the volume of each 6dof buoy models and the distance between their center of gravities is determined by comparing the result of slow recovery test between the numerical simulation and wave flume experiment in the slow recovery test the rov is raised from still water to air with a slow constant speed to avoid any significant dynamic tension in the line the results of slow recovery test from wave flume experiment and the numerical model are presented in fig 21 using savitzky and golay 1964 procedure the result of wave flume experiment is smoothened and included in fig 21 due to the inevitable simplification of complex shape and geometry of the rov model into a lumped 6dof buoys in orcaflex the simplified numerical model is not able to capture the non linearity of the tension increase in the umbilical when the rov nose and frame are passing through splash zone the floater however has a relatively uniform mass and volume distribution in the vertical direction hence the tension increase is almost linear and can be captured accurately by the simple numerical model table 5 shows the calibrated input data for 6dof buoys in the numerical model leading to the result presented in fig 21 to simplify the numerical process for this study roll pitch and yaw motion of the rov are suppressed by setting the roll pitch and yaw moment of inertia with a large number implying that the rov numerical model is only able to experience translational motions 4 3 umbilical axial stiffness and damping in this study the section stiffness ea and structural damping c of the umbilical for numerical model as defined in orcaflex are determined experimentally by adjusting their value to produce a comparable time history of umbilical tension as that one from dry test result presented in section 3 2 during the dry test the hydrodynamic parameters of the rov can be neglected and the cable section stiffness and structural damping can be determined by matching the natural period and exponential decay of the transient tension fluctuation between the numerical and experimental results since the umbilical is paid out and hauled in the period and decay rate of the tension fluctuation varies with the changes of umbilical length in this study the section stiffness and structural damping of the umbilical are acquired by continuously changing the section stiffness and structural damping in orcaflex model until the resulted time history matches well with the experimental result during the iteration the priority is given to the period of tension fluctuation then to the tension decay rate refer to fig 6 the tension fluctuation is more apparent when the winch is activated with speed of 0 32 m s the adjustment of line stiffness and damping parameters in the orcaflex model is firstly performed only for case with winch speed of 0 32 m s and then the proposed configuration is used to numerically simulate other winch speed configurations and compare the numerical and wave flume results it is found that one section stiffness parameter cannot perfectly represent the behavior of tension fluctuation both in launch and recovery process since the axial tension is governed by the axial stiffness of umbilical ea lu where lu line length to produce a better representation of tension time history two umbilical configurations are used by varying the length between the launch and recovery simulation in orcaflex table 6 shows the best fitted section stiffness structural damping and the cable length of the umbilical model during launch and recovery process 4 4 rov added mass coefficient and unit damping the added mass coefficient and unit damping of the 6dof buoys representing the rov are determined using the results of still water test using the numerical model that has been adjusted to the dry test the added mass coefficient and unit damping in vertical direction are determined to produce similar snap load as the winch starts and stops when the rov is under water fig 22 shows the comparison of numerical and wave flume experiment results for still water test under different winch speeds there is a very good match between the experimental and numerical results of tension spikes as the winch starts or stops while the rov is under water however there is a slight difference between the experimental and numerical results for the rest of tension fluctuations in the line while the rov is still under water there are several reasons for this mismatch 1 during experiment the rov moves with a certain tilting angle which cannot be captured by the simple numerical model this leads to different hydrodynamic damping in the system 2 the porosity of the rov also introduces some non linear hydrodynamic loads which also cannot be captured accurately by the simplified model despite the insignificant mismatch is some areas the simplified model is accurate enough to simulate the experimental results numerically the added mass coefficient and unit damping for the 6dof buoys representing the rov are presented in table 7 4 5 numerical simulation of lars under wave and ship motion the orcaflex numerical model with adjusted input parameters through slow recovery dry and still water tests is used to simulate the launch and recovery of rov under the effect of wave and ship motion numerical simulations are carried out using 5th order stokes waves in three different wave directions 0 wave parallel to rov longitudinal axis 45 and 90 wave perpendicular to rov longitudinal axis in addition different time lags between the wave and ship motion are also considered to account for random phase angle between wave and ship response the time lag from 0 to 90 with 10 interval is defined as percentage of the simulated wave period for each set of ship motion winch speed and wave parameter firstly the numerical simulation is carried out then the results are obtained and post processed the ensemble maximum is determined and the results are shown in fig 23 as seen in fig 23 the maximum tension during the launch process is almost constant for 0 and 50 ship motion indicating that the winch mechanism govern the maximum tension only for 100 ship motion there is a slight increase in the maximum tension as the normalized vertical velocity increases especially for 0 06 m s winch speed implying that the wave induced snap load is the governing factor in this case these observations match well with the wave flume results for recovery case the snap load governs the maximum tension for large normalized vertical velocity especially for 50 and 100 ship motions and increasing the winch speed fails to decrease the maximum tension the increase in snap load cannot be easily predicted by the increase of winch speed though the increase of normalized vertical velocity consistently results in larger snap load especially for 100 ship motion the maximum normalized tension from all numerical cases is up to 2 3 which is slightly larger than the one obtained from the wave flume experiment i e 2 2 when excluding the tension fluctuation due to the sudden start stop of the winch operationally representing a condition where the transient fluctuation due to sudden start stop of the winch is suppressed through proper ramping up down of the winch speed the wave ship induced snap load is more onerous during the recovery process as presented in fig 24 for small ship motion the increment in winch speed gradually increases the maximum tension whereas a more severe ship motion produces a less predictable and larger increase on the maximum tension when the winch speed is increased for the launch case the wave ship induced snap load is only governing the maximum tension under large normalized vertical velocity and large ship motion similar to the wave flume experiment slow winch speed produces larger maximum tension since the umbilical experiences more frequent snap loads when the rov lower speed is less than its terminal velocity the tension increases due to hydrodynamic loads are measured by subtracting the time history result of tension for launch and recovery under wave with that one from still water simulation the results are presented in fig 25 and it is seen that the increase on tension is more predictable during launch simulation at maximum the normalized tension increase is up to 2 which is larger than the one from wave flume experiment i e 1 6 in general for the maximum line tension due to wave ship induced loads only the presented simplified numerical model provides more conservative results compared to the wave flume experiment 4 6 environmental limit of rov operation the adjusted numerical model is utilized to simulate the launch and recovery process under wider range of wave heights and periods to predict the environmental limit of the entire operation table 8 shows the selected wave height period and their normalized vertical velocity the numerical simulations are carried out for waves with large normalized vertical velocity since large tension in the umbilical is more pronounced under that condition three wave directions and 10 time lags between ship and wave are observed for each combination of wave height and period the ensemble maximum for each combination of wave height period ship motion and winch speed is taken and presented in fig 26 while the increase in tension due to hydrodynamic loads only is taken by subtracting the ensemble maximum from each wave conditions with the ensemble maximum of still water test and the results are presented in fig 27 when the ship motion is suppressed and the umbilical is hauled in with fast winch speed the tension spike due to sudden stop of the winch when the rov is in air governs the maximum tension during the recovery process for wave with normalized vertical velocity less than 0 04 as presented in fig 26 for large ship motion and normalized vertical velocity value the wave ship induced snap load governs the maximum tension the best option to recover the rov is by combining slow winch speed i e 0 06 m s during the experiment and suppressed ship motion 0 ship motion where the exceedance of umbilical swl i e 1 6 times the rov weight in air can be avoided even under wave with normalized vertical velocity up to 0 06 in all performed simulations even under large wave and large ship motions the minimum breaking load of the umbilical i e 4 7 times the rov weight in air is not exceeded yet implying that the rov can still be safely recovered over the deck during launch process the tension spike due to sudden start of the winch governs the maximum tension for small ship motion even for large normalized vertical velocity up to 0 065 meanwhile the wave ship induced snap load governs the maximum tension for large ship motion and normalized vertical velocity larger than 0 046 in general the maximum tension during the launch process is smaller than the recovery process there is no minimum breaking load exceedance during the simulations when using slow winch speed the launch process can be performed without any swl exceedance with larger normalized vertical velocity range than the recovery process even under large ship motion in this case for 100 ship motion the launch can be performed safely under wave with normalized vertical velocity less than 0 046 if the rov is lowered with 0 06 m s winch speed though this winch speed produces the largest maximum tension for operation under large normalized vertical velocity and large ship motion fig 27 shows the increase in the maximum line tension due to the inclusion of wave ship induced motion only in the numerical simulation for different normalized vertical velocity as in the wave flume tests and previous numerical simulations for each combination of wave and ship motion the observed difference in the tension increasing trend between recovery and launch process is getting bigger with the increase in winch speed for larger normalized vertical velocity than those generated in the flume using the fast winch speed can still suppress maximum tension during launch process but fast winch speed can produce larger maximum tension during recovery case which contradicts the result acquired from smaller normalized vertical velocity cases i e different observed trend as the winch speed increases for recovery case with normalized vertical velocity smaller or larger than 0 04 the environmental limit of the launch and recovery operation can be determined by the normalized vertical velocity of the wave for each ship motion magnitude similar to the wave flume experiment the maximum tension in the umbilical during launch and recovery process is governed by the winching mechanism and wave ship induced snap load for the launch process the magnitude of wave ship induced snap load can be reduced by a combination of fast winch speed and suppressed ship motion though this approach only works if a certain ramping procedure can be applied on the winching mechanism to avoid tension spike due to sudden change in winch speed if the required ramping mechanism cannot be applied for the winch operation the best way to launch the rov is by suppressing the ship motion and using a slow winch speed combination of slow winch speed and suppressed ship motion also produces the best recovery process for the rov 5 conclusion the effect of wave ship motion and winch speed on the umbilical tension during launch and recovery process of an ultra deep water work class rov is observed through a set of wave flume experiments the vertical ship motion is generated by an electric motor and superimposed to a constant downward or upward winch speed to simulate respectively a real launch or recovery process for 1 10 scaled rov model one hundred different test conditions combinations of fixed length dry still water tests and different wave setups ship motions and winch speeds and each one repeated 30 times to cover the random interaction between the rov and water are investigated experimentally a simplified numerical model is developed and the model parameters are calibrated based on the wave flume experimental results the calibrated numerical model is used for series of numerical simulations of launch and recovery operation under wider range of waves condition using the rov model and the presented input data in this study the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the inclusion of ship motion and winching mechanism during the launch and recovery operation is proven important since the maximum line tension may increase up to 2 2 times the maximum tension from the case where the winching mechanism is excluded from the experiment 2 in the dry test configuration there is a significant fluctuation in the umbilical tension due to sudden start stop of the winch having hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads on rov during the still water test these transient fluctuations lead to notable tension spikes during the wave flume experiment the tension fluctuation can be twice as large as the rov dry weight which is higher than the umbilical safe working load indicating an unsafe condition for the rov operation this can be avoided by using a slow winch speed during launch and recovery of the rov 3 the inclusion of wave and ship motion furtherly increase the tension in the umbilical the increase is more pronounced for wave with larger normalized vertical velocity around the mean water level and larger ship motions based on the numerical simulations the environmental limit for safe launch and recovery simulation can be broadened by suppressing the ship motion and using slow winch speed when the tension spike due to sudden winch activation cannot be avoided 4 if the tension spike due to sudden winch activation can be avoided the wave ship induced snap load governs the maximum tension in the umbilical in this case the best way to launch the rov is by using fast winch speed to keep the umbilical in slack condition until the rov pass the energetic area of the wave for recovery the best scenario is still by a combination of slow winch speed and suppressed ship motion 5 the environmental limit in the launch process is larger than in the recovery process this emphasizes that the recovery of rov with light submerged weight is more critical to its umbilical integrity than the launch process therefore the rov operation should be planned with a stricter environmental limits and ship motions on the recovery phase than the launch phase to ensure a

20256,the international maritime organization imo has been actively developing the second generation intact stability criteria of ships and discussing a technical issue in this study we focused on the dead ship condition and introduced the procedures of assessment for lv1 level 1 and lv2 level 2 if the lv1 criterion of relatively simple calculation related to the gz curve is not satisfied the lv2 criterion considering the hydrodynamics in waves were presented in addition the roll damping coefficient and wave slope function required to obtain the spectrum of the effective relative roll angle which are the most important factors in the lv2 criterion calculation were accurately implemented in this paper the calculation process was described in as much detail as possible based on actual ship data 13 k oil chemical tanker and finally it was confirmed that the ship s vulnerability criteria were passed at lv1 and lv2 in particular it can provide clues to predict the stability in advance in a dead ship condition in the event of a failure of an engine of the ship keywords international maritime organization second generation intact stability criteria dead ship condition 13k oil chemical tanker roll damping wave slope function 1 introduction ship stability is one of the most essential requirements for any type of ship is code revision work of the international maritime organization imo has integrated the standards for intact stability and the mandatory requirements are divided into part a and the recommended standards for specific ships such as offshore structures are divided into part b with the adoption of the 2008 is code at the 85th msc meeting the is code part a was mandated by the revision of the 5th rule of solas chapter 2 1 however despite being a ship that satisfies the current standards of intact stability accidents frequently occurred due to the problem of dynamic stability to solve the dynamic stability problem five types of stability failure modes have been identified as follows and stability standards are being developed for each mode 1 pure loss of stability 2 parametric roll 3 surf riding broaching 4 excessive acceleration 5 dead ship condition shipbuilding engineers were aware of the danger of probability of capsizing in specific conditions when the ship s engine loses power a typical characteristic of a ship with a superstructure in the middle of the hull is that the wind pressure area is distributed almost symmetrically this resulted in the ship returning to the beam sea position in the dead ship condition maximizing the adverse effects of wind and waves the dead ship condition was a mode of loss of stability introduced as a physical basis for the severe wind transverse criterion known as weather criterion adopted by the imo in 1985 the scenario for the weather criterion is shown in fig 1 imo sdc 7 inf 2 as follows this scenario assumes that a ship loses power and encounters a transverse wave in a situation where it is rolling under the influence of waves and is also inclined and pushed by the wind influence the ship is inclined and pushed by the simultaneous action of the wind aerodynamic force and the hydrodynamic force caused by the roll motion of the ship next a long gust suddenly occurs the worst possible moment for this is when the ship is rolling at an angle to the side where the maximum wind blows and in addition to the impact of the waves the wind is also affected the enhanced wind increases the drift velocity which increases the hydrodynamic drift reaction therefore the heeling moment increases due to the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces assuming that the wind gust is sustained enough to allow the ship to roll completely in the other direction the roll angle on the opposite side of the wind is the basis for the criterion if the roll angle on the opposite side of the wind is too large or if any opening can be flooded the ship s stability is considered insufficient several studies have been conducted on attempts to apply the dead ship condition to ships francescutto 2004 mata and souto 2014 bulian and francescutto 2006 however the ship file is missing or some contents have been omitted also some ships are very old for this reason not all of their main dimensions and characteristics are available the most regrettable point is that the latest imo draft imo sdc 7 2020 has not been applied so there are few studies to refer to detailed calculation procedures in this study we focused on the dead ship condition and introduced the procedures of assessment based on the most recent draft standards imo sdc 6 2019a imo sdc 7 2020 the study on the vulnerability criteria of dead ship condition lv1 and lv2 was revised according to the following imo draft imo 2015a and imo 2015b draft revision of the international standard is code with respect to lv1 and lv2 vulnerability criteria for dead ship condition failure modes imo 2015c and imo 2016a draft of explanatory notes for the ship s vulnerability to dead ship condition failure mode imo 2016b opinion on dead ship condition lv2 standard therefore the formula of lv1 and lv2 of the dead ship condition and the calculation of the actually built ship 13 k oil chemical tanker will be used to examine application of the second generation intact stability criteria the dead ship condition is the last added mode among the 5 s generation stability failure modes this means that there are few calculation results of the second generation stability of dead ship conditions for previous ships for reference in this paper we focus on showing and analyzing numerical examples of the calculation procedure for each step along with a lot of data from the sample ship for the dead ship condition 2 imo vulnerability criteria for dead ship condition 2 1 lv1 vulnerability criterion according to lv1 criterion of the dead ship condition l w1 and l w2 can be used to determine the vulnerability of the ship s stability mode if the ship can withstand the effect of beam wind and rolling in fig 2 as follows imo sdc 7 2020 1 the ship is subjected to a steady wind pressure acting perpendicular to the ship s centerline which results in a steady wind heeling lever l w1 from the resultant angle of equilibrium ϕ 0 the ship is assumed to roll owing to wave action to an angle of roll ϕ 1 to windward and the angle of heel under action of steady wind ϕ 0 should not exceed 16 or 80 of the angle of deck edge immersion whichever is less 2 the ship is then subjected to a gust wind pressure which results in a gust wind heeling lever l w2 under these circumstances area b should be equal to or greater than area a as indicated in fig 2 where the angles in fig 2 are defined as follows ϕ 0 angle of heel under action of steady wind deg ϕ 1 angle of roll to windward due to wave action deg ϕ 2 angle of downflooding ϕ f or 50 or ϕ c whichever is least where ϕ f angle of heel at which openings in the hull superstructures or deck houses which cannot be closed weather tight immerse in applying this criterion small openings through which progressive flooding cannot take place need not be considered as open ϕ c angle of second intercept between wind heeling lever l w2 and gz curves therefore summarizing the explanations so far in fig 2 a ship is not considered to be vulnerable to the dead ship condition failure mode under the lv1 criterion as given be eq 1 1 φ 0 16 and a b l w1 can be calculated as eq 2 and l w2 as eq 3 2 l w 1 p a l z 1000 g δ m 3 l w 2 1 5 l w 1 m where p wind pressure of 504 pa the value of p

2 and 3 in fig 8 are 0 0289 m and 0 0434 m respectively referring to fig 2 the values required for the dead ship condition lv1 vulnerability criterion calculation are shown in table 9 using eq 4 ϕ 1 was obtained and 24 g z ϕ g 1 ϕ g 3 ϕ 3 g 5 ϕ 5 g 7 ϕ 7 ϕ 0 and ϕ c are solutions corresponding to the intersection of the gz curve and l w1 and l w2 respectively and were obtained using the newton raphson method with reference to fig 2 the areas a and b determined by the previously obtained ϕ values were calculated using the trapezoidal rule of integration method therefore in table 9 since the two conditions for determining the lv1 vulnerability criterion are finally satisfied it can be determined that the first step criterion is passed if the lv1 vulnerability criterion is passed it is not necessary to perform the lv2 vulnerability criterion calculation but in this study the logic is verified by performing the calculation of the lv2 vulnerability criterion 4 lv2 vulnerability criterion assessment of dead ship condition case study the dead ship condition lv2 vulnerability criterion can be calculated according to the calculation procedure described above the most important factor in the calculation procedure is how accurately the spectrum of the effective relative roll angle s ω given by eq 15 to do this first the equivalent linear roll damping coefficient μ e which is common to eqs 16 and 17 is obtained equivalent linear roll damping b e is obtained by the ikeda s method since the roll damping of a ship is difficult to calculate theoretically due to the large influence of viscosity experimental results or some prediction methods are used to obtain the roll damping at the design stage of the ship therefore imo sdc 7 recommended using the ikeda s method to calculate the roll damping of various hulls with bilge keels in this paper the detailed formula for eq 25 to obtain the roll damping b e is omitted and refer to kawahara et al 2012 25 b e b ˆ 44 b 44 ρ b 2 b 2 g 26 b 44 b f b e b l b b k b w where b f frictional component b e eddy component b l lift component b bk bilge keel component b w wave component the calculation result for the roll damping b e is shown in fig 9 in fig 9 a it was verified by comparing the existing results sdc7 inf 2 of the c11 container ship with the calculation results performed in this study fig 9 b shows the calculation result for the 13 k oil chemical tanker using the calculation code verified very well matched results the second is to find the effective wave slope function r ω in eq 18 in the absence of ship specific data the effective wave slope function r ω can be obtained by the following equation by the direct pressure integration method in sdc7 inf 2 27 r ω m f k ω δ g m h 2 k ω where m fk ω the magnitude of the froude krylov roll moment h wave height k ω ω 2 g wave number fig 10 is the result of eq 27 according to the wave frequency ω for a 13 k oil chemical tanker therefore the lv2 vulnerability criterion result was finally obtained according to eq 5 in table 10 the c value of eq 5 is 0 000831 which is less than the lv2 reference value r ds2 0 06 so it satisfies the lv2 vulnerability criterion therefore if the more conservative lv1 vulnerability criterion in table 9 is passed the lv2 criterion naturally satisfies the logic that passes usually if the lv1 vulnerability criterion is not satisfied the lv2 vulnerability criterion is calculated and judged 5 conclusion recently the international maritime organization imo has been actively developing the second generation intact stability criteria of ships and discussing a technical issue in this study we focused on the dead ship condition of the five causes of loss of stability pure loss of stability parametric roll surf riding broaching excessive acceleration dead ship condition we introduced the procedures of assessment for lv1 level 1 and lv2 level 2 in much detail in the case of not satisfying the lv1 criterion of relatively simple calculation related to the gz curve the mathematical modeling of the lv2 criterion considering the hydrodynamics in waves were presented for a 13 k oil chemical tanker the second generation intact stability criteria consist of two levels lv1 and lv2 imo 2017a imo 2017b the lv1 criterion is an evaluation using a relatively simple physical based vulnerability criterion using given ship data on the other hand the lv2 criterion is an evaluation made through complex calculations by applying a mathematical model and considering the waves the lv1 criterion is determined through formulas formulated in terms related to the heel angles and weather conditions the lv2 criterion is determined through the summation of the weighting function in the condition of the wave spectrum through a probabilistic point of view the main difference from lv1 is that at lv2 the calculation is performed under conditions where the ship is affected by waves in particular the roll damping coefficient and wave slope function required to obtain the spectrum of the effective relative roll angle which are the most important factors in the lv2 criterion calculation were accurately implemented in the future we plan to conduct an in depth analysis through lv3 direct stability assessment using cfd and model experiments so far there has been few papers describing the process of calculating lv1 and lv2 for dead ship condition in great detail in this paper the calculation process was described in as much detail as possible based on actual ship data and finally it was confirmed

20256,the international maritime organization imo has been actively developing the second generation intact stability criteria of ships and discussing a technical issue in this study we focused on the dead ship condition and introduced the procedures of assessment for lv1 level 1 and lv2 level 2 if the lv1 criterion of relatively simple calculation related to the gz curve is not satisfied the lv2 criterion considering the hydrodynamics in waves were presented in addition the roll damping coefficient and wave slope function required to obtain the spectrum of the effective relative roll angle which are the most important factors in the lv2 criterion calculation were accurately implemented in this paper the calculation process was described in as much detail as possible based on actual ship data 13 k oil chemical tanker and finally it was confirmed that the ship s vulnerability criteria were passed at lv1 and lv2 in particular it can provide clues to predict the stability in advance in a dead ship condition in the event of a failure of an engine of the ship keywords international maritime organization second generation intact stability criteria dead ship condition 13k oil chemical tanker roll damping wave slope function 1 introduction ship stability is one of the most essential requirements for any type of ship is code revision work of the international maritime organization imo has integrated the standards for intact stability and the mandatory requirements are divided into part a and the recommended standards for specific ships such as offshore structures are divided into part b with the adoption of the 2008 is code at the 85th msc meeting the is code part a was mandated by the revision of the 5th rule of solas chapter 2 1 however despite being a ship that satisfies the current standards of intact stability accidents frequently occurred due to the problem of dynamic stability to solve the dynamic stability problem five types of stability failure modes have been identified as follows and stability standards are being developed for each mode 1 pure loss of stability 2 parametric roll 3 surf riding broaching 4 excessive acceleration 5 dead ship condition shipbuilding engineers were aware of the danger of probability of capsizing in specific conditions when the ship s engine loses power a typical characteristic of a ship with a superstructure in the middle of the hull is that the wind pressure area is distributed almost symmetrically this resulted in the ship returning to the beam sea position in the dead ship condition maximizing the adverse effects of wind and waves the dead ship condition was a mode of loss of stability introduced as a physical basis for the severe wind transverse criterion known as weather criterion adopted by the imo in 1985 the scenario for the weather criterion is shown in fig 1 imo sdc 7 inf 2 as follows this scenario assumes that a ship loses power and encounters a transverse wave in a situation where it is rolling under the influence of waves and is also inclined and pushed by the wind influence the ship is inclined and pushed by the simultaneous action of the wind aerodynamic force and the hydrodynamic force caused by the roll motion of the ship next a long gust suddenly occurs the worst possible moment for this is when the ship is rolling at an angle to the side where the maximum wind blows and in addition to the impact of the waves the wind is also affected the enhanced wind increases the drift velocity which increases the hydrodynamic drift reaction therefore the heeling moment increases due to the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces assuming that the wind gust is sustained enough to allow the ship to roll completely in the other direction the roll angle on the opposite side of the wind is the basis for the criterion if the roll angle on the opposite side of the wind is too large or if any opening can be flooded the ship s stability is considered insufficient several studies have been conducted on attempts to apply the dead ship condition to ships francescutto 2004 mata and souto 2014 bulian and francescutto 2006 however the ship file is missing or some contents have been omitted also some ships are very old for this reason not all of their main dimensions and characteristics are available the most regrettable point is that the latest imo draft imo sdc 7 2020 has not been applied so there are few studies to refer to detailed calculation procedures in this study we focused on the dead ship condition and introduced the procedures of assessment based on the most recent draft standards imo sdc 6 2019a imo sdc 7 2020 the study on the vulnerability criteria of dead ship condition lv1 and lv2 was revised according to the following imo draft imo 2015a and imo 2015b draft revision of the international standard is code with respect to lv1 and lv2 vulnerability criteria for dead ship condition failure modes imo 2015c and imo 2016a draft of explanatory notes for the ship s vulnerability to dead ship condition failure mode imo 2016b opinion on dead ship condition lv2 standard therefore the formula of lv1 and lv2 of the dead ship condition and the calculation of the actually built ship 13 k oil chemical tanker will be used to examine application of the second generation intact stability criteria the dead ship condition is the last added mode among the 5 s generation stability failure modes this means that there are few calculation results of the second generation stability of dead ship conditions for previous ships for reference in this paper we focus on showing and analyzing numerical examples of the calculation procedure for each step along with a lot of data from the sample ship for the dead ship condition 2 imo vulnerability criteria for dead ship condition 2 1 lv1 vulnerability criterion according to lv1 criterion of the dead ship condition l w1 and l w2 can be used to determine the vulnerability of the ship s stability mode if the ship can withstand the effect of beam wind and rolling in fig 2 as follows imo sdc 7 2020 1 the ship is subjected to a steady wind pressure acting perpendicular to the ship s centerline which results in a steady wind heeling lever l w1 from the resultant angle of equilibrium ϕ 0 the ship is assumed to roll owing to wave action to an angle of roll ϕ 1 to windward and the angle of heel under action of steady wind ϕ 0 should not exceed 16 or 80 of the angle of deck edge immersion whichever is less 2 the ship is then subjected to a gust wind pressure which results in a gust wind heeling lever l w2 under these circumstances area b should be equal to or greater than area a as indicated in fig 2 where the angles in fig 2 are defined as follows ϕ 0 angle of heel under action of steady wind deg ϕ 1 angle of roll to windward due to wave action deg ϕ 2 angle of downflooding ϕ f or 50 or ϕ c whichever is least where ϕ f angle of heel at which openings in the hull superstructures or deck houses which cannot be closed weather tight immerse in applying this criterion small openings through which progressive flooding cannot take place need not be considered as open ϕ c angle of second intercept between wind heeling lever l w2 and gz curves therefore summarizing the explanations so far in fig 2 a ship is not considered to be vulnerable to the dead ship condition failure mode under the lv1 criterion as given be eq 1 1 φ 0 16 and a b l w1 can be calculated as eq 2 and l w2 as eq 3 2 l w 1 p a l z 1000 g δ m 3 l w 2 1 5 l w 1 m where p wind pressure of 504 pa the value of p

ship condition the calculations were performed by referring to the data of 13 k oil chemical tanker lee and kang 2004 in table 6 the main specifications of the ship applied for calculation are the length l 120 4 m where b is the width d is the draft is the displacement ton is the displaced volume a k is the bilge keel area and v s is the service speed the sectional area according to the position of the longitudinal section of the 13 k oil chemical tanker is shown in fig 7 it is a typical medium sized tanker and the bottom of the hull is relatively flat fig 8 shows the result of the lv1 vulnerability criterion calculation using the gz data according to the heel angle the gz curve was fitted with a polynomial in several studies contento et al 1996 surendran and venkata ramana reddy 2003 taylan 2000 because of the symmetrical nature of the gz curve 5th to 9th order odd polynomials were used as a function of heel angle in this paper the gz calculated value and the curve fitting were matched very well in fig 8 through the 7th order polynomial of eq 24 and the coefficients of the polynomial are shown in table 8 the values of heeling lever l w1 and l w2 explained in eqs 2 and 3 in fig 8 are 0 0289 m and 0 0434 m respectively referring to fig 2 the values required for the dead ship condition lv1 vulnerability criterion calculation are shown in table 9 using eq 4 ϕ 1 was obtained and 24 g z ϕ g 1 ϕ g 3 ϕ 3 g 5 ϕ 5 g 7 ϕ 7 ϕ 0 and ϕ c are solutions corresponding to the intersection of the gz curve and l w1 and l w2 respectively and were obtained using the newton raphson method with reference to fig 2 the areas a and b determined by the previously obtained ϕ values were calculated using the trapezoidal rule of integration method therefore in table 9 since the two conditions for determining the lv1 vulnerability criterion are finally satisfied it can be determined that the first step criterion is passed if the lv1 vulnerability criterion is passed it is not necessary to perform the lv2 vulnerability criterion calculation but in this study the logic is verified by performing the calculation of the lv2 vulnerability criterion 4 lv2 vulnerability criterion assessment of dead ship condition case study the dead ship condition lv2 vulnerability criterion can be calculated according to the calculation procedure described above the most important factor in the calculation procedure is how accurately the spectrum of the effective relative roll angle s ω given by eq 15 to do this first the equivalent linear roll damping coefficient μ e which is common to eqs 16 and 17 is obtained equivalent linear roll damping b e is obtained by the ikeda s method since the roll damping of a ship is difficult to calculate theoretically due to the large influence of viscosity experimental results or some prediction methods are used to obtain the roll damping at the design stage of the ship therefore imo sdc 7 recommended using the ikeda s method to calculate the roll damping of various hulls with bilge keels in this paper the detailed formula for eq 25 to obtain the roll damping b e is omitted and refer to kawahara et al 2012 25 b e b ˆ 44 b 44 ρ b 2 b 2 g 26 b 44 b f b e b l b b k b w where b f frictional component b e eddy component b l lift component b bk bilge keel component b w wave component the calculation result for the roll damping b e is shown in fig 9 in fig 9 a it was verified by comparing the existing results sdc7 inf 2 of the c11 container ship with the calculation results performed in this study fig 9 b shows the calculation result for the 13 k oil chemical tanker using the calculation code verified very well matched results the second is to find the effective wave slope function r ω in eq 18 in the absence of ship specific data the effective wave slope function r ω can be obtained by the following equation by the direct pressure integration method in sdc7 inf 2 27 r ω m f k ω δ g m h 2 k ω where m fk ω the magnitude of the froude krylov roll moment h wave height k ω ω 2 g wave number fig 10 is the result of eq 27 according to the wave frequency ω for a 13 k oil chemical tanker therefore the lv2 vulnerability criterion result was finally obtained according to eq 5 in table 10 the c value of eq 5 is 0 000831 which is less than the lv2 reference value r ds2 0 06 so it satisfies the lv2 vulnerability criterion therefore if the more conservative lv1 vulnerability criterion in table 9 is passed the lv2 criterion naturally satisfies the logic that passes usually if the lv1 vulnerability criterion is not satisfied the lv2 vulnerability criterion is calculated and judged 5 conclusion recently the international maritime organization imo has been actively developing the second generation intact stability

20257,to improve the stability performance of the trimaran appendages were usually installed installing a larger area appendage will increase the ship s resistance and a smaller area appendage has a limited stabilizing effect therefore the design of appendages was a problem to be solved meanwhile the installation position of the designed appendages was also worth studying this study designed the appendages and investigated the installation position of stability appendages for a trimaran using computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation the results of model tests and cfd simulations were compared which verify the accuracy and feasibility of cfd simulation t foil and flap were selected as the trimaran vertical stability appendages according to the appendage design basis and constraints the shape and dimension are given through the design process the flap was installed on the stern of the trimaran six longitudinal and four vertical installation positions were selected while the best installation position for the t foil was obtained finally simulation and experimental results verify that the installation position of appendages is reasonable and effective for improving the trimaran stability performance keywords trimaran numerical simulation stability appendages model tests appendages installation position 1 introduction compared with traditional ships multi hull ships have many advantages including higher sailing performance lower resistance at high speeds and better stability tang et al 2020 based on the above advantages the multi hull ship has become a research hotspot in ships in recent years however multihulls like others ships also have this stability problem when they are sailing ship stability performance is an important problem in the field of navigation many experts and scholars have conducted many simulations and experiments to overcome the ship motion and keep ship stabilization the ship s motion includes the following 6 degrees of freedom motion surge sway roll yaw heave and pitch the vertical acceleration caused by heave and pitch motions usually leads the ship to capsize or seasick for the crew many appendages are selected and installed on a ship to eliminate the heave and pitch motion installing appendages is an effective way to reduce heave and pitch motion and improve the ship s seakeeping performance it is also applicable to the trimaran a multi hull ship studied in this article a stern flap appendage for halifax was designed by cumming et al 2006 the stern flap can reduce hydrodynamic resistance and warship fuel cost from 5 to 10 jang et al 2009 conducted some practical design aspects of appendages for passenger vessels they performed the investigation through reference review numerical simulation and model tests and obtained the optimized design of the appendages suneela et al 2020 studied the effect of an interceptor on the performance of a high speed planing hull the results showed that the installation of interceptors reduces the drag and trim of the hull through cfd simulation mansoori and fernandes 2016 2017 also used an interceptor to improve the trim motion of high speed crafts jokar et al 2020 developed vertical motion control of an unstable planning craft using trim tabs combined with the control system simulations and experimental results indicated heave and pitch motions are all reduced through installed appendage santos et al 2005 performed motion reduction of fast ferries using t foil and flaps experimental results showed that the active appendages could significantly improve the stability performance of the hull ghassemi et al 2011 installed two interceptors on a high speed craft for controlling trim motion the installation of interceptors changed the stern pressure which directly results in better control of trim motion jiang et al 2020 conducted a hybrid control strategy for ship motion reduction using t foil the results indicated the passive t foil and actively controlled t foil are all effective for the motion reduction of a ship huang et al 2018a 2018b used four fins for ship heave pitch and roll stabilization the stabilization effectiveness has been verified by model tests also there is much research about the installation of appendages on multi hull ships zhu and ma 2019 used t foils and trim tabs to improve the stability performance of a catamaran hu et al 2018 studied a motion reduction method for a catamaran using two hydrofoils begovic et al 2019 studied the hydrodynamic performance of swath vessels by installing two fins on the swath hull heave and pitch motion can be reduced in the head and the following sea li and li 2019 developed the seakeeping of a trimaran with t foil through numerical simulations and experimental tests although the installed t foil increases the calm water resistance the t foil can significantly reduce the amplitude of the heave and pitch motion of a trimaran alavimehr et al 2017 2019 designed a ride control system to stabilize a catamaran the motion has smoothed with a t foil installed on the bow and two trim tabs installed on the stern of a catamaran the above literature reviews indicated that the appendages could significantly reduce the ship s motion improve the stability of the ship and thereby reduce the risk of a ship sailing at sea however much of the research is based on existing appendages the research content is an active appendage or a passive appendage there is no detailed analysis of the design process and installation location of the appendage in this investigation to reduce the heave and pitch motion of a trimaran t foil and flap were selected as the stability appendages the design process and installation position were given in this study the main contributions are listed as follows 1 first the model test and numerical simulation of the trimaran were carried out the feasibility and accuracy of numerical simulation are determined then a large number of simulations were carried out using numerical simulation and the design method of hull ship anti rolling appendage was analyzed and proposed based on the simulation results 2 after the appendage is designed we used cfd to simulate the different longitudinal and vertical installation positions and then calculate the hydrostatic resistance of the trimaran at the different installation positions of the appendage based on the above results the best installation position of the trimaran s anti rolling appendage is obtained 3 the design and installation of appendages were verified by numerical simulation and model test the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the information of trimaran and model tests section 3 describes the numerical simulation in section 4 the process of appendages design and installation is conducted results and discussion are presented in section 5 finally section 6 concludes the paper 2 model tests 2 1 description and experimental setup in this study the trimaran model is a scale model the geometric characteristics of the trimaran are shown in table 1 model tests of the trimaran were performed in a towing tank the information about the towing tank can be found in liu et al 2021 under regular waves the cases of the model test are listed in table 2 while all cases are presented in liu et al 2020 the trimaran model is shown in fig 2 in the process of model tests the trimaran was towed by carriage the speed conditions for model testing mainly include two types 2 93 m s and 6 51 m s which equals 18kn and 40kn as the scale ratio is 1 10 the reason for the choice of these two speeds is that the maximum speed is 40kn and the regular speed is maintained at 18kn of this trimaran the trimaran was hoisted by a crane into the towing tank for an experiment the experiment setup includes carriage wave generator and control and monitors computer in addition there exist some necessary equipment to consider such as sensors and power cabinets the conditions of the model test are mainly controlled by carriage and wave generators carriage speed determines the speed condition of the trimaran while wave generators simulate different forms of waves regular waves and irregular waves model tests of the trimaran are shown in fig 3 2 2 motion description the heave motion of the trimaran is the translational movement of the trimaran along the z axis the pitch motion of the trimaran is the rotation movement of the trimaran along the y axis the motion coordinate of heave and pitch motion is shown in fig 1 heave and pitch motion was the studied

study numerical simulation and model tests are used as the main design and installation optimization of the appendages a large number of studies have shown that numerical simulation is feasible for ship related simulation these studies include ship hydrodynamic characteristics song et al 2019a ship motion tezdogan et al 2015 and the propulsion performance of the ship song et al 2019b the results of their study showed that the cfd simulation could be applied in the shipping field therefore in this study cfd simulation is also used in the motion calculation and appendages optimization design the numerical simulation was performed by the commercial cfd code star ccm ship cfd simulation is a multiphase flow problem including water and air the volume of fluid vof method was used to capture the free surface dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi was applied to calculate trimaran motion in the regular wave generator the fifth order wave was used for the numerical simulation 3 1 governing equations cfd simulation is based on three equations of fluid mechanics continuity equation momentum equation and energy equation the continuity equation and navier stokes n s equation are the most widely acknowledged method for describing turbulent flows typically ship cfd needs to solve the n s equation and the complete n s equation is presented as niklas and pruszko 2019 3 ρ u i x i 0 4 ρ u i

this study the sst k ω turbulence model was selected to solve a trimaran s motion problem the related equations about the turbulence can be found in menter 1992 3 3 free surface modeling ship sailing in marine is a two phase flow problem of air and water this simulation used the volume of fluid vof method to accurately capture the free surface in the vof method a function α was defined and 0 α 1 α can be expressed as bi et al 2019 6 α 0 air 1 water and α satisfies the equation as 7 α t u α x v α y w α z 0 3 4 computational domain and boundary condition the first step of the cfd simulation is to build a calculation domain the boundary condition should be clear table 3 gives the boundary condition of the calculation domain and then the calculation domain of the cfd simulation is shown in fig 4 to calculate the accuracy of turbulent numerical simulation a nearly layered grid is required and the y value is controlled between 30 and 300 for general hydrodynamic calculations 3 5 mesh generations overset grid method was applied in the cfd simulation fig 5 shows the condition of the grids three grids include coarse medium and fine have been built to analyze the grid independence it is necessary to carry out verification before proceeding to the systematic computation fig 6 shows the results of the calculation under three grids 3 6 calculation setup as mentioned above the dfbi model was used to solve the motion of the trimaran in cfd simulation the time step follows the international towing tank conference ittc equation de marco et al 2017 ittc 2014 8 δ t 0 01 0 005 l v the time step independence analysis was also conducted based on eq 8 three time steps include 0 007s 0 010s and 0 014s were applied in the cfd simulation the results are shown in fig 7 model tests of the trimaran were performed in a towing tank for comparing the numerical simulation and the experiments numerical simulation is also required to perform the same condition fig 8 a and b show the resistance calculation of the trimaran under different speeds fig 8 c and d are the sailing state of the trimaran under different wave periods 3 7 verifications and validations the procedure of verifications and validations is necessary for numerical calculation in the process of verification the grid independence and time step independence are conducted and the validation process is to compare the results of cfd simulation and the model tests the detail information about verification and validation can be found in stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 3 7 1 verification the method of grid convergence verification was based on the process described by celik et al 2008 tezdogan et al 2016 song et al 2019 the convergence ratio r could be expressed as follows 9 r s f s m s m s c and r 1 monotonic divergence r 0 oscillatory convergence 0 r 1 monotonic convergence where s f s m and s c represent the computational results corresponding to fine medium and coarse grids respectively the estimated order of accuracy p was calculated as follows 10 p ln s m s c s f s m ln r where r is refinement ratio and r 2 the grid convergence index gci was defined as 11 gci 1 25 e a 21 r p 1 where e a 21 s f s m s f the results of different grids and time steps are shown in tables 4 and 5 through the verification process the results are calculated and shown in tables 6 and 7 from table 6 it could be seen that the grid is monotonic convergence in table 7 the difference between the results is reduced when the time step decreases which means convergence towards the exact solution value in short the simulation calculation is feasible to save computer resources grid 2 and t2 were used for numerical calculation in this study 3 7 2 validation to valid the cfd simulation a comparison of the simulation and the experiment results are required tables 8 and 9 show the comparison results under calm water and regular waves between simulation and model test the resistance value error is below 10 for motion calculation the maximum error is 24 71 which occurs under high speed and large wave height the minimum error is 5 32 which occurs under the conditions of low speed and small wave height it is mentioned bi et al 2019 that as the speed and wave height increase the nonlinearity of ship motion also increases as a result the increased nonlinear characteristics of trimaran motion will affect the accuracy of numerical simulation in summary the simulation results show that the overset grid proposed in this paper can reliably simulate the motion of a trimaran in waves therefore the numerical simulation can accurately reflect the motion trend of the trimaran in waves and the simulation results are in good agreement with the model test data however with the enhancement of the nonlinear characteristics of the trimaran in the waves the accuracy of the numerical simulation will be reduced 4 appendages design and installation 4 1 design by comparing simulations and model tests the results show that cfd simulation is feasible and can be used for the design and installation analysis of appendages in this study t foil and flap were selected as the stability appendages of the trimaran the appendages design complies with the following conditions in eq 12 12 min s h p s t 15 θ t 15 7 5 θ f 7 5 f w a v e f t f f w f w s t e r n w t w b o w where h and p are heave displacement and pitch angle of the trimaran s is the area of the appendage θ f are attack angles of t foil and flap w f w t w s t e r n and w b o w are the width of t foil flap trimaran stern and trimaran bow respectively the flowchart of the appendages design was presented in fig 9 as follows step 1 dimension the dimension selection of appendages should meet the conditions in eq 12 under the constraint conditions to minimize the heave and pitch of the trimaran the width of the flap is the same as the width of the stern and the t foil width is the same as the bow deck width to meet the minimum area of the airfoil the resultant force of t foil and flap is equal to the wave force suffered by the trimaran 6 51 m s ssn4 significant wave height ssn3 0 5 1 25 m ssn 4 0 125 0 25 m ssn 5 2 5 4 0 m based on the above analysis the dimensions of the t foil and flap are shown in figs 10 a and b notes the reason for condition 6 51 m s ssn4 selection is that the maximum speed of the trimaran is 6 51 m s and there is a higher probability of occurrence of ssn4 on the sea perez 2005 step 2 installation position the flap is installed in the stern of the trimaran in this study as shown in fig 10 c six longitudinal positions and four vertical positions were selected for t foil installation which is shown in fig 11 the selection of the best installation position should perform multiple simulations the constraint is shown in eq 14 remark 1 t foil is not out of the water surface as far as possible the slamming effectiveness will produce when the t foil is out of the water surface which will cause structural damage to the t foil 2 flap is required to match the trimaran stern streamline to ensure the effectiveness of the flap and facilitate installation it is usually necessary to fit the profile line of the stern 3 t foil is installed as front as possible to obtain a larger moment step 3 verification when the installation position selection has been achieved the effect of appendages design and installation should be verified verification was conducted through cfd simulations and model tests it is relatively feasible to carry out the corresponding model tests since the trimaran is a scaled model that the appendages are easy to replace if the stability effect is not obvious after the appendages are installed the process will return to step 1 to redesign and install the appendages the process of the appendages design installation and verification are shown in fig 9 based on the design steps the designed appendages are presented in figs 10 a and b 4 2 flap installation the flap should be consistent with the trimaran stern streamline the stern profile of the trimaran stern is an arc so the flap profile is designed to fit the stern profile of the trimaran under the requirement of the dimension of the flap the installation position of the flap is indicated in fig 10 c 4 3 t foil installation the first principle of t foil installation is to maximize the stabilization effect for the trimaran the second is to make the sailing resistance of the trimaran with appendages as small as possible finally the t foil cannot be separated from the water surface the t foil separated from the water surface will cause a slamming effect on the t foil thereby destroying the structure of the foil simultaneously the t foil will not have the stabilization effect when it is out of the water in this study four vertical installation positions and six longitudinal installation positions were selected for the t foil installation the range of longitudinal distance from the bow to the cog of the trimaran is 0 06l 0 46 l and the range of vertical distance the height of column foil is 0 051d 0 202d therefore six longitudinal and four vertical installation positions are selected at 0 06 l w l 0 46 l w l and 0 051d 0 202d we select six equidistant intervals for the longitudinal installation distance and four equidistant intervals for the vertical installation distance fig 11 shows the longitudinal and vertical installation positions table 10 lists the vertical and longitudinal installation positions overall the combination of installation positions includes 24 cases and defines as a vector matrix n as shown in eq 13 the appendages installation complies with eq 14 minimize the resistance heave motion and pitch motion of the trimaran at the same time the t foil is not out of the water surface to calculate the appropriate installation position conveniently and quickly we first assume a longitudinal installation position and then calculate the optimal solution for the vertical installation position under this longitudinal position 13 n v 1 l 1 v 1 l 2 v 1 l 3 v 1 l 4 v 1 l 5 v 1 l 6 v 2 l 1 v 2 l 2 v 2 l 3 v 2 l 4 v 2 l 5 v 2 l 6 v 3 l 1 v 3 l 2 v 3 l 3 v 3 l 4 v 3

represents the height of the water surface 4 3 1 vertical installation position of t foil the column airfoil of the t foil is an asymmetrical horizontal airfoil and the airfoil profile is also naca 0012 the height of the column airfoil affects the structural performance of the t foil in general as the length of the t foil column foil increases the structural performance of the overall t foil will decrease and the column foil is prone to breakage however the too short column foil may cause the t foil to break out of the water surface it includes two points to determine the vertical installation position of the t foil the first one is the t foil not out of water surface at different sea states the other is the motion reduction at different vertical installation positions we select the first longitudinal as an example and test four group column airfoil height using the cfd simulation in section 2 the four vertical installation positions are shown in fig 12 under the simulation environment heave and pitch motions at different vertical installation positions were compared the results are shown in figs 15 16 figs 15 a and b show the motion condition at different vertical positions under 2 93 m s 0 05 m in the other three cases the effect of the vertical installation is almost the same fig 15 shows a certain difference in motion values however the influence of different vertical installation positions on heave and pitch motion is not a uniform law in the comprehensive motion analysis the average motion values under each condition 2 0s 2 4s 2 7s 3 0s 3 5s and 4 0s are similar after analyzing the overall four groups 2 93 m s 0 05 2 93 m s 0 10 6 51 m s 0 05 6 51 m s 0 10 m the conclusion is that different vertical installations have some influence on heave and pitch motion however the overall effect is not large it can almost be considered that the four types of vertically installed t foil do not affect the heave and pitch motion consider the condition of 6 51 m s ssn5 and the four vertical installation positions were conducted the different motion states of vertical installation positions 1 and 2 were given and shown in fig 13 from fig 13 a the t foil under vertical position 1 has out of water in some motion states to ensure that the t foil is not out of the water surface the second vertical installation position is chosen for vertical installation 4 3 2 longitudinal installation position of the t foil after determining the vertical installation position the longitudinal installation position needs to be determined in the longitudinal installation the first is to compare the motion state of different installation positions the second is to compare the sailing resistance of different installation positions correspondingly six longitudinal installation position of t foil on the trimaran in cfd simulation environment is shown in fig 14 then running the simulation the comparison results of motion reduction under the six installation positions are shown in figs 17 18 resistance analysis for different longitudinal installation positions was also conducted as shown in figs 19 20 the resistance result is given in fig 21 simulations were performed at 2 93 m s and 6 51 m s in calm water the results show position 1 has a minimum value under 2 93 m s also in the case of 6 51 m s the resistance changes at position 1 and position 2 are almost the same at 5s according to eq 14 the installation position of the t foil should select as position 1 simultaneously the front the t foil is installed the farther it is from the cog and the greater the moment that can be provided based on m f l m f and l are moment force and distance to better choose the longitudinal position we discussed position 1 and position 2 in depth as follows heave and pitch motion reduction under positions 1 and 2 are listed in table 11 it can be seen from table 11 that the heave and pitch motion reduction effect of position 1 is better than that of position 2 based on the motion and resistance analysis of positions 1 and 2 the installed position was selected to position 1 5 results and discussions figs 17 18 indicates that position 1 has the most significant stabilization effect on the heave and pitch motion of the trimaran comprehensive analysis of the influence of the installation position on the resistance and stability effect position 1 of longitudinal position is selected overall position 2 of the vertical installation position and position 1 of the longitudinal position were determined as the t foil installation position the first point is to verify whether the t foil is out of the water surface and the second point is to verify the stability performance of the appendages the condition of 6 51 m s ssn5 is simulated the different motion postures of the trimaran are shown in fig 13 t foil is not out of the water surface through the cfd simulation fig 13 b proving the feasibility of the installation position next the fixed t foil and flap at different sea states require to be verified numerical simulations and model tests of the trimaran in the regular and irregular waves were all performed fig 22 exhibits the process of verification which includes simulations and model tests in the previous sections the simulation was conducted under regular waves in this section irregular waves for simulation regular waves and irregular waves for model tests were mainly carried out in the irregular wave the conditions of 6 51 m s ssn4 6 51 m s ssn3 2 93 m s ssn4 and 2 93 m s ssn3 were also calculated according to the cfd simulations the stability performance of a trimaran equipped with a fixed appendage is obtained the comparison of the trimaran with appendages and the bare trimaran under cfd simulations is shown in fig 23 fig 23 shows a set of examples of regular and irregular waves the results of model tests were displayed in liu et al 2020 2021 fig 23 shows part of the comparison results and fig 24 gives all the results under statistics tables 12 and 13 shows the value of the stabilization effect of simulations and model test the results prove the stabilization effect of the trimaran equips the appendages and verified the successful design and installed appendages for improving the ability of motion reduction the actively controlled appendages were also investigated the basis of active controller design is to install the fixed appendage first in the irregular model test wave compared with the bare trimaran the motion of the trimaran with appendages is reduced by about 20 the stabilization effect is feasible and can be used as a basis for the design of active control appendages 6 conclusions this study investigated the design and installation of appendages for trimaran stabilization simulations and experiments of regular waves were mainly carried out to ensure the regularity of waves and thus the regularity of motion in the design and installation stage simulations and experiments of irregular waves were performed to ensure consistency with actual sea states in the stage of verification this study was summarized as 1 cfd simulation was used to conduct the sailing status of the trimaran at different sea states including regular waves and irregular waves through cfd simulations the force of the trimaran encountered in 6 51 m s ssn4 was obtained then we assume the force of the appendages provided equal the trimaran encountered force at 6 51 m s ssn4 then solve the dimension of the appendages according to the force 2 the flap is installed on the stern of the trimaran for t foil installation we select six longitudinal and four vertical installation positions the calculation process of different installation positions was conducted based on the calculation results we chose the installation location with the best stabilization effect 3 a large number of simulations and model tests were carried out to verify the stability effect under the appendages current design and installation position the results verified the effect of the designed and installed appendages in motion reduction of the trimaran in the future study consider the different profiles of the appendages to achieve a better effect of motion reduction simultaneously the appendages for full scale trimaran should also be conducted credit

20257,to improve the stability performance of the trimaran appendages were usually installed installing a larger area appendage will increase the ship s resistance and a smaller area appendage has a limited stabilizing effect therefore the design of appendages was a problem to be solved meanwhile the installation position of the designed appendages was also worth studying this study designed the appendages and investigated the installation position of stability appendages for a trimaran using computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation the results of model tests and cfd simulations were compared which verify the accuracy and feasibility of cfd simulation t foil and flap were selected as the trimaran vertical stability appendages according to the appendage design basis and constraints the shape and dimension are given through the design process the flap was installed on the stern of the trimaran six longitudinal and four vertical installation positions were selected while the best installation position for the t foil was obtained finally simulation and experimental results verify that the installation position of appendages is reasonable and effective for improving the trimaran stability performance keywords trimaran numerical simulation stability appendages model tests appendages installation position 1 introduction compared with traditional ships multi hull ships have many advantages including higher sailing performance lower resistance at high speeds and better stability tang et al 2020 based on the above advantages the multi hull ship has become a research hotspot in ships in recent years however multihulls like others ships also have this stability problem when they are sailing ship stability performance is an important problem in the field of navigation many experts and scholars have conducted many simulations and experiments to overcome the ship motion and keep ship stabilization the ship s motion includes the following 6 degrees of freedom motion surge sway roll yaw heave and pitch the vertical acceleration caused by heave and pitch motions usually leads the ship to capsize or seasick for the crew many appendages are selected and installed on a ship to eliminate the heave and pitch motion installing appendages is an effective way to reduce heave and pitch motion and improve the ship s seakeeping performance it is also applicable to the trimaran a multi hull ship studied in this article a stern flap appendage for halifax was designed by cumming et al 2006 the stern flap can reduce hydrodynamic resistance and warship fuel cost from 5 to 10 jang et al 2009 conducted some practical design aspects of appendages for passenger vessels they performed the investigation through reference review numerical simulation and model tests and obtained the optimized design of the appendages suneela et al 2020 studied the effect of an interceptor on the performance of a high speed planing hull the results showed that the installation of interceptors reduces the drag and trim of the hull through cfd simulation mansoori and fernandes 2016 2017 also used an interceptor to improve the trim motion of high speed crafts jokar et al 2020 developed vertical motion control of an unstable planning craft using trim tabs combined with the control system simulations and experimental results indicated heave and pitch motions are all reduced through installed appendage santos et al 2005 performed motion reduction of fast ferries using t foil and flaps experimental results showed that the active appendages could significantly improve the stability performance of the hull ghassemi et al 2011 installed two interceptors on a high speed craft for controlling trim motion the installation of interceptors changed the stern pressure which directly results in better control of trim motion jiang et al 2020 conducted a hybrid control strategy for ship motion reduction using t foil the results indicated the passive t foil and actively controlled t foil are all effective for the motion reduction of a ship huang et al 2018a 2018b used four fins for ship heave pitch and roll stabilization the stabilization effectiveness has been verified by model tests also there is much research about the installation of appendages on multi hull ships zhu and ma 2019 used t foils and trim tabs to improve the stability performance of a catamaran hu et al 2018 studied a motion reduction method for a catamaran using two hydrofoils begovic et al 2019 studied the hydrodynamic performance of swath vessels by installing two fins on the swath hull heave and pitch motion can be reduced in the head and the following sea li and li 2019 developed the seakeeping of a trimaran with t foil through numerical simulations and experimental tests although the installed t foil increases the calm water resistance the t foil can significantly reduce the amplitude of the heave and pitch motion of a trimaran alavimehr et al 2017 2019 designed a ride control system to stabilize a catamaran the motion has smoothed with a t foil installed on the bow and two trim tabs installed on the stern of a catamaran the above literature reviews indicated that the appendages could significantly reduce the ship s motion improve the stability of the ship and thereby reduce the risk of a ship sailing at sea however much of the research is based on existing appendages the research content is an active appendage or a passive appendage there is no detailed analysis of the design process and installation location of the appendage in this investigation to reduce the heave and pitch motion of a trimaran t foil and flap were selected as the stability appendages the design process and installation position were given in this study the main contributions are listed as follows 1 first the model test and numerical simulation of the trimaran were carried out the feasibility and accuracy of numerical simulation are determined then a large number of simulations were carried out using numerical simulation and the design method of hull ship anti rolling appendage was analyzed and proposed based on the simulation results 2 after the appendage is designed we used cfd to simulate the different longitudinal and vertical installation positions and then calculate the hydrostatic resistance of the trimaran at the different installation positions of the appendage based on the above results the best installation position of the trimaran s anti rolling appendage is obtained 3 the design and installation of appendages were verified by numerical simulation and model

trimaran model is a scale model the geometric characteristics of the trimaran are shown in table 1 model tests of the trimaran were performed in a towing tank the information about the towing tank can be found in liu et al 2021 under regular waves the cases of the model test are listed in table 2 while all cases are presented in liu et al 2020 the trimaran model is shown in fig 2 in the process of model tests the trimaran was towed by carriage the speed conditions for model testing mainly include two types 2 93 m s and 6 51 m s which equals 18kn and 40kn as the scale ratio is 1 10 the reason for the choice of these two speeds is that the maximum speed is 40kn and the regular speed is maintained at 18kn of this trimaran the trimaran was hoisted by a crane into the towing tank for an experiment the experiment setup includes carriage wave generator and control and monitors computer in addition there exist some necessary equipment to consider such as sensors and power cabinets the conditions of the model test are mainly controlled by carriage and wave generators carriage speed determines the speed condition of the trimaran while wave generators simulate different forms of waves

verifications and validations is necessary for numerical calculation in the process of verification the grid independence and time step independence are conducted and the validation process is to compare the results of cfd simulation and the model tests the detail information about verification and validation can be found in stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 3 7 1 verification the method of grid convergence verification was based on the process described by celik et al 2008 tezdogan et al 2016 song et al 2019 the convergence ratio r could be expressed as follows 9 r s f s m s m s c and r 1 monotonic divergence r 0 oscillatory convergence 0 r 1 monotonic convergence where s f s m and s c represent the computational results corresponding to fine medium and coarse grids respectively the estimated order of accuracy p was calculated as follows 10 p ln s m s c s f s m ln r where r is refinement ratio and r 2 the grid convergence index gci was defined as 11 gci 1 25 e a 21 r p 1 where e a 21 s f s m s f the results of different grids and time steps are shown in tables 4 and 5 through the verification process the results are calculated and shown in tables 6 and 7 from table 6 it could be seen that the grid is monotonic convergence in table 7 the difference between the results is reduced when the time step decreases which means convergence towards the exact solution value in short the simulation calculation is feasible to save computer resources grid 2 and t2 were used for numerical calculation in this study 3 7 2 validation to valid the cfd simulation a comparison of the simulation and the experiment results are required tables 8 and 9 show the comparison results under calm water and regular waves between simulation and model test the resistance value error is below 10 for motion calculation the maximum error is 24 71 which occurs under high speed and large wave height the minimum error is 5 32 which occurs under the conditions of low speed and small wave height it is mentioned bi et al 2019 that as the speed and wave height increase the nonlinearity of ship motion also increases as a result the increased nonlinear characteristics of trimaran motion will affect the accuracy of numerical simulation in summary the simulation results show that the overset grid proposed in this paper can reliably simulate the motion of a trimaran in waves therefore the numerical simulation can accurately reflect the motion trend of the trimaran in waves and the simulation results are in good agreement with the model test data however with the enhancement of the nonlinear characteristics of the trimaran in the waves the accuracy of the numerical simulation will be reduced 4 appendages design and installation 4 1 design by comparing simulations and model tests the results show that cfd simulation is feasible and can be used for the design and installation analysis of appendages in this study t foil and flap were selected as the stability appendages of the trimaran the appendages design complies with the following conditions in eq 12 12 min s h p s t 15 θ t 15 7 5 θ f 7 5 f w a v e f t f f w f w s t e r n w t w b o w where h and p are heave displacement and pitch angle of the trimaran s is the area of the appendage θ f are attack angles of t foil and flap w f w t w s t e r n and w b o w are the width of t foil flap trimaran stern and trimaran bow respectively the flowchart of the appendages design was presented in fig 9 as follows step 1 dimension the dimension selection of appendages should meet the conditions in eq 12 under the constraint conditions to minimize the heave and pitch of the trimaran the width of the flap is the same as the width of the stern and the t foil width is the same as the bow deck width to meet the minimum area of the airfoil the resultant force of t foil and flap is equal to the wave force suffered by the trimaran 6 51 m s ssn4 significant wave height ssn3 0 5 1 25 m ssn 4 0 125 0 25 m ssn 5 2 5 4 0 m based on the above analysis the dimensions of the t foil and flap are shown in figs 10 a and b notes the reason for condition 6 51 m s ssn4 selection is that the maximum speed of the trimaran is 6 51 m s and there is a higher probability of occurrence of ssn4 on the sea perez 2005 step 2 installation position the flap is installed in the stern of the trimaran in this study as shown in fig 10 c six longitudinal positions and four vertical positions were selected for t foil installation which is shown in fig 11 the selection of the best installation position should perform multiple simulations the constraint is shown in eq 14 remark 1 t foil is not out of the water surface as far as possible the slamming effectiveness will produce when the t foil is out of the water surface which will cause structural damage to the t foil 2 flap is required to match the trimaran stern streamline to ensure the effectiveness of the flap and facilitate installation it is usually necessary to fit the profile line of the stern 3 t foil is installed as front as possible to obtain a larger moment step 3 verification when the installation position selection has been achieved the effect of appendages design and installation should be verified verification was conducted through cfd simulations and model tests it is relatively feasible to carry out the corresponding model tests since the trimaran is a scaled model that the appendages are easy to replace if the stability effect is not obvious after the appendages are installed the process will return to step 1 to redesign and install the appendages the process of the appendages design installation and verification are shown in fig 9 based on the design steps the designed appendages are presented in figs 10 a and b 4 2 flap installation the flap should be consistent with the trimaran stern streamline the stern profile of the trimaran stern is an arc so the flap profile is designed to fit the stern profile of the trimaran under the requirement of the dimension of the flap the installation position of the flap is indicated in fig 10 c 4 3 t foil installation the first principle of t foil installation is to maximize the stabilization effect for the trimaran the second is to make the sailing resistance of the trimaran with appendages as small as possible finally the t foil cannot be separated from the water surface the t foil separated from the water surface will cause a slamming effect on the t foil thereby destroying the structure of the foil simultaneously the t foil will not have the stabilization effect when it is out of the water in this study four vertical installation positions and six longitudinal installation positions were selected for the t foil installation the range of longitudinal distance from the bow to the cog of the trimaran is 0 06l 0 46 l and the range of vertical distance the height of column foil is 0 051d 0 202d therefore six longitudinal and four vertical installation positions are selected at 0 06 l w l 0 46 l w l and 0 051d 0 202d we select six equidistant intervals for the longitudinal installation distance and four equidistant intervals for the vertical installation distance fig 11 shows the longitudinal and vertical installation positions table 10 lists the vertical and longitudinal installation positions overall the combination of installation positions includes 24 cases and defines as a vector matrix n as shown in eq 13 the appendages installation complies with eq 14 minimize the resistance heave motion and pitch motion of the trimaran at the same time the t foil is not out of the water surface to calculate the appropriate installation position conveniently and quickly we first assume a longitudinal installation position and then calculate the optimal solution for the vertical installation position under this longitudinal position 13 n v 1 l 1 v 1 l 2 v 1 l 3 v 1 l 4 v 1 l 5 v 1 l 6 v 2 l 1 v 2 l 2 v 2 l 3 v 2 l 4 v 2 l 5 v 2 l 6 v 3 l 1 v 3 l 2 v 3 l 3 v 3 l 4 v 3

represents the height of the water surface 4 3 1 vertical installation position of t foil the column airfoil of the t foil is an asymmetrical horizontal airfoil and the airfoil profile is also naca 0012 the height of the column airfoil affects the structural performance of the t foil in general as the length of the t foil column foil increases the structural performance of the overall t foil will decrease and the column foil is prone to breakage however the too short column foil may cause the t foil to break out of the water surface it includes two points to determine the vertical installation position of the t foil the first one is the t foil not out of water surface at different sea states the other is the motion reduction at different vertical installation positions we select the first longitudinal as an example and test four group column airfoil height using the cfd simulation in section 2 the four vertical installation positions are shown in fig 12 under the simulation environment heave and pitch motions at different vertical installation positions were compared the results are shown in figs 15 16 figs 15 a and b show the motion condition at different vertical positions under 2 93 m s 0 05 m in the other three cases the effect of the vertical installation is almost the same fig 15 shows a certain difference in motion values however the influence of different vertical installation positions on heave and pitch motion is not a uniform law in the comprehensive motion analysis the average motion values under each condition 2 0s 2 4s 2 7s 3 0s 3 5s and 4 0s are similar after analyzing the overall four groups 2 93 m s 0 05 2 93 m s 0 10 6 51 m s 0 05 6 51 m s 0 10 m the conclusion is that different vertical installations have some influence on heave and pitch motion however the overall effect is not large it can almost be considered that the four types of vertically installed t foil do not affect the heave and pitch motion consider the condition of 6 51 m s ssn5 and the four vertical installation positions were conducted the different motion states of vertical installation positions 1 and 2 were given and shown in fig 13 from fig 13 a the t foil under vertical position 1 has out of water in some motion states to ensure that the t foil is not out of the water surface the second vertical installation position is chosen for vertical installation 4 3 2 longitudinal installation position of the t foil after determining the vertical installation position the longitudinal installation position needs to be determined in the longitudinal installation the first is to compare the motion state of different installation positions the second is to compare the sailing resistance of different installation positions correspondingly six longitudinal installation position of t foil on the trimaran in cfd simulation environment is shown in fig 14 then running the simulation the comparison results of motion reduction under the six installation positions are shown in figs 17 18 resistance analysis for different longitudinal installation positions was also conducted as shown in figs 19 20 the resistance result is given in fig 21 simulations were performed at 2 93 m s and 6 51 m s in calm water the results show position 1 has a minimum value under 2 93 m s also in the case of 6 51 m s the resistance changes at position 1 and position 2 are almost the same at 5s according to eq 14 the installation position of the t foil should select as position 1 simultaneously the front the t foil is installed the farther it is from the cog and the greater the moment that can be provided based on m f l m f and l are moment force and distance to better choose the longitudinal position we discussed position 1 and position 2 in depth as follows heave and pitch motion reduction under positions 1 and 2 are listed in table 11 it can be seen from table 11 that the heave and pitch motion reduction effect of position 1 is better than that of position 2 based on the motion and resistance analysis of positions 1 and 2 the installed position was selected to position 1 5 results and discussions figs 17 18 indicates that position 1 has the most significant stabilization effect on the heave and pitch motion of the trimaran comprehensive analysis of the influence of the installation position on the resistance and stability effect position 1 of longitudinal position is selected overall position 2 of the vertical installation position and position 1 of the longitudinal position were determined as the t foil installation position the first point is to verify whether the t foil is out of the water surface and the second point is to verify the stability performance of the appendages the condition of 6 51 m s ssn5 is simulated the different motion postures of the trimaran are shown in fig 13 t foil is not out of the water surface through the cfd simulation fig 13 b proving the feasibility of the installation position next the fixed t foil and flap at different sea states require to be verified numerical simulations and model tests of the trimaran in the regular and irregular waves were all performed fig 22 exhibits the process of verification which includes simulations and model tests in the previous sections the simulation was conducted under regular waves in this section irregular waves for simulation regular waves and irregular waves for model tests were mainly carried out in the irregular wave the conditions of 6 51 m s ssn4 6 51 m s ssn3 2 93 m s ssn4 and 2 93 m s ssn3 were also calculated according to the cfd simulations the stability performance of a trimaran equipped with a fixed appendage is obtained the comparison of the trimaran with appendages and the bare trimaran under cfd simulations is shown in fig 23 fig 23 shows a set of examples of regular and irregular waves the results of model tests were displayed in liu et al 2020 2021 fig 23 shows part of the comparison results and fig 24 gives all the results under statistics tables 12 and 13 shows the value of the stabilization effect of simulations and model test the results prove the stabilization effect of the trimaran equips the appendages and verified the successful design and installed appendages for improving the ability of motion reduction the actively controlled appendages were also investigated the basis of active controller design is to install the fixed appendage first in the irregular model test wave compared with the bare trimaran the motion of the trimaran with appendages is reduced by about 20 the stabilization effect is feasible and can be used as a basis for the design of active control appendages 6 conclusions this study investigated the design and installation of appendages for trimaran stabilization simulations and experiments of regular waves were mainly carried out to ensure the regularity of waves and thus the regularity of motion in the design and installation stage simulations and experiments of irregular waves were performed to ensure consistency with actual sea states in the stage of verification this study was summarized as 1 cfd simulation was used to conduct the sailing status of the trimaran at different sea states including regular waves and irregular waves through cfd simulations the force of the trimaran encountered in 6 51 m s ssn4 was obtained then we assume the force of the appendages provided equal the trimaran encountered force at 6 51 m s ssn4 then solve the dimension of the appendages according to the force 2 the flap is installed on the stern of the trimaran for t foil installation we select six longitudinal and four vertical installation positions the calculation process of different installation positions was conducted based on the calculation results we chose the installation location with the best stabilization effect 3 a large number of simulations and model tests were carried out to verify the stability effect under the appendages current design and installation position the results verified the effect of the designed and installed appendages in motion reduction of the trimaran in the future study consider the different profiles of the appendages to achieve a better effect of motion reduction simultaneously the appendages for full scale trimaran should also be conducted credit

20258,the present study investigates the dynamic responses of offshore jacket platforms using a passive and semi active tuned mass damper tmd satmd where the control action is achieved by a fuzzy logic controller flc under environmental i e wind water waves sea currents and seismic loadings since the studied structure failed to meet recent codes requirements adequately the suppressing effect of a satmd is considered as a way to retrofit structural performances under hydrodynamic loadings after extraction of the dynamic properties of the jacket type structure simulations of an installation system with and without a tmd have been performed and the effectiveness of tmd is quantified in order to exploit the potential of the structure to overcome all types of excitations the satmd comes complete with a fuzzy algorithm controller acknowledging that the use of a passive tmd is only a preliminary attempt to reduce the structure s dynamic responses comparison of the results indicates a significant response value reduction in acceleration base shear overturning moment velocity and lateral displacement of a case study of steel jacket platforms keywords offshore jacket platform environmental loading seismic loading semi active control inverse dynamic model dynamic time history analysis 1 introduction over the past few decades and influenced by the recent advances in science and technology traditional uses of the oceans have been expanded to include other emerging uses such as the extraction of hydrocarbons and minerals patel 1989 to meet an increasing demand for maritime sources of energy and minerals in recent years the researchers have put more effort into offshore platforms the offshore platforms have been categorized into fixed and floating types each with their particular purposes and configurations design of structures fatigue and structural analyses and reliability assessment are of high practical interests for all steel structures under cyclic loadings in particular offshore platforms located in a very tough ocean environment over a long period of time are inevitably subjected to severe environmental loads such as waves winds ice sea currents fluid flow and ground motions zhang et al 2019 consequently they undergo excessive vibrations causing disruption to the platform operation process as the most pressing problem facing the structure fatigue failure of joints uneconomical operation and discomfort of personnel reduction of the vibration amplitude of an offshore platform by 15 is expected to increase the service life by two times and may lead to decreasing maintenance and inspection of structures lin et al 2017 thus it is of considerable significance to find appropriate methods to reduce the effect of different types of excitement which are applied to offshore platforms and carry out comprehensive surveys of vibration control for offshore structures kandasamy et al 2016 oil and gas companies have renewed their interests in discovering drilling and extracting offshore hydrocarbons from shared oil fields in the persian gulf therefore the use of various efficient methods to provide maintenance service of structures and facilities has drawn the attention of the countries in this region structural control is always introduced as one of the proposed solutions to prolong the service life and operation of all types of structures in 1992 kawano and venkataramana examined an analytical model of the jacket type offshore structure with passive tmd system under earthquake load with three different types of mass ratios kawano and venkataramana 1992 abdel rohman investigated the effect of tmd device on reduction of steel jacket platform s dynamic responses by active and passive methods against hydrodynamic loading abdel rohman 1996 wang et al introduced an optimum design method for tmd by considering energy concept in an offshore jacket platform under impact loading wang et al 2002 for a template offshore structure which was equipped with a mechanical damping device lee showed fifty percent reduction in responses in dealing with in line random wave forces lee 1997 golafshani and gholizad studied the performance of tmd with friction damper located on the jacket type structure golafshani and gholizad 2009 wu et al 2011 was among the first studies to use of semi active tuned mass damper satmd to reduce main deck responses of the offshore platform due to ice and seismic induced vibration karkoub et al studied the integration of mr magnetorheological dampers with tmd device in a spar platform to decrease the effect of the hydro dynamically induced forces karkoub et al 2011 more recently taghikhany et al evaluated the effectiveness of satmd on response of a steel jacket platform with h2 lqg linear quadratic gaussian algorithm when it was subjected to the earthquake action taghikhany et al 2013 for suppression of the oscillation of offshore platforms yajun and deyou used satmd with fuzzy logic controller under hydrodynamic loading yajun and deyou 2004 the inherent robustness of fuzzy controller and its ability to handle nonlinear behaviors were introduced to control responses of the offshore platform models by ji and yin studies ji and yin 2007 in other studies ji et al investigated the effectiveness of the satmd with fuzzy logic algorithm on responses of an offshore platform in the gulf of mexico ji et al 2010 li et al used the semi active method on an experimental model to validate the results of the numerical simulation the results indicated that the vibration amplitude of the simplified offshore platform is reduced tremendously with the mr damper performance under sea wave excitation li et al 2002 babaei et al compared time domain responses of a semi active tmd system with lqg control algorithm on the existing jacket platform under several types of ground acceleration records babaei et al 2016 park et al evaluated the impact of passive tmd and semi active tmd on a fixed bottom and a floating offshore wind turbine they improved the performance of the passive system by use of linear mr damper with an on off state damping control approach park et al 2019 in order to improve the effectiveness of the semi active control system on an existing steel jacket platform in the persian gulf region honarparast et al pondered whether adaptive particle swarm optimization apso algorithm for mr dampers could be worthwhile honarparast et al 2020 som and das designed semi active control algorithm and considered how numbers and positions of mr dampers have a major impact on reduction of offshore jacket platform dynamic responses after application of four known earthquake acceleration records therefore decentralized sliding mode controller to generate command voltage in association with clipped optimal structural control algorithm was used som and das 2018 all of the mentioned studies and their desired level of achievements in dynamic responses value reduction have further strengthened our confidence in using a smart tmd system although most studies have tended to focus on control methods and their validation they have failed to address the proper loading systems analysis methods and using purpose built equipment therefore many details appear to be unsupported some of the investigations cite the installed devices and instrumentations in lower water elevations which suffer from a plethora of pitfalls and they are neither feasible nor logical the results from such analyses should consequently be treated with the utmost caution this is a neglected area in the field of maritime structural control this paper outlines the efficiency of the tmd and satmd systems for a safe control of an offshore jacket platform in the persian gulf under dynamic loading effects to this end the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief overview of site characteristics and governing environmental conditions and a case study is presented section 3 looks at the ways of force application and begins by introducing the quasi static analysis section 4 focuses on selecting the time domain random analysis as an appropriate irregular waves method then after optimum design of the tmd and satmd systems with fuzzy logic controller an inverse model of mr damper inmr based on adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis design is introduced in section 5 in the following the performance target of control strategy on natural excitations i e wave wind sea current and ground motion is monitored and the structural responses are compared to each other whereby the stability of the control system is carried out some conclusions are drawn in the final section 2 a case study of offshore jacket platforms a case study of steel jacket platforms has six through the leg battered piles it belongs to the nasr complex dena oilfield which is located approximately 32 km southwest of the sirri island in the persian gulf the bed line elevation is 60 m below mean sea level and the main upper deck is located in 16 20 m above water surface the platform as shown in fig 1 is a wellhead drilling platform when some reasons have raised concerns over safety a detailed assessment which is fully justified by experiences would be indispensable our focus is on the following a the service life treatment and subsequent life extension plan of the platform b the addition of new facilities during operation c damages as a consequence of aging d design code requirements e evaluating the probable increase in environmental loads due to marine fouling changes in the hydrodynamic coefficients and improving metocean data accuracy 2 1 site characteristics the presented platform structure has been analyzed and assessed in accordance with the site characteristics no sign of subsidence has been reported and there is no significant scour visible in the underwater survey report table 1 presents site characteristics and assessment s assumptions conductors shielding and current blockage factors would be assumed equal to unity 2 2 governing environmental conditions the marine environment is the source of phenomena and it is necessary to know how and how often they occur contrary to the usual conditions these phenomena sometimes occur accidently with up to a ten year return period statistics and local data measurements are used as a basis for representation of the long term and short term metocean conditions relatively shallow water condition governs in the persian gulf mazaheri and ghaderi 2011 and in the absence of any fundamental information or site specific computational equations based on regional survey it is preferred to use a general approach with suitable coefficients which is adapted to the climate and the geography of the selected region and covers a wider area 3 static analysis a sufficiency of deterministic regular waves allowed for in place analysis structural members adequacy and quasi static response of the platform recommended practice dnv rp c205 2014 moreover the deterministic wave parameters i e water wavelength and corresponding water wave period water wave height and crest height are obtained through the use of statistical methods 3 1 water wave theory and wave force regular waves method the fifth order stokes finite amplitude wave theory is opted for the persian gulf sea conditions and platform s location because it is computationally efficient and includes closed form asymptotic expressions for both deep and shallow water limits considering the laboratory results and field measurements this wave theory forecasts kinematics and pressure much more efficiently compared to other nonlinear theories the water surface profile horizontal and vertical water particle

especially in the vertical direction is critical and could be up to ten times greater than wind force clauss et al 1992 equation 4 gives the wave force on a unit length of a vertical cylinder this is

inertia force and a d is the area per unit volume associates with the drag force fig 2 illustrates wave characteristics and wave force on a vertical circular cylinder 3 2 current force speed and direction profile of the total current vector sum of tidal circulatory and storm generated currents generate the extreme waves wave and current forces are calculated at a wave crest position which correspond to maximum base shear in orthogonal directions and maximum overturning moment in diagonal directions they are defined for eight directions by a 100 year return period 3 3 wind force the wind speed varies with time and height above sea surfaces like water wave loads wind loads have dynamical behavior but less contribution to global loads typically less than 10 wind speed shows almost static responses with some structures in relatively shallow waters wind load cases were considered in the minimum and maximum water depth for storm conditions and 1 h wind speed was used in the estimation the wind drag force on structure is calculated as 5 f w i n d ρ 2 u 2 c s a where f w i n d wind force n ρ air density 1 22 k g m 3 u wind speed m s c s shape coefficient and a area of

api rp 2a wsd 22nd recommends it by way of compensation for undesired effects when an inevitable difference happens between the orientation of the platform after installation and the position as planned api rp 2a wsd 2014 in this method the unit circle is divided into eight sections and it is traced counterclockwise as the angle of 120 the dominant wind direction increases in value each side of segments forms an angle of 45 fig 3 table 2 lists the available sirri regional data which explicitly assigns an associated wave period to each maximum storm wave height for different incident directions 4 dynamic analysis time domain since hydrodynamic load effects are nonlinear and could only be dealt with a time domain approach here we determined to use a wave model that includes all environmental action effects the model describes irregular and random characteristics of sea states in a time variant analysis time history methods of dynamic analysis involve numerical integration of the equations of motion with beneficial effects when wave responses of a platform structure are considered for instance monitoring the capability of higher order load effects overall measured sea wave spectra can be used for time history analysis of the structural dynamic responses 4 1 wave spectrum irregular waves method the irregular waves method is used to indicate sea states realistically several forms of wave energy spectra based on wind speed significant wave height wave period parameters and shape factors have been proposed aimed at describing the sea surface close to its shape in nature cem 2008 in current study the jonswap spectrum rewritten by goda 2000 is selected for its possibility of wave forecast by means of the wind speed parameter it can be modified to fit closely with the wave spectrum from the collected and filtered data by fast fourier transform fft approach in the persian gulf region mazaheri and ghaderi 2011 this equilibrium is an approximate form in terms of the parameters of wave height and period as follows 6 s f β j h 1 3 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 7 β j 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 1 094 0 01915 ln γ 8 t p t 1 3 1 0

and period other standard spectrum pierson moskowitz spectrum is provided to compare with jonswap spectrum in a 100 year wave storm condition h s 11 m t 10 5 s e c as the results of fig 4 the present structure is excited adjacent to the natural frequency see fig 5 by the largest sine wave with the crest position to acquire the maximum responses the significant wave height and dominant period correspond to the 100 year return period in sacs software to generate the random phase angles of the wave components five sequential equally spaced seeds are used 4 2 dynamic responses here the modal characteristics of the jacket platform are derived to compute time history responses and natural periods of the structure as an initial step fig 5 demonstrates the first four modes of vibration of the system as expected our model proves that the structure moves laterally by first and second dominant modes of vibration with the maximum value of natural period detailed observation of the third and fourth modes helps to weigh up a suitable control strategy and device s and sets the stage for the next step this means that the designed damping system should be activated after lateral displacement of the structure the time history surface profile under the effect of wave wind and sea current can be observed in fig 6 after application of the selected wave spectrum the generalized forces as a result of the water surface profile energy deploys to the platform as shown in this figure the derived heights of water surface from jonswap spectrum are higher than pierson moskowitz spectrum and consequently its effect on structural responses would be more severe lateral displacement and velocity of designated joints in the main deck are considered as related parameters to the service life of this structure comparison of the lateral displacement with the allowable provisions in aisc code aisc 360 16 indicates that the structure can barely cover the acceptable range table 3 4 3 dynamic condensation of the model in this stage the stiffness and mass matrix of the system should be extracted to use in the control of structure however the size of these matrices and the time of analysis have negative influences on online control of the system for this reason dynamic condensation of the model is taken into account removing unnecessary degrees of freedom from the model we used the craig bampton method craig and bampton 1968 to assign only the effective natural modes here forty five modes of vibration and considering the interior dofs degrees of freedom of the sub structure the accuracy of craig bampton method is controlled to construct the transformation to generate the simple stiffness and mass matrices and applied force we have 11 m r t m r k r t k r a n d f r t f mass stiffness and damping of jacket structure model without control facilities are square matrices of order 396 to prevent running a protracted simulation hankel norm approximation method gawronski 2004 could be usefully employed and it is helpful to reduce the dimension of dynamic properties matrices afterwards all large scale matrices were reduced to a 24 dofs model 5 vibration control methods of the jacket platform offshore structures in the long term are vulnerable to natural phenomena and their dynamic excitations and the structural control strategies can give a novel solution to maintain their service for longer periods the large magnitude of hydrodynamic forces and consequently high order nonlinear responses are two specific features in loading and response of marine structures that should be considered prior to using the control system general vibration control methods can be divided into passive active semi active and hybrid systems ou et al 2007 the most common vibration control mechanisms are developed into stiffening damping and isolation stiffening comprises shifting the resonance frequency of the structure outside the limit of the frequency band of excitation damping involves of reduction in the resonance peaks by the vibration energy dissipation isolation is a way to help avoid propagation of disturbances to sensitive parts of the systems tuned mass damper as a passive vibration absorber is composed of a mass a spring and a viscous damper mechanism that dissipates energy demand on structures tmd is a feasible approach to suppress vibration of seismic and environmental loading however under an extreme dynamic excitement or severe weather conditions the property of steel elements is changed and by variation of structural stiffness tmd becomes out of tune and its performance is mitigated therefore in spite of the mentioned advantages tmd causes unwanted additional loads on the structure one of the most common solutions to overcome shortcomings and disadvantages of passive devices is using a smart damper semi active tuned mass damper satmd has an inherent stability and ease of installation and provides high reliability to adjust its tuning capability in real time for a fraction of a second for this reason before all else first we require an optimal design of the passive tmd then implementing a smart damper by exploiting a control algorithm 5 1 tuned mass damper passive device the accuracy of how the natural frequency of the tmd shifts to the natural frequency of the structure has long been bound up with performance of the tmd primary investigations on undamped sdof single degree of freedom structures have led to derive formulation for the optimum values of the tmd parameters optimum frequency ratio f o p t and optimum damping ratio ξ d o p t significantly results in den hartog hartog and p 1956 warburton warburton 1982 and sadek et al sadek et al 1997 studies in spite of acceptable results of tmd application in the determinate periodic loading conditions such as high rise building against wind blowing there are considerable drawbacks it is mainly because tuned mass devices have limited performance capabilities to suppress a wide range of exciting responses here the proposed formulation of sadek et al sadek et al 1997 is used to construct a classical damping matrix and obtain tmd parameters tuning ratio f and damping ratio ξ for the selected offshore platform as follows 12 f 1 1 μ 1 β μ 1 μ 13 ξ β 1 μ μ 1 μ the ratio of the fundamental frequency of the tmd ω t to that of the platform ω 0 defines as the tuning ratio f ω t ω 0 the mass ratio is μ m m where m and m are the mass of the vibration absorber and the total mass matrices of the platform respectively is the amplitude of the mode shape at the tmd location β is the damping ratio of the platform the opted values for this study and all assumptions are summarized in table 4 first and second vibration modes angular frequencies ω 1 ω 2 result from dynamic analysis of the jacket platform according to the api rp 2a wsd 22nd api rp 2a wsd 2014 recommendation for structural modeling we used damping value of 2 of critical for extreme wave analyses 5 2 semi active tuned mass damper satmd the semi active control system contains passive energy dissipation devices with tunable properties stiffness and damping that can vary with little power source up to tens of watts has become a common tool in many vibration control applications for large and medium amplitudes of responses the operation of a semi active control system typically demands external power sources and employs the structural movement to develop control force thenozhi and yu 2013 it gains the benefits of both active and passive devices semi active methods or passive tunable systems focus on stiffness or damping as tunable parameters of structures to succeed in vibration control approaches 5 3 mr damper modeling description as described in satmd the generated force of the smart variable damper is controlled by a fuzzy logic algorithm based on recorded acceleration on main deck at level 16 20 m above lat 76 20 m above mudline elevation and it uses target voltage to drive mr damper a forward model of the mr damper application part it is impossible to substitute a controller for the forward model of the mr damper fmr through nonlinear dynamics damper force is modeled by using the modified bouc wen model see fig 7 as follow sarrafan et al 2012 the generated force of damper is modeled by following equations 14 f α z c 0 x y k 0 x y k 1 x x 0 15 c 1 y α z k 0 x y c 0 x y where variable z is governed by 16 z γ x y z z n 1 β x y z n a x y solving 15 for y results in 17 y 1 c 0 c 1 α z c 0 x k 0 x y where 18 α α u α a α b u 19 c 1 c 1 u c 1 a c 1 b u 20 c 0 c 0 u c 0 a c 0 b u the parameters in above equations a η n β γ α b α a x 0 k 1 c 1 b c 1 a k 0 c 0 b and c 0 a have been explained in salehi et al 2014 when the u results first order filter then 21 u η u v b inverse model of the mr damper modeling part in contrast with what was the parametric procedure to calculate the control force in the forward approach the inverse modeling technique is chosen to control the damping force accurately by predicting the target voltage the inmr is designed primarily with anfis the results of the non parametric inmr model show that the predicted damping force could accurately pursue the desired damping force lin and chen 2016 5 4 locating energy dissipation devices the intersections of the piles and the levels of the platform make specific six joints at each elevation with direct effect on modeling and dynamic analysis the mass matrix of the model including fluid added mass is assigned to those joints and value reduction in responses generally outperforms other efforts in consistent mass assignment therefore the tmd system should be installed in one of the mentioned points on the main deck design should include the symmetry of mass distribution and extreme caution must be taken to prevent disruptions to the operational process while the drilling is in progress fig 8 depicts schematically the applied forces and satmd controlling system on the jacket platform it shows the assumed position of tmd mass mr dampers and physical place of instrumentations accelerometer on the main deck sensors accelerometer are used for either sensing movement at the top of the structure and to transmit a control signal via controller or measuring the structural response 5 5 equation of motion generalized model now the dynamic equation of the large scale offshore structure with semi active controller in state space form is presented as follow 22 z a z b u u m r b r u r y c z d u m r 23 a 0 n n i n n m

are mass stiffness and damping matrices respectively b u is the input control force matrix and b r is the input excitement force matrix c is the output matrix and d is the feedforward transfer matrix γ is the location vector for control force produced by mr dampers and δ is the excitement vector the plant state vector is denoted z t and x t x t and x t are the lateral displacement velocity and acceleration vectors of the designated joints relative to the initial position respectively the output of the state representation of the model consists of the sensor vector for feedback purposes it is of paramount importance to select the actuators here fmr first and consequently to establish the sensors location to attain collocated control system at hand for the purpose of structural response monitoring accelerometers are used to register though accelerations are not state variables of the state space model and the standard model of the structure consists of displacement and velocity variables in addition the output equation cannot just be y c z to represent the output with a linear combination of nodal accelerations we have 28 y c a x t the equation 28 is not a portion of the state vector z t nevertheless it is a part of the state derivative to express the acceleration output through the state derivative with combination of 27 and 28 we obtain 29 y 0 c a z t using z t from 22 we arrive at 30 y 0 c a a z 0 c a b u 31 y c a m 1 k c a m 1 c d c z c a m 1 γ u m r c a m 1 δ u r d in the end in concise notation 32 y c z d u equation 32 is the output equation of the state space representation of the structure with acceleration output where c c a m 1 k m 1 c d d c a m 1 γ and c a is the accelerometer location matrix the second portion of feedforward matrix is zero because the accelerometer location matrix c a and the excitation force vector δ are orthogonal with respect to inverse mass matrix gawronski 2004 5 6 control algorithm fuzzy logic controller in this step we have proposed an intelligent control scheme that rests entirely on the time history responses of the structure to make it more responsive pragmatic approach to tackle uncertain parameters is the pivot on why a controller should be singled out for working with disturbances considering other pros and cons the appropriate control system is utilized to address the tradeoff between the high performance and less control cost control methods such as lqr linear quadratic regulator and lqg linear quadratic gaussian enhance certain aspects of controlling linear systems and make great demand on instrumentations at every elevation of the structure they require the optimal location of sensors and devices to perform desirably cha et al 2012 despite the almost 20 percent of the case study of the jacket platform is easily accessible by elevation above mean sea level scientists prefer to integrate the pid proportional integral derivative controller with other algorithms to develop insight into the system identification fuzzy logic theory is an auspicious solution to cope with the nonlinearity and uncertainty that happen in real experiences in other words uncertainty of input data is treated in an easier method by fuzzy logic control systems this theory was developed by zadeh 1965 in 1965 simple inference rules instead of a computational classic model and low solution cost a firm grasp of some basic mathematical concepts is considered dispensable nonlinear mapping capability map an input space to an output space and simulated model adaptation to the actual model are the main advantages in utilizing a fuzzy control algorithm the fuzzy logic control flc design entails input and output variables membership functions rule base design and composes of fuzzifier decision maker and defuzzifier fuzzy set theory characterizes transformation from input to output as the inference engine which is the central part of a fuzzy control system it seems reasonable to assume that the conventional fuzzy controller mamdani type fuzzy control as a feedback controller is a multi input single output miso prototype to replicate its ability to tackle the multi excitation forces with irregular nature the closed loop block diagram of the proposed control system is shown in fig 9 a membership function here the membership functions of input data including the main deck s velocity and displacement and output data applied force are selected the controller takes the information about the plant s state from sensors lateral displacement and velocity are measured indirectly from acceleration data acquisition section 5 4 the fuzzy linguistic values nl nm ns zo ps pm and pl correspond to negative large negative medium negative small zero positive small positive medium and positive large respectively which are portrayed in fig 10 variable data are normalized in the range of 1 1 and the input membership functions for the second part are trained with anfis in the second section of the modeling part subsystem the output membership functions specify the range of changes in target voltage which at the end is an input for the fmr fig 11 presents schemes for inmr membership functions b rule base the if then heuristic rules contain knowledge base information to infer new control signals defuzzification produces the desired outputs and the inmr runs on predicted force acceleration and time series velocity on the other hand two parts of the control subsystem can be merged together and the values of the velocity and displacement would bring about the command voltage proportionally table 5 the oscillating amplitude of the applied voltage and the corresponding time history control force of the mr damper are shown in fig 12 the amplitude of the applied voltage varies from zero to 4 v during simulation time under the environmental loading 5 7 stability of the control system until fairly recently the issue of the stability of the closed loop fuzzy control method is often criticized we have employed any means to condense the full scale model of the jacket platform into a reduced dofs model although each applied condensation method has been perceived to be more accurate and stable the stability of the controller should be inspected specifically after size reduction and during the simulation the ordinary lyapunov function is the main criterion for the stability of a mathematical based control system whereas fuzzy controller cannot be approximated by any dynamic equation to make the stability analysis possible through a mathematical solution with regard to nonlinearity and time variance complexity of a model free system takes a turn for the worse in fact the fuzzy controller does not support internal memory the input components are only available for an instant to generate output estimates and time delay causes instability in the system whenever the loop gain exceeds unity and in case of the loop phase shift is greater than 180 there is a potential to cause a problem of stability in a closed loop control system finally the closed loop control system turns out to be a positive feedback along with an extreme extra vibration shaw 1998 the most important limitation lies in the fact that there are no feasible approved guidelines with stability analytical techniques and if so it is plausible that a nonlinear system might be stable for one type of input signal and unstable for another there is no guarantee that a satisfactory design is obtained in every case the matter of the stability of the control systems is a wide topic and we do not pretend to cover it in this small subsection the results are aimed at summarizing the foregoing discussions now we proceed to introduce the concept of the dissipative system the notion of dissipativity is based on fundamental laws of physics these systems dissipate the energy and there is a close connection between positive real transfer functions and dissipative systems applied to a nonlinear system although non passive systems are not always unstable the passivity framework substantiates robust stability for a variety of models for the laplace transform of the equation of the motion gawronski 2004 preumont 2018 and brogliato et al 2020 31 m s 2 d s k x s f s the transfer function is 32 g s s m s 2 d s k for all ω and s j ω the transfer function is stable if g j ω has no pole in r e j ω 0 g j ω is real for all positive real s 33 g j ω 90 r e g j ω 0 the stability of the control system is illustrated in fig 13 where the nyquist diagram of a positive real transfer function and the bode plot of phase angle are shown the nyquist curve does not enclose the critical point and we have a closed loop stable system observing the system response s and its variables are recommended in order to validate stability of the system likewise being aware that the stability cannot be inferred from performance gawronski 2004 in order to put an accurate interpretation on the results an applied time history acceleration of a seismic event is a major contributor to environmental loading to cover all aspects of the response monitoring accordingly the results of both types of loading emphasize the validity of our control system in the state of stability as an alternative method usually to test the performance of a memoryless control system when the plant gets an intentional shock the controller would be examined to overcome unsatisfactory perturbations furthermore several design iterations are required before a satisfactory result is obtained although in this present case study to raise the matter of the stability it seems to be somewhat redundant evaluating the performance of the controller by application of external disturbance owing to the concept of random and non harmonic loading 5 8 comparison of the platform s response reduction a time history responses under environmental loading herein the effects of tmd and satmd are compared in value reduction of the main deck responses including lateral displacement velocity acceleration base shear and overturning moment figs 14 and 15 show the main deck lateral deflection and the velocity under the time history environmental loads in three conditions i uncontrolled ii with tmd iii with satmd the result indicates that the application of satmd with fuzzy logic algorithm reduces almost 40 percent of the maximum deflection values and almost 15 percent of the maximum velocity values compared to an uncontrolled system table 6 summarizes maximum values in figs 14 and 15 it provides a basis for comparison of control methods performance on lateral relative displacement and relative velocity respectively it is observed that the tmd device has brought a significant mitigation of the main deck s velocity values more effective than the satmd system a possible explanation for almost 50 percent value reduction may be that the dominant vibration mode of the structure is commonly assumed constant in linear simulation clearly there may be other possible explanations in the absence of special equipment increasing self weight of the structure is the only way to increase the resisting moment which certainly would raise the base shear unsatisfactorily due largely to the acceleration of the incoming excitement despite the fact that foundation piles have penetrated to the depth of 90 m under the mudline elevation through the legs of the jacket platform sliding and overturning control do not remain crucial unless they are allowed to reach axial capacity or develop plastic behavior as observed in figs 16 and 17 the efficiency of the tmd value reduction in base shear and overturning moment responses is negligible however semi active controller decreases the values of the base shear and overturning moment around 90 percent and it considerably reduces the risk of fatigue failure in structural components and improves the life cycle of the jacket platform b time history responses under seismic loading since seabed motions are of significance and the jacket platform is installed in one of seismically active areas it has the merit of brief consideration the api rp 2eq 1st ansi api recommended practice 2eq 2014 recommends using nonlinear time history procedures when energy dissipation devices are employed to represent the efficiency and capability of both control systems in reducing dynamic responses under seismic motion figs 18 and 19 pinpoint the time history responses of the structure under the strongest earthquake acceleration record occurred in 2005 near the qeshm island iran strong motion network 2020 the pga peak ground acceleration of this record in the suza station the closest seismograph station was 319 c m s 2 the peak ground accelerations in the area of the studied field are summarized in table 7 after application of acceleration quantities to excite the structure in simulation computer program we used continues time integration of signal operator to gain velocity and displacement actually time history velocities and displacements are obtained from integration and double integration of the time history acceleration respectively note that initial velocity and displacement are assumed to be zero although that is beyond the scope of this paper velocity and displacement might not contain the same information of the acceleration record therefore it is generally assumed that the processed histories of ground acceleration velocity and displacement are compatible with one another in comparison with tmd and uncontrolled structure figs 18 and 19 delineate the superiority of semi active controller in seismic response reduction of the main deck it helps to prevent possible nonlinear behavior of structural elements and reduces the seismic failure risk of the jacket platform as shown in figs 20 and 21 it is clarified how control strategies would mitigate base shear and overturning moment results after base driven approach time history earthquake base shear and overturning moment are mainly affected by the first vibration mode of the structure and the results validate the efficacy of tmd and satmd in controlling the main mode of vibration it is noteworthy to mention that there is a possibility of controlling higher mode effects by increase in use of the sensors in satmd device application 6 conclusion in this study the conduct of passive and semi active tuned mass damper tmd satmd under the environmental and seismic dynamic loading were investigated it is essentially an attempt to put modern theories into practice and proposing a framework for further research to prolong the service life of a fixed offshore structure the study has gone some way towards enhancing our understanding of smart control limitations and the following results were obtained 1 the tmd system reduces the primary concern of lateral displacement to less than 20 percent and velocity to less than 30 percent under several governing loadings 2 the satmd system was found to be reasonably reliable and the main deck of the jacket platform led to more than 40 percent reduction in lateral displacement and velocity values 3 whilst satmd decreases the base shear and the overturning moment values by around 90 percent the effect of tmd is negligible it considerably reduces the risk of fatigue failure in structural components and improves the life cycle of the jacket platform 4 the time history responses of the structure under the strongest record of earthquake in 2005 near the qeshm island show the superiority of the semi active controller in reducing seismic responses of the main deck compared with the tmd it helps to prevent possible nonlinear behavior of structural elements and reduces the seismic failure risk of the jacket platform 5 the control loop keeps the velocity and displacement of the main deck at its set point despite applied disturbances and it is robust with respect to changing system parameters 6 the study of online control equipment in the marine environment is a highly challenging issue when it fails to account for high maintenance costs severe corrosion conditions sea state and the elevations under the mean sea level which are relatively inaccessible to install energy dissipation devices it is recommended that further research should be undertaken in implementation constraints on controller placement 7 in state of non collocated control systems in case of extremely light damping instability is inevitable damping augmentation helps the feedback control performance and robustness declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

20258,the present study investigates the dynamic responses of offshore jacket platforms using a passive and semi active tuned mass damper tmd satmd where the control action is achieved by a fuzzy logic controller flc under environmental i e wind water waves sea currents and seismic loadings since the studied structure failed to meet recent codes requirements adequately the suppressing effect

environmental loading seismic loading semi active control inverse dynamic model dynamic time history analysis 1 introduction over the past few decades and influenced by the recent advances in science and technology traditional uses of the oceans have been expanded to include other emerging uses such as the extraction of hydrocarbons and minerals patel 1989 to meet an increasing demand for maritime sources of energy and minerals in recent years the researchers have put more effort into offshore platforms the offshore platforms have been categorized into fixed and floating types each with their particular purposes and configurations design of structures fatigue and structural analyses and reliability assessment are of high practical interests for all steel structures under cyclic loadings in particular offshore platforms located in a very tough ocean environment over a long period of time are inevitably subjected to severe environmental loads such as waves winds ice sea currents fluid flow and ground motions zhang et al 2019 consequently they undergo excessive vibrations causing disruption to the platform operation process as the most pressing problem facing the structure fatigue failure of joints uneconomical operation and discomfort of personnel reduction of the vibration amplitude of an offshore platform by 15 is expected to increase the service life by two times and may lead to decreasing maintenance and inspection of structures lin et al 2017 thus it is of considerable significance to find appropriate methods to reduce the effect of different types of excitement which are applied to offshore platforms and carry out comprehensive surveys of vibration control for offshore structures kandasamy et al 2016 oil and gas companies have renewed their interests in discovering drilling and extracting offshore hydrocarbons from shared oil fields in the persian gulf therefore the use of various efficient methods to provide maintenance service of structures and facilities has drawn the attention of the countries in this region structural control is always introduced as one of the proposed solutions to prolong the service life and operation of all types of structures in 1992 kawano and venkataramana examined an analytical model of the jacket type offshore structure with passive tmd system under earthquake load with three different types of mass ratios kawano and venkataramana 1992 abdel rohman investigated the effect of tmd device on reduction of steel jacket platform s dynamic responses by active and passive methods against hydrodynamic loading abdel rohman 1996 wang et al introduced an optimum design method for tmd by considering energy concept in an offshore jacket platform under impact loading wang et al 2002 for a template offshore structure which was equipped with a mechanical damping device lee showed fifty percent reduction in responses in dealing with in line random wave forces lee 1997 golafshani and gholizad studied the performance of tmd with friction damper located on the jacket type structure golafshani and gholizad 2009 wu et al 2011 was among the first studies to use of semi active tuned mass damper satmd to reduce main deck responses of the offshore platform due to ice and seismic induced vibration karkoub et al studied the integration of mr magnetorheological dampers with tmd device in a spar platform to decrease the effect of the hydro dynamically induced forces karkoub et al 2011 more recently taghikhany et al evaluated the effectiveness of satmd on response of a steel jacket platform with h2 lqg linear quadratic gaussian algorithm when it was subjected to the earthquake action taghikhany et al 2013 for suppression of the oscillation of offshore platforms yajun and deyou used satmd with fuzzy logic controller under hydrodynamic loading yajun and deyou 2004 the inherent robustness of fuzzy controller and its ability to handle nonlinear behaviors were introduced to control responses of the offshore platform models by ji and yin studies ji and yin 2007 in other studies ji et al investigated the effectiveness of the satmd with fuzzy logic algorithm on responses of an offshore platform in the gulf of mexico ji et al 2010 li et al used the semi active method on an experimental model to validate the results of the numerical simulation the results indicated that the vibration amplitude of the simplified offshore platform is reduced tremendously with the mr damper performance under sea wave excitation li et al 2002 babaei et al compared time domain responses of a semi active tmd system with lqg control algorithm on the existing jacket platform under several types of ground acceleration records babaei et al 2016 park et al evaluated the impact of passive tmd and semi active tmd on a fixed bottom and a floating offshore wind turbine they improved the performance of the passive system by use of linear mr damper with an on off state damping control approach park et al 2019 in order to improve the effectiveness of the semi active control system on an existing steel jacket platform in the persian gulf region honarparast et al pondered whether adaptive particle swarm optimization apso algorithm for mr dampers could be worthwhile honarparast et al 2020 som and das designed semi active control algorithm and considered how numbers and positions of mr dampers have a major impact on reduction of offshore jacket platform dynamic responses after application of four known earthquake acceleration records therefore decentralized sliding mode controller to generate command voltage in association with clipped optimal structural control algorithm was used som and das 2018 all of the mentioned studies and their desired level of achievements in dynamic responses value reduction have further strengthened our confidence in using a smart tmd system although most studies have tended to focus on control methods and their validation they have failed to address the proper loading systems analysis methods and using purpose built equipment therefore many details appear to be unsupported some of the investigations cite the installed devices and instrumentations in lower water elevations which suffer from a plethora of pitfalls and they are neither feasible nor logical the results from such analyses should consequently be treated with the utmost caution this is a neglected area in the field of maritime structural control this paper outlines the efficiency of the tmd and satmd systems for a safe control of an offshore jacket platform in the persian gulf under dynamic loading effects to this end the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief overview of site characteristics and governing environmental conditions and a case study is presented section 3 looks at the ways of force application and begins by introducing the quasi static analysis section 4 focuses on selecting the time domain random analysis as an appropriate irregular waves method then after optimum design of the tmd and satmd systems with fuzzy logic controller an inverse model of mr damper inmr based on adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis design is introduced in section 5 in the following the performance target of control strategy on natural excitations i e wave wind sea current and ground motion is monitored and the structural responses are compared to each other whereby the stability of the control system is carried out some conclusions are drawn in the final section 2 a case study of offshore jacket platforms a case study of steel jacket platforms has six through the leg battered piles it belongs to the nasr complex dena oilfield which is located approximately 32 km southwest of the sirri island in the persian gulf the bed line elevation is 60 m below mean sea level and the main upper deck is located in 16 20 m above water surface the platform as shown in fig 1 is a wellhead drilling platform when some reasons have raised concerns over safety a detailed assessment which is fully justified by experiences would be indispensable our focus is on the following a the service life treatment and subsequent life extension plan of the platform b the addition of new facilities during operation c damages as a consequence of aging d design code requirements e evaluating the probable increase in environmental loads due to marine fouling changes in the hydrodynamic coefficients and improving metocean data accuracy 2 1 site characteristics the presented platform structure has been analyzed and assessed in accordance with the site characteristics no sign of subsidence has been reported and there is no significant scour visible in the underwater survey report table 1 presents site characteristics and assessment s assumptions conductors shielding and current blockage factors would be assumed equal to unity 2 2 governing environmental conditions the marine environment is the source of phenomena and it is necessary to know how and how often they occur contrary to the usual conditions these phenomena sometimes occur accidently with up to a ten year return period statistics and local data measurements are used as a basis for representation of the long term and short term metocean conditions relatively shallow water condition governs in the persian gulf mazaheri and ghaderi 2011 and in the absence of any fundamental information or site specific computational equations based on regional survey it is preferred to use a general approach with suitable coefficients which is adapted to the climate and the geography of the selected region and covers a wider area 3 static analysis a sufficiency of deterministic regular waves allowed for in place analysis structural members adequacy and quasi static response of the platform recommended practice dnv rp c205 2014 moreover the deterministic wave parameters i e water wavelength and corresponding water wave period water wave height and crest height are obtained through the use of statistical methods 3 1 water wave theory and wave force regular waves method the fifth order stokes finite amplitude wave theory is opted for the persian gulf sea conditions and platform s location because it is computationally efficient and includes closed form asymptotic expressions for both deep and shallow water limits considering the laboratory results and field measurements this wave theory forecasts kinematics and pressure much more efficiently compared to other nonlinear theories the water surface profile horizontal and vertical water particle

especially in the vertical direction is critical and could be up to ten times greater than wind force clauss et al 1992 equation 4 gives the wave force on a unit length of a vertical cylinder this is

direction profile of the total current vector sum of tidal circulatory and storm generated currents generate the extreme waves wave and current forces are calculated at a wave crest position which correspond to maximum base shear in orthogonal directions and maximum overturning moment in diagonal directions they are defined for eight directions by a 100 year return period 3 3 wind force the wind speed varies with time and height above sea surfaces like water wave loads wind loads have dynamical behavior but less contribution to global loads typically less than 10 wind speed shows almost static responses with some structures in relatively shallow waters wind load cases were considered in the minimum and maximum water depth for storm conditions and 1 h wind speed was used in the

api rp 2a wsd 22nd recommends it by way of compensation for undesired effects when an inevitable difference happens between the orientation of the platform after installation and the position as planned api rp 2a wsd 2014 in this method the unit circle is divided into eight sections and it is traced counterclockwise as the angle of 120 the dominant wind direction increases in value each side of segments forms an angle of 45 fig 3 table 2 lists the available sirri regional data which explicitly assigns an associated wave period to each maximum storm wave height for different incident directions 4 dynamic analysis time domain since hydrodynamic load effects are nonlinear and could only be dealt with a time domain approach here we determined to use a wave model that includes all environmental action effects the model describes irregular and random characteristics of sea states in a time variant analysis time history methods of dynamic analysis involve numerical integration of the equations of motion with beneficial effects when wave responses of a platform structure are considered for instance monitoring the capability of higher order load effects overall measured sea wave spectra can be used for time history analysis of the structural dynamic responses 4 1 wave spectrum irregular waves method the irregular waves method is used to indicate sea states realistically several forms of wave energy spectra based on wind speed significant wave height wave period parameters and shape factors have been proposed aimed at describing the sea surface close to its shape in nature cem 2008 in current study the jonswap spectrum rewritten by goda 2000 is selected for its possibility of wave forecast by means of the wind speed parameter it can be modified to fit closely with the wave spectrum from the collected and filtered data by fast fourier transform fft approach in the persian gulf region mazaheri and ghaderi 2011 this equilibrium is an approximate form in terms

structure is excited adjacent to the natural frequency see fig 5 by the largest sine wave with the crest position to acquire the maximum responses the significant wave height and dominant period correspond to the 100 year return period in sacs software to generate the random phase angles of the wave components five sequential equally spaced seeds are used 4 2 dynamic responses here the modal characteristics of the jacket platform are derived to compute time history responses and natural periods of the structure as an initial step fig 5 demonstrates the first four modes of vibration of the system as expected our model proves that the structure moves laterally by first and second dominant modes of vibration with the maximum value of natural period detailed observation of the third and fourth modes helps to weigh up a suitable control strategy and device s and sets the stage for the next step this means that the designed damping system should be activated after lateral displacement of the structure the time history surface profile under the effect of wave wind and sea current can be observed in fig 6 after application of the selected wave spectrum the generalized forces as a result of the water surface profile energy deploys to the platform as shown in this figure the derived heights of water surface from jonswap spectrum are higher than pierson moskowitz spectrum and consequently its effect on structural responses would be more severe lateral displacement and velocity of designated joints in the main deck are considered as related parameters to the service life of this structure comparison of the lateral displacement with the allowable provisions in aisc code aisc 360 16 indicates that the structure can barely cover the acceptable range table 3 4 3 dynamic condensation of the model in this stage the stiffness and mass matrix of the system should be extracted to use in the control of structure however the size of these matrices and the time of analysis have negative influences on online control of the system for this reason dynamic condensation of the model is taken into account removing unnecessary degrees of freedom from the model we used the craig bampton method craig and bampton 1968 to assign only the effective natural modes here forty five modes of vibration and considering the interior dofs degrees of freedom of the sub structure the accuracy of craig bampton method is controlled to construct the transformation to generate the simple stiffness and mass matrices and applied force we have 11 m r t m r k r t k r a n d f r t f mass stiffness and damping of jacket structure model without control facilities are square matrices of order 396 to prevent running a protracted simulation hankel norm approximation method gawronski 2004 could be usefully employed and it is helpful to reduce the dimension of dynamic properties matrices afterwards all large scale matrices were reduced to a 24 dofs model 5 vibration control methods of the jacket platform offshore structures in the long term are vulnerable to natural phenomena and their dynamic excitations and the structural control strategies can give a novel solution to maintain their service for longer periods the large magnitude of hydrodynamic forces and consequently high order nonlinear responses are two specific features in loading and response of marine structures that should be considered prior to using the control system general vibration control methods can be divided into passive active semi active and hybrid systems ou et al 2007 the most common vibration control mechanisms are developed into stiffening damping and isolation stiffening comprises shifting the resonance frequency of the structure outside the limit of the frequency band of excitation damping involves of reduction in the resonance peaks by the vibration energy dissipation isolation is a way to help avoid propagation of disturbances to sensitive parts of the systems tuned mass damper as a passive vibration absorber is composed of a mass a spring and a viscous damper mechanism that dissipates energy demand on structures tmd is a feasible approach to suppress vibration of seismic and environmental loading however under an extreme dynamic excitement or severe weather conditions the property of steel elements is changed and by variation of structural stiffness tmd becomes out of tune and its performance is mitigated therefore in spite of the mentioned advantages tmd causes unwanted additional loads on the structure one of the most common solutions to overcome shortcomings and disadvantages of passive devices is using a smart damper semi active tuned mass damper satmd has an inherent stability and ease of installation and provides high reliability to adjust its tuning capability in real time for a fraction of a second for this reason before all else first we require an optimal design of the passive tmd then implementing a smart damper by exploiting a control algorithm 5 1 tuned mass damper passive device the accuracy of how the natural frequency of the tmd shifts to the natural frequency of the structure has long been bound up with performance of the tmd primary investigations on undamped sdof single degree of freedom structures have led to derive formulation for the optimum values of the tmd parameters optimum frequency ratio f o p t and optimum damping ratio ξ d o p t significantly results in den hartog hartog and p 1956 warburton warburton 1982 and sadek et al sadek et al 1997 studies in spite of acceptable results of tmd application in the determinate periodic loading conditions such as high rise building against wind blowing there are considerable drawbacks it is mainly because tuned mass devices have limited performance capabilities to suppress a wide range of exciting responses here the proposed formulation of sadek et al sadek et al 1997 is used to construct a classical damping matrix and obtain tmd parameters tuning ratio f and damping ratio ξ for the selected offshore platform as follows 12 f 1 1 μ 1 β μ 1 μ 13 ξ β 1 μ μ 1 μ the ratio of the fundamental frequency of the tmd ω t to that of the platform ω 0 defines as the tuning ratio f ω t ω 0 the mass ratio is μ m m where m and m are the mass of the vibration absorber and the total mass matrices of the platform respectively is the amplitude of the mode shape at the tmd location β is the damping ratio of the platform the opted values for this study and all assumptions are summarized in table 4 first and second vibration modes angular frequencies ω 1 ω 2 result from dynamic analysis of the jacket platform according to the api rp 2a wsd 22nd api rp 2a wsd 2014 recommendation for structural modeling we used damping value of 2 of critical for extreme wave analyses 5 2 semi active tuned mass damper satmd the semi active control system contains passive energy dissipation devices with tunable properties stiffness and damping that can vary with little power source up to tens of watts has become a common tool in many vibration control applications for large and medium amplitudes of responses the operation of a semi active control system typically demands external power sources and employs the structural movement to develop control force thenozhi and yu 2013 it gains the benefits of both active and passive devices semi active methods or passive tunable systems focus on stiffness or damping as tunable parameters of structures to succeed in vibration control approaches 5 3 mr damper modeling description as described in satmd the generated force of the smart variable damper is controlled by a fuzzy logic algorithm based on recorded acceleration on main deck at level 16 20 m above lat 76 20 m above mudline elevation and it uses target voltage to drive mr damper a forward model of the mr damper application part it is impossible to substitute a controller for the forward model of the mr damper fmr through nonlinear dynamics damper force is modeled by using the modified bouc wen model see fig 7 as follow sarrafan et al 2012 the generated force of damper is modeled by following equations 14 f α z c 0 x y k 0 x y k 1 x x 0 15 c 1 y α z k 0 x y c 0 x y where variable z is governed by 16 z γ x y z z n 1 β x y z n a x y solving 15 for y results in 17 y 1 c 0 c 1 α z c 0 x k 0 x y where 18 α α u α a α b u 19 c 1 c 1 u c 1 a c 1 b u 20 c 0 c 0 u c 0 a c 0 b u the parameters in above equations a η n β γ α b α a x 0 k 1 c 1 b c 1 a k 0 c 0 b and c 0 a have been explained in salehi et al 2014 when the u results first order filter then 21 u η u v b inverse model of the mr damper modeling part in contrast with what was the parametric procedure to calculate the control force in the forward approach the inverse modeling technique is chosen to control the damping force accurately by predicting the target voltage the inmr is designed primarily with anfis the results of the non parametric inmr model show that the predicted damping force could accurately pursue the desired damping force lin and chen 2016 5 4 locating energy dissipation devices the intersections of the piles and the levels of the platform make specific six joints at each elevation with direct effect on modeling and dynamic analysis the mass matrix of the model including fluid added mass is assigned to those joints and value reduction in responses generally outperforms other efforts in consistent mass assignment therefore the tmd system should be installed in one of the mentioned points on the main deck design should include the symmetry of mass distribution and extreme caution must be taken to prevent disruptions to the operational process while the drilling is in progress fig 8 depicts schematically the applied forces and satmd controlling system on the jacket platform it shows the assumed position of tmd mass mr dampers and physical place of instrumentations accelerometer on the main deck sensors accelerometer are used for either sensing movement at the top of the structure and to transmit a control signal via controller or measuring the structural response 5 5 equation of motion generalized model now the dynamic equation of the large scale offshore structure with semi active controller in state space form is presented as follow 22 z a z b u u m r b r u r y c z d u m r 23 a 0 n n i n n m

are mass stiffness and damping matrices respectively b u is the input control force matrix and b r is the input excitement force matrix c is the output matrix and d is the feedforward transfer matrix γ is the location vector for control force produced by mr dampers and δ is the excitement vector the plant state vector is denoted z t and x t x t and x t are the lateral displacement velocity and acceleration vectors of the designated joints relative to the initial position respectively the output of the state representation of the model consists of the sensor vector for feedback purposes it is of paramount importance to select the actuators here fmr first and consequently to establish the sensors location to attain collocated control system at hand for the purpose of structural response monitoring accelerometers are used to register though accelerations are not state variables of the state space model and the standard model of the structure consists of displacement and velocity variables in addition the output equation cannot just be y c z to represent the output with a linear combination of nodal accelerations we have 28 y c a x t the equation 28 is not a portion of the state vector z t nevertheless it is a part of the state derivative to express the acceleration output through the state derivative with combination of 27 and 28 we obtain 29 y 0 c a z t using z t from 22 we arrive at 30 y 0 c a a z 0 c a b u 31 y c a m 1 k c a m 1 c d c z c a m 1 γ u m r c a m 1 δ u r d in the end in concise notation 32 y c z d u equation 32 is the output equation of the state space representation of the structure with acceleration output where c c a m 1 k m 1 c d d c a m 1 γ and c a is the accelerometer location matrix the second portion of feedforward matrix is zero because the accelerometer location matrix c a and the excitation force vector δ are orthogonal with respect to inverse mass matrix gawronski 2004 5 6 control algorithm fuzzy logic controller in this step we have proposed an intelligent control scheme that rests entirely on the time history responses of the structure to make it more responsive pragmatic approach to tackle uncertain parameters is the pivot on why a controller should be singled out for working with disturbances considering other pros and cons the appropriate control system is utilized to address the tradeoff between the high performance and less control cost control methods such as lqr linear quadratic regulator and lqg linear quadratic gaussian enhance certain aspects of controlling linear systems and make great demand on instrumentations at every elevation of the structure they require the optimal location of sensors and devices to perform desirably cha et al 2012 despite the almost 20 percent of the case study of the jacket platform is easily accessible by elevation above mean sea level scientists prefer to integrate the pid proportional integral derivative controller with other algorithms to develop insight into the system identification fuzzy logic theory is an auspicious solution to cope with the nonlinearity and uncertainty that happen in real experiences in other words uncertainty of input data is treated in an easier method by fuzzy logic control systems this theory was developed by zadeh 1965 in 1965 simple inference rules instead of a computational classic model and low solution cost a firm grasp of some basic mathematical concepts is considered dispensable nonlinear mapping capability map an input space to an output space and simulated model adaptation to the actual model are the main advantages in utilizing a fuzzy control algorithm the fuzzy logic control flc design entails input and output variables membership functions rule base design and composes of fuzzifier decision maker and defuzzifier fuzzy set theory characterizes transformation from input to output as the inference engine which is the central part of a fuzzy control system it seems reasonable to assume that the conventional fuzzy controller mamdani type fuzzy control as a feedback controller is a multi input single output miso prototype to replicate its ability to tackle the multi excitation forces with irregular nature the closed loop block diagram of the proposed control system is shown in fig 9 a membership function here the membership functions of input data including the main deck s velocity and displacement and output data applied force are selected the controller takes the information about the plant s state from sensors lateral displacement and velocity are measured indirectly from acceleration data acquisition section 5 4 the fuzzy linguistic values nl nm ns zo ps pm and pl correspond to negative large negative medium negative small zero positive small positive medium and positive large respectively which are portrayed in fig 10 variable data are normalized in the range of 1 1 and the input membership functions for the second part are trained with anfis in the second section of the modeling part subsystem the output membership functions specify the range of changes in target voltage which at the end is an input for the fmr fig 11 presents schemes for inmr membership functions b rule base the if then heuristic rules contain knowledge base information to infer new control signals defuzzification produces the desired outputs and the inmr runs on predicted force acceleration and time series velocity on the other hand two parts of the control subsystem can be merged together and the values of the velocity and displacement would bring about the command voltage proportionally table 5 the oscillating amplitude of the applied voltage and the corresponding time history control force of the mr damper are shown in fig 12 the amplitude of the applied voltage varies from zero to 4 v during simulation time under the environmental loading 5 7 stability of the control system until fairly recently the issue of the stability of the closed loop fuzzy control method is often criticized we have employed any means to condense the full scale model of the jacket platform into a reduced dofs model although each applied condensation method has been perceived to be more accurate and stable the stability of the controller should be inspected specifically after size reduction and during the simulation the ordinary lyapunov function is the main criterion for the stability of a mathematical based control system whereas fuzzy controller cannot be approximated by any dynamic equation to make the stability analysis possible through a mathematical solution with regard to nonlinearity and time variance complexity of a model free system takes a turn for the worse in fact the fuzzy controller does not support internal memory the input components are only available for an instant to generate output estimates and time delay causes instability in the system whenever the loop gain exceeds unity and in case of the loop phase shift is greater than 180 there is a potential to cause a problem of stability in a closed loop control system finally the closed loop control system turns out to be a positive feedback along with an extreme extra vibration shaw 1998 the most important limitation lies in the fact that there are no feasible approved guidelines with stability analytical techniques and if so it is plausible that a nonlinear system might be stable for one type of input signal and unstable for another there is no guarantee that a satisfactory design is obtained in every case the matter of the stability of the control systems is a wide topic and we do not pretend to cover it in this small subsection the results are aimed at summarizing the foregoing discussions now we proceed to introduce the concept of the dissipative system the notion of dissipativity is based on fundamental laws of physics these systems dissipate the energy and there is a close connection between positive real transfer functions and dissipative systems applied to a nonlinear system although non passive systems are not always unstable the passivity framework substantiates robust stability for a variety of models for the laplace transform of the equation of the motion gawronski 2004 preumont 2018 and brogliato et al 2020 31 m s 2 d s k x s f s the transfer function is 32 g s s m s 2 d s k for all ω and s j ω the transfer function is stable if g j ω has no pole in r e j ω 0 g j ω is real for all positive real s 33 g j ω 90 r e g j ω 0 the stability of the control system is illustrated in fig 13 where the nyquist diagram of a positive real transfer function and the bode plot of phase angle are shown the nyquist curve does not enclose the critical point and we have a closed loop stable system observing the system response s and its variables are recommended in order to validate stability of the system likewise being aware that the stability cannot be inferred from performance gawronski 2004 in order to put an accurate interpretation on the results an applied time history acceleration of a seismic event is a major contributor to environmental loading to cover all aspects of the response monitoring accordingly the results of both types of loading emphasize the validity of our control system in the state of stability as an alternative method usually to test the performance of a memoryless control system when the plant gets an intentional shock the controller would be examined to overcome unsatisfactory perturbations furthermore several design iterations are required before a satisfactory result is obtained although in this present case study to raise the matter of the stability it seems to be somewhat redundant evaluating the performance of the controller by application of external disturbance owing to the concept of random and non harmonic loading 5 8 comparison of the platform s response reduction a time history responses under environmental loading herein the effects of tmd and satmd are compared in value reduction of the main deck responses including lateral displacement velocity acceleration base shear and overturning moment figs 14 and 15 show the main deck lateral deflection and the velocity under the time history environmental loads in three conditions i uncontrolled ii with tmd iii with satmd the result indicates that the application of satmd with fuzzy logic algorithm reduces almost 40 percent of the maximum deflection values and almost 15 percent of the maximum velocity values compared to an uncontrolled system table 6 summarizes maximum values in figs 14 and 15 it provides a basis for comparison of control methods performance on lateral relative displacement and relative velocity respectively it is observed that the tmd device has brought a significant mitigation of the main deck s velocity values more effective than the satmd system a possible explanation for almost 50 percent value reduction may be that the dominant vibration mode of the structure is commonly assumed constant in linear simulation clearly there may be other possible explanations in the absence of special equipment increasing self weight of the structure is the only way to increase the resisting moment which certainly would raise the base shear unsatisfactorily due largely to the acceleration of the incoming excitement despite the fact that foundation piles have penetrated to the depth of 90 m under the mudline elevation through the legs of the jacket platform sliding and overturning control do not remain crucial unless they are allowed to reach axial capacity or develop plastic behavior as observed in figs 16 and 17 the efficiency of the tmd value reduction in base shear and overturning moment responses is negligible however semi active controller decreases the values of the base shear and overturning moment around 90 percent and it considerably reduces the risk of fatigue failure in structural components and improves the life cycle of the jacket platform b time history responses under seismic loading since seabed motions are of significance and the jacket platform is installed in one of seismically active areas it has the merit of brief consideration the api rp 2eq 1st ansi api recommended practice 2eq 2014 recommends using nonlinear time history procedures when energy dissipation devices are employed to represent the efficiency and capability of both control systems in reducing dynamic responses under seismic motion figs 18 and 19 pinpoint the time history responses of the structure under the strongest earthquake acceleration record occurred in 2005 near the qeshm island iran strong motion network 2020 the pga peak ground acceleration of this record in the suza station the closest seismograph station was 319 c m s 2 the peak ground accelerations in the area of the studied field are summarized in table 7 after application of acceleration quantities to excite the structure in simulation computer program we used continues time integration of signal operator to gain velocity and displacement actually time history velocities and displacements are obtained from integration and double integration of the time history acceleration respectively note that initial velocity and displacement are assumed to be zero although that is beyond the scope of this paper velocity and displacement might not contain the same information of the acceleration record therefore it is generally assumed that the processed histories of ground acceleration velocity and displacement are compatible with one another in comparison with tmd and uncontrolled structure figs 18 and 19 delineate the superiority of semi active controller in seismic response reduction of the main deck it helps to prevent possible nonlinear behavior of structural elements and reduces the seismic failure risk of the jacket platform as shown in figs 20 and 21 it is clarified how control strategies would mitigate base shear and overturning moment results after base driven approach time history earthquake base shear and overturning moment are mainly affected by the first vibration mode of the structure and the results validate the efficacy of tmd and satmd in controlling the main mode of vibration it is noteworthy to mention that there is a possibility of controlling higher mode effects by increase in use of the sensors in satmd device application 6 conclusion in this study the conduct of passive and semi active tuned mass damper tmd satmd under the environmental and seismic dynamic loading were investigated it is essentially an attempt to put modern theories into practice and proposing a framework for further research to prolong the service life of a fixed offshore structure the study has gone some way towards enhancing our understanding of smart control limitations and the following results were obtained 1 the tmd system reduces the primary concern of lateral displacement to less than 20 percent and velocity to less than 30 percent under several governing loadings 2 the satmd system was found to be reasonably reliable and the main deck of the jacket platform led to more than 40 percent reduction in lateral displacement and velocity values 3 whilst satmd decreases the base shear and the overturning moment values by around 90 percent the effect of tmd is negligible it considerably reduces the risk of fatigue failure in structural components and improves the life cycle of the jacket platform 4 the time history responses of the structure under the strongest record of earthquake in 2005 near the qeshm island show the superiority of the semi active controller in reducing seismic responses of the main deck compared with the tmd it helps to prevent possible nonlinear behavior of structural elements and reduces the seismic failure risk of the jacket platform 5 the control loop keeps the velocity and displacement of the main deck at its set point despite applied disturbances and it is robust with respect to changing system parameters 6 the study of online control equipment in the marine environment is a highly challenging issue when it fails to account for high maintenance costs severe corrosion conditions sea state and the elevations under the mean sea level which are relatively inaccessible to install energy dissipation devices it is recommended that further research should be undertaken in implementation constraints on controller placement 7 in state of non collocated control systems in case of extremely light damping instability is inevitable damping augmentation helps the feedback control performance and robustness declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

20259,in this paper the effect of the impeller diffuser interaction on the unstable flow in a mixed flow pump operating under one part load condition is investigated based on the local energy loss analysis using a modified sst k ω partially averaged navier stokes msst pans model the comparison on the pump performance shows a good agreement between the experiment and simulation the characteristic curve of the test pump presents a positive slope region where hydraulic loss increases 90 75 in the impeller and 16 75 in the diffuser the internal flow analysis depicts that the rotating stall evolution captured in the impeller passages involves larger energy transfer while the separating flow in the diffuser passage involves lower energy transfer as the impeller blade tailing edge te begins to interact with the diffuser blade leading edge le the vortex attached to the impeller blade te is cut off into two parts one of which keeps propagating circumferentially and forms the rotating stall in the impeller and the other is regarded as the shedding vortex moving into the diffuser further analysis by the fast fourier transform and proper orthogonal decomposition reveals the frequency of rotating stall is 1 49f n and the frequency of the shedding vortex is 0 53f n keywords mixed flow pump unstable flow msst pans turbulence model local energy loss rotating stall impeller diffuser interaction 1 introduction in the process of hydropower exploitation and utilization mixed flow pumps mfps are regarded as important energy conversion devices applied in fields of waterjet propulsion system huang et al 2019 2020 and pumped storage technology liu and tan 2018 although the application technology of the mfps is quite mature nowadays the typical and complicated flow instability phenomenon i e hump characteristic is universal as the mfps operate under part load conditions ye et al 2020a with a large amount of energy loss the flow field is also deteriorated significantly once the hump characteristic occurs therefore to guarantee the safe operation of the mfps during the energy utilization it is of great significance to explore the mechanism of the hump characteristic in the mfps it was indicated by posa posa et al 2015 that the rotating stall appears as the mfps operate under the off design conditions which is regarded as the source inducing the pump performance variation up to now lots of researches focusing on the rotating stall have been carried out braun et al 2005 byskov et al 2003 li et al 2020 miyabe et al 2008 pacot et al 2016 widmer et al 2011 yang et al 2019 for examples yang yang et al 2019 simulated the unstable flow in a pump turbine in pump mode and found three sets of rotating stall cells appearing in the guide vanes and stay vanes under part load conditions pacot pacot et al 2016 investigated the rotating stall evolution in the guide vane of the pump turbine by using large eddy simulation les and found that the propagation speed of the rotating stall was extremely low compared with the runner rotation speed i e ω s ω 2 0 li li et al 2020 captured the rotating stall evolution and its propagation from the blade leading edge le to the tailing edge te in a mixed flow pump impeller basing on the simulation results the authors believed that the stall vortex changed the fluid trajectory and caused the flow distortion at impeller rim which inducing the pre stall and tip initial stall miyabe miyabe et al 2008 considered that the diffuser rotating stall drs was the main reason for the characteristic instability in a mixed flow pump basing on the results by dynamic particle image velocimetry dpiv measurement and numerical simulation byskov byskov et al 2003 analyzed the flow field in a centrifugal pump impeller under one part load condition by les and found a highly separated flow in one passage appearing at the entrance of the impeller with steady and non rotating state byskov recognized the stationary stall was not initiated by the interaction with the stationary components the researches mentioned above show that the analysis for rotating stall has been well investigated in impeller or diffuser where the rotating stall mainly occurs as mentioned by posa posa and lippolis 2019 the effect of the rotor stator interaction indeed plays substantial role on the rotating stall evolution thus forming the hump characteristic in his study the effect on pressure fluctuations through rotating and stationary channels by both flow rate and orientation of the diffuser blades are compared and discussed the results show that the pressure fluctuations are much more sensitive to the flow rate and setting angle of diffuser blades for the stationary vanes compared to the rotating channels with modified diffuser geometry the low frequency is also less energetic at the reduced flow rate sano sano et al 2002a also found different stall types i e alternate blade stall asymmetric stall and rotating stall by changing the impeller diffuser clearance the pressure in diffusers also changed according to different clearances therefore the effect of the rotor stator interaction rsi is very significant to the internal flow influencing pump performance and the flow instability therefore the analysis on the flow interaction between the impeller and diffuser is important and essential which contributes to giving a better insight on the flow instability mechanism however the related researches are few and the effect on flow instability due to rsi should be further investigated many analyses on flow instability indicate that the sudden increase of hydraulic loss in pumps is responsible for the hump characteristic formation dou and jiang 2013 lu et al 2019 ye et al 2019a however detailed energy loss distribution and its propagation mechanism are still unclear lu lu et al 2019 derived the local unsteady loss from the energy equation to illustrate the contribution of local flow patterns to the loss in corresponding hydraulic components his study showed that the unsteady local loss assessment was suitable for the turbulent flow involving rotating stall on the other hand the flow diagnosis technique based on the proper orthogonal decomposition pod has been utilized widely to identify spatio temporal characteristics of multi scale coherent structures sirovich 1987 this technique is used in many engineering cases such as turbulent channel flow derebail muralidhar et al 2019 cavitation around a hydrofoil liu et al 2019 and unstable flow in a radial turbomachine witte et al 2018 in case of turbulent flow in mfps it is essential to separate the specific and periodic flow structures from the rest of the irregular and chaotic motions an insight for the interaction between coherent flow structures and corresponding pressure fluctuations contributes to understanding the flow instability mechanism precisely due to the limitation of measurement techniques numerical simulation becomes important for the analysis of turbulent separated flows in recent years based on the researches mentioned above lots of researches are carried out by computation fluid dynamics cfd using different turbulence models such as k ε model miyabe et al 2008 sst k ω model li et al 2020 liu and tan 2018 luo et al 2020 widmer et al 2011 ye et al 2019a v 2 f model lu et al 2019 les model

viscosity models attracts lots of attention however the rans model has the inferiority to capture the detailed unsteady flow structures some cfd work on flow field prediction expressed the involved issue huang et al 2017 sano et al 2002b shih et al 1995 ye et al 2019b recently the partially averaged navier stokes pans model bridging smoothly from rans to dns direct numerical simulation has been proposed girimaji 2005 the filter width is controlled by the unresolved to total ratios of kinetic energy i e f k in high reynolds number cases which is in the range of 0 f k 1 if f k 1 0 the pans model is reduced to the rans model if f k 0 the pans model is switched to the dns model during the development of the pans model it has been applied in many test cases huang et al 2017 lakshmipathy and girimaji 2006 ye et al 2020c yu et al 2020 most recently ye ye et al 2020b 2020d 2020e developed a modified partially averaged navier stokes msst pans model based on the modified sst k ω model which is a hybrid model introducing the realizable k ε model into the sst k ω model this model was tested for the turbulent flow in a 90 curved rectangular duct ye et al 2020b cavitating flow in a two dimensional curved hydrofoil ye et al 2020d and unstable flow in a centrifugal pump ye et al 2020e and a mixed flow pump ye et al 2020a results indicate that the msst pans can give more detailed flow information and achieves a better accordance with the external characteristics and detailed flow structures comparing with other conventional models therefore by employing numerical simulations using msst pans model the main objective of the present paper is to investigate the effect of impeller diffuser interaction on the unstable flow in a mixed flow pump from the perspective of local loss characteristic the flow characteristics in the impeller and diffuser are analyzed in detail based on the simulation this paper is organized as follows mathematical formulations about msst pans model

shear stress and high vortex evolution in the mixed flow pump a modified sst k ω partially averaged navier stokes msst pans model ye et al 2020b 2020d ye et al 2020e is applied in this paper the msst pans model is believed to be sensitive to high shear stress and high pressure gradient flow where the effects of streamline curvature and rotation effect should be carefully considered the governing equations of the msst pans model are 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j τ v i v j x j p x i μ ρ 2 u i x j x j 3 ρ k u t ρ k u u j x j x j μ tu σ ku k u x j p ku β ρ ω u k u 4 ρ ω u t ρ ω u u j x j x j μ

τ v i v j is the subfilter scale stress which is regarded as a partially reynolds stress in the pans model the boussinesq assumption is also applied to express τ v i v j in eq 3 and eq 4 the subscript

model are f k and f ω in high reynolds number cases the dissipation scales are unlikely to be resolved thus f ε is set to a unity of 1 0 and f ω 1 f k the only one filter width parameter is f k which needs to be specified carefully in early stage of pans model f k is usually treated as a constant such as 0 7 0 5 0 4 and so on girimaji 2005 since it is difficult to get the detailed flow structures in advance it is impossible to determine f k as a suitable unity prior to the simulation usually the pans model with a constant f k is not reasonable because the simulation consumes redundant calculation cost girimaji and abdol hamid 2005 proposed the dynamic coefficient f k defined for the best grid utilization i e 13 f k 3 δ l 2 3 where l is the integral turbulence length scale l k 1 5 ε k u β ω u and δ is the local grid size determined as δ δx δy δz 1 3 based on the girimaji and abdol hamid s work girimaji and abdol hamid 2005 a spatially varying and dynamically updating f k is used in our research as follows 14 f k min 1 c s δ l 2 3 where c s is the model coefficient c s 1 0 in the calculation 3 energy loss evaluation 3 1 hydraulic loss generally the hydraulic loss can be evaluated according to the total pressure difference between the outlet and inlet of each flow component as shown in eq 15 15 p loss p t 2 p t 1 where p t2 and p t1 represent the total pressures at the outlet and the inlet of each flow component such as impeller diffuser etc thus the energy loss coefficient in the diffuser cp d is defined as 16 c p d p t 2 d p t 1 d ρ u 2 2 where u 2 represents peripheral velocity at the impeller exit and the subscript d means the parameter for the diffuser because the energy loss coefficient in rotating component should be modified by considering the input power p in the energy loss coefficient in the impeller cp i is defined as 17 c p i p t 2 i p t 1 i ρ u 2 2 p in ρ q u 2 2 where the subscript i represents the parameter for the impeller therefore the hydraulic losses in the impeller and diffuser can be evaluated directly under different flow rate condition 3 2 local loss wilhelm wilhelm et al 2016 calculated the head losses in turbine draft tube by deriving the mean kinetic energy equation from navier stokes equations based on this concept lu lu et al 2019 developed the energy balance equations which had been utilized for local loss analysis in an airfoil cascades and a pump turbine the local loss in each flow component is expressed as follows 18 p l v t 1 2 ρ u 2 d v v u i τ v i v j x j d v v μ u i d ij x j d v v τ v i v j u i x j d v v μ d ij u i x j d v where 19 d ij u i x j u j x i 20 τ v i v j μ tu u j x i u i x j 2 3 δ ij ρ k u the first term in eq 18 represents the kinetic energy variation of the mean flow according to the literature lu et al 2019 the contribution of the variation of mean kinetic to the local loss is insignificant under the condition including rotating stall and the most loss is converted to the turbulent kinetic energy thus in current study the first term is neglected and the local loss is expressed by the next four terms 21 p l v u i τ v i v j x j d v v μ u i d ij x j d v v τ v i v j u i x j d v v μ d ij u i x j d v in eq 21 the local loss is integrated in every flow component and is named as p l1 p l4 respectively p l1 is the diffusion of the kinetic energy by means of the reynolds stress and p l2 is the diffusion of the kinetic energy by means of the viscous stress the third term i e p l3 represents the turbulent kinetic energy production due to the transformation of the kinetic energy to the turbulent kinetic energy the last term i e p l4 is the viscous dissipation of mean kinetic energy since the subfilter scale stress τ v i v j is also computed in the form of boussinesq assumption the subfilter scale stress τ v i v j is calculated using eq 20 where δ ij is kronecker function 4 problem descriptions 4 1 computational domain to investigate the flow characteristic in the mixed flow pump especially in the impeller and diffuser the full passage computational domain is adopted the computational domain includes inlet pipe suction pipe impeller diffuser and outlet pipe the mixed flow pump consists of 5 blade impeller and 7 blade diffuser the diameter at the impeller exit is 299 4 mm and the impeller tip clearance is treated as 0 3 mm the corresponding experimental system is shown in fig 1 b and mainly includes water tank test pump booster pump motor and experimental pipes the pump head is derived from the total pressure difference between the inlet and outlet pipe and measured by the pressure sensors the uncertainty of the pressure sensors is 0 2 the electromagnetic flow meter is utilized to measure the flow rate in the experimental system with the uncertainty of 0 5 the shaft rotational speed is 1500r min in the experiment and simulation the input power can be acquired by the measurement of the shaft torque using a torque transducer and the angular speed according to the shaft rotational speed npsh a i e available net positive suction head is 9 86 m under the condition of 0 6q bep and is large enough for the pump operation without cavitation the detailed descriptions about the specifications of the mixed flow pump and the experimental system are available in the ref ye et al 2020a 4 2 grid generation and independence test the hexahedral grids are applied for the impeller and diffuser and generated using the software of the ansys turbogrid while that for the inlet pipe and outlet pipe are generated using the software of ansys icem since the grid treatment is significant for the simulation four sets of grid strategies are applied to examine the gird sensitivity the grids are well refined on the blade surfaces from grid set no 1 to grid set no 4 as table 1 shows by comparing the experimental data at design point condition h d η d the predicted head h and efficiency η tend to reach convergent values as the grid is refined therefore considering the accuracy of the results and the computational cost the grid set no 3 is selected as the final grid strategy in the research based on the independence test results fig 2 displays the detailed grid distributions of the mixed flow pump note that the grid is refined near the blade surfaces and wall bounded regions the time averaged yplus distributions on the impeller and diffuser blades are around 15 as shown in fig 3 which are fine enough for the calculation using the msst pans model 4 3 numerical setting commercial software of ansys cfx is utilized in current study steady calculations are carried out under all operating conditions to obtain the hump characteristic curves directly while one unsteady calculation is performed under one typical operating condition to analyze the transient unstable flow in detail different mass flow rates are imposed at the inlet section under different conditions and a fixed static pressure is prescribed at the outlet section a time step of 1 ω ω is the angular speed of pump impeller is selected in the steady calculations and the time step value of 2 22 10 4s corresponding to the runner rotating angle of 2 per time step is applied for the unsteady calculation the discretization methods for the advection scheme and the turbulence numerics are high resolution during the calculation the root mean squared rms momentum residuals are set below 10 4 for the steady calculations and the rms momentum residuals are controlled below 10 5 for the unsteady calculation fig 4 shows the residual distribution for unsteady calculation under the condition of 0 6q bep the results indicate that the rms residual for convergence approaches 10 5 which is suitable for the unsteady calculation 5 results and discussion 5 1 characteristic curves the pump characteristic curves are shown in fig 5 where the black scattering points having square symbol represent the experimental results and the blue lines with cross symbol are the calculation results the pump performance can be expressed by flow coefficient ϕ head coefficient ψ efficiency η and input power coefficient τ which are defined below 22 ϕ q π r 2 b 2 u 2 23 ψ h u 2 2 g 24 η ρ g q h t ω 25 τ 2 t ω ρ π r 2 b 2 u 2 3 where r 2 is the tip radius at impeller exit q is the volume flow rate t is the shaft torque ω is the angular velocity and b 2 is the blade width the results in fig 5 show the fairly good agreement between the simulation and the experiment as shown in fig 5 a the predicted head coefficient ψ is close to the experimental data under all flow conditions especially in the range of ϕ 1 to ϕ 2 a positive slope region is measured by the experiment and is also well predicted by the calculation the relative error for ψ is 2 28 under the condition of ϕ 2 and 3 69 under the condition of ϕ 1 the predicted efficiency agrees very well with the experimental data with the relative error of 2 96 under the condition of ϕ 1 the best efficiency is located under the condition of 1 1ϕ d although the input power is underestimated with the maximum relative error of 7 21 under the condition of ϕ 1 the predicted curve of input power coefficient exhibits the same tendency with the experiment data particularly under the hump region the τ ϕ curve also shows positive slope indicating the input power decreases during the hump region the results confirm that the msst pans reasonably predicts the hydraulic performance even under the unstable operation conditions it is acknowledged that the sudden increase of hydraulic loss is the main mechanism for the positive slope in pumps lu et al 2019 ye et al 2019a fig 6 further shows the euler head and net head coefficient ψ e and ψ predicted by the simulation the difference between the ψ e and ψ can be considered as the head loss coefficient ψ loss the euler head h e euler head coefficient ψ e and head loss coefficient ψ loss are calculated according to eq 26 26 h e 1 g u 2 v u 2 u 1 v u 1 ψ e g h e u 2 2 v u 2 u 2 u 1 v u 1 u 2 2 ψ loss ψ e ψ as shown in fig 6 the value of ψ e increases gradually as the flow coefficient ϕ decreases under the unstable conditions where the positive slope region is apparently shown in the ψ ϕ curve the slope of the ψ e ϕ curve also tends to be flat obviously by comparing the head loss coefficient ψ loss under the two conditions ψ loss increases rapidly from the operation ϕ 2 to ϕ 1 where the flow is regarded to become much unstable according to eq 16 and eq 17 the hydraulic losses in the impeller and diffuser are calculated respectively and the results are plotted against the flow coefficient in fig 7 it is noted that under the condition of ϕ bep 1 1ϕ d the hydraulic loss in impeller cp i is the same as that in diffuser cp d and their values are the lowest indicating the stable and fluent flow in both impeller and diffuser ye et al 2020a as the flow rate decreases the hydraulic loss increases rapidly in the diffuser while that in the impeller increases slightly that means the flow field in the diffuser begins to be deteriorated right after the ϕ bep 1 1ϕ d while the flow in the impeller is relative smooth ye et al 2020a however as the operation shifts from ϕ 2 to ϕ 1 the hydraulic loss in the impeller increases dramatically with the relative increment of 90 75 while that increases only 16 75 in the diffuser it is suspected that the flow in the impeller changed substantially from ϕ 2 to ϕ 1 causing dramatic loss increase compared with that in the diffuser 5 2 flow pattern in impeller and diffuser fig 8 shows the time averaged streamlines in the mid span section of the impeller and diffuser under three part load conditions as shown in fig 5 a it is found that the streamlines in the impeller are generally smooth under the conditions of 0 7ϕ d and 0 8ϕ d while there are strong separations in the diffuser flow passages the separations occurring from the suction side partly block the passage in the diffuser under the condition of 0 6ϕ d flow separation is observed near the impeller blade tailing edge te while the blockage in the diffuser passages become more severe compared with other operation conditions it is suspected that the flow separation near the impeller blade te may enhance the flow instability in the diffuser under the condition of 0 6ϕ d and is regarded as the dominant factor corresponding to the unstable flow for the positive slope region on the other hand though the flow in the diffuser changes the flow pattern is similar under three conditions detailed flow patterns in the impeller and diffuser under the unstable condition of ϕ 1 are specifically provided from transient perspective fig 9 shows the transient streamlines on three span sections of the impeller near the impeller hub i e span 0 1 the flow seems to be smooth in five blade to blade flow passages and no apparent flow separation occurs on the mid span flow separation is observed near the blade suction side and the te as shown in fig 9 b it can be noted that the zone of flow separation changes periodically the separation flow sheds gradually from t 0 to t 0 3 10t n and develops again from t 0 4 10t n to t 0 7 10t n t n represents the period of the impeller rotation near the impeller shroud i e span 0 9 the flow is much more turbulent in the blade to blade channels take one flow passage as an example as shown in fig 9 c there are three large flow separation zones marked as vi vii and viii from t 0 to t 0 3 10t n vi begins to merge with vii forming a new large scale of vortex after that the vortex propagates downstream along the blade suction side gradually as for viii the red arrow line shows the track of the vortex it is clear that viii moves from one blade le to the adjacent blade le from t 0 to t 0 7 10t n the vortex propagates circumferentially and forms the rotating stall which is also analyzed in our previous research ye et al 2020a fig 10 shows the streamlines in the diffuser the complicated flow is observed in the diffuser as shown in the fig 8 near the diffuser hub large scale of flow separation occupies the inlet of diffuser passage the flow structure seems to be stable and to propagate along the streamwise direction to the diffuser outlet slowly on the mid span section large scale of flow separation occurs in each flow passage the results shown in fig 10 a and b indicate the flow passages are severely blocked from the hub to the mid span near the shroud the flow separation is located near the diffuser exit further the large velocity near the blade tip means that the flow is mainly pushed toward the diffuser shroud due to the special flow features in the impeller and the diffuser it is a strong secondary flow which makes the flow near the impeller hub to be pushed toward diffuser shroud in addition flow oscillation with relatively high velocity near the diffuser inlet is also observed near the diffuser shroud at instant of t 0 relatively high velocity is observed while at instant of t 0 5 5t n the velocity becomes low after that at instant of t 0 8 5t n the velocity near the diffuser inlet becomes relatively high again combining with the results shown in the fig 9 c the velocity oscillation shown in the 0 9 span is affected by the rotating stall evolution observed in the impeller shroud depicting the strong interaction between the impeller and the diffuser 5 3 local loss distribution the non dimensional local loss λ li is calculated in the impeller and diffuser respectively using the following definition 27 λ li p li ρ π r 2 b 2 u 2 3 where p li is the hydraulic loss shown at the right side of eq 21 fig 11 shows the local loss coefficient in the impeller and diffuser under the condition of ϕ 1 it is noted that the turbulent kinetic energy production term i e λ l3 is the main loss source and the λ l3 in impeller is larger than that in the diffuser indicating that the large scale separation flow promotes the production of turbulent kinetic energy in the mixed flow pump compared with λ l3 the other three terms are much smaller of which the viscous dissipation term λ l4 is lowest in both impeller and diffuser however the λ l1 and λ l2 are calculated to evaluate the overall diffusion effect in the flow components detailed local loss distribution is specifically shown in fig 12 as for the right side of eq 21 the local loss per unit volume is named as p l1 p l4 respectively i e p l 1 u i τ v i v j x j p l 2 μ u i d ij x j p l 3 τ v i v j u i x j p l 4 μ d ij u i x j the first term p l1 and second term p l2 represent the diffusion effect of the kinetic energy of the mean flow it is noted that the terms of p l1 and p l2 have the positive and negative values which represent the diffusion direction fig 12 gives the time averaged contours of the non dimensional local loss coefficient defined in eq 28 and pressure on the mid span section of the impeller and diffuser under the condition of ϕ 1 it is noted that the local loss coefficients of λ l1 and λ l3 are much larger than the other terms 28 λ li p li ρ u 2 3 d 2 where d 2 is the tip diameter at impeller exit in accordance with the results in fig 11 the term for turbulent kinetic energy production λ l3 plays the dominant effect in both impeller and diffuser owing to the high adverse pressure gradient shown in fig 12 e the flow separation is induced as illustrated in fig 9 and the high value region of the λ l3 is observed near the impeller blade te compared with the terms for diffusion effect by viscous stress λ l2 the term of diffusion effect by reynolds stress λ l1 is much larger and cannot be neglected high λ l1 value region mainly occurs in the impeller blade to blade passage and occupies most area near the suction side of the blade besides due to the adverse pressure gradient shown near the impeller blade le the high λ l1 value region at the impeller inlet tends to split and propagate over the blade le to the adjacent blade suction side as shown in fig 12 a it is also noted that there is a strong effect due to reynolds stress diffusion located near the impeller exit representing the kinetic energy diffusion in opposite direction where the reverse flow occurs therefore the turbulent kinetic energy production and the reynolds stress diffusion are the two main factors resulting in large hydraulic loss and unstable flow characteristics in the mixed flow pump impeller which are directly induced by the local pressure gradient however the high value region of λ l1 and λ l3 is mainly limited near the le and te for diffuser vane the energy transfer in the diffuser is much suppressed compared with that in the impeller consequently even under the positive slope region the hydraulic loss in the diffuser is not very large for further discussion of hydraulic loss in the impeller and diffuser several monitoring planes are set along streanwise direction as shown in fig 13 planes a b c d are in the streamwise location of 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 9 in the impeller and planes f g h are the streamwise location of 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 in the diffuser particularly plane e is at the vaneless area i e the area between impeller exit and diffuser inlet as shown in fig 14 high absolute value region of λ l1 is circumferentially distributed and radially expands from blade tip toward hub on the planes indicating high energy transfer along the blade tip owing to the centrifugal force effect in the impeller the results show the strong energy transfer due to the rotating stall evolution in the impeller where the flow separation as well as flow passage blockage occurs near the blade tip and develops toward the impeller hub the result of fig 14 e shows the unique λ l1 distribution due to the rotor stator interaction it is noted that the effect of kinetic energy diffusion by the reynolds stress is not so strong in the diffuser compared with that in the impeller under the condition of ϕ 1 fig 15 represents the turbulent kinetic energy production λ l3 under the condition of ϕ 1 it is shown that the high value region of λ l3 mainly occurs along the blade tip and the area with high λ l3 near the blade le is larger than that near the te in the impeller in the diffuser the turbulent kinetic energy production is weak relatively but the turbulent kinetic energy production is not small at the diffuser inlet due to the impeller diffuser interaction therefore combined with results shown in figs 9 and 10 high energy transfer in the impeller is induced by the rotating stall evolution while the energy transfer in the diffuser is much lower the flow characteristics in different hydraulic components under the unstable condition result in the main hydraulic loss occurring in the impeller and slighter loss in the diffuser detailed analysis on the vaneless region is carried out to give further explanation on the impeller diffuser interaction 5 4 flow characteristic in the vaneless region fig 16 gives the time averaged vectors colored by the absolute velocity near the vaneless region under the condition of ϕ 1 near the hub side i e span 0 1 the flow near the vaneless region is rather turbulent as shown in the fig 16 a there is vortex near the diffuser blade le in this region the reverse flow from the diffuser collides with the diffuser vane le and large attack angle of the flow is presented the flow features include the vortex and reverse flow with low velocity in this region on the mid span section the flow in the vaneless region tends to be smooth and the velocity gradient in this region becomes smaller large scale of vortex is observed in the flow passage which corresponds to the development of vortex shown in the fig 16 a near the shroud side the absolute velocity vectors departing from the impeller blade te enter in the diffuser vane le smoothly the velocity gradient is smallest and the flow pattern in the vaneless region is smooth fig 17 represents the transient distribution of λ l3 on the span 0 5 under the condition of ϕ 1 the high λ l3 value region is cut off from the impeller blade te at instant of t 0 where the rotating stall cell sheds from t 0 to t 0 2 45t n the shedding vortex propagates downstream and circumferentially at t 0 3 45t n when the impeller blade te begins to interact with the diffuser vane le the shedding vortex begins to separate into two parts one part attaches to the impeller blade suction side and keeps propagating to the adjacent blade and the other part sheds into the diffuser along the diffuser vane from t 0 7 45t n to t 0 9 45t n another rotating stall attached to the adjacent blade te is cut off by the effect of impeller diffuser interaction and the new shedding vortex propagates downstream therefore it is obvious that the effect of impeller diffuser interaction in the vaneless region is the key factor to promote the rotating stall cell propagating circumferentially at the impeller blade te the shedding vortex is separated from the rotating stall when the impeller blade and diffuser vane interact spatially therefore the effect of the impeller diffuser interaction on the unstable flow is obvious in the impeller which is regarded as the actuator to promote the flow separation attached to the blade te propagating circumferentially and form rotating stall in the impeller finally fig 18 gives the vortex evolution by q criterion 202636 s 1 in the vaneless region under the condition of ϕ 1 to further explain the results in fig 17 at the instant of t 0 the rotating stall attached to the impeller blade te is cut off and large scale of vortex is also attached to the diffuser vane le which blocks the flow passage at diffuser inlet at t 0 3 45t n the cut off vortex is separated further by the diffuser blade and propagates downstream in the diffuser from t 0 7 45t n to t 0 9 45t n another rotating stall is cut off by the effect of impeller diffuser interaction as shown in fig 17 therefore not only the flow separation inception near the blade tip which is regarded as the source of the rotating stall the effect of the impeller diffuser interaction also plays a significant role on the rotating stall formation in the impeller fig 19 gives the transient pressure gradient in z direction contours in the vaneless region to explain the mechanism of the rotating stall evolution under the condition of ϕ 1 at the instant of t 0 the impeller blade a is far away from the diffuser vane a the large adverse pressure gradient occurs near the blade suction side and the impeller exit as the impeller blade a begins to interact with the diffuser vane a i e from t 0 2 45t n to t 0 5 45t n the adverse pressure gradient region near the impeller blade te expands forming the zone with high adverse pressure gradient on the other hand at the instant of t 0 5 45t n the adverse pressure gradient region at the impeller inlet is relatively small but at the instant of t 0 8 45t n a high adverse pressure gradient region is also formed at the impeller inlet induced by the high adverse pressure gradient at the impeller blade te the high adverse pressure gradient results in the flow separation as well as rotating stall in the impeller and the blockage in the flow passage therefore the impeller diffuser interaction plays significant role in flow pattern not only in the impeller blade te but also at impeller inlet fig 20 shows the schematic of the flow mechanism on the rotating stall the flow separation occurs at the impeller blade le and propagates along the impeller blade suction side to the impeller blade te under part load condition as the impeller blade te interacts with the diffuser vane le the rotating stall cell is cut off into two parts one part keeps propagating circumferentially forming the rotating stall and the other part is regarded as the shedding vortex which dissipates in the diffuser finally owing to the impeller diffuser interaction high adverse pressure is induced around the impeller blade te the high adverse pressure region expands further near the impeller inlet forcing the flow separation to propagate from one flow passage to the adjacent flow passage and form the rotating stall at impeller inlet finally the rotating stall is observed at the adjacent passage 5 5 pressure oscillation pressure oscillation intensity cp sd is calculated as follows 29 c p sd 1 n i 1 n p x y z t i p x y z t 2 1 2 ρ u 2 2 where n is the number of time steps and p x y z t i is instantaneous pressure fig 21 shows the pressure oscillation intensity in the pump under the condition of ϕ 1 the region with high cp sd value can reflect the unstable flow discussed above it is clear that the highest cp sd region locates near the blade te on the 0 5span followed by the impeller blade le on the 0 9span there is the region with high cp sd value at the vaneless zone and near the diffuser inlet where the rotating stall propagates circumferentially in the impeller and dissipates in the diffuser to capture the dominate frequency inducing by the unstable flow in both impeller and diffuser pressure oscillation is monitored at several points set in the impeller vaneless region and diffuser respectively as shown in fig 22 note that pi1 pi6 are all set on the impeller blade suction side where the rotating stall evolution mainly occurs pd1 pd9 are located on different diffuser span sections points of pd1 pd4 and pd7 are on the 0 1span section pd2 pd5 and pd8 are on the 0 5span section and pd3 pd6 and pd9 are on the 0 9span section fig 23 and fig 25 show the pressure oscillation spectrum by performing fast fourier transform fft the pressure coefficient c p is defined as 30 c p p i p 0 1 2 ρ u 2 2 where p i presents the instantaneous static pressure at any monitoring point and p 0 is the averaged pressure at the impeller inlet in the impeller the dominant frequency is 1 49 f n f n represents the impeller rotating frequency 1 t n in the mid stream and te of blade based on the results it is easy to judge that the frequency is resulted from the rotating stall cells evolution from the results in figs 9 and 12 flow patterns in five blade to blade flow passages are synchronous thus the frequency representing the rotating stall evolution in one flow passage is regarded as 1 49 5 0 298f n which is lower than the impeller rotating as shown in fig 23 c d and e the dominant frequency of 0 53f n is captured in the diffuser with relative lower amplitudes compared with the component of 1 49f n in the impeller since the effect of the impeller diffuser interaction on the unstable flow in the impeller is significant it is assumed that the pressure oscillation component with frequency of 0 53f n is originated from the shedding vortex dissipating in the diffuser to investigate the mechanism of the frequency of 0 53f n it is necessary to explore the flow in the diffuser individually fig 24 shows λ l3 evolution in the diffuser passage on span 0 9 section where higher λ l3 distribution is observed fig 15 it is recognized that the high value region represents the rotating stall shedding from the impeller blade te which called shedding vortex in fig 17 based on the streamlines shown in fig 10 c though the streamlines are relative smooth at the diffuser inlet flow oscillation is observed in this region and attributes to the shedding vortex succeeding from the impeller propagating at the diffuser inlet circumferentially as plotted in fig 24 high λ l3 value region is found around the diffuser inlet at the instant of t 0 high λ l3 value region in the flow passage of ⅵ succeeds from the impeller outlet and propagates downstream along the flow passage at t 0 2 9t n the high λ l3 value region dissipates gradually however it is noted that the shedding vortex not only propagates along one flow passage but also moves to the adjacent flow passages as shown in the flow passage ⅳ the shedding vortex propagates in the ⅳ from t 0 to t 0 2 9t n and splits into two parts on part dissipates in current flow passage and the other part keeps moving to the adjacent flow passages i e ⅲ and ⅱ at t 0 3 9t n and t 0 4 9t n from t 0 5 9t n to t 0 8 9t n the shedding vortex propagates and finally dissipates at the passage ⅱ as indicated in fig 17 the impeller diffuser interaction promotes the rotating stall attached to the impeller blade te to propagate circumferentially and the shedding vortex separated from the impeller blade te moves into the diffuser and influences the downstream flow patterns after succeeding the shedding vortex the flow near the diffuser inlet still shows oscillation because the shedding vortex propagates circumferentially in the diffuser inlet however the intensity of the shedding vortex is lower than the rotating stall in the impeller recognized by the amplitudes of the dominate frequency of 1 49f n and 0 53f n based on this consideration the frequency of 0 53f n is induced by the shedding vortex propagating circumferentially at the diffuser inlet owing to the impeller blade number of 5 and diffuser blade number of 7 it is easy to calculate the succeeding frequency in one flow passage as 1 49f n 7 5 1 06f n considering the feature of the shedding vortex evolution its frequency is calculated as 1 06 2 0 53f n thus the shedding vortex propagates from one passage to the adjacent flow passage then dissipates finally in the adjacent flow passage the analysis result matches with the fft results perfectly 6 monitoring points are also set in the vaneless region pressure oscillation on the frequency domain is shown in fig 25 it is clear that the pressure oscillations at monitoring points pv1 pv2 and pv3 show the typical frequency of 1 49f n which represents the effect of rotating stall evolution near the diffuser the pressure oscillation at pv4 exhibits low frequency of 0 64f n which is affected by the corner vortex shown in fig 16 at the points of pv5 and pv6 the dominant pressure oscillation has the frequency of 5f n and is recognized as the effect of impeller diffuser interaction finally the proper orthogonal decomposition pod is adopted to extract the specific flow structures in the pump the main methodology is introduced in the related literatures liu et al 2019 2020 2020 witte et al 2018 several monitoring planes i e plane d in the impeller and plane f plane g and plane h in the diffuser as shown in fig 13 are selected to perform the pod analysis on each plane the snapshot method holmes et al 2012 is applied with each snapshot containing m spontaneous velocity data in a single column n 301 snapshots covering 30 cycles of impeller rotation are selected for analysis thus the m n data matrix u is shown as follows 31 u u 1 u 2 u n handle its autocovariance matrix r defined in eq 32 32 r 1 n u u t being a symmetric positive definite matrix the i th real eigenvalue and its eigenvector of r are solved in eq 33 33 r a i λ i a i i 1 2 3 n the k th pod mode i e φ k can be expressed by a linear combination of velocity data vectors 34 φ k i 1 n a i k u i k 1 2 3 n the temporal coefficients are then calculated by projecting the data vector onto each pod mode 35 a k i 1 n u i t φ k k 1 2 3 n fig 26 shows some typical pod modes on these planes the amplitude is calculated by performing fft on the a k on plane d in the impeller the frequency of the first two energetic pod modes is f n not shown in this paper which is the dominant feature of impeller flow the frequency of mode 3 in fig 26 a is 1 49 f n representing the rotating stall evolution as shown in fig 24 a and b the frequencies of mode 4 include two components i e 0 53f n and 1 49f n as indicated in fig 24 c d the frequency of 0 53f n observed in the diffuser represents the shedding vortex from the impeller blade te to the diffuser passage it is further confirmed that the rotating stall cell is cut off into two parts near the impeller blade te since the component of 0 53f n is still observed in mode 4 of the plane d in the impeller the energies of 0 53f n and 1 49f n in mode 4 decreased compared with the energy of 1 49f n in mode 3 on the plane f in the diffuser the first energetic pod mode is 5f n not shown in this paper caused by the effect of impeller diffuser interaction the mode 2 and mode 3 represent the typical flow feature in the diffuser their frequencies are all 0 53f n on the plane g and plane h where it is far away from the impeller exit the first two frequencies of energetic pod modes are 0 53f n the energy amplitude is lower as the monitoring planes move downstream representing the shedding vortex dissipates gradually downstream in the diffuser 6 conclusions in this study the effect of impeller diffuser interaction on the unstable flow in a mixed flow pump has been systematically investigated using a modified sst k ω partially averaged navier stokes msst pans model from the internal flow and hydraulic loss analysis the formation mechanism of the rotating stall evolution due to impeller diffuser interaction in the pump is discussed adequately the following conclusions can be drawn 1 numerical simulation accurately reproduces the characteristic curves for the pump having a positive slope region from 0 7q d to 0 6q d where hydraulic loss increases 90 75 in the impeller and 16 75 in the diffuser due to the rotating stall evolution 2 the local loss analysis reveals that rotating stall evolution captured in the impeller blade to blade flow passage involves with high energy transfer while the separating flow induces lower energy transfer in the diffuser passage 3 the unstable flow as well as the rotating stall evolution is originated from separation inception at the impeller blade leading edge le near tip side it is confirmed that the impeller diffuser interaction plays significant role in promoting the rotating stall to propagate circumferentially 4 owing to the impeller diffuser interaction the rotating stall attaching to the impeller blade trailing edge te is cut off into two parts as the impeller blade te begins to interact with the diffuser vane le one of which propagating circumferentially in the impeller and the other moving into the diffuser and dissipating downstream 5 the dominant frequency of pressure oscillation in the impeller is 1 49f n and induced by the rotating stall evolution while that in the diffuser is 0 53f n and caused by the evolution of the shedding vortex which is separated from the rotating stall credit authorship contribution statement weixiang ye data curation writing original draft chen geng formal analysis mechanism analysis akihiro ikuta

20259,in this paper the effect of the impeller diffuser interaction on the unstable flow in a mixed flow pump operating under one part load condition is investigated based on the local energy loss analysis using a modified sst k ω partially averaged navier stokes msst pans model the comparison on the pump performance shows a good agreement between the experiment and simulation the characteristic curve of the test pump presents a positive slope region where hydraulic loss increases 90 75 in the impeller and 16 75 in the diffuser the internal flow analysis depicts that the rotating stall evolution captured in the impeller passages involves larger energy transfer while the separating flow in the diffuser passage involves lower energy transfer as the impeller blade tailing edge te begins to interact with the diffuser blade leading edge le the vortex attached to the impeller blade te is cut off into two parts one of which keeps propagating circumferentially and forms the rotating stall in the impeller and the other is regarded as the shedding vortex moving into the diffuser further analysis by the fast fourier transform and proper orthogonal decomposition reveals the frequency of rotating stall is 1 49f n and the frequency of the shedding vortex is 0 53f n keywords mixed flow pump unstable flow msst pans turbulence model local energy loss rotating stall impeller diffuser interaction 1 introduction in the process of hydropower exploitation and utilization mixed flow pumps mfps are regarded as important energy conversion devices applied in fields of waterjet propulsion system huang et al 2019 2020 and pumped storage technology liu and tan 2018 although the application technology of the mfps is quite mature nowadays the typical and complicated flow instability phenomenon i e hump characteristic is universal as the mfps operate under part load conditions ye et al 2020a with a large amount of energy loss the flow field is also deteriorated significantly once the hump characteristic occurs therefore to guarantee the safe operation of the mfps during the energy utilization it is of great significance to explore the mechanism of the hump characteristic in the mfps it was indicated by posa posa et al 2015 that the rotating stall appears as the mfps operate under the off design conditions which is regarded as the source inducing the pump performance variation up to now lots of researches focusing on the rotating stall have been carried out braun et al 2005 byskov et al 2003 li et al 2020 miyabe et al 2008 pacot et al 2016 widmer et al 2011 yang et al 2019 for examples yang yang et al 2019 simulated the unstable flow in a pump turbine in pump mode and found three sets of rotating stall cells appearing in the guide vanes and stay vanes under part load conditions pacot pacot et al 2016 investigated the rotating stall evolution in the guide vane of the pump turbine by using large eddy simulation les and found that the propagation speed of the rotating stall was extremely low compared with the runner rotation speed i e ω s ω 2 0 li li et al 2020 captured the rotating stall evolution and its propagation from the blade leading edge le to the tailing edge te in a mixed flow pump impeller basing on the simulation results the authors believed that the stall vortex changed the fluid trajectory and caused the flow distortion at impeller rim which inducing the pre stall and tip initial stall miyabe miyabe et al 2008 considered that the diffuser rotating stall drs was the main reason for the characteristic instability in a mixed flow pump basing on the results by dynamic particle image velocimetry dpiv measurement and numerical simulation byskov byskov et al 2003 analyzed the flow field in a centrifugal pump impeller under one part load condition by les and found a highly separated flow in one passage appearing at the entrance of the impeller with steady and non rotating state byskov recognized the stationary stall was not initiated by the interaction with the stationary components the researches mentioned above show that the analysis for rotating stall has been well investigated in impeller or diffuser where the rotating stall mainly occurs as mentioned by posa posa and lippolis 2019 the effect of the rotor stator interaction indeed plays substantial role on the rotating stall evolution thus forming the hump characteristic in his study the effect on pressure fluctuations through rotating and stationary channels by both flow rate and orientation of the diffuser blades are compared and discussed the results show that the pressure fluctuations are much more sensitive to the flow rate and setting angle of diffuser blades for the stationary vanes compared to the rotating channels with modified diffuser geometry the low frequency is also less energetic at the reduced flow rate sano sano et al 2002a also found different stall types i e alternate blade stall asymmetric stall and rotating stall by changing the impeller diffuser clearance the pressure in diffusers also changed according to different clearances therefore the effect of the rotor stator interaction rsi is very significant to the internal flow influencing pump performance and the flow instability therefore the analysis on the flow interaction between the impeller and diffuser is important and essential which contributes to giving a better insight on the flow instability mechanism however the related researches are few and the effect on flow instability due to rsi should be further investigated many analyses on flow instability indicate that the sudden increase of hydraulic loss in pumps is responsible for the hump characteristic formation dou and jiang 2013 lu et al 2019 ye et al 2019a however detailed energy loss distribution and its propagation mechanism are still unclear lu lu et al 2019 derived the local unsteady loss from the energy equation to illustrate the contribution of local flow patterns to the loss in corresponding hydraulic components his study showed that the unsteady local loss assessment was suitable for the turbulent flow involving rotating stall on the other hand the flow diagnosis technique based on the proper orthogonal decomposition pod has been utilized widely to identify spatio temporal characteristics of multi scale coherent structures sirovich 1987 this technique is used in many engineering cases such as turbulent channel flow derebail muralidhar et al 2019 cavitation around a hydrofoil liu et al 2019 and unstable flow in a radial turbomachine witte et al 2018 in case of turbulent flow in mfps it is essential to separate the specific and periodic flow structures from the rest of the irregular and chaotic motions an insight for the interaction between coherent flow structures and corresponding pressure fluctuations contributes to understanding the flow instability mechanism precisely due to the limitation of measurement techniques numerical simulation becomes important for the analysis of turbulent separated flows in recent years based on the researches mentioned above lots of researches are carried out by computation fluid dynamics cfd using different turbulence models such as k ε model miyabe et al 2008 sst k ω model li et al 2020 liu and tan 2018 luo et al 2020 widmer et al 2011 ye et al 2019a v 2 f model lu et al 2019 les model byskov et al 2003 liu et al 2019 pacot et al 2016 posa and lippolis 2019 posa et al 2015 and so on for the industry applications the reynolds average navier stokes rans equation approach with eddy viscosity models attracts lots of attention however the rans model has the inferiority to capture the detailed unsteady flow structures some cfd work on flow field prediction expressed the involved issue huang et al 2017 sano et al 2002b shih et al 1995 ye et al 2019b recently the partially averaged navier stokes pans model bridging smoothly from rans to dns direct numerical simulation has been proposed girimaji 2005 the filter width is controlled by the unresolved to total ratios of kinetic energy i e f k in high reynolds number cases which is in the range of 0 f k 1 if f k 1 0 the pans model is reduced to the rans model if f k 0 the pans model is switched to the dns model during the development of the pans model it has been applied in many test cases huang et al 2017 lakshmipathy and girimaji 2006 ye et al 2020c yu et al 2020 most recently ye ye et al 2020b 2020d 2020e developed a modified partially averaged navier stokes msst pans model based on the modified sst k ω model which is a hybrid model introducing the realizable k ε model into the sst k ω model this model was tested for the turbulent flow in a 90 curved rectangular duct ye et al 2020b cavitating flow in a two dimensional curved hydrofoil ye et al 2020d and unstable flow in a centrifugal pump ye et al 2020e and a mixed flow pump ye et al 2020a results indicate that the msst pans can give more detailed flow information and achieves a better accordance with the external characteristics and detailed flow structures comparing with other conventional models therefore by employing numerical simulations using msst pans model the main objective of the present paper is to investigate the effect of impeller diffuser interaction on the unstable flow in a mixed flow pump from the perspective of local loss characteristic the flow characteristics in the impeller and diffuser are analyzed in detail based on the simulation this paper is organized as follows mathematical formulations about msst pans model are presented in section 2 methodology on the energy loss evaluation is introduced briefly in section 3 problem descriptions are clarified in section 4 the detailed results and discussions are carried out in section 5 finally the conclusions are provided 2 mathematical formulations 2 1 pans formulations the partially averaged navier stokes pans model is constructed based on the statistics of partially averaged transient fields which is proposed by girimaji 2005 the details rationale can be referred to the literature girimaji 2005 lakshmipathy and girimaji 2006 for the analysis of the high shear stress and high vortex evolution in the mixed flow pump a modified sst k ω partially averaged navier stokes msst pans model ye et al 2020b 2020d ye et al 2020e is applied in this paper the msst pans model is believed to be sensitive to high shear stress and high pressure gradient flow where the effects of streamline curvature and rotation effect should be carefully considered the governing equations of the msst pans model are 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j τ v i v j x j p x i μ ρ 2 u i x j x j 3 ρ k u t ρ k u u j x j x j μ tu σ ku k u x j p ku β ρ ω u k u 4 ρ ω u t ρ ω u u j x j x j μ

τ v i v j is the subfilter scale stress which is regarded as a partially reynolds stress in the pans model the boussinesq assumption is also applied to express τ v i v j in eq 3 and eq 4 the subscript

model are f k and f ω in high reynolds number cases the dissipation scales are unlikely to be resolved thus f ε is set to a unity of 1 0 and f ω 1 f k the only one filter width parameter is f k which needs to be specified carefully in early stage of pans model f k is usually treated as a constant such as 0 7 0 5 0 4 and so on girimaji 2005 since it is difficult to get the detailed flow structures in advance it is impossible to determine f k as a suitable unity prior to the simulation usually the pans model with a constant f k is not reasonable because the simulation consumes redundant calculation cost girimaji and abdol hamid 2005 proposed the dynamic coefficient f k defined for the best grid utilization i e 13 f k 3 δ l 2 3 where l is the integral turbulence length scale l k 1 5 ε k u β ω u and δ is the local grid size determined as δ δx δy δz 1 3 based on the girimaji and abdol hamid s work girimaji and abdol hamid 2005 a spatially varying and dynamically updating f k is used in our research as follows 14 f k min 1 c s δ l 2 3 where c s is the model coefficient c s 1 0 in the calculation 3 energy loss evaluation 3 1 hydraulic loss generally the hydraulic loss can be evaluated according to the total pressure difference between the outlet and inlet of each flow component as shown in eq 15 15 p loss p t 2 p t 1 where p t2 and p t1 represent the total pressures at the outlet and the inlet of each flow component such as impeller diffuser etc thus the energy loss coefficient in the diffuser cp d is defined as 16 c p d p t 2 d p t 1 d ρ u 2 2 where u 2 represents peripheral velocity at the impeller exit and the subscript d means the parameter for the diffuser because the energy loss coefficient in rotating component should be modified by considering the input power p in the energy loss coefficient in the impeller cp i is defined as 17 c p i p t 2 i p t 1 i ρ u 2 2 p in ρ q u 2 2 where the subscript i represents the parameter for the impeller therefore the hydraulic losses in the impeller and diffuser can be evaluated directly under different flow rate condition 3 2 local loss wilhelm wilhelm et al 2016 calculated the head losses in turbine draft tube by deriving the mean kinetic energy equation from navier stokes equations based on this concept lu lu et al 2019 developed the energy balance equations which had been utilized for local loss analysis in an airfoil cascades and a pump turbine the local loss in each flow component is expressed as follows 18 p l v t 1 2 ρ u 2 d v v u i τ v i v j x j d v v μ u i d ij x j d v v τ v i v j u i x j d v v μ d ij u i x j d v where 19 d ij u i x j u j x i 20 τ v i v j μ tu u j x i u i x j 2 3 δ ij ρ k u the first term in eq 18 represents the kinetic energy variation of the mean flow according to the literature lu et al 2019 the contribution of the variation of mean kinetic to the local loss is insignificant under the condition including rotating stall and the most loss is converted to the turbulent kinetic energy thus in current study the first term is neglected and the local loss is expressed by the next four terms 21 p l v u i τ v i v j x j d v v μ u i d ij x j d v v τ v i v j u i x j d v v μ d ij u i x j d v in eq 21 the local loss is integrated in every flow component and is named as p l1 p l4 respectively p l1 is the diffusion of the kinetic energy by means of the reynolds stress and p l2 is the diffusion of the kinetic energy by means of the viscous stress the third term i e p l3 represents the turbulent kinetic energy production due to the transformation of the kinetic energy to the turbulent kinetic energy the last term i e p l4 is the viscous dissipation of mean kinetic energy since the subfilter scale stress τ v i v j is also computed in the form of boussinesq assumption the subfilter scale stress τ v i v j is calculated using eq 20 where δ ij is kronecker function 4 problem descriptions 4 1 computational domain to investigate the flow characteristic in the mixed flow pump especially in the impeller and diffuser the full passage computational domain is adopted the computational domain includes inlet pipe suction pipe impeller diffuser and outlet pipe the mixed flow pump consists of 5 blade impeller and 7 blade diffuser the diameter at the impeller exit is 299 4 mm and the impeller tip clearance is treated as 0 3 mm the corresponding experimental system is shown in fig 1 b and mainly includes water tank test pump booster pump motor and experimental pipes the pump head is derived from the total pressure difference between the inlet and outlet pipe and measured by the pressure sensors the uncertainty of the pressure sensors is 0 2 the electromagnetic flow meter is utilized to measure the flow rate in the experimental system with the uncertainty of 0 5 the shaft rotational speed is 1500r min in the experiment and simulation the input power can be acquired by the measurement of the shaft torque using a torque transducer and the angular speed according to the shaft rotational speed npsh a i e available net positive suction head is 9 86 m under the condition of 0 6q bep and is large enough for the pump operation without cavitation the detailed descriptions about the specifications of the mixed flow pump and the experimental system are available in the ref ye et al 2020a 4 2 grid generation and independence test the hexahedral grids are applied for the impeller and diffuser and generated using the software of the ansys turbogrid while that for the inlet pipe and outlet pipe are generated using the software of ansys icem since the grid treatment is significant for the simulation four sets of grid strategies are applied to examine the gird sensitivity the grids are well refined on the blade surfaces from grid set no 1 to grid set no 4 as table 1 shows by comparing the experimental data at design point condition h d η d the predicted head h and efficiency η tend to reach convergent values as the grid is refined therefore considering the accuracy of the results and the computational cost the grid set no 3 is selected as the final grid strategy in the research based on the independence test results fig 2 displays the detailed grid distributions of the mixed flow pump note that the grid is refined near the blade surfaces and wall bounded regions the time averaged yplus distributions on the impeller and diffuser blades are around 15 as shown in fig 3 which are fine enough for the calculation using the msst pans model 4 3 numerical setting commercial software of ansys cfx is utilized in current study steady calculations are carried out under all operating conditions to obtain the hump characteristic curves directly while one unsteady calculation is performed under one typical operating condition to analyze the transient unstable flow in detail different mass flow rates are imposed at the inlet section under different conditions and a fixed static pressure is prescribed at the outlet section a time step of 1 ω ω is the angular speed of pump impeller is selected in the steady calculations and the time step value of 2 22 10 4s corresponding to the runner rotating angle of 2 per time step is applied for the unsteady calculation the discretization methods for the advection scheme and the turbulence numerics are high resolution during the calculation the root mean squared rms momentum residuals are set below 10 4 for the steady calculations and the rms momentum residuals are controlled below 10 5 for the unsteady calculation fig 4 shows the residual distribution for unsteady calculation under the condition of 0 6q bep the results indicate that the rms residual for convergence approaches 10 5 which is suitable for the unsteady calculation 5 results and discussion 5 1 characteristic curves the pump characteristic curves are shown in fig 5 where the black scattering points having square symbol represent the experimental results and the blue lines with cross symbol are the calculation results the pump performance can be expressed by flow coefficient ϕ head coefficient ψ efficiency η and input power coefficient τ which are defined below 22 ϕ q π r 2 b 2 u 2 23 ψ h u 2 2 g 24 η ρ g q h t ω 25 τ 2 t ω ρ π r 2 b 2 u 2 3 where r 2 is the tip radius at impeller exit q is the volume flow rate t is the shaft torque ω is the angular velocity and b 2 is the blade width the results in fig 5 show the fairly good agreement between the simulation and the experiment as shown in fig 5 a the predicted head coefficient ψ is close to the experimental data under all flow conditions especially in the range of ϕ 1 to ϕ 2 a positive slope region is measured by the experiment and is also well predicted by the calculation the relative error for ψ is 2 28 under the condition of ϕ 2 and 3 69 under the condition of ϕ 1 the predicted efficiency agrees very well with the experimental data with the relative error of 2 96 under the condition of ϕ 1 the best efficiency is located under the condition of 1 1ϕ d although the input power is underestimated with the maximum relative error of 7 21 under the condition of ϕ 1 the predicted curve of input power coefficient exhibits the same tendency with the experiment data particularly under the hump region the τ ϕ curve also shows positive slope indicating the input power decreases during the hump region the results confirm that the msst pans reasonably predicts the hydraulic performance even under the unstable operation conditions it is acknowledged that the sudden increase of hydraulic loss is the main mechanism for the positive slope in pumps lu et al 2019 ye et al 2019a fig 6 further shows the euler head and net head coefficient ψ e and ψ predicted by the simulation the difference between the ψ e and ψ can be considered as the head loss coefficient ψ loss the euler head h e euler head coefficient ψ e and head loss coefficient ψ loss are calculated according to eq 26 26 h e 1 g u 2 v u 2 u 1 v u 1 ψ e g h e u 2 2 v u 2 u 2 u 1 v u 1 u 2 2 ψ loss ψ e ψ as shown in fig 6 the value of ψ e increases gradually as the flow coefficient ϕ decreases under the unstable conditions where the positive slope region is apparently shown in the ψ ϕ curve the slope of the ψ e ϕ curve also tends to be flat obviously by comparing the head loss coefficient ψ loss under the two conditions ψ loss increases rapidly from the operation ϕ 2 to ϕ 1 where the flow is regarded to become much unstable according to eq 16 and eq 17 the hydraulic losses in the impeller and diffuser are calculated respectively and the results are plotted against the flow coefficient in fig 7 it is noted that under the condition of ϕ bep 1 1ϕ d the hydraulic loss in impeller cp i is the same as that in diffuser cp d and their values are the lowest indicating the stable and fluent flow in both impeller and diffuser ye et al 2020a as the flow rate decreases the hydraulic loss increases rapidly in the diffuser while that in the impeller increases slightly that means the flow field in the diffuser begins to be deteriorated right after the ϕ bep 1 1ϕ d while the flow in the impeller is relative smooth ye et al 2020a however as the operation shifts from ϕ 2 to ϕ 1 the hydraulic loss in the impeller increases dramatically with the relative increment of 90 75 while that increases only 16 75 in the diffuser it is suspected that the flow in the impeller changed substantially from ϕ 2 to ϕ 1 causing dramatic loss increase compared with that in the diffuser 5 2 flow pattern in impeller and diffuser fig 8 shows the time averaged streamlines in the mid span section of the impeller and diffuser under three part load conditions as shown in fig 5 a it is found that the streamlines in the impeller are generally smooth under the conditions of 0 7ϕ d and 0 8ϕ d while there are strong separations in the diffuser flow passages the separations occurring from the suction side partly block the passage in the diffuser under the condition of 0 6ϕ d flow separation is observed near the impeller blade tailing edge te while the blockage in the diffuser passages become more severe compared with other operation conditions it is suspected that the flow separation near the impeller blade te may enhance the flow instability in the diffuser under the condition of 0 6ϕ d and is regarded as the dominant factor corresponding to the unstable flow for the positive slope region on the other hand though the flow in the diffuser changes the flow pattern is similar under three conditions detailed flow patterns in the impeller and diffuser under the unstable condition of ϕ 1 are specifically provided from transient perspective fig 9 shows the transient streamlines on three span sections of the impeller near the impeller hub i e span 0 1 the flow seems to be smooth in five blade to blade flow passages and no apparent flow separation occurs on the mid span flow separation is observed near the blade suction side and the te as shown in fig 9 b it can be noted that the zone of flow separation changes periodically the separation flow sheds gradually from t 0 to t 0 3 10t n and develops again from t 0 4 10t n to t 0 7 10t n t n represents the period of the impeller rotation near the impeller shroud i e span 0 9 the flow is much more turbulent in the blade to blade channels take one flow passage as an example as shown in fig 9 c there are three large flow separation zones marked as vi vii and viii from t 0 to t 0 3 10t n vi begins to merge with vii forming a new large scale of vortex after that the vortex propagates downstream along the blade suction side gradually as for viii the red arrow line shows the track of the vortex it is clear that viii moves from one blade le to the adjacent blade le from t 0 to t 0 7 10t n the vortex propagates circumferentially and forms the rotating stall which is also analyzed in our previous research ye et al 2020a fig 10 shows the streamlines in the diffuser the complicated flow is observed in the diffuser as shown in the fig 8 near the diffuser hub large scale of flow separation occupies the inlet of diffuser passage the flow structure seems to be stable and to propagate along the streamwise direction to the diffuser outlet slowly on the mid span section large scale of flow separation occurs in each flow passage the results shown in fig 10 a and b indicate the flow passages are severely blocked from the hub to the mid span near the shroud the flow separation is located near the diffuser exit further the large velocity near the blade tip means that the flow is mainly pushed toward the diffuser shroud due to the special flow features in the impeller and the diffuser it is a strong secondary flow which makes the flow near the impeller hub to be pushed toward diffuser shroud in addition flow oscillation with relatively high velocity near the diffuser inlet is also observed near the diffuser shroud at instant of t 0 relatively high velocity is observed while at instant of t 0 5 5t n the velocity becomes low after that at instant of t 0 8 5t n the velocity near the diffuser inlet becomes relatively high again combining with the results shown in the fig 9 c the velocity oscillation shown in the 0 9 span is affected by the rotating stall evolution observed in the impeller shroud depicting the strong interaction between the impeller and the diffuser 5 3 local loss distribution the non dimensional local loss λ li is calculated in the impeller and diffuser respectively using the following definition 27 λ li p li ρ π r 2 b 2 u 2 3 where p li is the hydraulic loss shown at the right side of eq 21 fig 11 shows the local loss coefficient in the impeller and diffuser under the condition of ϕ 1 it is noted that the turbulent kinetic energy production term i e λ l3 is the main loss source and the λ l3 in impeller is larger than that in the diffuser indicating that the large scale separation flow promotes the production of turbulent kinetic energy in the mixed flow pump compared with λ l3 the other three terms are much smaller of which the viscous dissipation term λ l4 is lowest in both impeller and diffuser however the λ l1 and λ l2 are calculated to evaluate the overall diffusion effect in the flow components detailed local loss distribution is specifically shown in fig 12 as for the right side of eq 21 the local loss per unit volume is named as p l1 p l4 respectively i e p l 1 u i τ v i v j x j p l 2 μ u i d ij x j p l 3 τ v i v j u i x j p l 4 μ d ij u i x j the first term p l1 and second term p l2 represent the diffusion effect of the kinetic energy of the mean flow it is noted that the terms of p l1 and p l2 have the positive and negative values which represent the diffusion direction fig 12 gives the time averaged contours of the non dimensional local loss coefficient defined in eq 28 and pressure on the mid span section of the impeller and diffuser under the condition of ϕ 1 it is noted that the local loss coefficients of λ l1 and λ l3 are much larger than the other terms 28 λ li p li ρ u 2 3 d 2 where d 2 is the tip diameter at impeller exit in accordance with the results in fig 11 the term for turbulent kinetic energy production λ l3 plays the dominant effect in both impeller and diffuser owing to the high adverse pressure gradient shown in fig 12 e the flow separation is induced as illustrated in fig 9 and the high value region of the λ l3 is observed near the impeller blade te compared with the terms for diffusion effect by viscous stress λ l2 the term of diffusion effect by reynolds stress λ l1 is much larger and cannot be neglected high λ l1 value region mainly occurs in the impeller blade to blade passage and occupies most area near the suction side of the blade besides due to the adverse pressure gradient shown near the impeller blade le the high λ l1 value region at the impeller inlet tends to split and propagate over the blade le to the adjacent blade suction side as shown in fig 12 a it is also noted that there is a strong effect due to reynolds stress diffusion located near the impeller exit representing the kinetic energy diffusion in opposite direction where the reverse flow occurs therefore the turbulent kinetic energy production and the reynolds stress diffusion are the two main factors resulting in large hydraulic loss and unstable flow characteristics in the mixed flow pump impeller which are directly induced by the local pressure gradient however the high value region of λ l1 and λ l3 is mainly limited near the le and te for diffuser vane the energy transfer in the diffuser is much suppressed compared with that in the impeller consequently even under the positive slope region the hydraulic loss in the diffuser is not very large for further discussion of hydraulic loss in the impeller and diffuser several monitoring planes are set along streanwise direction as shown in fig 13 planes a b c d are in the streamwise location of 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 9 in the impeller and planes f g h are the streamwise location of 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 in the diffuser particularly plane e is at the vaneless area i e the area between impeller exit and diffuser inlet as shown in fig 14 high absolute value region of λ l1 is circumferentially distributed and radially expands from blade tip toward hub on the planes indicating high energy transfer along the blade tip owing to the centrifugal force effect in the impeller the results show the strong energy transfer due to the rotating stall evolution in the impeller where the flow separation as well as flow passage blockage occurs near the blade tip and develops toward the impeller hub the result of fig 14 e shows the unique λ l1 distribution due to the rotor stator interaction it is noted that the effect of kinetic energy diffusion by the reynolds stress is not so strong in the diffuser compared with that in the impeller under the condition of ϕ 1 fig 15 represents the turbulent kinetic energy production λ l3 under the condition of ϕ 1 it is shown that the high value region of λ l3 mainly occurs along the blade tip and the area with high λ l3 near the blade le is larger than that near the te in the impeller in the diffuser the turbulent kinetic energy production is weak relatively but the turbulent kinetic energy production is not small at the diffuser inlet due to the impeller diffuser interaction therefore combined with results shown in figs 9 and 10 high energy transfer in the impeller is induced by the rotating stall evolution while the energy transfer in the diffuser is much lower the flow characteristics in different hydraulic components under the unstable condition result in the main hydraulic loss occurring in the impeller and slighter loss in the diffuser detailed analysis on the vaneless region is carried out to give further explanation on the impeller diffuser interaction 5 4 flow characteristic in the vaneless region fig 16 gives the time averaged vectors colored by the absolute velocity near the vaneless region under the condition of ϕ 1 near the hub side i e span 0 1 the flow near the vaneless region is rather turbulent as shown in the fig 16 a there is vortex near the diffuser blade le in this region the reverse flow from the diffuser collides with the diffuser vane le and large attack angle of the flow is presented the flow features include the vortex and reverse flow with low velocity in this region on the mid span section the flow in the vaneless region tends to be smooth and the velocity gradient in this region becomes smaller large scale of vortex is observed in the flow passage which corresponds to the development of vortex shown in the fig 16 a near the shroud side the absolute velocity vectors departing from the impeller blade te enter in the diffuser vane le smoothly the velocity gradient is smallest and the flow pattern in the vaneless region is smooth fig 17 represents the transient distribution of λ l3 on the span 0 5 under the condition of ϕ 1 the high λ l3 value region is cut off from the impeller blade te at instant of t 0 where the rotating stall cell sheds from t 0 to t 0 2 45t n the shedding vortex propagates downstream and circumferentially at t 0 3 45t n when the impeller blade te begins to interact with the diffuser vane le the shedding vortex begins to separate into two parts one part attaches to the impeller blade suction side and keeps propagating to the adjacent blade and the other part sheds into the diffuser along the diffuser vane from t 0 7 45t n to t 0 9 45t n another rotating stall attached to the adjacent blade te is cut off by the effect of impeller diffuser interaction and the new shedding vortex propagates downstream therefore it is obvious that the effect of impeller diffuser interaction in the vaneless region is the key factor to promote the rotating stall cell propagating circumferentially at the impeller blade te the shedding vortex is separated from the rotating stall when the impeller blade and diffuser vane interact spatially therefore the effect of the impeller diffuser interaction on the unstable flow is obvious in the impeller which is regarded as the actuator to promote the flow separation attached to the blade te propagating circumferentially and form rotating stall in the impeller finally fig 18 gives the vortex evolution by q criterion 202636 s 1 in the vaneless region under the condition of ϕ 1 to further explain the results in fig 17 at the instant of t 0 the rotating stall attached to the impeller blade te is cut off and large scale of vortex is also attached to the diffuser vane le which blocks the flow passage at diffuser inlet at t 0 3 45t n the cut off vortex is separated further by the diffuser blade and propagates downstream in the diffuser from t 0 7 45t n to t 0 9 45t n another rotating stall is cut off by the effect of impeller diffuser interaction as shown in fig 17 therefore not only the flow separation inception near the blade tip which is regarded as the source of the rotating stall the effect of the impeller diffuser interaction also plays a significant role on the rotating stall formation in the impeller fig 19 gives the transient pressure gradient in z direction contours in the vaneless region to explain the mechanism of the rotating stall evolution under the condition of ϕ 1 at the instant of t 0 the impeller blade a is far away from the diffuser vane a the large adverse pressure gradient occurs near the blade suction side and the impeller exit as the impeller blade a begins to interact with the diffuser vane a i e from t 0 2 45t n to t 0 5 45t n the adverse pressure gradient region near the impeller blade te expands forming the zone with high adverse pressure gradient on the other hand at the instant of t 0 5 45t n the adverse pressure gradient region at the impeller inlet is relatively small but at the instant of t 0 8 45t n a high adverse pressure gradient region is also formed at the impeller inlet induced by the high adverse pressure gradient at the impeller blade te the high adverse pressure gradient results in the flow separation as well as rotating stall in the impeller and the blockage in the flow passage therefore the impeller diffuser interaction plays significant role in flow pattern not only in the impeller blade te but also at impeller inlet fig 20 shows the schematic of the flow mechanism on the rotating stall the flow separation occurs at the impeller blade le and propagates along the impeller blade suction side to the impeller blade te under part load condition as the impeller blade te interacts with the diffuser vane le the rotating stall cell is cut off into two parts one part keeps propagating circumferentially forming the rotating stall and the other part is regarded as the shedding vortex which dissipates in the diffuser finally owing to the impeller diffuser interaction high adverse pressure is induced around the impeller blade te the high adverse pressure region expands further near the impeller inlet forcing the flow separation to propagate from one flow passage to the adjacent flow passage and form the rotating stall at impeller inlet finally the rotating stall is observed at the adjacent passage 5 5 pressure oscillation pressure oscillation intensity cp sd is calculated as follows 29 c p sd 1 n i 1 n p x y z t i p x y z t 2 1 2 ρ u 2 2 where n is the number of time steps and p x y z t i is instantaneous pressure fig 21 shows the pressure oscillation intensity in the pump under the condition of ϕ 1 the region with high cp sd value can reflect the unstable flow discussed above it is clear that the highest cp sd region locates near the blade te on the 0 5span followed by the impeller blade le on the 0 9span there is the region with high cp sd value at the vaneless zone and near the diffuser inlet where the rotating stall propagates circumferentially in the impeller and dissipates in the diffuser to capture the dominate frequency inducing by the unstable flow in both impeller and diffuser pressure oscillation is monitored at several points set in the impeller vaneless region and diffuser respectively as shown in fig 22 note that pi1 pi6 are all set on the impeller blade suction side where the rotating stall evolution mainly occurs pd1 pd9 are located on different diffuser span sections points of pd1 pd4 and pd7 are on the 0 1span section pd2 pd5 and pd8 are on the 0 5span section and pd3 pd6 and pd9 are on the 0 9span section fig 23 and fig 25 show the pressure oscillation spectrum by performing fast fourier transform fft the pressure coefficient c p is defined as 30 c p p i p 0 1 2 ρ u 2 2 where p i presents the instantaneous static pressure at any monitoring point and p 0 is the averaged pressure at the impeller inlet in the impeller the dominant frequency is 1 49 f n f n represents the impeller rotating frequency 1 t n in the mid stream and te of blade based on the results it is easy to judge that the frequency is resulted from the rotating stall cells evolution from the results in figs 9 and 12 flow patterns in five blade to blade flow passages are synchronous thus the frequency representing the rotating stall evolution in one flow passage is regarded as 1 49 5 0 298f n which is lower than the impeller rotating as shown in fig 23 c d and e the dominant frequency of 0 53f n is captured in the diffuser with relative lower amplitudes compared with the component of 1 49f n in the impeller since the effect of the impeller diffuser interaction on the unstable flow in the impeller is significant it is assumed that the pressure oscillation component with frequency of 0 53f n is originated from the shedding vortex dissipating in the diffuser to investigate the mechanism of the frequency of 0 53f n it is necessary to explore the flow in the diffuser individually fig 24 shows λ l3 evolution in the diffuser passage on span 0 9 section where higher λ l3 distribution is observed fig 15 it is recognized that the high value region represents the rotating stall shedding from the impeller blade te which called shedding vortex in fig 17 based on the streamlines shown in fig 10 c though the streamlines are relative smooth at the diffuser inlet flow oscillation is observed in this region and attributes to the shedding vortex succeeding from the impeller propagating at the diffuser inlet circumferentially as plotted in fig 24 high λ l3 value region is found around the diffuser inlet at the instant of t 0 high λ l3 value region in the flow passage of ⅵ succeeds from the impeller outlet and propagates downstream along the flow passage at t 0 2 9t n the high λ l3 value region dissipates gradually however it is noted that the shedding vortex not only propagates along one flow passage but also moves to the adjacent flow passages as shown in the flow passage ⅳ the shedding vortex propagates in the ⅳ from t 0 to t 0 2 9t n and splits into two parts on part dissipates in current flow passage and the other part keeps moving to the adjacent flow passages i e ⅲ and ⅱ at t 0 3 9t n and t 0 4 9t n from t 0 5 9t n to t 0 8 9t n the shedding vortex propagates and finally dissipates at the passage ⅱ as indicated in fig 17 the impeller diffuser interaction promotes the rotating stall attached to the impeller blade te to propagate circumferentially and the shedding vortex separated from the impeller blade te moves into the diffuser and influences the downstream flow patterns after succeeding the shedding vortex the flow near the diffuser inlet still shows oscillation because the shedding vortex propagates circumferentially in the diffuser inlet however the intensity of the shedding vortex is lower than the rotating stall in the impeller recognized by the amplitudes of the dominate frequency of 1 49f n and 0 53f n based on this consideration the frequency of 0 53f n is induced by the shedding vortex propagating circumferentially at the diffuser inlet owing to the impeller blade number of 5 and diffuser blade number of 7 it is easy to calculate the succeeding frequency in one flow passage as 1 49f n 7 5 1 06f n considering the feature of the shedding vortex evolution its frequency is calculated as 1 06 2 0 53f n thus the shedding vortex propagates from one passage to the adjacent flow passage then dissipates finally in the adjacent flow passage the analysis result matches with the fft results perfectly 6 monitoring points are also set in the vaneless region pressure oscillation on the frequency domain is shown in fig 25 it is clear that the pressure oscillations at monitoring points pv1 pv2 and pv3 show the typical frequency of 1 49f n which represents the effect of rotating stall evolution near the diffuser the pressure oscillation at pv4 exhibits low frequency of 0 64f n which is affected by the corner vortex shown in fig 16 at the points of pv5 and pv6 the dominant pressure oscillation has the frequency of 5f n and is recognized as the effect of impeller diffuser interaction finally the proper orthogonal decomposition pod is adopted to extract the specific flow structures in the pump the main methodology is introduced in the related literatures liu et al 2019 2020 2020 witte et al 2018 several monitoring planes i e plane d in the impeller and plane f plane g and plane h in the diffuser as shown in fig 13 are selected to perform the pod analysis on each plane the snapshot method holmes et al 2012 is applied with each snapshot containing m spontaneous velocity data in a single column n 301 snapshots covering 30 cycles of impeller rotation are selected for analysis thus the m n data matrix u is shown as follows 31 u u 1 u 2 u n handle its autocovariance matrix r defined in eq 32 32 r 1 n u u t being a symmetric positive definite matrix the i th real eigenvalue and its eigenvector of r are solved in eq 33 33 r a i λ i a i i 1 2 3 n the k th pod mode i e φ k can be expressed by a linear combination of velocity data vectors 34 φ k i 1 n a i k u i k 1 2 3 n the temporal coefficients are then calculated by projecting the data vector onto each pod mode 35 a k i 1 n u i t φ k k 1 2 3 n fig 26 shows some typical pod modes on these planes the amplitude is calculated by performing fft on the a k on plane d in the impeller the frequency of the first two energetic pod modes is f n not shown in this paper which is the dominant feature of impeller flow the frequency of mode 3 in fig 26 a is 1 49 f n representing the rotating stall evolution as shown in fig 24 a and b the frequencies of mode 4 include two components i e 0 53f n and 1 49f n as indicated in fig 24 c d the frequency of 0 53f n observed in the diffuser represents the shedding vortex from the impeller blade te to the diffuser passage it is further confirmed that the rotating stall cell is cut off into two parts near the impeller blade te since the component of 0 53f n is still observed in mode 4 of the plane d in the impeller the energies of 0 53f n and 1 49f n in mode 4 decreased compared with the energy of 1 49f n in mode 3 on the plane f in the diffuser the first energetic pod mode is 5f n not shown in this paper caused by the effect of impeller diffuser interaction the mode 2 and mode 3 represent the typical flow feature in the diffuser their frequencies are all 0 53f n on the plane g and plane h where it is far away from the impeller exit the first two frequencies of energetic pod modes are 0 53f n the energy amplitude is lower as the monitoring planes move downstream representing the shedding vortex dissipates gradually downstream in the diffuser 6 conclusions in this study the effect of impeller diffuser interaction on the unstable flow in a mixed flow pump has been systematically investigated using a modified sst k ω partially averaged navier stokes msst pans model from the internal flow and hydraulic loss analysis the formation mechanism of the rotating stall evolution due to impeller diffuser interaction in the pump is discussed adequately the following conclusions can be drawn 1 numerical simulation accurately reproduces the characteristic curves for the pump having a positive slope region from 0 7q d to 0 6q d where hydraulic loss increases 90 75 in the impeller and 16 75 in the diffuser due to the rotating stall evolution 2 the local loss analysis reveals that rotating stall evolution captured in the impeller blade to blade flow passage involves with high energy transfer while the separating flow induces lower energy transfer in the diffuser passage 3 the unstable flow as well as the rotating stall evolution is originated from separation inception at the impeller blade leading edge le near tip side it is confirmed that the impeller diffuser interaction plays significant role in promoting the rotating stall to propagate circumferentially 4 owing to the impeller diffuser interaction the rotating stall attaching to the impeller blade trailing edge te is cut off into two parts as the impeller blade te begins to interact with the diffuser vane le one of which propagating circumferentially in the impeller and the other moving into the diffuser and dissipating downstream 5 the dominant frequency of pressure oscillation in the impeller is 1 49f n and induced by the rotating stall evolution while that in the diffuser is 0 53f n and caused by the evolution of the shedding vortex which is separated from the rotating stall credit authorship contribution statement weixiang ye data curation writing original draft chen geng formal analysis mechanism analysis akihiro ikuta
